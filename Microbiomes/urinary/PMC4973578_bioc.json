Metagenomic analysis was complemented by strain-specific enterococcal PCR and indirect assessment of bacterial load by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of urinary indoxyl sulfate. At the time of admission, patients showed a predominance of commensal bacteria. After transplantation, a relative shift toward enterococci was observed, which was more pronounced under antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment of neutropenic infections. The shift was particularly prominent in patients that developed subsequently or suffered from active gastrointestinal (GI) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The mean proportion of enterococci in post-transplant stool specimens was 21% in patients who did not develop GI GVHD as compared with 46% in those that subsequently developed GI GVHD and 74% at the time of active GVHD. Enterococcal PCR confirmed predominance of Enterococcus faecium or both E. faecium and Enterococcus faecalis in these specimens. As a consequence of the loss of bacterial diversity, mean urinary indoxyl sulfate levels dropped from 42.5 \u00b1 11 \u00b5mol/L to 11.8 \u00b1 2.8 \u00b5mol/L in all post-transplant samples and to 3.5 \u00b1 3 \u00b5mol/L in samples from patients with active GVHD. Our study reveals major microbiome shifts in the course of allogeneic SCT that occur in the period of antibiotic treatment but are more prominent in association with GI GVHD. Our data indicate early microbiome shifts and a loss of diversity of the intestinal microbiome that may affect intestinal inflammation in the setting of allogeneic SCT.",

However, the exact nature of these interactions in GVHD remains unclear. Early studies focused on the ability of bacterial components such as endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) to activate macrophages that cause inflammation [2,3]. It is now clear, however, that the intestinal microbiome exerts multiple effects that can result in specific tolerance to commensal bacteria in healthy individuals, whereas a loss of microbiome diversity is associated with a number of inflammatory diseases [4,5].",

More recently, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has allowed deeper analysis of intestinal bacterial diversity. In the setting of experimental stem cell transplantation (SCT), Eriguchi et al. [8] provided evidence that murine GVHD disrupts the intestinal microbiome and suggested a loss of Paneth cells and reduced antimicrobial defensins as a potential mechanism. In line with this, we analyzed intestinal biopsies from patients with acute GVHD and observed Paneth cell loss as a hallmark of GVHD also in patients [9]. Jenq et al. [9] further confirmed loss of bacterial diversity in GVHD both in experimental models and in patients receiving allogeneic SCT.",

Among the Firmicutes, enterococci were almost absent, whereas Eubacterium rectale (42.7% \u00b1 16.0%), Clostridium phytofermentans (34.8% \u00b1 20.7%), and Lactobacillus lactis (9.4% \u00b1 1.8%) were the most dominant commensal strains. Patients at the time of admission showed a comparable distribution with some loss of the dominant commensal strains and an increase in enterococci to 6.8% \u00b1 4.9% in previously hospitalized patients. Starting with the day of transplant, all patients showed major shifts in the microbiome with a predominant increase in the proportion of enterococci and a complementary decrease in other Firmicutes and phyla (Figure 1, Supplemental Figure 1). In active GVHD, this shift was most pronounced, with an almost complete loss of commensal Firmicutes such as Clostridia and E. rectale, whereas residual commensals were present in patients without GI GVHD. Beyond day 28, the pattern started to return to pretransplant patterns in patients without and with resolving GI GVHD but not in 2 patients who suffered from ongoing active GI GVHD.",

First, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially ciprofloxacin and systemic antibiotics, resulted in an increase in enterococci and a concomitant reduction in classical commensal bacteria. The second factor associated with a further increase in enterococci was GI GVHD: This was most striking when pretransplant patients were compared with patients without and with active GI GVHD as confirmed by histology. Albeit limited by a small number of samples, the abundance of enterococci in active GI GVHD was also seen in patients who did not receive antibiotics (Figure 1). The potential association of GI GVHD with enterococcal flora is also suggested by the increased frequency of GI GVHD in patients with enterococcal abundance exceeding 20% (Figure 2).",

Antibiotic treatment mainly enhanced E. faecalis and to a lesser extent E. faecium(Table 2). Although enterococcal PCR does not allow absolute quantification of bacterial load, copy numbers for E. faecium were significantly increased in patients with active GI GVHD as compared with post-transplant patients without GVHD.",

Whereas pretransplant patients had a distribution of bacteria that was quite comparable with healthy normal donors, major changes occurred during the neutropenic period and after engraftment. As shown by the comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences in patients with and without use of antibiotics, the observed loss of commensal bacteria and the increase in enterococci in this period reflect the administration of both oral ciprofloxacin and systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics. Suppression of commensal flora by clinical use of antibiotics has been shown, and a specific mechanism for overgrowth of enterococci has been suggested [14]: Commensal bacteria are important inducers of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to maintain a diverse composition of the microbiome. After prolonged use of antibiotics, induction of specific AMPs such as Reg3alpha declines, which is the major peptide preventing enterococcal overgrowth [15].",

It was difficult to extract sufficient 16S rDNA for pyrosequencing from stool specimens that had been collected from patients with watery diarrhea during the neutropenic period. A further limitation of the present study was its ability to capture only relative rather than absolute changes in abundance of enterococci in the GI tract. The existence of significant differences in absolute content of enterococci and other bacteria in the stool specimens investigated here is reflected by the fact that it took in some cases up to 9 independent PCR reactions to generate amounts of 16S rDNA sufficient for successful pyrosequencing analysis. Real-time quantitative PCR of 16S rDNA would constitute an obvious means of quantitating bacterial load but is hampered by the difficulty of normalizing 16S rDNA content to such physical measures as weight of stool specimens, which range in consistency from purely liquid to mushy, semiformed, and formed. Indirect measures, such as concentrations of serum or urine biomarkers of bacterial metabolism, may provide an alternative for estimating gut bacterial load. Currently, however, there is no serum or urine biomarker available that is specific for enterococci. Decreased levels of IS in the urine during the neutropenic period and after application of antibiotics and even more in patients with GI GVHD suggest a dramatic suppression of colonic commensals but do not reveal any information on the abundance of enterococci in the gut.",

[9] tested the role of antibiotic pretreatment on both microbiome composition and the severity and outcome of GVHD. All mice that developed intestinal GVHD revealed massive changes in the intestinal microbiome. However, mice that had not received antibiotics had an overgrowth of lactobacilli, whereas ampicillin treatment resulted in a predominant enterococcal flora as observed in our patients. The murine data suggested that changes in the intestinal microbiome also directly influenced GVHD, as mice treated with ampicillin had worse survival and an increased pathology score.",

However, because of the low load of bacteria in the aplastic period, it is more likely that the observed predominance of enterococci is rather an indicator of loss of bacterial diversity, as outlined in Figure 1 This loss of diversity is first induced by oral and systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics, as clearly shown by the substantial drop of IS levels. Additional contribution of GVHD to loss of diversity seems possible not only on the basis of the murine data but is also supported by our recent clinical observation on a substantial loss of Paneth cells in biopsies form patients with severe GI GVHD, which was also highly predictive for outcome [19], and might be associated with loss of AMPs. However, careful analyses of the AMPs in these intestinal biopsies are needed to demonstrate a direct impact of Paneth cell defensins on microbiome composition in GVHD patients.",

Although complete decontamination may be protective against GVHD, our observation indicates that current protocols achieve incomplete rather than complete decontamination, which may be the worst scenario. Defining the role of the microbiome in development of intestinal inflammation may help to develop alternative approaches for prevention of intestinal GVHD such as the use of specific probiotics or therapeutic application of AMPs. Defining inflammatory \u201ccheckpoints\u201d of GVHD, as described by Chakraverty et al.
