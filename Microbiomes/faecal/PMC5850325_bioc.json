Less well studied is the effect of immunomodulatory therapy on the microbiota and its role in response to therapy. This study explored associations between the fecal microbiota and therapeutic response of Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) patients treated with ustekinumab (UST; Stelara) in the phase 2 CERTIFI study. Using stool samples collected over the course of 22\u00a0weeks, the composition of these subjects\u2019 fecal bacterial communities was characterized by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Subjects in remission could be distinguished from those with active disease 6\u00a0weeks after treatment using random forest models trained on subjects\u2019 baseline microbiota and clinical data (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.844, specificity of 0.831, sensitivity of 0.774). The most predictive operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were ubiquitous among subjects were affiliated with Faecalibacterium and Escherichia or Shigella. The median baseline community diversity in subjects in remission 6\u00a0weeks after treatment was 1.7 times higher than that in treated subjects with active disease (P = 0.020). Their baseline community structures were also significantly different (P = 0.017). Two OTUs affiliated with Faecalibacterium (P = 0.003) and Bacteroides (P = 0.022) were significantly more abundant at baseline in subjects who were in remission 6\u00a0weeks after treatment than those with active CD. The microbiota diversity of UST-treated clinical responders increased over the 22\u00a0weeks of the study, in contrast to nonresponsive subjects (P = 0.012). The observed baseline differences in fecal microbiota and changes due to therapeutic response support the potential for the microbiota as a response biomarker.",

Additionally, the microbiome has been shown to alter the efficacy of vaginal microbicides in African women (7), as well as cardiac drugs (8) and cancer treatments (9, 10) in murine models of disease. These results demonstrate that it is possible to use biomarkers from within the microbiome to predict response to therapeutics. In relation to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), previous studies have shown that the bacterial gut microbiota correlates with disease severity in new-onset, pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) patients (11, 12). Additionally, recent studies suggest that the gut microbiota could be used to predict clinical response to treatment in adult patients with IBD, including anti-integrin biologics (13, 14) and treatment of pediatric IBD with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-\u03b1) or immunomodulators (15, 16). It remains to be determined, however, whether the composition of the fecal gut microbiota can predict and monitor response to biologic CD therapy directed at other targets, such as interleukin 23 (IL-23). Considering the involvement of the immune system and previous evidence for involvement of the microbiome, we hypothesize that response to anti-IL-23 CD therapy can be predicted using microbiome data.",

Currently, individuals with CD are treated based on disease location and risk of complications using escalating immunosuppressive treatment, and/or surgery, with the goal of achieving and sustaining remission (19, 20). Faster induction of remission following diagnosis reduces the risk of irreversible intestinal damage and disability (20,\u201322). Ideally, clinicians would be able to determine personalized treatment options for CD patients at diagnosis that would result in faster achievement of remission (23).

Given the potential impact of IL-23 on the microbiota (32,\u201335), we hypothesized that response to UST could be influenced by differences in subjects\u2019 gut microbiota and that UST treatment may alter the fecal microbiota. The effects of biological treatment of IBD on the microbiota are not yet well described but are hypothesized to be indirect, as these drugs act on host factors (19). We analyzed the fecal microbiota of subjects who participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of UST for treating subjects with CD refractory to anti-TNF agents (37). The original study found that UST induction treatment had an increased rate of response as well as increased rates of response and remission with UST maintenance therapy compared to placebo. We quantified the association between the fecal microbiota and disease severity, tested whether clinical responders had a microbiota that was distinct from that of nonresponders, and determined whether the fecal microbiota changed in subjects treated with UST using 16S rRNA gene sequence data from these subjects\u2019 stool samples. Our study demonstrates that these associations may be useful in predicting and monitoring UST treatment outcome and suggest that the fecal microbiota may be a broadly useful source of biomarkers for predicting response to treatment.",

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics of this subset are summarized in Table\u00a01. Subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment group in the induction phase of the study and were rerandomized into maintenance therapy groups 8\u00a0weeks after induction based on their response (Fig.\u00a01A). In the current study, response was defined as a decrease in a subject\u2019s initial Crohn\u2019s disease activity index (CDAI) of greater than 100 points or remission. Remission was defined as a CDAI below 150 points. The CDAI is the standard instrument for evaluating clinical symptoms and disease activity in CD (40, 41). The CDAI weights patient reported stool frequency, abdominal pain, and general well-being over a week, in combination with weight change, hematocrit, opiate usage for diarrhea, and the presence of abdominal masses or other complications to determine the disease severity score (40, 41). Subjects provided stool samples at baseline (screening) and at 4, 6, and 22\u00a0weeks after induction for analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Fig.\u00a01B).

We determined the optimal model based the largest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the RF model (6, 42).

The study design resulted in only 75 stool samples at week 22 from subjects induced and maintained with UST, so we focused our analysis on the 220 stool samples collected at week 6 from subjects induced with UST. We were again better able to distinguish subjects in remission from subjects with active CD than subjects with a clinical response versus no response (P = 0.005; Fig.\u00a05A). Our model could classify responses 6\u00a0weeks after induction using week 6 stool samples from subjects treated with UST with an AUC of 0.720 (sensitivity, 0.563; specificity, 0.812). For classifying subjects in remission from subjects with active CD 6\u00a0weeks after UST induction using week 6 stool samples, the model had an AUC of 0.866 (sensitivity, 0.833; specificity, 0.832). OTUs that were important for these classifications again included Faecalibacterium (OTU7), as well as Blautia (OTU124), Clostridium XIVa (OTU73), Ruminococcaceae (OTU53), and Roseburia (OTU12).

This allowed us to generate hypotheses about the biology of CD as it relates to the microbiome and UST response. Faecalibacterium frequently occurred in our models. It is associated with health, comprising up to 5% of the relative abundance in healthy individuals, and is generally rare in CD patients (28, 30, 44, 45). Each subject in remission 6\u00a0weeks after UST therapy had measurable Faecalibacterium present at baseline. This supports the hypothesis that Faecalibacterium impacts CD pathogenesis. It may even be beneficial to administer Faecalibacterium as a probiotic during therapy. Escherichia/Shigella also occurred frequently in our models. This OTU is associated with inflammation and has been shown to be associated with CD (45). Many other taxa observed in our analysis had low abundance or were absent in the majority of subjects. However, in many cases, these taxa are related and may serve similar ecologic and metabolic roles in the gut environment. We hypothesize that these microbes may have genes that perform redundant metabolic functions. Performing metagenomics on stool samples in future studies, especially in patients who achieve remission, could reveal these functions, which could be further developed into a clinically useful predictive tool.",

Serum CRP, fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin are widely used as biomarkers to measure inflammation and CD severity. In this study, the microbial community structure was different among subjects based on these markers. These results support the hypothesis that the fecal microbiota could function as a biomarker for measuring disease activity in patients, especially in concert with established inflammatory biomarkers (24, 25, 36). Higher CDAI scores were also associated with lower microbial diversity. This is consistent with other studies on the microbiota in individuals with CD compared to healthy individuals and studies looking at active disease compared to remission (11, 36, 47). However, the CDAI subscore of weekly stool frequency likely drove these differences (see Table\u00a0S1\u00a0in the supplemental material), as we did not observe significant associations between microbial diversity and the other quantitative CDAI subscores. Our observed association between high loose stool frequency and low microbial diversity is consistent with the results of previous studies (48). We also observed differences in the microbial community structure based on disease localization, which is consistent with a study by Naftali et al. (44). Our study also showed that corticosteroid use impacts the composition of the human fecal microbiota, which is consistent with observations in mouse models (49). We also observed that longer disease duration is associated with a reduction in fecal microbial diversity. We hypothesize that prolonged disease duration and the associated inflammation result in the observed decrease in diversity.",

For CD specifically, using the microbiota to predict response to specific treatment modalities could result in more personalized treatment and faster achievement of remission, thereby increasing patients\u2019 quality of life and reducing economic and health care impacts for CD patients. Our results showing that the \u03b1-diversity of clinical UST responders increased over time, in contrast to nonresponsive subjects, and our ability to classify subjects in remission from those with active disease following UST treatment are again consistent with other studies suggesting the microbiota could be a useful biomarker for predicting or monitoring response to treatment (36). These predictive biomarkers will need to be validated using independent cohorts in future studies. Additionally, the positive and negative associations between the microbiota and CD allow us to predict the types of mechanisms most likely to alter the microbiota in order to increase the likelihood of achieving a therapeutic response or to monitor disease severity. Prior to the initiation of therapy, patients could have their fecal microbiome analyzed. The microbial community data could then be used to direct the modification of a patient\u2019s microbiota prior to or during treatment with the goal of improving treatment outcomes. Since it has been shown experimentally that the microbiome can alter the efficacy of treatments for a variety of diseases (7,\u201310), if fecal microbiota can be validated as biomarkers to noninvasively predict response to therapy, then patients and clinicians will be able to more rapidly ascertain effective therapies that result in increased patient quality of life.",

Institutional review board approval was acquired at each participating study center, and subjects provided written informed consent (37). Inclusion/exclusion criteria and concomitant medication handling are described in full in the supplemental \u201cProtocol\u201d of the published clinical study (37). Briefly, for inclusion in this study, subjects must have been over the age of 18 years and diagnosed with CD for at least 3\u00a0months prior to study initiation, have active CD with a baseline Crohn\u2019s disease activity index (CDAI) score between 220 and 450, and refractory to anti-TNF-\u03b1 treatment. Subject data were deidentified for our study. Participants provided a stool sample prior to the initiation of the study and were then divided into treatment groups. An additional stool sample was provided 4\u00a0weeks after treatment. At 6\u00a0weeks after treatment, an additional stool sample was collected, subjects were scored for their response to UST based on CDAI, and then divided into groups receiving either subcutaneous injection of UST or placebo at weeks 8 and 16 as maintenance therapy. A clinical response was defined as a reduction from baseline CDAI score of 100 or more points or as remission in subjects with a baseline CDAI score between 220 and 248 points (37). Remission was defined as a CDAI below the threshold of 150. Finally, at 22 weeks after treatment, subjects provided an additional stool sample and were then scored using CDAI for their response to therapy. Of these samples, 306 were provided prior to treatment, 258 were provided at week 4, 289 at week 6, and 205 at week 22 after treatment, for a total of 1,058 samples. Stool samples were collected by the patients at home, kept refrigerated for no more than 24\u00a0h, and then brought to the clinical sites and frozen.

Spearman correlation tests were performed to compare the inverse Simpson index and continuous clinical data. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed for pairwise comparisons, and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests were performed for comparisons with more than two groups (58, 59). To measure \u03b2-diversity, the distance between samples was calculated using the \u03b8YC metric, which takes into account the types of bacteria and their abundance to calculate the differences between the communities (60). These distance matrices were assessed for overlap between sets of communities using the nonparametric analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) test as implemented in the adonis function from the vegan R package (v.2.4.4) (61). Changes in \u03b1-diversity over time based on week 22 response was assessed using a Friedman test on subjects who provided a sample at each time point (62). The Friedman test is a function in the stats R package (v.3.4.2). Multiple comparisons following a Friedman test were performed using the friedmanmc function in the pgirmess package (v.1.6.7) (63). Changes in \u03b2-diversity over time by treatment group and response were assessed using the adonis function in vegan stratified by subject. We used the relative abundance of each OTU, \u03b1-diversity, age, sex, current medications, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, disease location, fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, C-reactive protein, bowel stricture, and CDAI subscores as input into our random forest (RF) models constructed with the AUCRF R package (v.1.1) (64) to identify phylotypes or clinical variables that distinguish between various treatment and response groups, as well as to predict or determine response outcome (65). Optimal predictors were determined based on their mean decrease in accuracy (MDA) of the model to classify subjects. Differentially abundant OTUs and phyla were selected through comparison of clinical groups using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcox tests, where appropriate, to identify OTUs/phyla where there was a P\u00a0value less than 0.05 following a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons (66). Other R packages used in our analysis included ggplot2 v.2.2.1 (67), dplyr v.0.7.4 (68), pROC v.1.10.0 (69), knitr v.1.17 (70), gridExtra v.2.3 (71), devtools v.1.13.3 (72), knitcitations v.1.0.8 (73), scales v.0.5.0 (74), tidyr v.0.7.2 (75), Hmisc v.4.0.3 (76), and cowplot v.0.8.0 (77).
