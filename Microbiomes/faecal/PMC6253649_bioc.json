We modeled daily change in Shannon diversity across oral, ET, and stool specimens, parameterized with daily exposure to cefepime, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, meropenem, IV vancomycin, and oral vancomycin. All parameters fit with Rhat value lower than 1.1. Absent antibiotic exposure on the previous day, the daily change in Shannon diversity at all sites was near zero. The largest observed effect was oral vancomycin on stool (daily delta Shannon: \u22120.6, 95% CI: \u22121.38 to 0.09). All estimated effects for intravenous antibiotics on the stool, and for all antibiotics at other sites were smaller.",
