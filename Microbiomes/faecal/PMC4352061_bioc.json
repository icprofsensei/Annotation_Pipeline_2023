Such complexity and diversity poses considerable challenges to researchers as to how best to investigate such an environment accurately and completely. In the past, studies relied heavily on culture-based approaches, known now to capture only 10\u201320% of the actual microbiota present [2]. However, as molecular technologies advanced, studies increasingly applied molecular approaches such as PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis or temperature gradient gel electrophoresis to determine the gut microbiota with greater accuracy than culturing alone [3]. Over the past 2 decades, with our enhanced understanding of the human gut microbiota, researchers have investigated the contribution of gut microbes to diseases such as diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease and certain cancers [4\u20136]. These investigations have been enabled through the advent of next generation sequencing technologies including Roche 454-pyrosequencing, Illumina MiSeq and PacBio [7].",

                    "text": "With decreasing costs and increasing speed, high-throughput sequencing approaches are being applied more frequently to investigate human gut microbiota. The majority of sequencing studies sequence the hyper variable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bacterial gene. This enables the sequencing of all bacteria, without requiring prior knowledge of which populations are present, while also providing insights into populations present at low abundances that could be missed by culturing alone. The results from high-throughput sequencing can however be biased by numerous factors. Studies have shown that the DNA extraction procedure, primers and sequencing platform used, can impact on the accuracy of the results achieved [8\u201310]. In the majority of gut microbiota studies, faecal samples are used owing to the non-invasive nature of collecting such samples. Recently, studies have highlighted that the storage conditions of the sample prior to DNA extraction can alter the microbiota detected, especially in cases where prolonged room temperature exposure occurs [11]. However, at present limited studies have addressed a critical comparison of microbiota composition in fresh faecal samples to samples snap frozen on dry ice, to samples frozen immediately at -80\u00b0C, using both culturing methods and sequencing on the MiSeq platform. In fact, there is a considerable paucity of studies investigating the ability to culture from frozen faecal samples. This is critical information as increasingly research collaborations between institutions are occurring, resulting in a necessity to collect, store and ship samples in an appropriate manner to enable accurate subsequent culture-based analysis. While studies using 454-pyrosequencing have been completed on this topic, to date we are unaware of any study using MiSeq sequencing to investigate the effects of such storage conditions on faecal microbiota. Given the increased sequencing depth achieved through MiSeq sequencing compared to 454-pyrosequencing, subtle changes in microbiota that may not be detected using 454-pyrosequencing, may be captured using the MiSeq sequencing platform. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the faecal microbiota of 7 healthy adults using culturing and MiSeq sequencing approaches and to determine the effects of different storage conditions on the faecal microbiota detected. Such results will inform future studies using faecal samples and MiSeq sequencing on the most appropriate way to store samples prior to DNA extraction, when extraction from fresh samples is not appropriate.",

Two PCR reactions were completed on the template DNA. Initially the DNA was amplified with primers specific to the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene which also incorporates the Illumina overhang adaptor (Forward primer 5\u2019 TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG; reverse primer 5\u2019 GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC). Each PCR reaction contained DNA template (~10\u201312ng), 5 \u03bcl forward primer (1 \u03bcM), 5 \u03bcl reverse primer (1 \u03bcM), 12.5 \u03bcl 2X Kapa HiFi Hotstart ready mix (Anachem, Dublin, Ireland), PCR grade water to a final volume of 25\u03bcl. PCR amplification was carried out as follows: heated lid 110\u00b0, 95\u00b0C x 3mins, 25 cycles of 95\u00b0C x 30s, 55\u00b0C x 30s, 72\u00b0C x 30s, then 72\u00b0C x 5mins and held at 4\u00b0C. PCR products were visualised using gel electrophoresis (1X TAE buffer, 1.5% agarose, 100V). Successful PCR products were cleaned using AMPure XP magnetic bead based purification (Labplan, Dublin, Ireland). A second PCR reaction was completed on the purified DNA (5\u03bcl) to index each of the samples, allowing samples to be pooled for sequencing on the one flow cell and subsequently demultiplexed for analysis. Two indexing primers (Illumina Nextera XT indexing primers, Illumina, Sweden) were used per sample. Each PCR reaction contained 5\u03bcl index 1 primer (N7xx), 5\u03bcl index 2 primer (S5xx), 25\u03bcl 2x Kapa HiFi Hot Start Ready mix, 10\u03bcl PCR grade water. PCRs were completed as described above, but only 8 amplification cycles were completed instead of 25. PCR products were visualised using gel electrophoresis and subsequently cleaned (as described above). Samples were quantified using the Qubit (Bio-Sciences, Dublin, Ireland), along with the broad range DNA quantification assay kit (BioSciences) and samples were then pooled in an equimolar fashion. The pooled sample was run on the Agilent Bioanalyser for quality analysis prior to sequencing. The sample pool (4nM) was denatured with 0.2N NaOH, then diluted to 4pM and combined with 10% (v/v) denatured 4pM PhiX, prepared following Illumina guidelines. Samples were sequenced on the MiSeq sequencing platform in the Teagasc sequencing facility, using a 2 x 300 cycle V3 kit, following standard Illumina sequencing protocols.",

In contrast, the proportion of Leuconostoc was significantly higher in the fresh samples compared to the snap frozen samples (p = 0.033), but no differences occurred between the fresh and -80\u00b0C frozen samples (p = 0.054), or between the snap and -80\u00b0C frozen samples (p = 1.000).

While studies have investigated this, to date however, no study has used MiSeq sequencing to determine the effects of freezing on the faecal microbiota compared to the fresh sample. Aware of the increased sequencing depth and coverage achieved using MiSeq sequencing compared to 454-pyrosequencing, our aim was to determine if subtle changes occur following freezing of faecal samples that may not have been captured in previous studies using 454-pyrosequencing. Such studies are important, as researchers are increasingly using MiSeq sequencing instead of 454-pyrosequencing and thus our study aimed to clarify the most appropriate storage of faecal samples, prior to DNA extraction for MiSeq sequencing to limit biasing the results achieved. While DNA extraction from fresh faecal samples may be the ideal choice, in many situations this is not practical, especially given the growing number of large multicentre projects being undertaken. Thus, knowing the effects of different storage conditions on faecal microbiota, as determined using MiSeq sequencing, is important for the design, analysis and interpretation of microbiota studies in the future.",

We chose to culture and enumerate total aerobes and anaerobes as the best method of evaluating the global effect of storage condition on the culturable microbiota. Bifidobacteria were cultured and enumerated because of their low abundance in faecal microbiota and their assumed sensitivity to freezing. We rationalised that if bifidobacteria were recoverable following freezing at -80\u00b0C, accordingly other low abundance groups may be recoverable. However, the recovery rate of other such groups has yet to be investigated. Although microbiological culturing from faecal samples is for the most part performed on fresh samples [17, 18], there is little information in the literature comparing the effects of storage conditions on the culturable bacterial populations present in faecal samples. Using culturing approaches, our results demonstrated that the levels of total aerobes, total anaerobes or bifidobacteria in the fresh samples were similar compared with either the snap frozen or -80\u00b0C frozen samples. The greatest differences were seen between samples from different individuals, rather than from different treatments. The results suggest that rapid freezing of samples following collection and the avoidance of prolonged periods at room temperature or the occurrence of freeze-thaw enables the recovery of comparable levels of aerobes, anaerobes and bifidobacteria from frozen samples, as from fresh samples. Snap freezing did not appear to afford any additional benefits over freezing the samples at -80\u00b0C. Importantly, we show that immediate freezing at -80\u00b0C demonstrates no significant difference in enumerated total aerobes, total anaerobes and bifidobacteria from fresh or snap frozen, at global level without the addition of glycerol or other preservation media, such as RNA later. We acknowledge the limitations of this study, in that we can only comment on the global levels of the groups enumerated. In future studies, it may be interesting to examine the effects of storage on a wider range of bacterial groups and to investigate if the recovery of bacterial numbers at a global level translates to specific taxa.",

The dominant phyla, families and genera were similar between the three groups. We did note non-significant higher levels of Firmicutes in the snap and -80\u00b0C frozen samples compared to the fresh samples. This supports previous research using qPCR, which demonstrated a significantly higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in frozen samples compared to fresh [19]. This may be due to an increased extraction ability of DNA from Gram positive (Firmicutes) bacteria following frozen storage [19]. Our results of minimal and non-significant differences in microbiota following freezing of faecal samples are in agreement with previous research which used alternative analysis [11, 20, 21]. The increased depth of coverage achieved through MiSeq enabled us to identify genera present at very low levels e.g. Bifidobacterium at <0.001% of assignable phylum reads. However, even in these circumstances no significant difference occurred in samples stored under different storage conditions. Thus, using MiSeq we could confirm the suitability of sample freezing prior to DNA extraction, with results being comparable to fresh samples.",

However, we hope to further study these faecal samples after months and even years at -80\u00b0C, using both culture and MiSeq analysis to determine the effects of long-term storage of samples at -80\u00b0C on faecal microbiota. The research to date suggests that freezing, either snap or at -80\u00b0C, preserves the faecal microbiota, while long-term storage at 4\u00b0C, room temperature or samples which undergo freeze-thaw, results in altered microbiota compared to their fresh equivalent [8, 21]. Our fresh samples were processed within 4 hours of collection, during which time they were stored at 4\u00b0C. Such a short period of cold storage is unlikely to alter the results of these \u2018fresh\u2019 samples compared to the samples when defecated, with previous publications indicating minimal changes occur in faecal microbiota following short-term storage at room temperature or 4\u00b0C [11, 20]. In fact, recent studies on sputum samples from individuals with cystic fibrosis have suggested that 12 hours room temperature storage prior to -80\u00b0C storage, is unlikely to alter microbiota [23]. Studies examining the effects of snap freezing are limited, but those which have been completed suggest freezing (either on dry ice or at -80\u00b0C) achieves the most accurate microbiota relative to the fresh sample [24]. Though snap freezing results in samples reaching the same end-point temperature as samples placed at -80\u00b0C, the temperature drops at a greater rate, reducing ice crystal formation in the sample, thus retaining superior cell integrity. Though outside the scope of this study, it may be the case that snap freezing would be beneficial in cases where subsequent enzymatic or RNA-based analysis are to be completed [25]. This study also investigated microbial diversity and found no significant differences between the 3 treatment groups in terms of alpha or beta diversity. Previously, 454-pyrosequencing studies suggested that samples cluster based on the donor rather than the storage of the faecal sample [22]. Our MiSeq results support these findings, with the greatest variation in microbiota being attributable to interpersonal differences rather than the storage treatment.",

Despite the increased sequencing depth achievable using MiSeq as compared to 454-pyrosequencing, our results support previous 454-pyrosequencing results that found the greatest differences between samples is due to the uniqueness of each individual\u2019s microbiota, rather than storage conditions prior to DNA extraction. Our results suggest that rapid freezing, either on dry ice or simply placed at -80\u00b0C prior to culturing or DNA extraction for sequencing analysis, will result in accurate microbiota results. Going forward, when comparing data sets from different studies, it will be important to consider how the samples were stored prior to extraction, with results from fresh or frozen samples being more reliable than samples stored at room temperature or 4\u00b0C for prolonged periods.",
