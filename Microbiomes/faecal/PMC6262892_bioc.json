Compared with MDRO\u2212 patients, the intestinal microbiota of MDRO+ patients had substantially lower microbial diversity, even after adjusting for potential confounders of MDRO colonization, including prior stay in healthcare-associated facility and antimicrobial exposure. Reduced microbial diversity has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Among patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, a profound decrease in microbial diversity preceded intestinal domination by specific bacterial pathogens and increased the risk of subsequent VRE or gram-negative bacteremia.3 In the same patient setting, low intestinal microbial diversity has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality.20 Similarly, the intestinal microbiota of patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), in particular those with severe disease, is also characterized by reduced microbial diversity compared to controls.21 Although data suggest that reduced microbial diversity itself does not constitute a causal mechanism for developing disease, it may be considered a biomarker of a disrupted microbiota.22",

These findings are consistent with previous reports showing severe disruptions in the fecal microbiota of hospitalized patients exposed to antimicrobials. Thus, higher abundances of pathogens such as enterococci may reflect an impaired colonization resistance. Several bacterial taxa have been associated with colonization resistance against transient pathogens, including MDROs. For example, a greater abundance of Lactobacillus spp. characterized the fecal microbiota of patients that remained uncolonized with MDRO during hospitalization.4\nClostridium scindens has been shown to have a potentially protective effect against C. difficile and Barnesiella spp. against VRE colonization.22,23 Lastly, successful eradication of MDRO using fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with hematologic disease has been reported, with a high abundance of members of the Bacteroidales order characterizing the post-FMT microbiota of patients in whom MDRO was successfully eradicated.24 In this study, the microbiome of patients not colonized with an MDRO also showed greater abundance of the Bacteroidales order, suggesting that this order may reflect a healthier microbiome that is more resistant to MDRO colonization.24",

Therefore, the associations described should be interpreted with caution; no causal relationship between microbiome features and MDRO colonization can be established. Furthermore, as a cross-sectional study, the differences in microbiome characteristics cannot be considered predictive of the outcome. Second, the case definition (MDRO detection) was based on cultures that have variable sensibility, conveying a risk of misclassification bias. However, participants were extensively exposed to antimicrobials, which maximizes the sensitivity of the MDRO detection approach.10 Third, antimicrobial use is a well-recognized confounder in microbiome studies.30 Although prior and current antimicrobial exposures were variables considered in the analysis, differential exposure to types of antimicrobials between MDRO+ and MDRO\u2212 patients may have occurred. Finally, the functional prediction for a given bacterial community based on 16S rRNA sequence data may be subject to limitations when the availability of reference genomes is scarce. However, the low mean NSTI value (0.05) reported in this study indicates that closely related genomes were available and supports the accuracy of the prediction.18",

The findings of this study begin to characterize MDIs associated with MDRO colonization, including an independent and inverse association with microbiome diversity, differences in bacterial community structures, and metabolic pathways. Future larger studies are required to increase our understanding and application of microbiome analyses toward limiting MDRO transmission and spread, with the future goal of developing rapid tests that could detect MDRO colonization at hospital admission.",
