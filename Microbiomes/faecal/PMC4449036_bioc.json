Adequate sampling strategies are required to limit bias due to shifts in microbial communities during sampling and storage. Therefore, we examined the impact of different sampling and storage conditions on the stability of fecal microbial communities in healthy and diseased subjects. Fecal samples from 10 healthy controls, 10 irritable bowel syndrome and 8 inflammatory bowel disease patients were collected on site, aliquoted immediately after defecation and stored at -80\u00b0C, -20\u00b0C for 1 week, at +4\u00b0C or room temperature for 24 hours. Fecal transport swabs (FecalSwab, Copan) were collected and stored for 48-72 hours at room temperature. We used pyrosequencing of the 16S gene to investigate the stability of microbial communities. Alpha diversity did not differ between all storage methods and -80\u00b0C, except for the fecal swabs. UPGMA clustering and principal coordinate analysis showed significant clustering by test subject (p<0.001) but not by storage method. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and (un)weighted UniFrac showed a significant higher distance between fecal swabs and -80\u00b0C versus the other methods and -80\u00b0C samples (p<0.009). The relative abundance of Ruminococcus and Enterobacteriaceae did not differ between the storage methods versus -80\u00b0C, but was higher in fecal swabs (p<0.05). Storage up to 24 hours (at +4\u00b0C or room temperature) or freezing at -20\u00b0C did not significantly alter the fecal microbial community structure compared to direct freezing of samples from healthy subjects and patients with gastrointestinal disorders.",

Recent introduction of high-throughput sequencing methods has paved the way for the discovery of key microbial players in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Although differences in composition and metabolic activity have been clearly reported, the causal contribution of such key bacterial species or groups is in most cases not yet clear. This may be due to the relative small study populations, different disease phenotypes, and lack of control for potential confounding factors such as medication, co-morbidity and differences in dietary patterns. Therefore, large well-defined prospective cohorts are required to gain further insight in the role of the microbiota in heterogeneous disease entities. To accurately analyze the fecal microbiota, it is crucial that the sampling and storage procedures do not alter the microbial composition. Therefore, sampling methods that are applicable in large cohorts and do not bias the results are needed for these studies. Although immediate freezing of fecal samples is generally considered the gold standard, this is logistically challenging in large-scale studies. Moreover, thawing of frozen samples during transport is known to have a dramatic effect on DNA integrity [5].",

Principal coordinate analysis of the weighted UniFrac distances and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity showed similar results (S4\u2013S9 Figs).

Pairwise comparisons of the weighted UniFrac distance and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity also showed that the beta diversity distances between the FecalSwab and the reference method is statistically significantly larger compared to the reference method and all other storage methods (S10 and S11 Figs). The median unweighted UniFrac distances of -20\u00b0C, +4\u00b0C and RT versus the reference method were comparable between each other (Fig 4), implying that aliquots stored under these conditions were equally similar to samples stored directly at -80C.

Previous studies have investigated the effect of various storage temperatures on the fecal microbiota composition and showed overall no significant differences in richness, diversity and clustering. These studies were however based upon a limited number of subjects, included only healthy individuals or did not report the health status of included subjects. As such, the generalizability of their results and conclusions is unclear [5\u20139]. Our study included both healthy as well as diseased subjects; diagnosed with common GI disorders that are reported to be associated with the intestinal microbiota, have differences in fecal consistency and use a variety of medications which enhances the heterogeneity of our study population and thereby the external validity of our results. No significant differences were found in the amount of observed OTUs, richness and diversity between the reference storage method and other methods. Similar results were observed in the total study population, as well as in the subgroups of healthy subjects, IBS and IBD patients and did not differ with regard to stools consistency (i.e. ranging from constipation to diarrhea type stools).",

Only one previous study compared the microbial richness of directly frozen samples and samples stored at room temperature up to 24 hours and showed no statistically significant differences [8], which is in accordance with our findings. Previous studies were mainly performed in small numbers of healthy subjects or with unknown health status. We showed that the findings are also applicable to patients with different disease states, medication use and/or fecal consistencies. In contrast to the study of Roesch et al, which included four healthy subjects, we did not observed a decrease in the relative abundance of the extreme oxygen sensitive species Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus or an increase in the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in the fecal samples stored at room temperature for 24 hours as compared to the reference method in our cohort of 28 study objects. In addition to these results, we found that the relative abundance of extreme oxygen sensitive species Roseburia and the Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio was not significantly different between the storage methods and reference method. Our results indicate only a minimal effect of the investigated storage methods on the fecal microbiota composition from the total population and all subgroups investigated. This observation is further supported by the UPGMA clustering and principal coordinate analyses, which showed that the fecal aliquots clustered based on test subject and not storage methods. Although the distances in beta diversity are relatively small and comparable between each and every storage method, we still recommend using a single standardized method within one study to minimize any potential sampling bias.",

The FecalSwabs were stored for 48\u201372 hours at room temperature in modified Cary-Blair medium, which promotes survival of obligate anaerobes by the low oxidation reducing potential and is used for the isolation of enteric pathogens [20]. FecalSwabs showed a significantly higher microbial richness and diversity. This might be explained by a slight growth advantage of certain low abundant bacterial taxa, particularly within the significantly enriched Enterobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae families, in this medium. Such low abundant taxa, undetected at the applied sequencing depth in the other aliquots, could then rise above the detection limit. Although FecalSwabs still strongly clustered to the other aliquots of the same subject, this could also explain why the microbial community structure of the FecalSwabs showed a larger distance (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and UniFrac distances) to the reference method than the other storage methods. The use of fecal swabs seems to be the most user friendly method to obtain fecal samples, however, in this study 10 out of 28 FecalSwab samples yielded insufficient DNA quantity and could therefore not be sequenced. When using FecalSwabs, an adapted DNA isolation protocol (e.g. not depending on column-based purification) is recommended to retain highest possible DNA yield. The results of the FecalSwab are only applicable to this particular swab and other transport swabs containing Cary-Blair medium and should not be extrapolated to swabs using different transport medium. It is important to note that within or between studies, the results of the FecalSwab should not be compared with other feces collection and storage methods due to the variations in the microbiological structure between these sampling methods. To our best knowledge this is the first study that investigates the effect of different sampling and storage methods by means of pyrosequencing within a rather large, heterogeneous group. By including healthy subjects and those with a GI disorder, the results drawn from this study can be generalized to other populations. The results and conclusions are only applicable for studies on the taxonomic composition of the fecal microbiota. Metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metametabolomics are becoming increasingly important in the study and understanding of the human GI microbiota. Metabolites, proteins and especially mRNA are known to be susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Therefore, studies on the impact of different sampling and storage methods on the stability of the metagenome, metametabolome, metatranscriptome and metaproteome are also warranted.",

Direct freezing of the feces (e.g. in the home freezer of participating subjects) increases the potential for additional analyses (eg. metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics), but thawing of the samples during transport should be prevented at any cost [8]. If direct freezing is not feasible within the setting of a study, we recommend storing feces at either room temperature or at +4\u00b0C (in a refrigerator) for a maximum of 24 hours.",
