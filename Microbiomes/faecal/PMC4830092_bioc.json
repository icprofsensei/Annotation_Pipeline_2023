Translation studies of the microbiome have the potential to indicate clinical applications such as fecal transplants and probiotics. However, one major issue is accurate identification of microbes constituting the microbiota. Studies of the microbiome have frequently utilized sequencing of the conserved 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. We present a comparative study of an alternative approach using shotgun whole genome sequencing (WGS). In the present study, we analyzed the human fecal microbiome compiling a total of 194.1\u00d7106 reads from a single sample using multiple sequencing methods and platforms. Specifically, after establishing the reproducibility of our methods with extensive multiplexing, we compared: 1) The 16S rRNA amplicon versus the WGS method, 2) the Illumina HiSeq versus MiSeq platforms, 3) the analysis of reads versus de novo assembled contigs, and 4) the effect of shorter versus longer reads. Our study demonstrates that shotgun whole genome sequencing has multiple advantages compared with the 16S amplicon method including enhanced detection of bacterial species, increased detection of diversity and increased prediction of genes. In addition, increased length, either due to longer reads or the assembly of contigs, improved the accuracy of species detection.",

These observations suggest that modulation of the fecal microbiome could become an important therapeutic modality for some diseases. For example, fecal transplants have been shown to alleviate diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile infection and temporarily improve insulin sensitivity [3, 4]. However, a major concern when administering fecal transplants, or even probiotics, is the long-term biological effects of the inoculum on the recipient microbiota. It is essential to precisely identify and enumerate the bacterial species in the inoculum as well as in the recipient microbiome in order to understand the complex interactions among the microbes [5, 6]. The gut microbiome, which has been the most extensively studied of the human microbiomes, is highly diverse and has been shown to include thousands of different bacterial species [7, 8]. The diverse community of bacteria is composed of a small number of abundant species plus a large number of rare or low abundance species [9]. The differential functions of the abundant and rare species remain poorly understood. Thus, to effectively understand the ecology of the fecal microbiome, it is imperative to analyze both the rare and the abundant microbes.",

These technical advances have been paradigm shifting since the majority (>90%) of microbial species cannot be readily cultured using current laboratory culture techniques [11\u201313]. The most common sequencing approach to analyze the microbiome, which has been used to compile most of the data collated by the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), is amplicon analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene [14, 15]. In this method, a 16S rRNA region is amplified by PCR with primers that recognize highly conserved regions of the gene and sequenced [16]. The limitations of this method are that the annotation is based on putative association of the 16S rRNA gene with a taxa defined as an operational taxonomic unit (OTU). In general, OTUs are analyzed at the phyla or genera level, and can be less precise at the species level. In addition, specific genes are not directly sequenced, but rather predicted based on the OTUs. Due to horizontal gene transfer and the existence of numerous bacterial strains [17\u201319], the lack of direct gene identification potentially limits understanding of a microbiome.",

The major advantages of the WGS method are that the taxa can be more accurately defined at the species level. Another important consideration is that the 16S and WGS methods commonly utilize different databases for classification of taxa. However, WGS is more expensive and requires more extensive data analysis [10, 20\u201322]. In addition, to identify and understand the bacterial genes in a taxa, it may be necessary to sequence a genome with high coverage [20].",

The PCR product was processed using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) and eluted with nuclease free water. Four \u00b5L was used as template for the second PCR (PCR-II), which adds the adapter sequences. PCR-II was performed using the following conditions (initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 12 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 72\u00b0C at 30 s, plus a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min). The final product was processed using the Agencourt AMPure XP Beads and library was analyzed using the Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 (Agilent Technologies). The final amplicon libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq using the v3\u2013600 cycle kit with 301 base paired end chemistry. To check for possible exogenous DNA contamination, samples of TE and water used for the PCR-I and PCR-II step were analyzed on a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 and Qubit (High Sensitivity Assay) with no detectable DNA. Also, the control libraries generated no detectable sequences.",

A similarity method was utilized to assign each contig to a species, and the assembled contigs were then queried against NCBI NT database. A stringent threshold of 90% identity and e-value of 1e\u22123 was used to evaluate the alignments, and the best hit was selected.

A freshly voided sample was processed and high quality (greater than 5 kb) metagenomic DNA was isolated (Fig. S2a,b). To evaluate reproducibility of our methods, the libraries were constructed with 11 fold multiplexing. We prepared 16S rRNA amplicon libraries from the metagenomic DNA using 16S rRNA gene V1\u2013V3 region primers listed by the Human Microbiome Project [27]. The Bioanalyzer tracings of the 11 libraries showed a peak at 650\u2013700 bp without any primer-dimers or detectable adapter contamination confirming high quality of the amplicon libraries (Fig. S2c). To exclude the possibility of contamination of reagents, a control library without metagenomic DNA inserts was prepared following the same methods and no PCR product or DNA inserts were detected (S3a,b). To prepare WGS libraries for the v2\u2013300 and v3\u2013600 MiSeq sequencing, the fecal metagenomic DNA (Fig. S2a,b) was sheared to 300 \u2013 600 bp fragments using Covaris S220 (Fig. S4a). Eleven high quality libraries (S1 \u2013 S11) with unique indexes for multiplexed sequencing were prepared (Fig. S4b). Next, to prepare a library for sequencing on HiSeq, the same fecal metagenomic DNA was sheared (Fig. S5a) and a library was prepared.

The striking result was that the species abundance detected by the 16S method was markedly lower than by all of the WGS protocols. At 32.8 million reads, 16S detected 1,800 compared to more than 3,000 species by the WGS method. The different libraries and platforms analyzed with the WGS methods detected similar numbers of species per sequence read; however, the slope of the abundance curve remained positive indicating that additional species were being detected even at 163.7\u00d7106 total WGS reads. In the combined data in the v2+v3+HiSeq-total dataset, a total of 5,870 unique species were detected. Interestingly, the 21 common species (defined as relative abundance >1%) comprised 34.0% of the cumulative abundance, whereas the 1,222 rare species (defined as relative abundance <0.01%) comprised only 3.3% of the cumulative abundance (Table 2). Thus, we detected a large number of unique species in a single fecal microbiome. In parallel, we asked what is the minimum number of reads necessary to identify abundant species in the sample. We randomly sampled low numbers of reads from the v3-total dataset and constructed an abundance table (Table 3). Interestingly, 100% of the abundant species can be detected with as few as 500 sequence reads. The rarefaction curves for the multiplexed samples showed similar and reproducible results for the individual indexes (Fig. S6a\u2013e and Tables S3, S4, S5). Thus, our data shows that the microbiome contains a small number of abundant species, but a large number of low abundance and rare species.",

The relative abundance of the major phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria) was similar in all datasets sequenced with the WGS methods. However, we did detect significant differences between the 16S rRNA amplicon and WGS results. Specifically, in the 16S analysis we detected an increase in Bacteroidetes to 34% from 14\u201321% and a decrease in Actinobacteria to 0.4% from 4\u20137%. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria was similar. When we analyzed the abundance of phyla in the multiplexed data, we obtained similar and reproducible results for the individual indexes (Fig. S7a\u2013c). To compare the detection of phyla by the 16S rRNA amplicon versus WGS reads, we determined the number of species in each phyla identified by both methods or by only one of the methods (Fig. 4a and Table S6). In summary, both methods detected 70.8% of the Actinobacteria species, but only 8.9% of the Proteobacteria species. Among the Proteobacteria, 1,056 species were detected only by WGS showing increased sensitivity of species detection by WGS.",

The lower correlation between the 16S and WGS methods was in part due to differences between the classifications of OTUs in the RDP database and species in the NCBI-nt database.

Although some species showed comparable abundance between the 16S and WGS methods, other species (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were more abundant in the WGS results (17.0\u201323.5 versus 7.1), whereas other species were more abundant in the 16S results [e.g., Bacteroides uniformis (1.0 versus 3.9) and Bacteroides stercoris (1.0 versus 3.8)]. For some sequences, we detected different nomenclature in the RDP versus the 3 NCBI databases (nt, representative genome database and 16S rRNA databases). For example, several species (e.g., Subdoligranulum variabile, Clostridium saccharolyticum, Bacteroides sp. 1_1_6, Ruminococcus sp. SR1/5, Clostridium phytofermentans and Bacteroides sp. 4_3_47FAA) were detected by M5NR database but not by 16S analysis of the RDP and NCBI-nt database. In addition, we identified Blautia sp. Ser8 in the RDP database; however the same sequence was assigned to uncultured bacterium clone (99%) in NCBI-nt, Clostridium saccharolyticum WM1 (93%) in NCBI representative genome database and Blautia producta strain JCM (98%) in NCBI 16S ribosomal RNA database. Comparison of a complete list of the unique species identified by the 16S versus WGS methods also showed differences in a read-based versus contig-based analysis (Fig. 4b). First, the read-based analysis detected substantially more unique species (3,875) than the contig-based analysis (2,769). Furthermore, 63% of the species detected by the read-based method, compared with only 48% in the contig-based method, were not detected by the 16S approach.",

The most striking difference was for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii which showed 17.0\u201323.5% for our WGS read analysis (Table 4), but only 3.6\u20135.3% for WGS contig analysis (Table S6). Smaller differences were observed for other species. We observed similar results in the multiplexed data (Tables S3, S4, S5). Overall, among the unique bacterial species detected, 43% were detected only in the analysis of reads, whereas 2% were detected only in the analysis of contigs (Fig. 4b). These results could be due to decreased specificity in the read analysis or decreased sensitivity in the contig analysis. Our analysis underscores the importance of understanding the differences among the databases and using the same database for all comparative metagenomic analyses. Thus, both the sequencing and analytical methods showed differences in both detection and abundance of some species. Some of these discrepancies were because the RDP classifier gave a genus-level assignment, whereas NCBI gave only uncultured bacteria-level assignment for the same sequence.",

To investigate if the BLAST hits to a reference species mapped to short homologous sequences or with broad regions of a genome, we analyzed the depth and breadth of sequencing coverage for 10 reference genomes with abundance classified as common, high, moderate, low and rare (Table 5). The depth of coverage by sequencing reads ranged from 452 fold in the common abundance to 1.8 fold in the rare abundance species. A representative graphical representation of genome coverage for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii shows diffuse coverage for both strands of the genome for both mapped reads and contigs (Fig. 6). For this genome, the mapped reads covered 3,337 features (95.5% of total) and the contigs covered 2,460 features (70.4% of total). To determine if genomes with lower depth of sequencing also had diffuse coverage, we plotted the depth of sequencing on the genomes of the 10 reference species (Figs. S9a\u2013j). These results showed diffuse coverage that, although gaps and spikes were present, was broadly distributed across the genome. For example, the coverage of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii L2\u20136 shows broadly dispersed coverage with few gaps (Fig. 9a). Interestingly, coverage of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus NJ8700, which is a rare species with 1.8 fold coverage, also had diffuse coverage with intermittent spikes (Fig. S9j). We also documented genome size for the abundant species which ranged from 2.1\u20136.8 Mb (Table S9). These results indicate that sequencing coverage of the bacterial genomes was variable but diffuse.",

To analyze a discrepancy we submitted the reference query sequences, for example Blautia sp. Ser8 (S001745585; GU124472, reference sequence obtained from RDP), and Clostridium saccharolyticum WM1 (S002287206; CP002109) to the online RDP classifier at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/classifier/classifier.jsp [28]. We parsed the detailed RDP match results using taxon assignments with \u226595% bootstrap support and saved the assignment detail for each RDP match. Also, we submitted the reference query sequence Blautia sp. Ser8 and Clostridium saccharolyticum WM1 to the online NCBI databases at (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). NCBI BLAST computed a pairwise alignment between the query and the database sequences using default parameters. BLAST results for each sequence from each database were saved for comparison (Fig. S10). In general, comparison at the phylum level using the MG-RAST M5NR and NCBI-nt database revealed no differences in relative abundance of major phyla, however detection of unclassified bacteria was higher (~ 4 %) in NCBI-nt database (Fig. S11).",

After identifying the predicted genes, we selected all unique genes with the CD-HIT algorithm. Next, we aligned the putative genes with tblastx to the amino acid sequences in the NCBI database. Alignment with the amino acid sequences increased the confidence that the predicted genes could be translated and functional. The v2+v3+HiSeq-total dataset had the largest number of unique predicted genes (811,933), followed by the v3-total (783,887), HiSeq dataset (733,705) and the v2-total dataset (422,174). Thus, the HiSeq dataset detected the lowest number of genes. Although the HiSeq data generated the most identified reads (67.2\u00d7106 versus 59.0\u00d7106), the MiSeq v3-total dataset generated the largest number of total bases (15.6 Gb versus 6.7 Gb) due to the longer reads produced by the v3 technology. Interestingly, the longer MiSeq reads actually resulted in fewer total contigs, but the N50 length was substantially longer. These results suggest that longer reads can improve the efficiency of the assembly process resulting in the identification of a larger number of predicted genes.",

First, we compared the results of 16S versus WGS sequencing. The 16S amplicon approach has been the most commonly employed method to analyze bacterial microbiomes and has several important advantages: 1) it is cost effective, 2) data analysis can be performed by established pipelines, and 3) there is a large body of archived data for reference. However, our work demonstrated multiple substantial advantages of the WGS approach. As shown in a rarefaction plot, WGS identified significantly more bacterial species per read than the 16S method (Fig. 2a). For example, with >32\u00d7106 reads, the WGS method identified approximately twice as many species as the 16S method (4100 versus 2050 species). It is noteworthy that studies using the 16S method commonly generate approximately 10,000 reads[29]. Since the slope of the 16S rarefaction curve remains positive at 32\u00d7106 reads, it is likely that the lower number of reads commonly used does not fully detect the richness of a microbiome. In terms of diversity, 3 different metrics (Shannon diversity, Simpson index and evenness) all showed greater diversity with the WGS approach (see Fig. 6 and Table S8). In addition, the WGS, but not the 16S, approach can identify organisms in additional kingdoms including viruses, fungi and protozoa.",

The 16S method assigns OTUs based on the 16S amplicon which is used to predict classification of taxa. The classifications are most effective at the phyla and, to a lesser extent, genera levels, but often lack accuracy at the species level. Due to this limitation, the RDP classifier frequently assigns a 16S amplicon sequence to a genus without specifying a species. In contrast, the WGS approach can confidently assign classifications for many sequences at the species level. Thus, our analyses were occasionally qualitatively and quantitatively divergent. For example, 2,441 species detected by the WGS reads were not detected by the 16S method. Also, identical reference genomes occasionally had different classifications. For example, the Blautia sp. Ser8 genome in the RDP database was annotated as an uncultured bacterium clone (99%) in NCBI-nt, Clostridium saccharolyticum WM1 (93%) in NCBI representative genome database and Blautia producta strain JCM (98%) in NCBI-16S ribosomal RNA database (Fig. S10). Thus, the development of more complete and universal reference databases will be essential to enhance the accuracy of species classifications.",

As expected, the HiSeq run generated the most identified reads (67.2\u00d7106) compared with 59.0\u00d7106 and 37.5\u00d7106 for the v3\u2013600 and v2\u2013300 MiSeq runs, respectively (Table 1). However, due to longer reads, the v3\u2013600 MiSeq run generated the highest yield of 18.0 Gb. In the analysis of the rarefaction curves based on the number of sequencing reads, all of the WGS curves were approximately overlaid (Fig. 2a). However, when we performed the same analysis using contigs rather than reads, both the v2\u2013300 and v3\u2013600 MiSeq results outperformed the HiSeq data on a per read basis and also an absolute basis (Fig. 2b). All reads were paired-end, however, the v2\u2013300 and v3\u2013600 reads were longer, a factor that likely improved the efficiency of the de novo assembly. Interestingly, the v2\u2013300 reads were only 50 bp longer than the HiSeq reads (151 versus 100 bp, respectively). Since the rarefaction curves using contigs from the v2\u2013300 (read length 151) and v3\u2013600 (read length 301) dataset were similar, it is possible that increases from 100 to 150 supports critical increases in effectiveness of de novo assembly. Length also may be a critical factor in the differences between the read and contig comparisons with the 16S amplicons (Fig. 2). In this comparison, the read analysis of the v2+v3+HiSeq-total dataset identified 2,459 species not detected by the 16S amplicon analysis, whereas the contig analysis of the same v2+v3+HiSeq-total dataset identified only 1,353 species not detected by the 16S amplicon analysis. One interpretation of these results is that the shorter reads generate more false positives than the longer contigs. In summary, based on the v2\u2013300 versus v3\u2013600 and the read versus contig comparisons, it is apparent that read length exerts a major effect on data analysis.",

To directly assess the breadth and depth of genome coverage with the WGS method, we analyzed coverage of 10 reference genomes with common, high, moderate, low and rare abundance. Average coverage ranged from 452.3 fold for the high abundance Faecalibacterium prausnitzii L2\u20136 to 1.8 fold for the rare Aggregatibacter aphrophilus NJ8700 (Table 5). For all species analyzed, we observed occasional spikes and gaps, but overall diffuse coverage throughout the genomes (Figs. S9a\u2013j). Thus, with adequate sequencing depth the WGS method can generate both depth and breadth of coverage of the bacterial genomes even including bacteria of rare abundance. A major strength of the WGS method is the capacity to identify specific genes in the microbiota. In this study, we used the MetaGeneMark algorithm to identify predicted genes in our contig data and then used tblastx against the NCBI database to confirm that the predicted genes encoded amino acid sequences. In this analysis, the v2+v3+HiSeq-total identified 811,933 genes, whereas the HiSeq and v2-total identified 733,705 and 422,174, respectively (Table 6). These results support the conclusion that longer reads enhance gene prediction possibly due to more efficient de novo assembly of contigs. Although the HiSeq has been reported to generate fewer errors, this advantage was apparently neutralized in our analysis by the longer reads produced by the MiSeq. In summary, our study demonstrates that WGS has multiple advantages compared with the 16S rRNA amplicon method including enhanced detection of bacterial species, increased detection of diversity and increased prediction of genes. In addition, increased length, either due to longer reads or the assembly of contigs, improved the accuracy of species detection.",
