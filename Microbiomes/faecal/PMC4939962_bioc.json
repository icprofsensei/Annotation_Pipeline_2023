However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking. Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the \u201chealthy\u201d microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial dysbiosis.

In particular, shotgun metagenomics provide data at unprecedented species- and strain- levels of resolution. Several large-scale metagenomic disease-associated datasets are also becoming available, and disease-predictive models built on metagenomic signatures have been proposed.

In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of microbiome-phenotype associations.

To this end, we used the RF classifier that implicitly embeds a feature selection step during the model generation phase (see Methods). Feature selection produced a slight improvement of the AUC in all the cases when the model was generated on a reduced set of species (Fig 3). The advantage of this procedure is twofold. In addition to the increased accuracy, it enables biomarker discovery by detecting the (few) species that are most useful to discriminate between \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cdiseased\u201d subjects. These most discriminative species may be prioritized when performing follow-up and validation analyses, and the reduced complexity of the model potentially enables additional evaluations on low-throughput assays. However, the best accuracies were obtained with still relatively high numbers of species, i.e., more than 60 (S2 Fig). This confirms the complexity of microbial ecosystems where the combination of few species is probably not sufficient to characterize the microbiome associated with complex diseases.",

Given their strain-specificity, adopting markers as features let us also test the hypothesis that complex diseases are associated with the presence of specific strains or subspecies rather than only species-level abundances. Consistent with this hypothesis, better predictions were obtained from markers (Fig 2) than species abundance, with differences that were statistically significant for one dataset (S1 Fig). This was obtained using SVM with linear kernel, which in this context is more practical to use than RF and SVM with more complex kernels due to the very high dimensionality (~100K features) of the data. Focusing on SVM, markers gave statistically significant improvements with respect to species abundances in half of the datasets (S1 Fig). Moreover, RF in combination with feature selection (RF-FS:Emb) achieved satisfactory classification results, i.e., average accuracies were usually worse than SVM but with no statistically significant difference (S1 Fig) even using a very limited portion (<0.2%, S2 Fig) of the investigated markers. The biomarker discovery step here is of particular interest because it permits identification of a limited set of strain-specific markers potentially directly involved in the association with disease.",

The approach proposed here (RF with embedded feature selection) focuses on the set of features with the most discriminating power rather than on strictly statistical assessments [46] or statistical assessment coupled with effect size [47]. The implemented tool automatically plots the most relevant species (or markers) with the importance factor (see Methods) along with the average relative abundance (or average presence) associated with the different considered classes. We observed a reasonable level of overlap between the detected species and markers, as the most discriminative markers tended to represent strains of the most discriminative species. Interestingly, for all the considered datasets (Fig 4 and S4 Fig) the importance factor attributed to each species (or marker) was not well correlated with its average relative abundance (or presence) in the samples (maximum correlation of 0.49 for the T2D dataset, S5 Fig). In several cases, we detected relevant species with partial prevalence but highly discriminative potential between \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cdiseased\u201d subjects. For example, Peptostreptococcus stomatis resulted the most discriminative species in the colorectal dataset with an average relative abundance in the samples less than 0.15%.",

Species belonging to Veillonella and Streptococcus are typical colonizers of the oral cavity, but they are often overgrown in the small intestine in patients affected by liver cirrhosis, thus suggesting the invasion of the gut from the mouth in these patients [33].

Also the H. parainfluenzae pathogen may arrive to the gut from the oral cavity [33].

We found some species that were distinctive of one disease only as it is the case for P. stomatis, P. micra and Gemella morbillorum in colorectal cancer, multiple Veillonella species in cirrhosis, and, partially, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lachnospiraceae in IBD. Interestingly, F. nucleatum was highly discriminant both in colorectal cancer and cirrhosis, suggesting the presence of a similar dysbiosis niche for this organism. Overall, the discriminative species for the two diabetes datasets and the obesity dataset had lower weights, consistent with the lower classification performances achieved with them. Moreover, the pattern of discriminative species for these two datasets clustered together (S6 Fig), suggesting similar dysbiotic configurations of the gut microbiome for obesity and type-2 diabetes. Some species were also found in the set of top discriminative features for all the studies, in particular S. salivarius, S. anginosus, V. parvula, Roseburia intestinalis, and Coprococcus comes. These species might thus be biomarkers of general dysbiosis or ecological community stress in non-healthy states, and should be recognized as such in future disease-microbiome association studies.",

High classification accuracy in body site prediction in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) dataset (AUC = 0.96), is consistent with previously reported large differences in the microbiome composition among different body areas [1], and provided validation of the proposed tool for multi-class classification problems (S8 Fig). The confusion matrix revealed moderate misclassification between nasal and skin body sites, which may be due to nasal samples being taken from the anterior nares (external part of the nostrils), and thus having relatively similar biochemical characteristics compared to skin samples from the retroauricular crease.",

The two datasets presented very different population characteristics as T2D targeted Chinese subjects while WT2D enrolled European women. Still, we observed generalization from one study to the other, (Fig 6), although cohort effects clearly affected the results. For validation on the T2D dataset, the AUC for RF on species abundance decreased from a cross-validation value of 0.744 (0.747 for marker presence) to 0.569 (0.566) when the model was constructed on the WT2D dataset. Similarly, for validation on the WT2D dataset, AUC decreased from a cross-validation value of 0.762 (0.739) to 0.664 (0.622). Different results were achieved by transferring the model to WT2D from the two different experimental stages of the T2D dataset.

This similarity was consistent with integrative correlation [50] between the feature relative importance scores obtained on the considered stage of T2D and those on WT2D (S2 Table).

While we included all the control groups as \u201chealthy\u201d, there is the potential for health problems among some control subjects. However, it is standard practice in case-control studies to exclude known disease conditions from control groups, so we can assume that, even in the worst case, just a few diseased patients may be included in the controls and these may be mostly due to undiagnosed cases. In this setting we tested the generalization of the model across cohorts (Fig 7A) by generating the models on all the available samples apart those associated with the dataset considered for testing, a \"leave-one-dataset-out\" cross-study validation [51] (denoted as lodoCSV in Fig 1). Interestingly, we obtained improved discrimination for T2D when control samples from multiple independent studies were added to training sets, with a high cross-validation AUC score in predicting type-2 diabetes on the entire set of samples (0.837/0.806 for species abundance and marker presence using RF, respectively). These values were in fact higher than the AUC obtained by merging all the T2D and WT2D samples into a single set and cross-validating them (0.743/0.736). This cross-validation accuracy was reduced when we tested the generalization of the model to the two T2D datasets (from 0.743/0.736 to 0.655/0.653 and 0.709/0.679 for T2D and WT2D, respectively), which confirmed a non-complete generalization of the model across cohorts. Interestingly, such values obtained by including healthy samples from other cohorts were again higher than for models constructed only on the T2D or WT2D datasets (Fig 6). Thus, including healthy samples from independent cohorts was effective at improving the detection of T2D status. Finally, we evaluated generalization on the healthy samples of the four other datasets (prediction assessed in terms of overall accuracy\u2013OA, right part of Fig 7A). In such cases we verified high accuracy (i.e., OA close to 1 for all the considered datasets), confirming correct prediction for most of the control samples. Addition of independent healthy samples to training sets was also performed for gender prediction (S7 Fig, part b), also resulting in increased accuracy, although the discrimination capabilities remained generally low. Overall, these results strongly suggest that the inclusion of samples of healthy individuals from unrelated cohorts is beneficial in disease-targeted investigations, especially when the prediction task has to be generalized to new cohorts.",

This approach overestimates accuracy metrics such as AUC because supervised feature selection is applied on the same data used to evaluate the model, a problem referred by the machine learning community as overfitting [52].

For this purpose, we considered all gut samples from the disease-associated datasets for a total of 903 samples (Fig 7B). Here the class \u201cdiseased\u201d included patients affected by the set of disparate diseases discussed above. The cross-validation analysis on the entire set of samples exhibited satisfactory results (AUC = 0.821 for the best model; most discriminative features are reported in S10 Fig, part a, although in this scenario the model may in reality classify each type of disease separately from the others. More interesting are the results of cross-study and cross-disease prediction. In such cases the disease associated with the testing cohort was not present in the datasets used to generate the model. Although the obtained AUC were lower than the disease-specific cross-validation results reported previously in Fig 3, we still verified in all cases a certain level of generalization of the model. In particular, the AUC varied between 0.628 (for T2D) and 0.872 (for cirrhosis). This represents an intriguing result that can be associated to the task of modelling the features of the \u201chealthy\u201d microbiome for use as a dysbiosis prediction model for syndromes where few or no training samples are available. As expected, several disease-specific species such as G. morbillorum, B. bifidum and P. micra were not among the most discriminative, the diseases with which they are correlated are not in the training set (S10 Fig, part b). Conversely, species discriminative for multiple diseases (S. salivarius, S. anginosus, V. parvula, R. intestinalis, and C. comes) are even more relevant here, confirming that these species are associated to a general non-healthy microbiome state rather than to specific host conditions (especially S. anginosus, which is the most relevant feature for four of the five testing datasets). Overall, this suggests that the dysbiosis-associated microbiome is partially distinct from the healthy microbiome regardless of the specific disease under investigation. This also confirms that study-specific confounding factors [44, 45] are only partially affecting the estimation of the classification performance. These species identified as associated to general microbiome dysbiosis should be considered in future microbiome studies as non-specific responses to dysbiosis rather than as organisms directly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease under study.",

We verified generalization across studies, although transferred models were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the inclusion of healthy (control) samples from independent cohorts in training sets was effective for improving the transferability of predictions. We emphasize that considering cross-study performance, instead of the more traditional cross-validation approach, is necessary to understanding prediction capabilities from metagenomic data [56]. Furthermore, avoiding overfitting is crucial for transferring models between different cohorts. Finally, we obtained promising results in the ambitious task of modelling the features of the \u201chealthy\u201d microbiome for use as a dysbiosis prediction model for syndromes where few or no training samples are available. Importantly, this setting is not affected by confounding factors on the target dataset since target samples are not used to build the model. The identified biomarkers for the \u201chealthy\u201d versus \u201cdysbiosis\u201d-associated microbiome are also very important for future microbiome studies of new diseases, because if the same biomarkers are appearing as discriminatory they should be regarded as general dysbiotic organisms rather than microbes directly in involved in the disease under investigation.",

First, we showed that improved performance can be achieved using strain-level genomic features (i.e., markers) that are not available from 16S rRNA studies. This is also a confirmation that many disease phenotypes are likely linked with microbial genes and factors that are not \u201ccore\u201d components of microbial species, but rather are encoded in variable genomic portions that are strain- or subspecies-specific. Second, despite the common potential biases in DNA extraction, shotgun sequencing is considered more consistent across studies than 16S rRNA sequencing for which different variable regions and primer choices are available [57\u201359], and thus quantitative microbial signature are inherently less difficult to transfer across cohorts and populations. From a more technical viewpoint, learning analysis in shotgun metagenomes presents distinct challenges due to the very high dimensionality of the dataset when considering strain-level markers (~100K features), requiring different considerations in machine learning than for 16S rRNA datasets. Altogether, we provide the first validated toolbox for disease prediction across studies using shotgun metagenomics.",

The analysis of cross-study predictions, and identification of a dysbiotic microbiome, would not be possible any other way.

Although they are intrinsically linear, they can be extended to the non-linear case by mapping data into a higher dimensional feature space by means of a kernel function. In this work, a radial basis function (RBF) kernel was considered for classifying species abundances, while a linear kernel was adopted for markers due to the sparsity of marker-based profiling. In both cases, the best regularization parameter C (both for linear and RBF kernel) and the width parameter \u03b3 (only for RBF kernel) were chosen in {2\u22125, 2\u22123, \u2026, 215} and {2\u221215, 2\u221213, \u2026, 23}, respectively, using a 5-fold stratified cross-validation approach. In cross-validation, samples are first randomly subdivided into k subsets (folds) of equal size. In particular, we use here stratified cross-validation, in which folds are made to preserve the percentage of samples of each class. A single subset is then used for the testing the model, and the remaining k\u22121 subsets are used for training. The whole process is repeated k times, with each of the k subsets used once as the testing set. Finally, the results on the k testing folds are averaged to produce a single accuracy evaluation. The parameters that maximize the accuracy (or another metric of choice) are finally chosen. SVMs are binary classifiers and, in this work, extension to multi-class classification problems was obtained through the one-against-one approach [63]. Moreover, class posterior probabilities of each sample were estimated from the predicted labels in the binary case using the Platt formulation [64], which, in the multi-class case, was extended as per [65].",

Although a better estimation of such parameters may be obtained through cross-validation, no significant variations were verified by empirical evaluation. We note that RFs can intrinsically deal with binary and multi-class classification problems and give estimation of class probabilities. Moreover, they implicitly provides a list of the features sorted in terms of relative importance. Feature importance was computed in our case using the strategy usually referred to as \u201cgini importance\u201d or \u201cmean decrease impurity\u201d [66]. These importance values were exploited to perform an embedded feature selection strategy (denoted as RF-FS:Emb) implemented as follows: i) RF was applied on the whole set of available features; ii) features were ranked in terms of importance; iii) RF was re-trained on the top k-th features, by varying k in the set {5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200}; iv) the number of features that maximized the accuracy was chosen as the optimal number; v) the final model was generated by training RF on this reduced set of features.",

These three metrics (which range in [0, 1], where 1 indicates the best case) can be computed for each class separately. For brevity, we report in the paper only the average values: after calculating the metrics for each class, their average values, weighted by the number of samples per class, are computed. For binary classification problems, class posterior probabilities were used to plot the ROC curve, which represents the true positive rate (i.e., the recall) against the false positive rate (i.e., the number of wrong positive samples divided by the total number of non-positive samples). From the ROC curve, we computed the widely-used AUC statistic, which can be interpreted as the probability that the classifier ranks a randomly chosen positive sample higher than a randomly chosen negative one, assuming that positive ranks higher than negative.

The WT2D focused on European women and included 53 T2D patients, 49 impaired glucose tolerance individuals and 43 normal glucose tolerance people [32].

Additionally, we removed reads with length less than 90 nucleotides. For the IBD and obesity datasets the minimum length was set to 70 and 75, respectively, as these cohorts were sequenced with shorter read-lengths. Few samples did not pass the minimum length requirement and were thus discarded.",

First, we did cross-validation studies, in which each dataset was analyzed independently from the others. Also in this case we considered only one sample per subject in order to avoid overestimation of the accuracies. For such reason, HMP and skin were reduced to 131 and 17 samples, respectively. Then, we performed a cross-study analysis on gut samples (thus the entire skin and part of the HMP datasets were excluded). In such case, we considered first all the available samples (for a total of 1016 samples) and then only the \u201chealthy\u201d samples (for a total of 642 samples). Then, the implemented tool was validated on a multi-class classification problem, which was represented by body site discrimination in the HMP dataset. The available samples were subdivided into five major body sites [1]: gastrointestinal tract, nasal cavity, oral cavity, skin, and urogenital tract.
