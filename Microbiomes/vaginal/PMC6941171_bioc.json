All the samples were multiplexed using barcodes, and 251 base paired-end reads were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform (San Diego, CA).19,20 FASTQ conversion of the raw data files was performed following demultiplexing. Quality assessment of the FASTQ files was performed using FASTQC, and then quality filtering was done using the FASTX toolkit.29,30 Since the overlap between fragments was approximately 245 bases, both paired reads were merged to generate a single high-quality read using the module \u201cfastq_-mergepairs\u201d of USEARCH (Drive 5). Read pairs with an overlap of less than 200 bases or with too many mismatches (> 20) in the overlapping region were discarded. Chimeric sequences were also filtered using the \u201cidentify_chimeric_seqs.py\u201d module of USEARCH.31 The resulting reads with an average base quality Q score of < 20 were discarded. The remainder of the steps (explained below) were performed with the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) suite, version 1.8 and an in-house developed wrapper for QIIME called QWRAP.21,29,32,33 Following the quality control filtering, we excluded any sample containing fewer than 10,000 passing reads.

The RDP classifier was trained using a version of the Greengenes (v13_8) 16S rRNA database modified to identify bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB).34\u201336 Details of our BVAB prediction model have been previously described in detail.28 The resulting OTU table included all OTUs, their taxonomic identification, and abundance information. To account for differences in read depth across different samples, the OTUs were rarified at a common sequence depth. OTUs whose average abundance was less than 0.05% were filtered out. OTUs were then grouped together to summarize taxon abundance at different hierarchical levels of classification (e.g., phylum, class, order, family, genus). These taxonomy tables were also used to generate bar charts of taxon abundance. Multiple sequence alignment of OTUs was performed with PyNAST.30 Alpha diversity (within sample diversity) was calculated using a variety of diversity metrics, including Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson, as implemented in QIIME.37 Beta diversity (between sample diversity) among different samples was measured using UniFrac analysis.32 Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was performed by QIIME to visualize the dissimilarity matrix (\u03b2-diversity) between all the samples, such that samples that are more similar are closer in space than samples that are more divergent.38 Differences between groups of samples at the taxa level were performed by grouping OTUs by phylum, class, order, family and genus, and then testing for differences in frequency by a group using QIIME\u2019s implantation of the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test.",

We found significant differences at all taxonomic levels regarding puerperal infection, as presented in Table 2. There was decreased relative taxonomic abundance (~66% less) of Proteobacteria phylum seen in the midtrimester cervicovaginal microbiome of women who ultimately developed a puerperal infection at term (FDR-corrected p < 0.01) (Fig. 3). This difference was driven by the reduction of three orders of Proteobacteria (Caulobacterales, Burkholderiales, and Rhizobiales) in the infection group relative to no-infection group (FDR-corrected Kruskal-Wallis p < 0.05) (Table 2 and Fig. 4). Looking at individual samples, these orders were completely absent in patients with puerperal infection as compared with those without puerperal infection (Fig. 3). Several families and genera from these three orders, including a genus from order Pseudomonales, were also significantly reduced in the infection group (FDR-corrected Kruskal-Wallis p < 0.05) (Table 2). In addition to changes in Proteobacteria, there was an approximately 0.6% absolute increase in Firmicutes in the infection group relative to the no-infection group (FDR-corrected Kruskal-Wallis p < 0.05). This mirrors, and may be due to, the reduction in Proteobacteria in the infection group.",

Based on this, it appears that assessment of the midtrimester microbiome may be able to identify unique microbial signatures for women at an increased risk for puerperal infection months later, even when limited to lower risk women without bacterial vaginosis. Obesity, in this cohort of patients without bacterial vaginosis, did not affect the midtrimester cervicovaginal microbiome and there was no interaction between obesity and microbiome with relation to puerperal infection.",

In fact, we noted a small increase in Lactobacillus that mirrored a lower abundance of three orders of Proteobacteria in the midtrimester cervicovaginal microbiome of women delivering at term who developed puerperal infections. Possible explanations for the differences seen in our analysis include analysis of a different clinical endpoint (puerperal infection) as well as analysis of only term births (as opposed to preterm births included in the above-mentioned studies). We did, however, show increased relative abundance of BVAB1 genera. While the abundance was not significantly increased to result in a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, it does support the argument that microbes involved in bacterial vaginosis are a risk factor for chorioamnionitis and endometritis.6,18,39 These microbial changes should thus be further investigated prospectively to discern if they can be used to predict women (term or preterm) that may be at an increased risk of puerperal infection.",

We recognize that the relatively small sample size necessitated by limited resources could be viewed as a limitation, but we did demonstrate small, but statistically significant differences in bacterial composition by puerperal infection. Another possible perceived limitation is the use of the V4 region for our 16S analysis. However, our group has published utilizing these methods, and justification for V4 usage is described in the Methods section above.19,21\u201327 Some region of 16S must be chosen unless whole genome sequencing is undertaken, and that latter approach is cost prohibitive for a large number of samples. Another potential limitation is the use of midtrimester cervicovaginal samples. While the stability of the microbiome in pregnancy has been described, it is possible that the midtrimester microbiome is not reflective of the cervicovaginal microbiome at term.13\u201316 In addition, the population studied in our analysis was Black women with normal flora delivering term gestations. We acknowledge that this is a select, low-risk population\u2013arguing to generalizability. However, the ability to identify these microbial differences in a low-risk population could result in an even greater ability to identify microbial aberrations in high-risk populations (including women with BV). Thus, our findings, if replicated in a variety of populations, may represent a potential biomarker to detect patients at risk of puerperal infections with delivery. Rapid and cheaper testing for these biomarkers in the midtrimester could be accomplished through rapid PCR-based tests in routine clinical-care settings. This may provide a way to screen and identify, patients who are at risk for developing puerperal infections. Furthermore, identification of such a biomarker could provide a target for treatment such as probiotic therapy.",
