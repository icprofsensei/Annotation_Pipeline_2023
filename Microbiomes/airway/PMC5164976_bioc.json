Both the normal and diseased lung are host to hundreds of bacterial genera, blurring the lines between \u201ccolonization\u201d and \u201cinfection\u201d. However whereas in health the respiratory microbiome is determined primarily by the dynamic balance of immigration and elimination, in chronic disease conditions become much more favorable for the reproduction of resident bacteria. Recent studies demonstrate that the microbiota of the COPD lung differ from the healthy lung although significant intra- and inter-subject heterogeneity are still present with variation impacted by factors such as disease stage and inhaled medications. Changes in the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa during COPD exacerbations have also been noted although further longitudinal analyses are needed to ascertain the malleability and resilience of this ecological system and its role in the occurrence and frequency of exacerbations. Whether patients with a \u201cfrequent exacerbator\u201d phenotype possess specific or greater alterations in their airway microbiome that predispose them to recurrent exacerbations as compared to non-frequent exacerbators needs to be determined. While recent data suggest that the presence of bacteria has the potential to influence the host immune response, a key challenge in the next few years will be to continue to move beyond descriptive studies to define the clinical relevance of differences in lung microbiota associated with COPD.",

This work used housekeeping genes, specifically the genes for the ribosomal RNA, to build bacterial phylogenies and demonstrate that Archaea were phylogenetically distinct from Bacteria (2-4). Norman Pace and colleagues subsequently built molecular tools for assessing the ecology of microorganisms (5, 6). Since these early initial studies, more than 100 bacterial phyla have been identified, most of which do not include culturable representatives (7). The majority of culture-independent techniques are based upon the PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. This gene possesses both regions that are highly conserved in all bacteria and nine variable regions that have varied throughout bacterial evolution and are therefore useful for taxonomic identification (8). The conserved sequence stretches within the 16S rRNA gene have allowed for the design of so-called \u201cuniversal\u201d primers with broad recognition of the 16S rRNA gene throughout the bacterial kingdom. Using these primers, pools of 16S rRNA amplicons can be generated from a mixed population of bacteria and the relative abundances of the individual bacteria within the population estimated based on the relative abundance of individual 16S rRNA sequences.",

T-RFLP involves amplification of 16S rRNA using a fluorescently labeled primer with subsequent digestion of the amplicons using a restriction enzyme, followed by separation of the digested fragments on a capillary DNA sequencer. Electropherograms showing the relative abundance of the terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) could then be created (10, 11). Changes in the community were detected by the loss or gain of TRFs from the profile. While various multi-dimensional statistics could be applied to these datasets, definitive taxonomic assignments of TRFs were usually not accurate, due to machine-to-machine variation. To obtain taxonomic identities of 16S sequence pools, it was necessary to construct libraries of 16S rRNA by cloning amplicons into a bacterial expression vector, growing the bacteria, selecting individual transformants, growing the clones to sufficient density to purify the plasmid containing the 16S gene and sequencing the insert using traditional Sanger sequencing. Sequences of the clones were compared using either classifier-based or operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-based algorithms, to existing taxonomic databases, e.g., the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). The construction and analysis of these clone libraries to study a bacterial community sample is a robust technique that offers almost full length 16S sequencing information, but suffers from the limitations of low throughput, high cost, and low depth of sampling (~96 isolates at a time).",

These machines are capable of throughput, in some cases, of billions of bases, addressing all of the limitations of previous methods. It also created a very particular market: the need for high-throughput, but with long reads. One of the earliest platforms to be adopted was the 454-pyrosequencing platform, which offered sequencing depths of 500,000 reads and read lengths of ~400 base-pairs. The longer reads assured that multiple variable regions could be sequenced at once. By sample barcoding, the addition of unique short (6-8) bp of DNA, multiple samples could be multiplexed for sequencing at an affordable price (12-14). However, sequencing technology has rapidly advanced with higher-throughput technologies that have increased their read-lengths, most notably platforms from Illumina\u00ae (e.g. MiSeq or HiSeq; Illumina Corporation, San Diego, CA). The MiSeq, with read depths of millions of reads, coupled with dual-indexing strategies (i.e. sample barcoding), has reduced the cost of 16S rRNA sequencing to the point where often times the most expensive steps are DNA extraction and analysis (15). Whether 3rd and 4th generation sequencing technologies now available might compete with MiSeq is unclear. The specialization of Pac Bio systems (Pacific Bioscenses\u2122, Menlo Park, CA) for very long reads might seem attractive for full length 16S rRNA analysis; however, the much higher cost-to-throughput ratio makes this technology substantially less attractive for this application. Ion Torrent (a 4th generation technology; ThermoFisher, Inc.) has been used for 16S analysis; however, the technology has been shown to be more error prone than light-based technologies (16). Oxford Nanopore's MinIon (also a 4th generation technology) may find a role in 16S analysis not simply because of the portable design of the sequencer, but also because of a unique technology that has the potential to allow the instrument to sequence only what the user desires from a pool of DNA sequences (17). Thus, this technology potentially eliminates the need for PCR amplification before sequencing.",

The advantages of this technique are that one: (a) does not need to rely solely on a single gene to identify what organisms are present; (b) can identify non-bacterial community members; (c) can gain an understanding of the genetic capacity of the community members. The disadvantages are that, in the case of low biomass samples like the lung, one wastes a lot of reads sequencing the host genome, and that one must either have an idea of what organisms are present or a very large genome databases to assemble the genomes against (such as MG-RAST (18)). Another recent solution, Metaphlan, aligns only the reads that align to clade-specific markers (contained in a marker database) to identify the organisms present (19).

Fortunately, many tools and pipelines have been developed over the past decade to address this need (20), which in part grew out of large research consortiums such as the NIH Human Microbiome Project. Although a detailed discussion of available tools is beyond the scope of this review, we highlight the following. First, most tools are freely available for public use including the popular sequence processing and analysis pipelines, QIIME and mothur (21, 22). Secondly, the same is true of methods to perform statistical analysis for associations between biological variables and sequence data (the latter organized, for example, into OTUs based on >97% homology of 16S rRNA sequences). Many such methods are integrated into QIIME and mothur, but can also be accessed through the open-source R statistical environment and various R analysis packages available through Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org). The latter allows the end-user to directly manipulate analysis parameters as desired. Finally, these and other tools are increasingly user-friendly for biologists and clinical scientists. However, consultation with bioinformaticists or statisticians well-versed in these tools is recommended because nuances of sequence data processing and analysis-related tuning parameters could significantly impact both the inputs and outputs of analyses.",

Unlike the GI tract where bacteria can number in the trillions, the lungs are a lower microbial biomass environment. Accordingly, special attention needs to be paid to the analysis methodologies for accurate results. This process begins with generation of the 16S rRNA amplicon library. The standard amplification protocols will often fail to amplify 16S efficiently when the level of bacterial DNA is extremely small and/or the level of non-bacterial DNA is log orders greater than the bacterial DNA. Solutions for this problem have included over-amplification (running PCR reaction for more than 40 cycles); nesting (using a pre-amplification step followed by standard amplification); and touchdown PCR (starting the reaction at temperatures that favor more stringent primer binding, and gradually lowering the temperature (for greater efficiency) as more amplicons are generated. Of these methods, the last is the least affected by PCR-induced bias and has been well published as effective (23, 24). A second challenge is that within the context of low biomass, DNA contamination from reagents can have a disproportionately large effect on the results (25). Because of this, extracting DNA from different sample groups using different kits or at different times can, just through the act of sequencing, introduce an inherent difference between the groups. When not carefully controlled for (by including multiple reagent controls, extraction controls, blanks, etc.), these biases present a fundamental flaw that can obfuscate primary study findings. However, while these concerns are particular to studies involving low biomass, they are tractable with some thought to the experimental design.",

Decades before the advent of 16S rRNA-based community sequencing, we knew that even in health, the lungs are subject to a constant immigration of pharyngeal and environmental bacteria.

This belief ignored the countless examples of dynamic communities in nature that are defined by a balance of immigration and elimination of community members, with little or no contribution from reproducing residents (31). A useful analogy is a tide pool: its community is determined exclusively by immigration and elimination from and to its source, the ocean. Few or no resident species can survive the starkly different conditions of high and low tide; thus little or no site-specific selective pressure on reproduction is present. Yet tide pools are by no means devoid of life, and the presence of common creatures in a tide pool and the ocean that fills it is not evidence of \u201ccontamination.\u201d",

Just as a tide pool is subject to constant immigration from the ocean, the lungs are subject to constant immigration from the oropharynx (32-34). Whether a bronchoscope is inserted via the mouth or the nose, lung microbial communities resemble those of the former and bear no resemblance to the latter, indirect empirical evidence against the influence of pharyngeal contamination on bronchoscopic specimens (24, 30). Ecological modeling has shown that there is little evidence of site-specific reproduction of community members in the healthy lung (35), consistent with a constant and taxonomically neutral immigration of oropharyngeal bacteria via subclinical microaspiration.",

Though in isolation, DNA-dependent techniques used in microbiome studies cannot determine the viability of detected bacteria, advanced culture techniques using a variety of growth media and environmental conditions have revealed that that the majority (61%) of bacteria detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can indeed be recovered by cultivation (35). Some spatial variation can be detected in lung microbiota when multiple sites are sampled within the same subject. Intra-subject variation is significantly less than that of inter-subject variation (33); the microbiota within a given healthy subject's right middle lobe more closely resembles that of her own left upper lobe than it does another subject's right middle lobe. The more similar a healthy subject's lung microbiota are to oral microbiota, the more robust the inflammatory signal detected in concurrently collected BAL fluid (34). Thus even in health, the lung microbiome is viable, host-specific, and certainly not invisible to the host.",

Whereas in health the respiratory microbiome is determined primarily by the dynamic balance of immigration and elimination, in chronic disease conditions become much more favorable for the reproduction of resident bacteria. Nutrient density, quite sparse in healthy airways and alveoli, becomes replete with the introduction of mucus and vascular leak (30). Key environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen tension and the local concentration of pathogen-favoring host stress molecules all change dramatically (36, 37). As opposed to the dynamic conditions of health, in illness the microbiome grows dominated by a select spectrum of familiar bacteria that are especially adapted to reproducing in the lower respiratory tract (27). In turn, shifts in community composition of the respiratory microbiome change the identity and activation state of host inflammatory cells and further change environmental growth conditions for bacteria. Thus, a cycle of dysbiosis and inflammation can perpetuate injury to the host. In chronic lung disease, alterations in the lung microbiome likely are both cause and effect.",

COPD is characterized by airflow obstruction that is not completely reversible (38), yet this disorder is also very heterogeneous with significant variation in disease presentation, rates of progression, histologic abnormality and exacerbation frequency (39). One mystery surrounding COPD is that frequently the inflammatory response persists despite smoking cessation, making bacteria a plausible explanation for the persistent inflammation. However at the same time, one of the enormous challenges to understanding the role of the microbiome in COPD is that COPD phenotypes and their associated endotypes are still not well defined and patient heterogeneity within and across studies of the COPD microbiome adds to the difficulty of deciphering this relationship.",

To provide some perspective, the original British hypothesis put forth chronic colonization of the lower respiratory tract with bacteria was the cause of chronic bronchitis (40, 41). However, by the mid 1970's this hypothesis had fallen out of favor as there appeared to be \u201cno support for a role of respiratory infections experienced in adult life in the progressive obstructive airway disease found in some patients...(42).\u201d However, by the early 21st century, there was mounting evidence that there are more culturable organisms present in stable COPD than healthy individuals (43), yet whether those bacteria play a causal role in the development of airflow obstruction still remains unclear.",

One of the earliest studies to examine the lung microbiome in COPD using 16S rRNA sequencing to identify the bacteria was by Hilty et al., published in 2010 (1). This analysis used bronchoscopically obtained airway brushings to compare the microbiota of five patients with COPD to eleven subjects with asthma and eight healthy controls. Pathogenic Proteobacteria, particularly Haemophilus were more frequent in asthmatics and COPD than controls. Conversely, Bacteroidetes, particularly Prevotella were less frequent in asthmatics and COPD. A subsequent study by Erb-Downward, et al. compared bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from a small cohort of healthy subjects, smokers without airflow obstruction and subjects with obstruction. These data demonstrated comparable concentrations of 16S rRNA genes across their groups, suggesting a similar range of bacterial burdens across groups but decreased diversity in individuals with the most severe airflow obstruction. Common genera among individuals with COPD included Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Prevotella and Haemophilus. Tissue brushings from several COPD explants were also examined revealing marked regional heterogeneity of lung microbiota within a given lung.",

However, this study demonstrated no significant difference in microbial diversity between COPD lung and controls, although the COPD lungs were considerably more diverse than patients with cystic fibrosis also included in this study. Although both the study by Erb-Downward et al. and Sze et al. focused on individuals with advanced, even end-stage COPD, a difference between these two studies is in the lung compartment examined. Sze et al. used bulk tissue including alveolar parenchyma, whereas Erb-Downward utilized airway brushes and BAL. In another small study of expectorated sputum, bronchial aspirate, BAL and bronchial mucosal biopsies in eight moderate to severe COPD patients, Cabrera-Rubio et al. demonstrated similar genera to prior studies including Streptococcus, Prevotella, Moraxella and Haemophilus although diversity by disease stage was not examined.",

In another study by Pragman et al., BAL specimens from 22 COPD patients and 10 controls demonstrated that the microbiota of BAL samples clustered by subject exposure to inhaled bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids (45). This study also found that older age as opposed to disease severity was associated with increased microbial diversity. In sum, these studies suggest the microbial communities of the COPD lung to be different from that of healthy lungs, although the microbial membership varies based on sample location and type. Other host factors including medications, age and disease severity also likely influence microbial community membership. Larger studies of patients with more detailed clinical and radiographic characterizations and longitudinal follow-up will be required to understand the relationship between the lung microbiome, disease phenotype and disease progression. A summary of studies using 16S-based sequencing methods to describe the microbiome in COPD can be found in Table 1.",

AECOPD are characterized by an increase in symptoms that deviate from normal day-to-day variation and warrant a change in usual treatment (46). They are also associated with worse health status, increased airway and systemic inflammation and more rapid lung function decline (47). It has been believed that bacteria are an important etiology of AECOPD based on the ability to culture bacteria during these events. These culture-based studies have focused on the role of single species with known respiratory pathogenic potential such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and in more severe COPD, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, many COPD patients during clinical stability exhibit evidence of chronic airway colonization by these and other species, suggesting a pathogenic role for bacteria in the exacerbated state may be more complex than simply presence of bacteria. This point also echoes decades-old but ongoing discussions about definitions of \u201cinfection\u201d, \u201ccolonization\u201d and \u201cpathogen\u201d (48). In fact, this has led to calls for updated conceptual frameworks about microbial pathogenesis that (1) focus on the outcomes of microbial-host interactions, which can be highly variable in terms of illness manifestations, and (2) accommodate new knowledge about microbiota and the role of commensal microbial communities in shaping these outcomes (49-51).",

An important and consistent observation across studies to date is significant heterogeneity between COPD patients in not only their baseline airway bacterial community composition but also the compositional changes that occur with AECOPD. For example, some individuals exhibit marked increases in the relative abundance of H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis at the onset of AECOPD, while others manifest more subtle changes (53, 54). These inter-patient differences mirror findings from studies in other obstructive airway diseases, like exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (57).",

This framework is useful for conceptualizing how new microbial exposures and shifts in the balance of microbial composition can impact interactions within the microbial community, as well as between the microbiota and host. For example, experimental rhinovirus infection of COPD patients resulted in increased airway bacterial burden, which correlated with increases in sputum neutrophil counts and neutrophil elastase levels (54). Expansion in Proteobacteria phylum members, predominantly H. influenzae-assigned taxa presumably pre-existing in the community, was seen after rhinovirus infection in some, but not all, COPD subjects. Studies have shown that new strains of pre-existing species play a role in AECOPD (58). However, these data suggest the additional possibility that bacteria involved in acute exacerbations could be pre-existing strains whose selective outgrowth is newly favored in a perturbed microbial ecosystem. More detailed genetic analysis of detected strains would be necessary to dissect this, which is not feasible to discern by 16S rRNA sequence-based methods alone.",

                    "text": "Longitudinal studies are clearly needed to better understand the dynamics of microbiota-host interactions in relation to AECOPD. In a study of twelve COPD subjects enrolled in a longitudinal study of AECOPD, Huang et al. analyzed temporally-collected sputum samples from before, at the onset of, and after exacerbation events (53). They demonstrated significant changes in the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa at the onset of AECOPD. Also, given findings from gut microbiome studies that specific organisms present in a niche can promote community enrichment for related species (termed the \u201clike will to like\u201d phenomenon) (59), the investigators additionally examined co-occurrence relationships between H. influenzae (as well as P. aeruginosa or M. catarrhalis) and all other identified sputum bacterial communities during exacerbations. Results of these analyses demonstrated significant positive correlations between the abundance of H. influenzae and many other phylogenetically-related bacteria, whereas negative relationships were seen with more distantly related bacteria (Figure 1). These observations suggest that similar \u201clike will to like\u201d phenomena occur in the airway microbiome. In other words, the intrusion-success of an extrinsic bacterial species or strain into an established ecosystem may be related to the abundance of closely related bacteria, already present in the ecosystem. It is important to recognize, however, that it is not possible using 16S rRNA-based techniques to discern differences in strains of bacterial species present in a sample, and therefore determine if they are newly introduced or pre-existing in the airway ecosystem. Further longitudinal analyses will help ascertain the malleability and resilience of this ecological system and its role in the occurrence and frequency of AECOPD amongst patients.",

Microbiome analysis of sputum samples collected after completion of treatment for AECOPD, in some cases several weeks to months later, revealed sustained microbial alterations after antibiotic and systemic steroid treatments (53). Interestingly, antibiotics appear to exert prolonged suppressive effects, while steroids result in increased relative abundance of many taxa, in particular members of the Proteobacteria phylum. One could speculate that the cumulative effects of AECOPD treatments on the airway microbiome could, over months to years, result in sustained alterations in airway microbial composition, phenotype and expressed functions that contribute to the severity or frequency of exacerbations in certain patients. The effects of long-term antibiotic administration such as azithromycin, which has been demonstrated to reduce COPD exacerbation frequency on the lung microbiome (60), are also unknown. It is unclear whether azithromycin's effect is due to anti-inflammatory properties, anti-microbial properties or both. A small study of five patients with moderate to severe asthma demonstrated that azithromycin therapy was associated with decreased bacterial richness and altered airway microbiota (61). Not surprisingly, Pseudomonas, Haemophilus and Staphylococcus (three pathogenic genera associated with airway disease) were all reduced. However, more data are needed to understand the impact of azithromycin on factors such as airway mucus secretion and neutrophil accumulation and whether these are due to direct anti-inflammatory effects or indirect antimicrobial effects.",

This analysis was performed on control and GOLD IV surgically resected lung explants. A decline in microbial diversity was associated with emphysematous destruction and remodeling of the bronchiolar and alveolar tissue by CD4+ T cells. These data support the hypothesis that the microbial diversity of the lungs decrease as the geographic diversity of the lungs decrease with advancing emphysema. They also demonstrated that both Proteobacteria and to a lesser extent the Actinobacteria increased in COPD compared to controls, whereas the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes decrease as the alveolar surface is being destroyed by emphysema in lungs affected by COPD. The gene expression data also demonstrated that specific genes are up- or down-regulated in association with changes in Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, suggesting a specific host immune response to the microorganisms present. These data suggest that the presence of bacteria has the potential to influence the host immune response and that this interplay may vary depending on the type of histologic abnormality present.",

In particular, since the seminal discovery that the community structure of the gut microbiome shapes host immunity systemically (62, 63), there has been considerable interest in developing animal models to test tenets of the hygiene hypothesis. Germ-free mice were shown to develop increased lung inflammation in the ovalbumin (OVA) model of allergic airway inflammation, relative to specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice (64). Differences were seen in lung eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and dendritic cells and were accompanied by increases in IgE and lung type 2 (T2) cytokines, but in this study, not in CD4+, CD25+, FOXP3+ T cells. Importantly, this susceptible phenotype could be reversed by co-housing germ-free mice with SPF mice. This study provided the initial evidence that the bacterial microbiome contributed to the regulation of T2 immunity, but left unanswered many questions about the responsible mechanism. Subsequent understanding has been gained rapidly, but to date, remains almost entirely related to allergic inflammation and the contribution of the gut microbiome. There is urgent need for animal studies relevant to COPD development in response to tobacco-smoke or biomass fuel exposures, as well as animal studies using culture-independent techniques to analyze manipulations of the lung microbiome in animal models.",

Much less is known about the collective functional potential of bacterial consortia, and more importantly, what functional components most influence disease pathogenesis or prognosis. In considering these issues, it is necessary to move past the single-species framework of conceptualizing the role of bacteria in complex inflammatory diseases, like COPD. Microbes do not exist in isolation but respond to cues in their environment. Through quorum-sensing mechanisms, bacteria also shape the behaviors and functions of their neighbors, as has been shown for interactions between Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (65). In writing about the role of microbiota in disease, Byrd and Segre recently emphasized that the \u201ccriteria for disease causation must take microbial interactions into account\u201d (51).",

Tools include shotgun DNA sequencing to perform pan-metagenomic studies or RNA-sequencing. However, the high ratio of human-to-microbial sequence reads generated by such studies, magnified in certain sample types like airway brushings or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, means that often deep sequencing (i.e. high number of total sequence reads) is needed to obtain a useful representation of microbial sequences for analysis. In the absence of direct methods to clearly separate bacterial cells from host cells, bioinformatic methods can be used that focus on non-human prokaryotic sequences reads such as the MG-RAST pipeline (18). Few studies to date have applied meta-genomics or meta-transcriptomics to study the respiratory microbiome (66-68), but this situation is likely to change.",

However, COPD is heterogeneous, and it is unclear if specific patterns of lung dysbiosis are more likely to be associated with particular phenotypes, such as patients with more airway disease versus emphysema. Moreover, two studies have now shown that treatment of exacerbations with antibiotics or steroids impact microbiota composition differently, and the effects may last beyond the treatment period (53, 56). These considerations also raise the question of whether patients with a \u201cfrequent exacerbator\u201d phenotype possess specific or greater alterations in their airway microbiome that predispose them to recurrent exacerbations, compared to non-frequent exacerbators.",

The reasons involve greater accessibility, relative to non-bacterial microbiota, to fairly well-established pipelines and databases for bacterial community profiling, preceded by decades of work in the environmental ecology field. There is increasing interest in identifying the spectrum of fungal microbiota present in the airways, but studies of fungi are, in general, more difficult. There is limited culture-based data on the types of fungi that might be important in COPD, as fungal culture methods in clinical microbiology laboratories are sub-optimal. More recently, various investigative groups with specific expertise in fungal sequencing have reported on the range of fungal species potentially harbored in the respiratory tract. In contrast to leveraging knowledge about the broadly conserved 16S rRNA gene to profile bacteria, a straightforward corollary does not exist in the fungal kingdom. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has been the most widely sequenced DNA region in molecular ecology studies of fungi, but there is selectivity in species detection depending on the region chosen (76). Moreover, reference databases for fungal sequences and genomes are not as mature, which can limit species identification.",

Given increasing evidence that the gut microbiome can shape manifestations of inflammatory airway diseases (either in animal models or in association studies of pediatric asthma and CF patients), it is possible that the gut-lung axis also plays a role in adults with COPD. However, studies are lacking in human adult patients. Moreover, COPD primarily affects older individuals, and aging is known to be associated with changes in gut microbiota and immune function (78). Therefore, studies of the gut microbiome in COPD patients seems particularly relevant and may reveal additional mechanisms that play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD.",
