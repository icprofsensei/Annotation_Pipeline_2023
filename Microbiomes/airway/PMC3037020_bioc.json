While the role of microbial infection in asthma pathogenesis remains unclear, studies to date have primarily applied culture-based or targeted molecular approaches to identify specific bacterial species of interest in the airways. However, recent developments in defining the human microbiome have demonstrated that the composition of bacterial communities colonizing mucosal surfaces, rather than simply the presence of individual species, can be important in defining states of health or disease 6\u201311.",

It provides an ideal tool to examine relationships between microbiota composition, including the presence and relative abundance of members of the \u2018rare biosphere\u201922, and clinical characteristics of disease.",

Bronchial airway samples from asthmatics possessed greater bacterial burden and diversity than healthy individuals.

On initial screening, 54 of 65 (83%) asthmatics and 8 of 10 (80%) controls exhibited a visible 16S rRNA PCR product. However, not all PCR-positive samples subsequently produced sufficient 16S rRNA amplicon for PhyloChip analysis. While very small amplicon concentrations may be hybridized to the array, in our experience, application of 250 ng provides good characterization of the respiratory microbiota8,19. A greater proportion of asthmatic (37/65, 56.9%) than healthy subjects (3/10, 30%) produced 250 ng of amplicon, although this difference was not significant (p = 0.17). To increase the number of samples for comparative analyses, we analyzed the community composition detected by PhyloChip in six paired samples using both 100 ng and 250 ng of amplicon. Finding no significant difference in the community composition detected in paired samples (pMRPP > 0.1), seven additional subjects (5 asthmatic, 2 healthy) were assayed by PhyloChip using 100 ng of amplicon.

This data also confirmed that samples with sufficient amplicon for array analysis had significantly greater 16S rRNA copy number compared with those unable to be analyzed by PhyloChip (p = 0.002). Therefore, gel-quantified 16S rRNA amplicon concentrations were used as a proxy for bacterial burden to examine potential relationships between airway bacterial burden and clinical variables.

As a form of validation, we compared the phylogenetic distribution of airway microbiota detected by the array with reference trees for airway bacteria reported in the Human Microbiome Project (http://www.hmpdacc.org/reference_genomes.php; accessed May 13, 2010)37 and observed good agreement in the types of bacteria reported by both (data not shown). Community richness across asthmatic samples was variable and ranged from 48 to 1,240 taxa. Of the five healthy subjects, three exhibited low community richness (200 to 253 taxa) while two demonstrated greater richness (844 and 1,121 taxa), suggesting that variability in airway microbiota composition was not exclusive to asthmatic patients.",

Multivariate analyses also showed no association between microbiota composition and spirometry measurements (FEV1 and FVC), sputum eosinophil or neutrophil percentage, history of exacerbations or systemic corticosteroid treatment within the previous two years. However, microbiota structure differed significantly based on asthmatic or healthy group assignment (pMRPP = 0.028), and NMDS analysis demonstrated that variability in airway microbiota composition was correlated with both the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness (methacholine PC20 concentrations; r = 0.56, p < 0.001; Figure 2A) and bacterial burden (r = \u22120.36, p = 0.015; Figure 2B).

After false discovery correction, ~100 taxa demonstrated a significant (p < 0.01, q \u2264 0.015) linear relationship between increasing relative abundance and greater bronchial hyperresponsiveness (Figure 3. See also Table E2 in the Online Repository). These taxa, primarily belonging to the Proteobacteria, represented 31 bacterial families such as the Comamonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Nitrosomonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, and Pseudomonadaceae, and included a number of potentially interesting organisms. While samples were collected in a manner to minimize oral secretion contamination (e.g. use of triple-lumen protected specimen brushes, sample collection early in the procedure preferentially from upper lobes), we recognized the potential for organisms associated with the oropharynx to reside in the lower airways. Thus we investigated whether these ~100 phylotypes have previously been identified in the oral cavity by interrogating both the extensive human oral microbiome sequence database38 and PUBMED, using species or genus names and the search terms \u201coral\u201d, \u201coropharynx\u201d \u201cmouth\u201d, or \u201ctongue\u201d.

To validate array-based findings, 16S rRNA clone libraries were constructed utilizing the same amplicon pool hybridized to the array for a subset of asthmatics (n=6). An average of 333 clones per sample were analyzed yielding ~2,000 non-chimeric sequences representing 197 taxa, the majority of which were present in more than one sample. The majority of bacterial sub-families identified by sequencing were also present in the corresponding array dataset, validating large numbers of array-based positive hits (Table II). Two sub-families (Fusobacteriaceae sub-family 3 and Prevotellaceae sub-family 1) were detected by sequencing only in two samples (one sub-family per sample). However, taxa within these sub-families were very close (pf =0.84 and 0.75, respectively) to the conservative arbitrary cut-off (pf \u2265 0.9) used to define array-based presence or absence15. Clone library analysis also indicated that two samples (AB01 and AB04) were each dominated by a specific bacterial family. The majority of sequences for sample AB01 were classified as Pasteurellaceae sub-family 1 [this sample also exhibited the lowest array-reported community richness (48 taxa)], while for subject AB04, a majority of the sequences belonged to the Cellulomonadaceae.",

This culture-independent study also expands the repertoire of organisms of potential relevance to asthma pathogenesis within this cohort beyond those previously implicated1,2. These data, together with recent studies in other asthmatic patients7, suggest that the microbiome of the airways, as with other discrete host niches, may be an important contributor to asthma pathophysiology and to the heterogeneity of disease39\u201341.",

The existence of a bronchial microbiota suggests that the bronchial tree is unlikely to be completely sterile, and that the composition of its microbiome may directly or indirectly modulate airway function. The role of airway microbiota in airway disease is under-investigated compared with other human niches such as the intestinal microbiota, which has a demonstrated role in chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases10, 42. That a bronchial epithelia-associated microbiota exists is not entirely unexpected, particularly in the setting of airway disease and/or inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. Specific bacterial communities persist in the airways despite antimicrobial treatment in patients with COPD and cystic fibrosis8,19. Recently, Hilty and colleagues also described airway microbiota in patients with mild to moderate asthma (all on ICS therapy), COPD, and healthy subjects7. Those with airway disease had an increased prevalence of pathogenic Proteobacteria compared to controls, although relationships to clinical measurements were not examined in their study.",

Moreover, the airway epithelium is increasingly recognized as important in immunologic responses to environmental and microbial exposures44. Thus, the airway microbiome could potentially influence presentations of asthma. As such, our findings of specific community relationships with bronchial hyperresponsiveness, in the context of a well-characterized asthmatic cohort receiving standardized baseline treatment, implicate additional bacterial groups in asthma. These include a Nitrosomonas spp. possessing a functional nitric oxide reductase45. Their relative abundance may be a microbial indicator of airway concentrations of nitric oxide which, though not assessed in this study, reflect airway inflammation46 and correlate with measures of airway hyperresponsiveness47. Also notable is Oxalobacter formigenes (Oxalobacteraceae), an anaerobic bacterium known to be susceptible to macrolide antibiotics48. Other bacteria of interest include the Comamonadaceae and Sphingomonadaceae. Members of the Comamonadaceae, previously identified in cystic fibrosis patients49, possess steroid-responsive degradation pathways50, 51, and their presence could plausibly be related to the selective pressure of ICS therapy. This raises the intriguing possibility that steroid non-responsiveness, as observed in some asthmatics despite adherence to therapy52, may be due in part to the presence of airway bacteria with steroid-degrading capacity.",

This possibility is supported by the finding of neutrophilia in bronchial airway samples of some patients with severe asthma despite regular use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids53. Such inflammation could represent an appropriate response by the host to inappropriate airway microbial colonization. For example, Sphingomonadaceae, members of which were significantly correlated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness, are characterized by the presence of cell membrane glycosphingolipids, which are recognized by and can activate invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells resulting in induction of IL-4 and IL-1354, 55. Glycolipid activation of iNKT cells can also induce airway hyperreactivity independent of conventional CD4+ T cells56. While the presence of iNKT cells in asthmatic airways remains controversial57, 58, our findings suggest a possible role for Sphingomonadaceae in airway pathophysiology and the possibility that the observed variability of iNKT cell populations in asthmatics may depend in part on the relative abundance of these species.",

Nonetheless, the data indicate that airway bacterial burden in individuals without airway disease is much lower than in asthma patients requiring ICS therapy. As all asthmatics were required to be on standardized ICS for the parent study23, we are unable to infer whether the higher bacterial burden among asthmatics is a function of the disease itself or ICS treatment, although the relationships of bacterial burden, and the composition and diversity of the microbiota, to bronchial hyperresponsiveness, are robust. Determining the effects of ICS use on the airway microbiome will require further investigation and is an important question, given the wide use of ICS therapies in airway diseases, which, among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, has been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia59.",

The PhyloChip platform permits in-depth analysis of relatively large numbers of samples using a standardized assay that applies several levels of stringent criteria for determining the microbiota profile in a given sample. It is impractical to perform sequence corroboration for every array-based positive hit. Moreover, the extent of microbial diversity detected is dependent on the community structure and the depth of sequencing performed60. Our study included the largest number of clones sequenced to date for asthmatic airway samples and confirmed the presence of many array-detected phylotypes, indicating that complex microbiota do exist in this niche.",
