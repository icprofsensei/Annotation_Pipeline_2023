The clamps were positioned in such a way that the inserted substrata would fit into the wells of the culture plate. Since the substrata were positioned vertically, bacterial attachment plays a key role in this model. By transferring the lid with the substrata to a new plate, the medium could be refreshed. In this study, standardized 12-mm hydroxyapatite (HA) disks (Himed, Old Bethpage, USA) were used as substratum. The assembled model was autoclaved at 121\u00a0\u00b0C.",

This could be explained by the selective inhibition properties of this oxygenating compound [7]. This is further supported by the observation that after AX treatment the relative abundance of genus Veillonella was significantly lower in the treated biofilm accompanied with the higher relative proportion of other genera mainly Streptococcus. Increase of streptococci on the other hand, is attributable to the proportionality of the data, because within 10\u00a0min, no absolute increase that would imply bacterial growth is possible. Therefore, the only explanation for this finding is that relative abundance of genus Streptococcus increases due to a decrease in other taxa such as Veillonella.",

Butyrate is mainly produced by proteolytic anaerobic bacteria [28, 29] and has been associated with the inflammation found in periodontal disease [30]. AX has the potential to contribute to the treatment of periodontal diseases by further reducing the concentration of acetic, propionic, and butyric acid and by increasing the lactic acid within the GCF. In this way, AX can contribute to the resilience of the subgingival microbiome towards disease. On the other hand, the possible consequences of the higher concentrations of lactate triggered by the AX-treatment need to be elucidated. When produced by probiotics, lactic acid has been described as a natural antimicrobial that is beneficial as an adjunctive to the treatment of periodontitis [31]. Although the results achieved here with AX are promising, in vivo studies are needed to assess this potentially beneficial effect on the non-surgical treatment or in the maintenance of periodontal diseases.",

It was observed that the composition of the water-treated control biofilms (PMA treated) was dominated by genera Streptococcus (62\u00a0%), Veillonella (35\u00a0%), and Prevotella (2\u00a0%). In the present study, we attempted to increase the diversity of the biofilms by using as inoculum source a mixture of saliva and dental plaque. Furthermore, we increased the incubation period to 24\u00a0h and the total incubation period to 96\u00a0h, providing time to the slow-growing bacteria to establish within the biofilms. Figure \u200bFigure22 illustrates the relative abundance of the biofilms per donor being the water-treated control biofilms dominated by genera Veillonella, Streptococcus, Megasphaera, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella with 4\u201320\u00a0% of the reads belonging to other genera.",

In particular, biofilms derived from donor 11 (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2)2) seemed not to be affected by any mouthwash agent as compared to the water treatment. Also where donor 10 had minor changes after PA and MD treatment, it seemed not to be affected by AX as compared to water treatment. Our results confirmed the variation among donors in in vitro biofilms and are in agreement with previous studies [12, 32\u201334]. Our study supports the notion that pooling samples and averaging the data can mask the individual variability of results of the treatment and the conclusions that are based on them [32, 33]. The differences observed between the biofilms and their inoculum source are in agreement with previous in vitro studies [34, 35].",

This could explain in part, why in a previous clinical study we observed different changes in bacterial composition after twice-daily exposures for a week to AX [7]. Oxygenating agents such as AX are on the market while scientific evidence for their use is underreported [4]. Therefore, we underline the need of long-term randomized controlled trials testing these compounds. Concerning \u201cadjunctive\u201d compounds for plaque and gingivitis control such as AX, the American Dental Association (ADA) requires an evaluation period of at least 4\u00a0weeks (ADA 1997, 2008) and for mouthwash products, an evaluation period of 6\u00a0months.",
