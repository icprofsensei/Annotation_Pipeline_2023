Bacteria secrete nanometer-sized extracellular vesicles (EVs), which may induce more immune dysfunction and inflammation than the bacteria themselves. We hypothesized that the microbiome of lung EVs might have distinct characteristics depending on the presence of COPD and smoking status. We analyzed and compared the microbiomes of 13 nonsmokers with normal spirometry, 13 smokers with normal spirometry (healthy smokers) and 13 patients with COPD by using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of surgical lung tissue and lung EVs. Subjects were matched for age and sex in all groups and for smoking levels in the COPD and healthy smoker groups. Each group included 12 men and 1 woman with the same mean age of 65.5 years. In all groups, EVs consistently showed more operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than lung tissue. In the healthy smoker and COPD groups, EVs had a higher Shannon index and a lower Simpson index than lung tissue and this trend was more prominent in the COPD group. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clusters based on sample type rather than participants' clinical characteristics. Stenotrophomonas, Propionibacterium and Alicyclobacillus were the most commonly found genera. Firmicutes were highly present in the EVs of the COPD group compared with other samples or groups. Our analysis of the lung microbiome revealed that the bacterial communities present in the EVs and in the COPD group possessed distinct characteristics with differences in the OTUs, diversity indexes and PCA clustering.",

Repeated airway infection and hypersecretion of mucus have traditionally been thought to be the main features of COPD. In addition, respiratory tract infection is an important cause of acute exacerbation and progression of this disease.6 Exposure to infectious insults can trigger an immune reaction in the airway.7 However, it is difficult to characterize the bacterial community by using conventional culturing methods. Historically, the healthy lung has been presumed to be sterile; however, new observations have challenged this dogma.8 Novel techniques in culture-independent microbial identification have enabled the detection of complex microbial communities and have led to an increased understanding of their roles in various diseases.9, 10, 11 Pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicons from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, bronchial brushings and lung tissues from healthy individuals has revealed that various microorganisms exist in the healthy lower respiratory tract.12, 13, 14, 15",

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center (IRB 2013-0700), and all participants provided informed consent. The subjects were divided into three groups: nonsmokers (n=13), healthy smokers (n=13) and COPD patients (n=13). The nonsmoker group included subjects with no history of smoking in their lifetime and normal lung function. The healthy smoker group included individuals who had normal lung function and a history of smoking of more than 10 pack-years, and who had quit smoking <3 months prior to operation. COPD was defined as a ratio of <0.7 between forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009s (FEV1) per forced vital capacity (FVC). The COPD group included individuals with the same smoking criteria as in the healthy smoker group. Nonsmokers, healthy smokers, and COPD patients were matched for age and sex. In addition, healthy smokers and COPD patients were matched for smoking intensity (pack-year). Sterile water served as the negative control. We analyzed the lung microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, from the lung tissue itself and from EVs derived from the lung tissue.",

The bacterial communities derived from EVs as well as bacteria in the lung tissues were investigated and characterized. Lung EVs had more OTUs than lung tissue in all of our study groups. In terms of biodiversity indices, the microbiome data from the lung tissue and the lung EVs had different patterns; the Shannon index decreased from nonsmokers to COPD patients in lung tissue; in contrast, the Shannon index increased in lung EVs. The differences between lung tissue and lung EVs were greatest in the COPD group. This trend of an increase and a decrease in the Shannon index for lung EVs and lung tissue, respectively, was opposite in the Simpson index. The gap in the index between lung tissue and lung EVs was still greatest in the COPD group. The type of specimen (lung tissue or lung EVs) used for the microbiome analyses had a greater effect on PCA proximity than the patient group. Firmicutes were more prevalent in the lung EVs of COPD patients. In our present study cohort, Stenotrophomonas, Propionibacterium, Alicyclobacillus, Methylobacterium and Dechloromonas were the most common genera.",

Increased levels of the Firmicutes phylum have previously been found in the lung tissue of COPD patients, a result attributable to an increase in the Lactobacillus genus24 and consistent with our current findings. The outgrowth of Firmicutes in COPD patients may be explained by differences in pH, oxygenation levels and the temperature of the lung environment. In COPD, increased esophageal reflux25 may result in microbial immigration from the gut.26, 27 Firmicutes may be more likely than other species to adapt to the lung environment.28 In addition, our current findings showed that the differences in species were more prominent in lung EVs. A previous report has suggested that EVs from Lactobacillus may ameliorate helper type-1-dominated inflammatory responses,29 but their role in COPD is still not well established. Another study on human macrophages has indicated that Lactobacillus may play an anti-inflammatory role in smoke-associated diseases.30",

However, its relative abundance did not differ among groups and was below 1% in patients with COPD. Our current analyses differed from that in the previous study in terms of the severity of the COPD as well as in ethnicity, age and environment. According to the Shannon and Simpson index results in this study, lung tissue from our patients with COPD showed lower diversity and higher prevalence of certain organisms within the bacterial community. This trend was consistent with a previous observation that a few dominant genera emerge in COPD.12 However, the opposite trend was found in lung EVs. This difference may have resulted from the relative increase in Firmicutes, and accordingly the relative decrease in Proteobacteria.",

One interesting finding was that lung EVs had more OTUs than the lung tissue itself, and some microorganisms were detected in EVs but not in the lung tissue. EVs can disseminate far from the direct site of bacterial colonization, into the urine, blood and several other organs.32 EVs have been shown to disrupt cell monolayers and to penetrate the epithelial cell layer.33 Therefore, the EVs that remain in vesicle form may originate from adjacent lobes or even from other organs. Another finding from our present study was that the sample type (lung tissue or EVs) had a greater effect on the bacterial community than the patient characteristics. This finding suggests that EVs have distinct characteristics from the lung tissue, some of which may originate from outside of the lung. EVs derived from bacteria have several functions: interbacterial communication, delivery of toxins, entry into cells, and activation of inflammation and innate immunity. Hence, we suggest that EVs are able to affect host cells and other bacteria even far from the colonized area. Recent reports have indicated that EVs as well as the microbiota play important roles in chronic inflammatory disease in the gut.34 COPD, a chronic airway inflammatory disease, may therefore be associated with dysbiosis of the bacterial community and EVs in the airway. Further study of lung-derived EVs may thus be a useful tool to explore the pathogenesis of COPD.",

First, among our current study groups, the baseline demographic factors such as sex and age as well as smoking intensities in healthy smokers and the COPD patients were matched to minimize a confounding effect that might affect the bacterial community. Only one nonsmoker used inhaled corticosteroids for asthma, and the others had no medication history. Because the number of patients who had taken medications was very small, the effects of medication on the lung microbiome were insignificant in this study. Second, contamination from the upper airway tract is an important issue in lung microbiome studies.36 To avoid this issue, we harvested lung tissue from surgical resections by using an aseptic technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the microbiome of lung tissues in chronic airway disease patients from an Asian population. Third, the bacterial growth conditions in the lower respiratory tract are not uniform; the type of lung segments used in a study can affect the composition of the microbiome.15 Lung tissue was harvested from the resected lobes for lung cancer, so we were unable to match the location of the tissue. Our specimens were located sufficiently far from the malignant lesions. Fourth, patients with very severe COPD were not able to be included in our series. Therefore, characterization according to COPD severity was not possible. Last, we used a cross-sectional design. As such, it remains unclear whether differences in the composition of the lung microbiome were a consequence of COPD or whether the changes in the lung microbiome composition resulted in the development of disease. Further animal studies or long-term clinical studies may help to elucidate this issue specifically. In addition, increasing the number of patients would make the results more convincing, but well-matched baseline characteristics and the use of surgical resection specimens still produced meaningful results.",
