Infected infants have high mortality rates, and survivors often suffer life-long neurological disorders. The causes of many NICU infections go undiagnosed, and there is debate as to the importance of inanimate hospital environments (IHEs) in the spread of infections. We used culture-independent next-generation sequencing to survey bacterial diversity in two San Diego NICUs and to track the sources of microbes in these environments. Thirty IHE samples were collected from two Level-Three NICU facilities. We extracted DNA from these samples and amplified the bacterial small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA gene sequence using \u2018universal\u2019 barcoded primers. The purified PCR products were pooled into a single reaction for pyrosequencing, and the data were analyzed using QIIME. On average, we detected 93+/\u221239 (mean +/\u2212 standard deviation) bacterial genera per sample in NICU IHEs. Many of the bacterial genera included known opportunistic pathogens, and many were skin-associated (e.g., Propionibacterium). In one NICU, we also detected fecal coliform bacteria (Enterobacteriales) in a high proportion of the surface samples. Comparison of these NICU-derived sequences to previously published high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon studies of other indoor environments (offices, restrooms and healthcare facilities), as well as human- and soil-associated environments, found the majority of the NICU samples to be similar to typical building surface and air samples, with the notable exception of the IHEs which were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae. Our findings provide evidence that NICU IHEs harbor a high diversity of human-associated bacteria and demonstrate the potential utility of molecular methods for identifying and tracking bacterial diversity in NICUs.",

Infants admitted to NICUs, especially ones who have undergone surgery or have congenital abnormalities, are also often at high risk for developing nosocomial infections [2], [3]. An analysis of ELBW infant registry data from 1993\u20132001 by Stoll et al. (2004) illustrated the problems of NICU-acquired infections. This study found high infection rates, high mortality rates, and significantly increased risks of developing severe neuro-developmental disorders among infection survivors [4]. Specifically, Stoll et al. found that 65% (3932/6093) of ELBW infants contracted at least one infection during hospitalization; 38% had sepsis; 27% died from a hospital infection; surviving infected ELBW infants were significantly more likely than surviving uninfected infants to have severe neuro-developmental disorders; and 25% of ELBW infants had clinical manifestations of bacterial infection but were negative for culture growth.",

The infectious bacteria may come from many different sources (e.g., individuals in the hospital, on surfaces, or on equipment), and even if it were possible to culture samples from all of these sources, culturing may still fail if growth conditions are not known, because a particular microbe grows very slowly (e.g., Mycobacteria), or samples were poorly handled.",

In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to investigate the diversity of bacteria found on inanimate hospital environments (IHEs; e.g., surfaces and equipment) in NICUs. While DNA sequencing methods cannot verify the current viability of particular microorganisms, they can determine the typical patterns and sources of surface microbial diversity. Although the importance of IHEs in spreading infections has been controversial [9], studies have shown that nosocomial pathogens can persist in a viable state for months on IHEs, and that contaminated rooms are a significant risk factor for infection [9], [10]. More recently, studies have shown that patients exposed to a contaminated environment are more likely to contract nosocomial pathogens [11], [12], [13], and that cleaning improvements can reduce infection rates of certain pathogens [14], [15], [16]. Our goal was to comprehensively characterize the microbial diversity of IHEs in NICUs, with a focus on commonly touched surfaces. We also compared our results to those of other indoor settings using similar molecular methods. Our results paint a broad picture of the source and extent of bacterial diversity on NICU IHEs.",

Surface types sampled within the NICUs were chosen based on advice from the NICU medical personnel. We focused our sampling efforts primarily on surfaces that were likely to be touched before handling an infant. We also included less frequently touched surfaces, such as the inside of incubators and sink counters away from handles. Environmental samples were obtained with dual tip sterile cotton swabs (BBL CultureSwab\u2122, catalog # 220135, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD). On flat surfaces (e.g., incubator plastic, counters and touch screens), approximately 12 cm2 of each surface was swabbed. Handles were swabbed in their entirety, and we swabbed a total of 9 keys on each of the keyboards and button pads. After sampling, the swab was immediately transported back to the lab on ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until DNA extraction.",

Barcoded PCR amplification was performed with the widely used 27F and 338R 16S rRNA \u201cuniversal\u201d bacterial primers. The primers flank the highly variable V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene sequence that is taxonomically informative across most of the bacteria. The barcodes allowed us to pool the PCR products from all samples into one 454 sequencing run. The forward primer constructs consist of a short adapter sequence necessary for the pyrosequencing reaction, the unique 12-base DNA \u201cbarcode\u201d encoded with Golay codes [17], and the universal primer sequence. PCR was carried out in a total reaction volume of 50 \u00b5l including 1 \u00b5l (approx. 10 ng \u00b5l\u22121) of sample DNA as template, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at 400 \u00b5M, 1.65 mM MgCl2, 5 \u00b5l 10\u00d7 buffer (10\u00d7 concentration: 500 mM 1 M KCl, 100 mM 1 M Tris HCl pH 8.4, 1% Triton-X), each primer at 1 \u00b5M, and 1 \u00b5l of REDTAQ\u2122 DNA polymerase (1 unit \u00b5l\u22121; Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO). Thirty cycles of PCR amplification were performed for the environmental swab samples.

All PCR cycles included an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, an annealing step at 55\u00b0C for 45 sec and an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 1.5 min.

Most of the NICU samples clustered with other indoor samples from office, healthcare centers and restrooms. However, PCoA showed that those nine NICU1 samples were clearly divergent from the rest of the samples (Figure 1, pink points). Many of the restroom surface samples (green points) were also quite different from indoor office surfaces (yellow) and air (indoor hospital air (red), outdoor hospital air (purple).",

Members of the Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., E. Coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Salmonella) commonly inhabit the digestive tract and can be found abundantly in feces. E. coli, Klebsiella and Enterobacter in particular are very well known hospital ICU pathogens that appear to spread and proliferate quite easily in hospitals [32], and many of whom appear to be developing multi-drug resistance [34], [35]. Another very consistent finding was the high proportion of bacterial genera associated with human skin, particularly Propionibacterium, which was one of the most common in both NICUs. We also found considerable proportions of Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus, all of which are very common on hand surfaces [17].",

(2011), some restroom samples were either dominated by gut- (fecal), vagina- and soil-associated bacteria, while others were dominated by skin-associated bacteria. The majority of the office surfaces contained both skin and soil-associated bacteria [20] and clustered with the frequently hand-touched restroom surfaces (e.g., door and handle surfaces; Figure 1). SourceTracker shows the source of NICU surface microbes is often human skin to the exclusion of the other sources that were investigated here (Figure 2). Interestingly, we noticed that NICU1 surfaces seem to resemble human skin far more than NICU2 surfaces. We suspect that this might result from more recent cleaning of NICU2, but unfortunately we do not know when each room was last cleaned. These findings lend considerable weight to the notion that human hands are important vectors for transmitting bacteria in NICU facilities.",
