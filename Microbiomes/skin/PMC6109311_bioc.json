The first line of defense against inhaled environmental insults, including tobacco smoke and infection, is the respiratory epithelium. Until recently, healthy lungs were regarded as essentially sterile; however, studies now illustrate the presence of a lung microbiota [4], the community of microscopic organisms living within the host lung, which is altered in respiratory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis [5]. Disruption of the epithelium by tobacco smoke can be a primary cause of inflammatory pathology, which is seen in both COPD and lung cancer. Dysbiosis has been observed in both humans and model systems of COPD and cystic fibrosis [6, 7]. In COPD patients and in vitro, cigarette smoke has been shown to reduce epithelial integrity and cell\u2013cell contact, which can increase susceptibility to respiratory pathogens or other environmental pollutants [8]. Disturbances in the microbiome, from cigarette smoke, epithelial damage, or gene mutations, can allow pathogenic species to dominate the community or increase virulence of other normally commensal microbes. Evidence of this has been demonstrated in patients with cystic fibrosis who have more virulent forms of P. aeruginosa [9]. These inflammatory associated events have been proposed to lead to an increased risk or progression of diseases, including lung cancer.",

Recent microbiome studies in colon cancer have demonstrated a contribution of bacteria to carcinogenesis. Specifically, F. nucleatum, a bacterium commonly isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, may be a risk factor for colon cancer [11, 12]. The more virulent strains of F. nucleatum affect colon cancer progression in animal models and increase tumor multiplicity [13] by various mechanisms including favoring the infiltration of tumor-promoting myeloid cells to create a pro-inflammatory environment [14]. Colorectal carcinomas associated with high abundance of fecal F. nucleatum were found to have the highest number of somatic mutations, suggesting that these mutations create a pathogen-friendly environment [15]. Similarly, B. fragilis can secrete endotoxins that cause DNA damage leading to mutations and colon cancer initiation [16]. Furthermore, the loss of the oncogenic protein p53 in enterocytes impairs the epithelial barrier and allows infiltration of bacteria resulting in inflammatory signaling (NF-\u03baB), which is required for tumor progression [17]. The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in lung cancer [18], with certain missense mutations showing gain of oncogenic function [19]; however, the relationship between TP53 and microbiota in lung cancer remains unknown. Herein, we hypothesize that somatic mutations together with environmental exposures are correlated with tissue-associated alterations in the microbial community of the lung, which may participate in lung carcinogenesis.",

In addition, we used the clinical information from these two sample populations to control for confounders in lung cancer risk and progression (age, gender, smoking, race, family and medical history, and co-morbidities), as well as factors that are known to alter the human microbiome (antibiotics and neoadjuvant therapy). Given the paucity of healthy lung tissue available for study, we utilized two separate tissue biorepositories. Non-cancerous lung tissue was obtained by lung biopsy from individuals with benign lung nodules without cancer or non-cancer lung from immediate autopsy [20], which was used as a referent control (Table\u00a01).",

To assess possible confounding with sequence quality, we conducted sequencing quality control analysis by Phred score and by sequencing run (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). In order to remove possible contaminants from our analysis, we first performed a threshold analysis similar to a previous study [21], wherein we plotted the mean percent abundance across experimental samples versus negative control samples and removed those that were\u2009\u2265\u20095% in both experimental and negative control samples (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S2). We next applied a statistical analysis wherein we used a systematic removal process of putative contaminants including Herbaspirillum, Halomonas, and Shewanella (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). At each stage of removal, we report the number of Mann\u2013Whitney p values <\u20090.05 comparing paired tumor normal samples showing the greatest rise the number of significant p-values with the removal top five contaminants (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). At each stage of removal, we report the number of Mann\u2013Whitney p values <\u20090.05 comparing paired tumor normal samples showing the greatest rise the number of significant p values with the removal top five contaminants (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). Additionally, we conducted hierarchal clustering of negative controls, non-tumor samples, and tumor samples independently in order to visualize and identify the strongest sources of contamination (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figures S2 and S3). The combination of these analyses resulted in initial removal of the genera Halomonas, Herbaspririllium, Shewanella, Propionibacterium, and Variovorax.",

Using the unmapped RNA-seq reads from these samples (N\u2009=\u20091112 and n\u2009=\u2009106 paired tumor/non-tumor), we analyzed with our metagenomics analysis pipeline. After removal of all human reads, we took the remaining non-human reads and used three separate tools, MetaPhlAn, Kraken, and PathoScope, to assign reads to taxonomy, including bacteria, virus, and fungi (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S2). Due to the highly curated database of PathoScope, we were able obtain to species and in some cases strain-level putative identification of RNA-seq reads. For this reason, and due to its rigorous validation in other studies [22], we used these data as our validation dataset. Unfortunately, given that all patients in this database had lung cancer, we could not validate our microbial findings in non-diseased lung tissue in the TCGA dataset. Given that this was one of the first times TCGA was used to completely profile the microbiota of lung cancer, we asked how similar the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and RNA-seq microbial communities were at the phylum and genus levels. Using an overall threshold of 0.01% of genus level abundance, we identified 236 overlapping genera out of 520 total genera in the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data and 609 total genera in the RNA-seq data (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S4).",

In order to identify the microbial changes associated with lung cancer, we first examined the ecological diversity within samples (alpha diversity) and between samples (beta diversity) of non-cancerous (immediate autopsy and hospital biopsy) tissues, non-tumor adjacent (NT) and tumor (T) tissues from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. At the phylum level, we observed increases in Proteobacteria (Kruskal\u2013Wallis p\u2009=\u00a00.0002) and decreases in Firmicutes (Kruskal\u2013Wallis p\u2009=\u00a00.04) in lung tissue hospital biopsies, as well as in tumor and associated non-tumor tissues from the NCI-MD study compared with non-cancer population control lung tissues, as has been seen in COPD [25] (Fig.\u00a01a). Further, we note higher Fusobacterium in ImA and HB controls as compared to cancer cases, though it is unclear what this finding indicates at the phylogenic level. We also observed a similar increase in Proteobacteria (Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u00a00.02) between non-tumor lung tissue and lung cancer in the TCGA study, indicating that this is recurrent phenomenon in lung cancer (Fig.\u00a01a). However, the lack of similarity between the NCI-MD and TCGA non-tumor samples may be attributed to the TCGA data being derived from multiple sample populations in the United States, differences in sample prep and in sequencing platforms, as illustrated by Meisel et al. [26].",

Specifically, Chao1 measurement demonstrated a significant increase in both tumor and non-tumor tissue richness as compared to immediate autopsy control tissue samples (Fig.\u00a01b). Similarly, using the Inverse Simpson index, which measures number (richness) and abundance (evenness) of species, we observed a significant increase in alpha diversity in both tumor and non-tumors as compared to hospital biopsy control tissues (Fig.\u00a01b), similar to studies of severe COPD [27], indicating that microbial diversity of lung cancer tissues is altered from its non-diseased state. When we examined tissue from cancer cases, alpha diversity was significantly different between tumor and non-tumors in the NCI-MD study and TCGA study, but results were not consistent between studies or diversity metrics (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S5). However, we did not see any significant changes in alpha diversity by smoking status (never, former, or current) nor correlation with time since quitting smoking (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S4), in cancer-free or lung cancer tissues as has been demonstrated in other lung microbiome studies [28, 29].",

Since we were comparing between studies and between types of sequencing (16S rRNA and RNA-seq), we used a method that could be commonly applied between studies, which excludes phylogeny (e.g. Bray Curtis). Within the NCI-MD study, we observed significant differences in beta diversity between all tissue types (PERMANOVA F\u2009=\u20092.90, p\u2009=\u00a00.001), tumor and non-tumor (PERMANOVA F\u2009=\u20092.94, p\u2009=\u00a00.001), and adenocarcinoma (AD) versus squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (PERMANOVA F\u2009=\u20092.27, p\u2009=\u00a00.005), with tumor vs. non-tumor having the largest among-group distance denoted by the higher F value (Fig.\u00a01c\u2013e). Similarly, we observed significant difference in beta diversity between tumor and non-tumor (PERMANOVA F\u2009=\u20093.63, p\u2009=\u00a00.001) and AD v SCC (PERMANOVA F\u2009=\u200927.19, p\u2009=\u00a00.001) (Fig.\u00a01f, g).

                    "text": "The two most common types of non-small cell lung cancer are SCC and AD, arising centrally from the cells lining the bronchi and from peripheral airways, respectively. Previous studies report that the microbial community differs between the bronchi and lower lungs in COPD [6]. This phenomenon of anatomic-specific microbial variation was also apparent in the abundance of genera between bronchial and SCC tumors from the upper lungs with higher abundance of Acidovorax in comparison to AD tumors (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S6). Further, the taxonomic distribution in AD tumors appears more similar to the taxonomic abundance in COPD, which is generally dominated by Pseudomonas [6]. Given this distinction, we controlled for this potential confounder of lung location in subsequent analyses. This led us to investigate the specific taxonomic pattern further and ask if there was a specific microbial consortia that is enriched in SCC or AD tumor tissue. In the NCI-MD study, we identified 32 genera that were differentially abundant in SCC (n\u2009=\u200947) versus AD (n\u2009=\u200967) tumors (Student\u2019s t-test; MW P\u2009<\u20090.05), nine of which were significant after multiple testing correction (FDR) (Acidovorax, Brevundimonas, Comamonas, Tepidimonas, Rhodoferax, Klebsiella, Leptothrix, Polaromonas, Anaerococcus) (Fig.\u00a02a). We also validated these same observations in the TCGA dataset (AD\u2009=\u2009485, SCC\u2009=\u2009489) (Mann\u2013Whitney FDR corrected p value<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a02b). To control for potential confounders of this association, including age, gender, race, smoking, anatomical location, and stage, we conducted adjusted logistic regression analysis in the NCI-MD study for each taxa separately and confirmed 6/9 of these genera were significantly associated with increased odds of being SCC as compared to AD lung cancer (Fig.\u00a02c, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Tables S5 and S7). Though we had reduced power, we asked whether the time since quitting smoking would change this association, and found that Acidovorax, Klebsiella, Tepidimonas, Rhodoferax, and Anaerococcus remained significant. When we examined the larger TCGA dataset, we also found significantly increased odds of being SCC as compared with AD among 4/9 (Acidovorax, Klebsiella, Rhodoferax, Anaerococcus) of the same genera in adjusted models (FDR corrected P\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a02d, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Tables S6 and S8). This association also remained significant after adjusting for pack years and time since quitting smoking. Together these data, validated in two separate cohorts, demonstrate that a specific community of taxa is more abundant in SCC as compared with AD lung cancer tissue, and are capable of distinguishing between AD and SCC tumors from individuals with similar exposure to cigarette smoke. However, whether this is a cause or consequence of the development of SCC cancer remains unknown.",

We stratified the tumor samples into never smokers (n\u2009=\u20097) or ever-smokers (current [n\u2009=\u200970] and former smokers [n\u2009=\u200940]) using linear discriminant analysis (LEfSe) to identify smoking-associated microbial biomarkers in SCC tumors. We identified six genera that were able to distinguish ever (former and current) versus non-smokers in our NCI-MD study (Acidovorax, Ruminococcus, Oscillospira, Duganella, Ensifer, Rhizobium) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S6C). Specifically, Acidovorax was more abundant in former and current smokers as compared with never smokers (Kruskal\u2013Wallis p value <\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a03a), with a similar trend observed in the TCGA dataset (nnever\u2009=\u2009120, nformer\u2009=\u2009551, ncurrent\u2009=\u2009217) (Kruskal\u2013Wallis p\u2009=\u20090.27; ANOVA p\u2009=\u20090.02). We did not, however, observe any correlation between Acidovorax abundance and smoking time cessation. Interestingly, the relative abundance of Acidovorax and Klebsiella were higher in former and current smokers when we stratified by histological subtype in both the NCI-MD and TCGA datasets (Fig.\u00a03b, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S7), indicating not only are there bacteria which have a higher relative abundance in tumors from individuals who smoke, but SCC tumors from smokers have even greater relative abundance of these bacteria. We also demonstrated the presence of this bacterium in lung tumors using FISH (Fig.\u00a03c, d, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S8, Additional\u00a0file\u00a02), and using PacBio sequencing, which identified the species as A. temperans (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S4). We did not find any significant associations between pack years or time since quitting smoking and the abundance of these taxa in either study among SCC tumors in either study.",

                    "text": "The most prevalent somatic mutation in SCC lung tumors is in the gene TP53 [31]. Previous studies demonstrate that mutations in TP53, specifically in colon cancer, lead to disruption of the epithelial barrier allowing the infiltration of tumor-foraging bacteria and resulting in disease progression [17]. Given that TP53 mutations are found in 75\u201380% of SCC tumors, we hypothesized that these SCC-associated taxa may be more abundant in tumors with TP53 mutations, owing to the loss of the epithelial barrier function in these tumors. To address this question, we investigated the association between TP53 mutations in both the NCI-MD (n\u2009=\u2009107) and TCGA (n\u2009=\u2009409) datasets using either TP53 specific sequencing (MiSeq) or the published TP53 mutation analysis data from TCGA [31]. We first analyzed all tumors in the NCI-MD study regardless of histology and identified a group of taxa that were more abundant in tumors with TP53 mutations (Fig.\u00a04a). To have greater power, we performed the same analysis in the TCGA dataset and observed a significant increase in these same taxa (MW FDR corrected P\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a04b). When analyzing only SCC tumors (n\u2009=\u200946), this signature became stronger in tumors with TP53 mutations in both datasets, specifically among the SCC-associated taxa previously identified (Fig.\u00a04c, d). In the NCI-MD study, we found that 5/9 of the genera (Acidovorax, Klebsiella, Rhodoferax, Comamonas, and Polarmonas) that differentiated SCC from AD were also more abundant in the tumors harboring TP53 mutations, though not statistically significant (Fig.\u00a04c). In the TCGA dataset, the fold change in all five SCC-associated genera were significantly higher in SCC tumors (n\u2009=\u2009177) with TP53 mutations (MW corrected FDR <\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a04d). Furthermore, using these same SCC-associated taxa we observed no pattern of association in AD tumors with TP53 mutations indicating this signature was specific to SCC with TP53 mutations (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figures S9A and S9B). Overall, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that mutations in TP53 are associated with the enrichment of a microbial consortia that are highly represented in SCC tumors.",

We demonstrate a gene-microbiome association in human lung cancer as well as histological evidence of a smoking-associated bacterium, Acidovorax. Herein, we identify a microbial consortia that is associated with a histological subtype of lung cancer, SCC, which is further enriched in tumors with mutations in TP53. Given the strong association between smoking and development of SCC, it follows that a subgroup of this SCC consortium would also be found in smoking-associated SCC. We validate this assumption finding Acidovorax spp. more abundant in SCC tumors harboring TP53 mutations and confirmed the presence of this genus histologically. These results suggest that smoking together with tumorigenesis may provide an environment conducive to the growth of Acidovorax spp. and similar species, which can flourish in nutrient-depleted environments, such as that of the lung. Collectively, these observations indicate that a state of dysbiosis exists in lung cancer. The hypothesis generated is that epithelial cells in the lung exposed to tobacco smoke and/or mutations in TP53 are invaded by species that take advantage of this new microenvironment, suggesting these bacteria could act as promoters in lung tumorigenesis.",

                    "text": "In support of the promoter hypothesis, it is plausible that smoking creates an environment that allows these bacteria to outcompete other species for resources and thus survival, which allows exposure to microbial factors enhancing tumorigenesis. Smoking is most strongly associated with the SCC histological subtype of lung cancer; however, whether smoking alters the lung tissue microbiome is still not well understood, especially in the context of disease. Multiple studies using various samples tissue and non-tissue types (e.g. oral and/or nasal swabs, bronchial lavage fluid, or lung tissue) have found inconsistent results in alpha diversity by smoking status. From our study, while we did not observe differences in alpha diversity, we observe a significant difference in the taxonomic consortia among smokers as compared to non-smokers, specifically in Acidovorax and Klebsiella spp. Similarly, oral and nasal microbial taxa differences have been observed between smokers and non-smokers [29, 33]. From a large study of the naso- and oropharynx, significant differences in specific microbial taxa were identified between smokers and non-smokers [34]. Additionally, in a study of non-malignant lung tissue (n\u2009=\u2009152), they observed a significant increase in alpha diversity with higher number of pack years of smoking [35]. While they identified Acidovorax, Anaerococcus, and Comamonas in smokers, these taxa did not differentiate smokers and non-smokers in a healthy population. However, in a recent study of non-malignant lung tissue, which compared tissue to isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) from tissues, the greater diversity was identified specifically in EVs, with a greater abundance of Acidovorax specifically found in the EVs of smokers, indicating a possible factor in differential findings observed among previous studies [36].",

                    "text": "These data indicate that smoking alone may be insufficient to alter the microbial population in a healthy population. However, smoking has been shown to suppress the immune system and induce epithelial barrier dysfunction [37]. Specifically, Acidovorax spp. have been identified in two common brands of cigarettes [38] and have the capacity to metabolize multiple organic pollutants like those found in cigarette smoke [39]. Therefore, degradation of tobacco smoke compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by Acidovorax spp., may promote survival of transformed cells and subsequently tumor promotion. These factors may allow taxa direct access to epithelial cells where microbial toxins or reactive oxygen/nitrogen from the aforementioned species to directly or indirectly encourage malignant transformation of the lung epithelium via DNA damage and mutations in TP53 [40\u201342]. Once the epithelial barrier defense is lost as a consequence of mutations in TP53 and malignant transformation, these species then may become tumor-foraging bacteria. In support, several bacterial species have been shown to modulate the tumor-suppressor p53 at both the protein and DNA level [43]. Specifically, the loss of p53 in enterocytes in murine models impairs the epithelial barrier and allows infiltration of bacteria resulting in NF-\u03baB signaling, which was required for tumor progression [17]. This evidence suggests that SCC tumors with TP53 mutations could have poor epithelial barrier function, thus allowing tumor foraging bacteria, such as those identified in our study, to become more abundant in tumors with TP53 mutations. The counterfactual is also possible. Similar to the B. fragilis toxin ETBF, which is genotoxic and initiates colon carcinogenesis in animal models [44], one or more of the tumor-associated species may induce TP53 mutations. Notably, individuals harboring mutations in TP53 with stage I SCC also have poorer prognosis [45], thus it will be important to determine if any of the species enriched in SCC are functionally related to reduced survival or simply biomarkers of a diminished mucosal barrier function. Whether any of these bacteria are promoting SCC tumorigenesis or inducing mutations in TP53 is currently under investigation.",

The number one risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco exposure and is a known factor in chronic lung inflammation. Tobacco and cigarette smoke contain bacterial products (i.e. LPS) that can cause inflammation, impaired barrier function, and potentially alter the microbiome to influence lung carcinogenesis [8, 46, 47]. Additionally, tobacco leaves harbor both mold and potentially pathogenic bacteria that can be transferred in a viable form into the respiratory tract on tobacco flakes inhaled in mainstream smoke [46, 47]. Further, biologically significant quantities of bacteria are microaspirated daily in healthy individuals [48] and thus is possible for these species to accumulate in a pathogen-friendly environment but may not ultimately contribute to tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, future studies should address this issue mechanistically.",

We have also been diligent in assessing the possibility of contaminating taxa being an artifact of sample collection or sample processing by extensive quality control analysis of sequencing, sequencing across two different platforms, and microscopy. Given the low biomass of these samples, however, we were not able to completely eliminate all contaminants and acknowledge that this may skew the results. While we were able to control for antibiotic exposure in the NCI-MD study, we acknowledge a limitation of the validation study is the inability to control for antibiotic exposure in the TCGA dataset and ImA controls, as well as, significant differences in clinical features between the cancer cases and controls, which could be confounders. However, in a recent study of the microbiome of endoscopic gastric biopsies, confirmation of multiple shared bacteria in clinical samples, specifically H. pylori, was demonstrated using the TCGA RNA-seq data with methods similar to those presented in our study [49].",

The response rate, however, is still not complete for these patients. Important insights into understanding the differential response rates of this new immunotherapy has suggested the composition of the lung microbiome before therapy as a key player in therapeutic effectiveness [51]. Given our results demonstrating alterations in the microbial composition in lung cancer that are histology and mutation specific, future studies should address whether the lung or nasal microbiome composition improves the stratification of patients who would be most responsive to immunotherapy. This suggestion is supported by recent animal studies demonstrating the contribution of the gut microbiome to the effectiveness of immunotherapy [52]. With these results, we foresee a new avenue for mechanistic studies to address the role of microbe-host relationship in lung cancer inflammation, response to therapy, and microbial engineering for drug delivery.",

                    "text": "Samples used for DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were obtained from the ongoing NCI-MD study (seven hospitals participating in the greater Baltimore, MD area recruited during 1999\u20132012), as described previously [53], from which 398 lung cancer cases were obtained, and included both tumor and non-tumor adjacent, with 121 matched pairs. The final sample set used for analysis after sequencing, which contained 106 matched pairs after quality control, is found in Table\u00a01. Lung tumors and paired non-tumor adjacent samples from the NCI-MD study were obtained at the time of surgery, from which a section of tumor and non-involved adjacent lung tissue from the same lung resection were flash frozen and stored at \u2212\u200980 \u00b0C, with an estimated time to cold ischemia of 66\u00a0min. At the time of study entry, a detailed patient interview was conducted to obtain basic clinical information in addition to previous cancers, neoadjuvant therapies, current medications, family history of cancer, smoking history, education level, and financial status. Staging was assigned using the Cancer Staging Manual of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition. Preoperative antibiotics were administered for those cases recruited after 2008 and any antibiotic oral medication use was controlled for as a covariate for all statistical analysis in model testing; however, these data were not available for immediate autopsy (ImA) non-cancer samples. Controls representing non-cancerous tissue were obtained from the Lung Cancer Biorepository Research Network (n\u2009=\u200916; hospital controls). Theses samples were obtained as frozen lung specimens from individuals who had a previous positive nodule identified by PET scan and subsequently underwent tissue biopsy, which was ruled benign. The average non-operative ischemia time was 34\u00a0min (16\u201370\u00a0min) for these samples. Clinical information included those listed above as well as smoking history, antibiotic usage (Y/N), and disease diagnosis. Two cases had emphysema at the time of biopsy and were not used in the analyses. Immediate autopsy (ImA) samples obtained from the University of Maryland (UMD) hospital, which is part of the NCI-MD study population (n\u2009=\u200941; population controls) (Table\u00a01). Lung tissue from ImA was received frozen from the UMD biorepository and served as the population controls for non-cancer lung tissue. Briefly, samples from ImA were obtained within minutes (<\u200930\u00a0min) after death and put on ice for <\u200930\u00a0min during dissection before cold ischemia at \u2212\u200980 \u00b0C. All ImA subjects underwent extensive autopsy and were determined to be cancer-free. Demographic information included age, gender, race, and cause of death only. Non-smokers in the NCI-MD study were categorized as having smoked <\u2009100 cigarettes or <\u20095 packs over a lifetime, whereas smokers were categorized as current smokers or formers smokers, who had quit for >\u20096\u00a0months. Sequences derived from RNA-seq of lung tumor (n\u2009=\u20091006) or non-tumor adjacent tissue (n\u2009=\u2009106) were obtained from TCGA (N\u2009=\u20091112) for validation of the NCI-MD study16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and results. Due to the fact that all RNA-seq data in TCGA were obtained using poly-A capture, any microbial data from this analysis will necessarily be biased. For this reason, we only used these data as validation of results first identified in our 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. Public data, including all clinical patient information (Table\u00a01), was downloaded from the Data Matrix on the TCGA website, https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov. The raw data in the form of BAM and FastQ files were download from a secure server at CGHUB and access was applied for and approved for raw data downloads by University of California Santa Cruz, https://cghub.ucsc.edu/.

Genomic DNA from frozen lung tissue was extracted after tissue homogenization in Yeast Cell Lysis Buffer (Epicenter) containing lysozyme (Epicenter) by bead beating (TissueLyser II) with proteinase k (Invitrogen). DNA was purified with the Life Technologies PureLink kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Invitrogen). A sterile water control (MoBio) was also processed along with all frozen tissue and used as background contamination control for DNA isolation, PCR, and sequencing. Background contamination controls for tissue collection, pathology, and sequencing were also collected through routine swabs after surgery and sequenced in conjunction with tissue samples. Specifically, the NCI-MD study tissues were isolated in a laminar flow hood to minimize contamination for downstream applications, using sterile forceps and gloves. Controls for contamination points during surgical tissue collection and pathological assessment included swabs from inside of the surgical tissue collection vessel before/after, pathology cutting board before/after, pathology knife blade before/after, gloves before/after, and pathology ink bottle rim and collection tube for freezing before/after (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03). Briefly, swabs were dipped in Yeast cell Lysis buffer and area/object swabbed, then the swab was broken off into tube and frozen at \u2212\u200980 \u00b0C. A negative control was also collected using 50\u00a0\u03bcL of MoBio PCR water as a mock sample (PCR_NC) and processed through DNA extraction with tissues to assess contamination from reagents, which was analyzed on three separate runs of MiSeq. The positive control was the High Even Mock Community (Broad Institute), which was also sequenced on three separate runs of MiSeq. The negative and positive control samples were spiked into four MiSeq runs at a similar concentration to that of the NCI-MD samples. To control for false grouping or batch affects, we randomized the tissue sample types (NT, T, and ImA) (with the exception of HB controls) across five separate sequencing runs of MiSeq (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04). The fifth plate consisted of duplicate samples and samples that had failed sequencing on previous runs of MiSeq.",

Reads containing more than five consecutive low-quality base calls (Phred < Q20), were truncated at the beginning of the low-quality region. Due to the low quality of the majority of R2 reads (Phred < Q20 and\u2009<\u2009150\u00a0bp length), we used the R1 reads only for this analysis. Passing sequences were required to have high-quality base calls (\u2265 Phred Q20) along a minimum of 75% of the read length to be included. The average Phred score per read was 34 with 88% of reads having a Phred score\u2009>\u200930 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Supplemental Methods, Figure S1, and Table S2). After primer removal, final sequences containing ambiguous bases (Ns) or lengths <\u2009150\u00a0bp were removed. High quality sequences were then screened for spurious PhiX contaminant using BLASTN with a word size of 16. Reads were then assessed for chimeras using USEARCH61 (de novo mode, 97% identity threshold for clustering). Non- chimeric sequences were screened for contaminant chloroplast and mitochondria using the RDP na\u00efve Bayesian classifier, as well as non-specific human genome contaminant using Bowtie2 against the UCSC hg19 reference sequence. Finally, sequences were evaluated for residual contaminants using BLASTN searches of the GreenGenes database (v13.5). Filtered reads included those not matching any reference with at least 70% identity along 60% of their length. Exploratory assessment using BLASTN searches against the NCBI NT database indicated the majority unknown contaminant reads were amplified human genome sequence. High-quality passing sequences were subsequently clustered into operational taxonomic units using the open-reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking methodology implemented within QIIME using default parameters and the GreenGenes database (99% OTUs) supplemented by reference sequences from the SILVA database (v111). Before downstream diversity analyses, the OTU table was rarefied to 5500 sequences per sample. Before diversity analysis, contaminants were removed and again OTUs table rarified to 5500 sequences per sample. Alpha diversity estimators and beta-diversity metrics were computed in QIIME with differential abundance analyses performed in R. In order to determine significant differences in beta diversity, we used the adonis function in the R package vegan to conduct PERMANOVA with Bray Curtis distance and 999 permutations in order to be able to compare across studies.
