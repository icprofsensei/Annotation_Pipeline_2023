For both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), the two main subtypes of IBD, recent studies using 16S ribosomal sequencing have shown disease associations with dysbiosis or abnormal compositions of the gut microbiota 4-8. Dysbiosis includes increases in bacterial numbers, decreased bacterial biodiversity, increased abundance of the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and a decreased abundance of Firmicutes 9-11. This dysbiosis is observed in colonic pinch biopsy samples as well as fecal samples 6,12. Characterization of the mucosal microbiota from pinch biopsies reflects the communities adhering to the intestinal epithelium, which is quite distinct from the luminal bacteria. Analyses of pinch biopsies enable investigation of the microbiota at different locations in the colon, which can also be directly compared with pathology samples in order to correlate disease activity with adherent bacterial communities in IBD. There are large differences in the microbiota between stool and mucosal biopsies 6,13,14 and differences in colonic pH may result in differences at various locations of the gut 6,15.",

Microbial function in communities can be assessed using shotgun metagenomics 13,16, but this approach is dependent on the isolation of sufficient quantities of bacterial DNA, which is not possible from colonic pinch biopsy samples. Recently, an approach was developed to investigate microbiota functional profiles by inferring the metagenome of the closest available whole genome sequences using 16S gene sequence profiles 6,17. While this approach has some limitations 18, it provides a way to detect changes to microbial function when the quantity of bacterial DNA is very limited (e.g. in pinch biopsies). Studies on microbial function in healthy individuals have shown that although bacterial communities vary considerably among individuals, overall microbial functions of these communities are largely conserved 13. However, in IBD, functional differences were more pronounced than taxonomic differences 6. While a few studies have now analyzed the changes in microbial function in IBD based on metagenomic sequencing 6,19, alterations in microbial function during different inflammation states of the sampled tissues has not been examined.",

At the phylum level, the relative abundance of the three most prevalent bacterial phyla of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria was slightly different between UC, CD, and healthy controls (Figure 1A). Samples from CD patients had a significantly higher proportion of Bacteroidetes compared to healthy controls (Figure 1B). Although UC and CD biopsies showed slightly decreased abundance of Firmicutes and slightly increased abundance of Proteobacteria, these differences were not statistically significant (Figure 1A and Figure S1).",

This was consistent with the principal component analysis (Figure 3B), which showed that normal and inflamed samples were mostly intermingled. Finally, when we conducted a supervised comparison of inflamed and non-inflamed samples by LEfSe analysis, a reduced significance threshold (LDA > 2.0) was required to identify an increased abundance for energy metabolism in inflamed tissue (Figure 3C). There was also an increased abundance for genes in the nervous system pathway, but this is difficult to interpret. There were no KEGG pathways that were underrepresented in inflamed CD samples. Amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism was unaltered (Figure 3D). Hence, metabolic pathways of the mucosal microbiota in CD do not vary as much as UC with inflammation state.",

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis showed that inflamed UC samples and CD samples clustered distinctly in two major branches (Figure 4A and S3). Some healthy samples clustered with UC samples and others with CD samples. The distinct separation of UC and CD inflamed samples was confirmed by PCoA plots where they clustered distinctly (Figure 4B), intermingled with samples from healthy subjects.

However, there was a tight correlation between Treg frequency and microbial lipid metabolism, and to a lesser extent carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (Figure 5C). These relationships between Treg frequency and microbial metabolism pathways were not significant for UC patients (data not shown). In contrast, UC patients had significantly fewer CD4+IL-22+ cells in inflamed biopsy samples (Figure 5D) and the frequency of these CD4+IL-22+ cells was significantly correlated with microbial metabolism pathways (Figure 5E). The relationship between CD4+IL-22+ cells microbial metabolism pathways was not observed for CD samples (data not shown). These results suggest that host-microbial interactions for UC and CD patients may be quite different and that the tissue microenvironment, as reflected by the types of effector CD4+ cells present, may influence the functional phenotype of the mucosal microbiota. Alternatively, metabolites produced by different microbial metabolic pathways may influence the homeostasis of CD4+Foxp3+ and CD4+IL-22+ cells differently for UC and CD patients.",

Alterations to the microbiome in IBD include decreased biodiversity, increased numbers of bacteria, and changes in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. 9-11. In this study on the mucosal microbiota, we found that only the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was significantly different from healthy controls and only in CD. Contrary to published data, we found no phylum-level significant differences in Firmicutes or Proteobacteria. However, there are many inconsistencies between studies. For example, no significant changes at the phylum level for Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, or Proteobacteria was found in pediatric IBD patients at the time of diagnosis, compared to healthy patients 31, which raises the possibility that microbial alterations could be a function of previous treatment or disease progression, rather than preceding disease. Since the microbiome profiles are influenced by age, medication history, smoking status, and BMI 6,32, we are still some distance away from unraveling these complex relationships in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases.",

The metabolic activities of the microbiota are reflected in the genes encoded into their genomes, which has previously required deep metagenomic sequencing in order to be analyzed. Deep metagenomic sequencing is not possible on biopsy specimens because the relative content of bacterial DNA to host DNA is extremely small. Recently, a method called PICRUSt that can infer the metagenome through using 16S sequence data to extract information from the closest available whole-genome sequences has been developed 17. Using PICRUSt, we investigated functional perturbations to the mucosal microbiota communities of IBD patients. Consistent with findings in other body tissues 13, we found that overall function was largely conserved across samples, even with widespread differences in bacteria composition. However, important differences exist between bacteria found adhered to inflamed tissue compared to non-inflamed tissue.",

This is somewhat contrary to a previous study that found CD to have larger functional perturbations with inflammation then UC 6. The fact that normal and inflamed tissue is more different in patients with UC than CD is consistent with the hypothesis that UC is a more regionalized disease whereas CD is a more systemic disease. This observation is also consistent with our previous results comparing the profiles of immune effector CD4+ T cells in normal and inflamed tissues between patients with UC and CD 28. CD4+ T cell frequencies in normal non-inflamed tissue for UC patients were also more similar to healthy controls than non-inflamed tissue from patients with CD 28. Since we also observed here that there are greater differences between the mucosal microbiota of inflamed CD samples with inflamed UC and healthy samples, then between inflamed and non-inflamed CD samples, there may be a more systemic perturbation of host-bacteria interactions in CD that is independent of the inflammation status of the mucosa.",

Intestinal bacteria compete for the limited supply of nutrients within the intestine, which should be reflected in genes that are encoded into their genomes and their relative abundance 33. Bacteria that are highly dependent on nutrients from the host environment may have a reduced genome lacking in genes for specific metabolic pathways. For example, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) that can promote differentiation of TH17 cells, lack genes involved in nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis 34. One hypothesis is that inflamed tissue provides less supply of carbohydrates and bacteria that are able to undergo amino acid and lipid metabolism dominate. Hence, in actively inflamed regions of the gut of a UC patient, perhaps nucleotides and carbohydrates might become more readily available, favoring the expansion of carbohydrate auxotrophic bacteria that maintain biosynthetic pathways for amino acids and lipids. Recently, butyrate-producing bacterial taxa were found to be reduced in ulcerative colitis patients, together with a reduction in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) 35.",

Alterations in microbial metabolic pathways could result in production of different metabolites, some of which (e.g. SCFA) have been shown to regulate intestinal Foxp3+ Treg populations in mice 27. Although there are few differences for microbial metabolic pathways between inflamed and non-inflamed regions of CD patients, there was a very strong association between the frequency of Foxp3+ Treg and microbial metabolism pathways. These observations suggest a link between bacterial metabolism and the intestinal homeostasis of Foxp3+ Tregs in CD patients.",

Alterations to the mucus layer may lead to breaches of the epithelial barrier by specific bacteria, resulting in immune responses that may result in chronic inflammation. Changes in the quantity and quality of this mucus layer will influence the constituency of attached microbial populations. Mucin production can be dysfunctional in IBD, and there is a particular paucity of mucin in UC 36. Since mucin is a significant source of carbohydrates for the commensal bacteria 33, mucosal microbiota in inflamed regions of the gut may shift toward bacteria that can metabolize lipids and amino acids for energy. Further support of this principle is that bacteria like Firmicutes 33 are unable to metabolize amino acids and are seen with decreased prevalence in IBD.",

We have now found by both flow cytometry analysis of effector T cells and by 16S sequencing of the mucosal microbiota that alterations to the intestinal mucosa in CD are largely colon-wide, and do not vary as much as UC with inflammation state. Together this is indicative of a more systemic perturbation of mucosal immunity in CD patients, compared to a more localized dysfunction in UC patients. Therapeutic strategies designed to improve host-bacteria interactions during IBD may have to be selective for UC and CD patients, since there is clearly a different interplay between mucosal immune responses and the gut microbiota of these two classes of IBD patients.",
