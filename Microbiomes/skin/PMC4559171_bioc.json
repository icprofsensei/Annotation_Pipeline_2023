Direct infection of the vessel wall, along with the cardiovascular risk factors, is hypothesized to play a key role in the atherogenesis by promoting an inflammatory response leading to endothelial dysfunction and generating a proatherogenic and prothrombotic environment ultimately leading to clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease, e.g., acute myocardial infarction or stroke. There are many reports of microbial DNA isolation and even a few studies of viable microbes isolated from human atherosclerotic vessels. However, high-resolution investigation of microbial infectious agents from human vessels that may contribute to atherosclerosis is very limited. In spite of the progress in recent sequencing technologies, analyzing host-associated metagenomes remain a challenge.",

(2) Presumed stabile atherosclerotic plaques obtained from autopsy from a control group of patients who all died from causes not related to cardiovascular disease. Our data provides evidence that suggest a wide range of microbial agents in atherosclerotic plaques, and an intriguing new observation that shows these microbiota displayed differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic plaques as judged from the taxonomic profiles in these two groups of patients. Additionally, functional annotations reveal significant differences in basic metabolic and disease pathway signatures between these groups.",

However, elevated circulating levels of inflammatory markers, e.g., high-sensitivity C-reactive proteins are also risk markers for atherosclerotic disease and increasing evidence indicates that infections and chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, are also linked with increased risk of atherosclerosis [1\u20133]. Indeed, direct microbial infection in the vessel wall can promote inflammatory responses and generation of a proatherogenic and prothrombotic environment, while secreted bacterial products, e.g., lipopolysaccharide and heat shock proteins, can also indirectly induce autoimmunity and other immunoinflammatory mechanisms that may contribute to the atherosclerotic process [1, 2].",

Indeed, previous studies have identified DNA from a broad variety of bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques [6]. Bacterial 16S rDNA signatures from environmental microorganisms and several nosocomial pathogens and viruses were recently found in atherosclerotic lesions of patients with coronary heart disease [7, 8]. As compared to asymptomatic stable plaques, culprit lesions associated with atherosclerotic disease manifestations, e.g., myocardial infarction or stroke, are associated with increased inflammation and thrombosis, but differences in bacterial profiles of unstable vs. stable atherosclerotic plaques have not been investigated.",

The traditional approach for identifying microbes from target sites such as culturing and 16S rRNA PCR sequencing are quite limited for characterization of numerous infectious agents [4, 6]. Recent progress in deep sequencing technology has provided another potential approach for high throughput and comparative analysis of the atherosclerosis-associated microbial agents. Also, metagenomics has the potential to characterize microbial communities in various sites of human body and give a deeper understanding of their impact on human physiology and diseases [9]. However, many challenges still remain in applying metagenomics analysis of atherosclerotic plaque samples. For example, atherosclerotic plaques contain large amounts of human genome DNA which can reduce the microbial genome DNA reads during sequencing. Similar considerations apply for analyses of target tissue samples from other host inflammation-associated diseases like periodontal diseases, non-healing ulcers, or traumatic wounds.",

The atherosclerotic microbial communities were analyzed by applying deep sequencing and a multistage approach using different methods to reduce human genomic reads and hereby achieve improved understanding of the bacterial communities potentially involved in human disease.

Additionally, the PCoA plot and UPGMA tree of the taxonomic profile (Fig.\u00a03) showed clustering among the unstable plaques and among the control samples, respectively, using species level data. Only three samples (233, 238, and P0613) remained separated, and it appears that the high diversity caused by the sequencing depth is a major contributor for separation of samples 233 and 238. For P0613, the species profile appeared very different from all other samples (Fig.\u00a01). We therefore omitted these three samples from the merged samples. Figure\u00a04 depicts a multiple comparison tree view at \u201cfamily\u201d level of NCBI taxonomy using the normalized total biome for the merged samples. The taxonomic profile in this tree view was consistent with results of comparisons between all samples (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Figure\u00a05 shows the 25 most abundant species in the total biome for merged samples (excluding 4 biased species, as mentioned earlier). Among the most prevalent species in case samples were Lactobacillus rhamnosus MTCC 5462, Neisseria polysaccharea ATCC 43768, H. pylori Hp P-4, and Acidovorax spp. CF316.",

However, evidence accumulated in the last 25\u00a0years suggests that infection can also play an important contributory role by direct and indirect mechanisms [1\u20133]. In the present study, we used deep sequencing and metagenomic analysis to provide a high-resolution investigation of microbial species in atherosclerotic plaques from stable asymptomatic lesions and unstable lesions removed at surgery. We provided details of a multi-step protocol to reduce human DNA reads in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the microbial community present in the diseased arterial wall. A similar protocol can be applied to any host-associated metagenomics study.",

However, these works were based on final point sampling of the symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques samples. The lack of asymptomatic atherosclerotic plaques samples limits our understanding of the roles of microbial agents for contributing to the development of the atherosclerotic diseases. Also, recent research has suggested that the contribution from an aggregate \u201cinfectious\u201d burden induced by a large number of pathogens is much more important for atherosclerosis development than any single organism [3, 10, 11].",

The asymptomatic atherosclerotic plaques have more abundance of host microbiome-associated microbial families such as Porphyromonadaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Micrococcaceae, and Streptococcaceae [12] than the symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques (Fig.\u00a01). This result suggests that these host microbiome-associated microbial families are one of the first colonizers of the arteries. These early colonizers might support the growth of sulfur-consuming families such as sulfur-oxidizing symbionts and Thiotrichaceae [13] and pathogens such as Helicobacteraceae and Neisseriaceae, which were found to be abundant in the symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques (Fig.\u00a01). It is well known that homocysteine, an intermediate in sulfur-containing amino acid methionine metabolism, is highly related to the vascular disease, and arteriosclerosis patients have elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood [14]. The elevated levels of homocysteine might facilitate the thrive of sulfur-consuming families. The presence of pathogens might enhance the degeneration of elastic fibers and fragmentation of the internal elastic membrane by their elastase activity. Further study is required to investigate the potential interactions of commensal and pathogen populations during the transition from asymptomatic atherosclerotic plaques to symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques.",

FISH observation validated the presence of biofilm-like structures of these pathogens in the symptomatic atherosclerotic plague samples (Fig.\u00a07). In addition, the presence of multiple pathogens in atherosclerotic plaques and their potential organization in biofilms may be part of the explanation underlying other pertinent findings in this area of research, e.g., absence of effect of antibiotic treatment on clinical endpoints in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease, and an apparent correlation between oral, gut, and atherosclerotic plaque microbiotas [5, 15, 16]. Indeed, a very recent study suggested the presence of P. aeruginosa biofilms within the plaque in patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease [5]. In our study, however, we found only a very low number of Pseudomonas reads in four symptomatic atherosclerotic plague samples (average 0.08\u00a0% reads of all assigned bacteria) out of 15 unstable plaque samples and in one asymptomatic atherosclerotic plague samples sample (0.048\u00a0% reads) among seven plaques, respectively. These differences in observation of Pseudomonas abundance between their study and our study might due to the fact that we used deep shotgun sequencing approach, which might have helped to obtain greater picture of the microbial community. More studies are clearly needed to determine the putative identity, organization, and role of bacteria detected in atherosclerotic plaques.",

However, these results should be viewed as preliminary and hypothesis-generating, and more research is required to provide more insights into atherosclerosis pathobiology. In addition to this context, it is worth to mention that currently, we are working on the next phase of this project using transcriptomics.

For such analysis, the MEGAN program matched each read to a KEGG orthology (KO) accession number, using the best hit to a reference sequence for which a KO accession number is known. The program reported the number of hits to each KEGG pathway. For such functional annotation using both SEED and KEGG, we first extracted all the reads that were mapped to bacteria in taxonomic annotations for all the datasets. Subsequently, we only processed these reads to obtain SEED and KEGG classifications to investigate metabolic or disease pathways of potential relevance to atherosclerosis",

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed according to a previously reported authoritative protocol [25]. Hybridization buffer was transferred onto the samples and followed by addition of individual gene probes (working solution 50\u00a0ng/uL). After applying FISH probes onto the tissue samples, slides were incubated in humidified environment at 46\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h to hybridize the probe into target DNA. Different compositions of washing buffer were prepared corresponding to individual formamide concentrations. Then, slides were washed with preheated washing buffer at 48\u00a0\u00b0C (water bath) for 20\u00a0min, followed by snap dip in cold H2O and air-dried. Signals for each probe were observed under LSM 780 confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with GASP array detector and two PMT detectors for fluorescence signal detections and combination with T-PMT detector for transmitted images using Plan-Apochromat 40\u00d7/1.3NA oil objectives. Auto-fluorescence signals were checked using CLSM to avoid the biomass auto-fluorescence and determined the specific emission spectrum of each FISH probes.",
