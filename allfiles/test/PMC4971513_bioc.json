The breast consists of epithelium, stroma and a mucosal immune system that make up a complex microenvironment. Growing awareness of the role of microbes in the microenvironment recently has led to a series of findings important for human health. The microbiome has been implicated in cancer development and progression at a variety of body sites including stomach, colon, liver, lung, and skin. In this study, we assessed breast tissue microbial signatures in intraoperatively obtained samples using 16S rDNA hypervariable tag sequencing. Our results indicate a distinct breast tissue microbiome that is different from the microbiota of breast skin tissue, breast skin swabs, and buccal swabs. Furthermore, we identify distinct microbial communities in breast tissues from women with cancer as compared to women with benign breast disease. Malignancy correlated with enrichment in taxa of lower abundance including the genera Fusobacterium, Atopobium, Gluconacetobacter, Hydrogenophaga and Lactobacillus. This work confirms the existence of a distinct breast microbiome and differences between the breast tissue microbiome in benign and malignant disease. These data provide a foundation for future investigation on the role of the breast microbiome in breast carcinogenesis and breast cancer prevention.",

While there are established risk factors for breast cancer, at least 70% of breast cancer cases occur in women of average risk, and current prediction models provide poor risk discrimination for individuals2,3. Mounting evidence suggests that shifts in microbial assemblages are linked to cancer development and aggressiveness while eradication of the causative organism or restoration of the normal microbiota may reverse this process4,5,6,7,8,9. Our group has recently identified immune effectors in breast lobules, with cytotoxic T lymphocytes and dendritic cells intimately associated with normal breast epithelium10. Since mucosal immune systems develop as a direct result of microbial exposure, the presence of immune effectors within the complex microenvironment of the breast is suggestive of a breast microbiome.",

The distinct nature of the microbiome of each body niche suggests a similar organ specificity to microbial effects on inflammation and carcinogenesis14. Work with 3,2\u2032-dimethyl- 4-aminobiphenyl hydrochloride (DMAB)-treated mice suggests a microbial role in breast tumorigenesis, but this has not been examined in humans15. More recently, 16S rDNA analysis has shown that milk samples from lactating women have diverse bacterial communities, but it is unknown whether these also are present in breast tissues16. Interestingly, the milk microbiome seems to recapitulate some risk features that are associated with breast cancer. For instance, the breast milk microbiome appears to differ from other human niches and a different, less diverse bacterial community has been observed in obese versus lean mothers17. Additionally, the gut microbiome influences estrogen metabolism via the enterohepatic circulation18,19. These data and the association of obesity, estrogen levels and inflammation with breast cancer risk provide a rationale for exploring a cancer-associated microbiome in breast tissue. Past studies have cultured bacteria from intraoperatively-obtained breast tissue, consistent with the presence of endogenous bacteria20,21. However, potential confounding factors, such as contamination from the skin, were not explored and genomic technology for testing was not available.",

Evaluating the taxonomic profiles of the breast and skin tissue microbiota at phylum, family, and genus levels shows similar abundances of major taxa between breast skin tissue and breast tissue (Fig. 2A, detail in Supplemental Fig. 2). Alpha diversity analysis reveals that the breast tissue is richer in bacterial species than the skin tissue (P\u2009<\u20091e-4, Fig. 2B), while the species evenness (Shannon Index) is similar between breast tissue and skin tissue (P\u2009=\u20090.38, Fig. 2C). The increased species richness of the breast tissue microbiota is illustrated by the heat map (Fig. 2D), where more OTUs (mostly of low abundance) are observed in breast tissue microbiota. Beta diversity analysis reveals a highly significant difference in community membership between the breast and skin tissue microbiota, as indicated by unweighted UniFrac analysis (MiRKAT P\u2009<\u20091e-4, Fig. 2E), but the difference is not significant in weighted analysis (MiRKAT P\u2009=\u20090.14, Fig. 2F), indicating that the major difference lies in the rare or less abundant lineages22. To address potential concern about differential sequencing depth between breast tissue and skin tissues accounting for the differences observed in diversity, we adjusted for sequence depth in the model, in addition to rarefaction. After adjusting for sequence depth, the statistical significance for both alpha and beta diversity analysis was unchanged (i.e., significant differences remained in both alpha and beta diversity; data not shown). Evaluating differential taxa based on permutation testing also identifies differential taxa of low abundance (unadjusted P\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig. 2G,H), consistent with the beta-diversity analysis findings. These differentially abundant taxa were from the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. The distinct nature of the microbiota of breast versus skin tissue is further supported by a significantly lower classification error of a microbiota-based predictor (P\u2009<\u20091e-10, Friedman test), where we built a predictive model based on random forests using genus-level relative abundances as input, compared to a predictor solely based on the majority class in the training set (Fig. 2I). The result further supports that the breast tissue microbiota is different from the skin tissue microbiota. Despite differences in microbiota between skin tissue and breast tissue, we did observe a trend of greater similarity, though not significant, in paired breast and skin tissues from the same subject as compared to breast and skin tissue microbiota from different subjects (P\u2009=\u20090.13, permutation test, Supplemental Fig. 3).",

The invasive cancers were stage I in 10 patients (67%) and stage II in 5 (33%); two of 15 patients (13%) had a positive lymph node. The invasive cancers were all estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, and a minority (29%) were HER-2neu positive. Tumors were histologic grade I in 43% and grade II in 57%. These samples were randomized into two sequencing batches with equal representation of each disease state. Alpha- and \u03b2-diversity analyses revealed batch effects (P\u2009<\u20090.05 for all diversity measures).

An overview of taxonomic profiles shows the overall microbiota of breast tissue between the two disease states appear similar, dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (Supplemental Fig. 4). Alpha diversity analysis shows no significant differences in observed OTU number nor in the Shannon index (Supplemental Fig. 5). However, beta diversity assessment with unweighted UniFrac distance (Fig. 3A) reveals the microbial community in breast tissue adjacent to invasive cancer is significantly different from that of women with benign disease (MiRKAT P\u2009=\u20090.009). However, the difference is not significant using the weighted UniFrac distance, indicating the major differences are mainly in rare and/or less abundant lineages. Utilizing a permutation test to assess differential taxa between the breast tissue microbiota in malignant and benign states demonstrates increased relative abundance in the following low-abundant genera in the breast tissue of women with invasive breast cancer: Fusobacterium, Atopobium, Hydrogenophaga, Gluconacetobacter and Lactobacillus (unadjusted P\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig. 3B and Supplemental Fig. 6). Barplots confirmed the differential abundances of the five differential genera between the two disease states (Fig. 3C\u2013G). PICRUSt analysis23 demonstrates differential KEGG pathways between the microbiota of benign and malignant states, with benign tissues showing increased cysteine and methionine metabolism, glycosyltransferases and fatty acid biosynthesis, whereas cancerous tissue microbiota showed reduced inositol phosphate metabolism (unadjusted P\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig. 3H).",

With this approach analyzing 33 samples, results were similar to the analysis of the 28 samples described above. Including the intermediate lesions, there were no observed differences in alpha diversity (P\u2009>\u20090.4). Similar to the N\u2009=\u200928 analysis, beta diversity analysis of the 33 samples showed significant differences in unweighted UniFrac analysis, indicating differences in rare and less abundant lineages. In addition, likely due to greater power from the slightly larger sample size, weighted UniFrac analysis also showed marginally significant differences. This suggests a potential widespread community change between benign and malignant breast tissues, although larger sample sizes are needed for confident characterization of critical differences in these tissues.",

The unique features of our study include (1) simultaneous collection of breast tissue, skin tissue and skin swab samples in the operating room under aseptic conditions and (2) comparison of the breast tissue microbiome in women with benign versus malignant disease. Our other key finding is that the background breast microbiome in women with malignant disease is notably different from the breast microbiome in women with benign disease. These data form the foundation for exploration of the core microbial community in breast tissue and microbial dysbiosis in association with health and disease including both cancer and infection. Dysbiosis of this intrinsic microbial community may contribute to cancer development and clinically apparent infection.",

Xuan et al. compared breast tumor and unspecified negative control breast tissue from 20 patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer24. One of the main confounding factors they discussed was the presence of potential contamination, which they were unable to address using retrospective collection of non-sterile formalin-fixed tissue. However, their results showed 1614 OTUs with 11 exhibiting differential abundance between tumor and normal tissue samples, with the predominant finding enrichment of Sphingomonas in normal tissue. The high number of OTUs they report possibly may be due to sample contamination. While this study assumes that contamination would be similar in the case and control samples, this study design makes it difficult to assess the true role of individual microbes in breast cancer. More recently Urbaniak et al. reported on 16S sequencing in unaffected breast tissue 5\u2009cm from tumors in patients with malignant and benign tumors and in women undergoing breast reduction25. Also sterilely collected, they identify 121 OTUs in the breast microbiome and compared the relative abundance of taxa between women from Canada versus Ireland. The most abundant phyla in that report were Proteobacteria followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in descending order, consistent with our own findings. The investigators were unable to culture some of the most abundant taxa they identified, raising the question of whether some of these microbes were introduced from contaminated DNA rather than being intrinsic to the tissue samples. Further, the most prominent finding was a geographical difference between Canadian and Irish breast tissue microbiomes (although this may be artifactual as the samples were processed in different laboratories using different protocols and reagents), and there was no subsequent examination of benign versus malignant disease.",

In both studies, the most commonly cultured organism was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and the most common anaerobe was Propionibacterium acnes, both predominantly skin bacteria that had potentially contaminated the surgical site. Indeed, this was the major weakness of these findings\u2014one which we now have addressed using skin tissue and swabs. In the current study, samples of skin tissue from the incision edge were also evaluated in order to determine if the findings in breast tissue might be attributable to the skin organisms.

Specific genus-level taxa that were significantly enriched in breast tissue from women with malignant disease include Fusobacterium, Atopobium, Gluconacterobacter, Hydrogenophaga and Lactobacillus. Fusobacterium has been reported in association with other epithelial malignancies including colon cancer and may act by secreting virulence factors as well as creating a pro-inflammatory environment that promotes carcinogenesis4,5,6,7,27. Therefore, we further investigated the functional role of these bacteria within these microenvironments. Using KEGG pathways as the basis for our analysis, we identified 6 differentially abundant pathways between benign and malignant disease states. In patients with malignant disease, pathways involving cysteine and methionine metabolism, glycosyltransferases, fatty acid biosynthesis and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism were depleted. Interestingly, methionine dependence is a general metabolic derangement across multiple cancers and it is postulated that depleting methionine might reverse cancer progression, either using methioninase or a methionine-restricted diet28,29.",

Possible routes of bacterial access to breast tissue include passage from the skin via the nipple-areolar orifices, nipple-oral contact via lactation or sexual contact and bacterial translocation from the gut. Data supporting the first two hypotheses stems mainly from observations showing that the microbial composition of human breast milk in healthy lactating women contains many of the same bacteria found commonly in skin16 and shifts from a skin flora-dominant pattern in colostrum to an oral cavity-dominant pattern after 6 months of lactation17. In support of bacterial translocation from the gut, studies have shown that orally administered probiotics are recovered in the milk and treat the clinical infection lactational mastitis with better efficacy than orally administered antibiotics30. Further, in a clinical trial of orally administered Lactobacillus salivarius in late pregnancy, the rate and severity of lactational mastitis was significantly decreased31. Taken together, these studies demonstrate potential translocation of beneficial microbes from the gastrointestinal tract to the breast, although an alternative explanation of the protection from mastitis might be homing to the breast of anti-microbe B cells made in the gut. Additional indirect evidence of the possibility of gut to breast translocation comes from mouse studies showing increased rates of mammary gland carcinogenesis with enteral administration of certain pathogenic bacteria that appear to act in an immune cell-dependent fashion, although no data yet exists on the breast tissue microbiome in those experiments32. Future work to examine the relationship of multiple microbiome sites including gut, oral, skin and breast may help resolve some of these questions.",

Although we were able to detect an overall microbiota difference between tissue types and between disease states based on the MiRKAT test, the study was underpowered to identify specific differential taxa/KEGG pathways if a multiple testing correction procedure such as false discovery rate control is applied. Thus, in differential abundance analysis for both taxa and function data, we did not perform multiple testing correction in order to increase the power to identify true positives at the cost of a greater likelihood of false positives. A future study with a larger sample size is needed to identify with confidence a microbial signature for malignant breast tissue. The patients in this study with malignant disease all had estrogen receptor-positive tumors, as do 85% of breast cancer patients, but a different microbial signature may be present in the breast tissues of women with other biologic subtypes of breast cancer. To address the potential for contamination we did run negative controls as detailed in the methods. The significant differences that we identified in the microbial communities among breast tissue, skin tissue, skin swab and buccal swab samples suggest that contamination in collection, storage or processing does not account for the breast microbiome.",

In the operating room, once the targeted lesion was excised and margins were confirmed negative by intraoperative pathology assessment, and prior to wound closure, the surgeon obtained a skin swab from adjacent to the incision site (20 strokes with a sterile Dacron swab), a full thickness skin sample (2\u2009mm by 20\u2009mm or equivalent) excised from the edge of the skin incision and harvested one cubic centimeter of normal adjacent breast tissue from the margin of the lumpectomy cavity.

Two \u03b1-diversity metrics were used, the observed OTU number and the Shannon index. The observed OTU number reflects species richness, whereas the Shannon index places more weight on species evenness. \u03b2-diversity, by contrast, indicates the shared diversity between bacterial populations in terms of ecological distance; different distance metrics provide distinctive views of community structure. Two \u03b2-diversity measures, unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances, were calculated using the OTU table and a phylogenetic tree (with the \u201cGUniFrac\u201d function in the R package GUniFrac)22. The unweighted UniFrac reflects differences in community membership (i.e., the presence or absence of an OTU), whereas the weighted UniFrac mainly captures differences in abundance. To reduce the potential confounding effect due to uneven sampling, we rarefied the OTU table to a sequencing depth of 20,000 per sample for both diversity analyses. To assess the association with \u03b1-diversity, we fitted a linear regression model to the \u03b1-diversity metrics after rarefaction, adjusting for technical covariates such as sequencing batch if necessary. A Wald test was used to determine significance. To assess the association between with \u03b2-diversity measures, we used the recently proposed MiRKAT37, which is a kernel-based association test based on ecological distance matrices. MiRKAT also allows easy adjustment of covariates such as sequencing batch. To further address the potential concern about differential sequencing depth between groups (Supplemental Fig. 7), we adjusted the sequence depth in the model, in addition to rarefaction. Ordination plots were generated using principal coordinate analysis as implemented in R (\u201ccmdscale\u201d function in the R \u2018vegan\u2019 package).",
