However, despite the cost and throughput advances associated with massively parallel sequencing, it remains challenging to reliably detect mutations that are present at a low relative abundance in a given DNA sample. Here we describe smMIP, an assay that combines single molecule tagging with multiplex targeted capture to enable practical and highly sensitive detection of low-frequency or subclonal variation. To demonstrate the potential of the method, we simultaneously resequenced 33 clinically informative cancer genes in eight cell line and 45 clinical cancer samples. Single molecule tagging facilitated extremely accurate consensus calling, with an estimated per-base error rate of 8.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 in cell lines and 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 in clinical specimens. False-positive mutations in the single molecule consensus base-calls exhibited patterns predominantly consistent with DNA damage, including 8-oxo-guanine and spontaneous deamination of cytosine. Based on mixing experiments with cell line samples, sensitivity for mutations above 1% frequency was 83% with no false positives. At clinically informative sites, we identified seven low-frequency point mutations (0.2%\u20134.7%), including BRAF p.V600E (melanoma, 0.2% alternate allele frequency), KRAS p.G12V (lung, 0.6%), JAK2 p.V617F (melanoma, colon, two lung, 0.3%\u20131.4%), and NRAS p.Q61R (colon, 4.7%). We anticipate that smMIP will be broadly adoptable as a practical and effective method for accurately detecting low-frequency mutations in both research and clinical settings.",

In multicellular organisms, both germline variation and somatic mutation can lead to phenotypic differences. In humans, somatic mutation in particular can lead to benign phenotypic variation as well as to a variety of clinically important conditions, including all types of cancer. In a given tissue sample, clinically informative mutations may be present at a low frequency because of non-neoplastic cell admixture or tumor heterogeneity (Navin et al. 2011; Carter et al. 2012; Gerlinger et al. 2012; Nik-Zainal et al. 2012). Furthermore, recent pioneering studies have explained the rapid emergence of resistance to targeted therapy in colon cancer by showing that drug-resistance mutations may be present at a very low frequency prior to treatment initiation (Diaz et al. 2012; Misale et al. 2012), although the generality of this phenomenon remains to be established. Post-zygotic mutations also have implications for human disease beyond cancer; for example, some developmental disorders can be caused by somatic mutations, as was recently shown for the overgrowth syndromes MCAP and MPPH (Riviere et al. 2012) and HME (Lee et al. 2012). Subclonal variation also has important consequences in populations of microorganisms, where low-frequency variants can confer drug resistance or facilitate immune evasion.",

The sensitive and accurate detection of subclonal genetic variation remains challenging, as this necessarily requires a method that is capable of processing a large number of DNA molecules and sensitively identifying a variant at low relative abundance without an excess of false-positive calls. To address these challenges, other innovative methods have been developed, including phenotypic screening, COLD-PCR (Li et al. 2008; Milbury et al. 2012), the random mutation capture assay (Bielas and Loeb 2005), and BEAMing (Dressman et al. 2003).

These methods also have attractive properties for the study of subclonal variation, including throughput on the order of 1,000,000,000 molecules per run and a separate readout for each molecule processed. However, the application of massively parallel sequencing to detecting subclonal variation generally faces two technical challenges. First, massively parallel sequencing instruments typically suffer from high per-base substitution error rates, hampering their specificity for detecting low-frequency variants. Second, whereas throughput has improved substantially, whole-genome sequencing is not practical because of the size of mammalian genomes and, consequently, the high sampling depth required for detecting low-frequency variation (typically addressed by targeted sequencing).",

Emerging methods for multiplex targeted sequencing with particular emphasis on the ability to detect sub-clonal variation have been largely aimed at cancer. These include multiplex hybrid capture (Lipson et al. 2012; Wagle et al. 2012) and highly multiplexed PCR (Tewhey et al. 2009; Harismendy et al. 2011; Forshew et al. 2012). However, each of these methods has important drawbacks that limit practical utility. Hybrid capture typically entails a complex and time-intensive workflow, high per-sample reagent costs, and limited flexibility to reformulate the protocol as the regions of interest change over time. Highly multiplexed PCR often relies on complex instrumentation (Tewhey et al. 2009; Forshew et al. 2012) and may be restricted to a limited number of target genes. Furthermore, to maximize generality, an effective method for sensitive multiplex targeted sequencing must also be robust to relatively small amounts and poor quality of source DNA such as that isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue.",

The resulting method, termed smMIP (for single molecule Molecular Inversion Probes), combines the MIP strategy for targeted capture (Turner et al. 2009; Shen et al. 2011; O'Roak et al. 2012a) with single molecule tagging (Hiatt et al. 2010; Casbon et al. 2011; Fu et al. 2011; Jabara et al. 2011; Kinde et al. 2011; Kivioja et al. 2012; Shiroguchi et al. 2012). MIPs represent an attractive platform for targeted capture because of their very low per-sample cost, workflow simplicity, target-set modularity, and low sample input requirements. Single molecule tagging, on the other hand, enables consensus calling for single genomic equivalents present in the input material, thereby facilitating both highly sensitive variant calling and precise quantitation of mutation frequency. The combination of MIPs and single molecule tagging form the basis for an ultra-sensitive, targeted sequencing assay that has additional attractive characteristics from the standpoint of practicality, e.g., speed, ease of use, and compatibility with small quantities of degraded DNA.",

On average, smc-reads were comprised of 2.03 fr-reads in cell line samples, 1.21 fr-reads in fresh clinical samples, and 2.79 read-pairs in FFPE clinical samples (Supplemental Fig. S2). However, some samples exhibited a much higher rate of fr-reads per smc-read, which was likely due to degraded DNA leading to low-complexity capture. Thus, given a certain sequencing depth, the number of fr-reads per smc-read is directly related to capture complexity and can serve as a useful quality control metric.",

Two additional sites had variant genotypes and were again supported by newer 1-KG data. Therefore, based on this limited comparison, our assay is highly accurate at adequately covered positions.

After smc-read formation, elevated substitution rates potentially attributable to 8-oxo-guanine damage are evident across all sample types, but are most markedly elevated in the FFPE clinical samples, suggesting that FFPE treatment may increase 8-oxo-G formation rates. To further investigate the possibility of cytosine deamination, we asked whether the G-to-A substitutions were more frequent in the CpG context, which could be consistent with deamination of 5-methyl-cytosine (Fig. 3C). Indeed, the G-to-A substitution was more frequent in the CpG context across all sample types compared with all other G-to-A substitutions, but the CpG dinucleotide is rare and is not sufficient to fully explain the elevated G-to-A substitution rate (Supplemental Table S3). Finally, we asked whether the corresponding C-to-T mutation rate was also elevated in the CpG context, which would be expected if 5-methyl-C deamination were occurring spontaneously in a replicating population of cells. We observed modest elevation of C-to-T in the CpG context (Supplemental Fig. S5D). Together, these patterns suggest a combined role of in vivo 5-methyl-cytosine deamination as well as ex vivo deamination of 5-methyl-C-to-T and C-to-U. This is consistent with the properties of the polymerase used during the gap-fill step, which, as a proofreading polymerase, is expected to stall at Uracil residues (Lasken et al. 1996), but also bypasses these lesions at some rate (Greagg et al. 1999).",

Smc-reads are, therefore, at least fivefold and as much as 30-fold more accurate than the most confident base-calls in the fr-reads, with substitution rates as low as 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 per base when ignoring only two of 12 possible substitutions, or 8.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 per base when considering all possible single nucleotide substitutions.",

To explore the possible contribution of copy-number change to allele frequency variation, we also examined alternate allele frequencies for putatively germline variant sites for all clinical samples and the two pure HapMap cell line samples (Supplemental Fig. S7B). Alternate allele frequencies for germline variants appeared substantially more variable in a subset of clinical samples compared with the cell line samples, which is consistent with a contribution of copy-number gain to the observed variation in allele frequencies. We cannot exclude the possibility that other factors, including systematic allelic bias, are also contributing to this phenomenon.

In addition to using the more rapid sequencing instrument, we further streamlined the experimental protocol. To assess the performance of this revised workflow, we applied it to eight of the clinical samples that we had already characterized. Five of these samples harbored low-frequency variation at clinically relevant sites as described above; the other three were selected at random. Briefly, we observed excellent agreement between genotype calls using the slow workflow (high-coverage) and rapid workflow (low-coverage) approaches (Supplemental Table S7).

Compared with hybrid capture, smMIP offers very low per-sample reagent costs and a substantially simpler and more rapid workflow. Furthermore, the capture reagent is modular, meaning new probes can be added \u201con-the-fly.\u201d Alternatively, the reagent could be split into single gene pools and combined as desired for small batches of samples to most efficiently leverage the rapid turnaround and lower throughput of the bench-top sequencing platforms. Finally, molecular tagging facilitates single molecule consensus base-calling without relying on pseudo-random fragmentation breakpoints, which may not be informative at high-sequencing depths. However, a smMIP-based approach will not likely scale as well to very large targets (i.e., thousands of genes), and may be less sensitive to large-scale genomic rearrangements. Compared with highly multiplexed droplet (Tewhey et al. 2009; Harismendy et al. 2011) or microfluidic (Forshew et al. 2012) PCR, smMIP does not rely on sophisticated instrumentation, and, because of molecular tagging, is more sensitive and quantitative for low-frequency variation.

Coverage of poorly captured sites and capture uniformity from probe to probe will be improved by further probe rebalancing and supplementation of the probe set to more densely tile problematic regions. Further optimization of the capture protocol directed toward reducing formation of undesired low-molecular weight artifacts should improve mapping rates, increasing sensitivity and reducing or eliminating the need for time- and labor-intensive size-selection steps during sample preparation. Another opportunity is the development of higher resolution models to prioritize variants, potentially using dinucleotide or even site-specific error rates. Application of the smMIP method to larger numbers of samples is expected to facilitate the development of such models.

For example, in one colon cancer sample, we identified a KRAS p.G13D mutation and a low-frequency NRAS p.Q61R mutation. NRAS mutations are infrequent (\u223c5% overall; \u223c3% p.Q61; \u223c1% p.Q61R) in KRAS wild-type colon cancers (Vaughn et al. 2011), but have similar implications, i.e., reduced response to the targeted anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab (Maughan et al. 2011), and KRAS mutations have been detected in \u223c20% of cancers also harboring NRAS mutations (Maughan et al. 2011). Furthermore, colon cancers harboring KRAS p.G13D, unlike those harboring other KRAS mutations, may remain responsive to cetuximab/panitumumab (De Roock et al. 2010), although this finding was not replicated in a subsequent study (Maughan et al. 2011). Based on our observation, one possible explanation for the disagreement between those studies is that some subset of tumors harboring KRAS p.G13D also harbor NRAS mutations at clonal or subclonal frequencies, and that NRAS mutation status is also influencing response to antibody therapy. Further study will be needed to better establish the prevalence of co-occurring KRAS p.G13D and clonal or subclonal NRAS mutations and the relationship between mutational status and response to therapy. Characterization of large panels of archival clinical specimens using the smMIP assay could be used to address this and other questions.",

                    "text": "Genetic heterogeneity in populations of cells derived from a clonal origin is a fundamental aspect of biology and has important implications in fields ranging from evolution to cancer. However, DNA sequencing methods have been largely blind to subclonal variation because of limitations in throughput and/or sequencing error rate. In the long term, researchers will require genomic characterization methods that include the reliable detection and quantitation of low-frequency mutations. For example, genetic heterogeneity is emerging as a common attribute of human cancers (Navin et al. 2011; Carter et al. 2012; Gerlinger et al. 2012; Nickel et al. 2012; Nik-Zainal et al. 2012) and the rapid emergence of resistance to therapy in some cancers may be explained in part by the pre-existence of subclonal resistance mutations (Diaz et al. 2012; Misale et al. 2012). We anticipate that a practical, sensitive, and accurate method for targeted subclonal variation detection will enable the design and execution of many more and much larger studies than have been previously possible. The speed, simplicity, parallelizability, and very low substitution error rate (\u22643 \u00d7 10\u22125) of the smMIP assay also raises the possibility of processing multiple independent samplings of a given specimen over time and space. In cancer, the smMIP assay could be applied to multiple biopsies from the same tissue mass or multiple independent metastases (Gerlinger et al. 2012; Nickel et al. 2012), while in the case of somatic mosaicism, many tissue specimens of diverse embryological origin could be analyzed. Finally, the smMIP assay could be useful in other scenarios where the sensitive and precise quantification of low-frequency variation is relevant, e.g., the detection of extremely low-frequency cancer-related mutations in circulating cell or cell-free DNA (Diehl et al. 2008; Forshew et al. 2012), or as a complementary approach for noninvasively assaying fetal DNA from maternal plasma (Fan et al. 2012; Kitzman et al. 2012) at clinically relevant sites.",

We designed probes with targeting arms summing to 40 nt in length, with extension arms ranging in length from 16 to 20 nt and ligation arms ranging in length from 20 to 24 nt. The gap-fill length was fixed to 112 nt. Targeting arms were joined by a constant 40-mer \u201cbackbone\u201d sequence (common oligo sequences can be found in Supplemental Table S9) containing a stretch of 12 random nucleotides, such that each probe could exist in \u223c412 = 1.67 \u00d7 106 unique sequences. After adding probes to accommodate sites of common variation in the genome that fell in targeting arms, we had a set of 1312 probes targeting \u223c88 kb of coding sequence and \u223c125 kb overall. These 80-mer probes were procured individually as column-synthesized oligos at 25 nanomole scale in 96-well plate format without any modifications or purification at a cost of $7.20 per probe. While a nontrivial up-front cost, this represents an effectively infinite supply, as each capture reaction consumes less than one 10-millionth of the supply of a given probe.

Test captures using cell line genomic DNA were then carried out as described below, using the equimolar probe pool at a 1000-fold probe-to-target molar excess.

Overlapping regions of read-pairs were then reconciled to form single \u201cfr-reads\u201d using a custom Smith-Waterman-based strategy.

For positions where the read-pairs did overlap, quality scores for the resulting consensus calls were estimated as below for smc-reads. Only successfully overlapped fr-reads were retained for downstream analysis; read-pairs that failed to merge were discarded, although subsequent implementations aimed at greater sensitivity toward large insertions such as those found in FLT3 will retain and analyze these reads, and smMIP does not explicitly require collecting overlapping read-pairs. Fr-reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using the bwasw alignment mode of the aligner bwa (Li and Durbin 2010) (v0.5.9) with non-default parameters \u201c-r 1\u201d. Based on expected alignment positions according to the probe design, fr-reads were then assigned to individual probes, allowing 1 nt of tolerance in each direction for the beginning of the read, which primarily accommodates insertion and deletion mutations during probe synthesis.

We adopted a likelihood ratio framework to incorporate both the abundance and associated quality-scores of fr-read base-calls supporting each possible nucleotide at each position. Briefly, we calculated the log-likelihood Lx of consensus nucleotide x as the difference of the log-likelihood of a model in which a given nucleotide x was underlying none of the calls and the log-likelihood of a model in which x was underlying all of the calls.

The final phred-like quality score is calculated as the integer casting of \u221210*Lx. For example, in the event that a model against a given consensus nucleotide is 10\u22123 times as likely as a model for a given consensus nucleotide, the associated quality score was calculated to be 30. These scores were capped at 60 as we did not observe substitution rates substantially below 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 in practice. We note that a smc-read base-call that is derived from a single Q60 fr-read base-call (which may have been derived from two Q40 calls at an overlapping position, for example) will be assigned an estimated quality score of 59 because of the integer casting step.

We note that this framework makes simplifying assumptions: that a given nucleotide, in the event of a sequencing error, is equally likely to give rise to any of the other three substitution nucleotides, and that a single nucleotide truly underlies all calls across all reads in the TDRG. Furthermore, for interpretability, we used three as the denominator to distribute the probability when the observed nucleotide was not the candidate consensus nucleotide, though we computed this value for a total of six possible consensus calls and not four.",

Alignments of fr-reads and smc-reads were considered directly and base-calls at putative homozygous reference sites (according to genotypes called by GATK) were tabulated, considering only very high-quality calls (at least Q41 for fr-reads, Q60 for smc-reads). We note that some, but not all positions in fr-reads can attain higher-quality scores via the merging process (up to a maximum of 60 as specified by the quality score estimation process described above). To estimate confidence in and prioritize subclonal variant calls, we used empirically computed error rates for each of the 12 possible single-nucleotide substitutions and assumed a binomial error process to estimate the probability of observing a given number of variant calls against a background of reference calls for each position. We then adjusted these P-values for multiple testing in R using the function p.adjust() with method=\u201dBH\u201d.",

Because we observed that some sites in this list were also present in the COSMIC database (CosmicMutantExport_v59_230512.tsv obtained from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/CGP/cosmic/data_export/), we first filtered the ESP5400 list to remove these positions (e.g., JAK2 p.V617F). Next, variants were categorized as putative germline if they occurred at a site present in the ESP5400 list that had been filtered of COSMIC variant sites. Remaining variant sites were then compared with the COSMIC list and categorized thusly.",
