We investigate the composition of active and total mucosal microbiota of treatment-na\u00efve ulcerative colitis (UC) patients to determine the microbial picture at the start-up phase of disease, using both a 16S rRNA transcript and gene amplicon sequencing. DNA and RNA were isolated from the same mucosal colonic biopsies. Our aim was to identify active microbial members of the microbiota in early stages of disease and reveal which members are present, but do not act as major players. We demonstrated differences in active and total microbiota of UC patients when comparing inflamed to non-inflamed tissue. Several taxa, among them the Proteobacteria phyla and families therein, revealed lower transcriptional activity despite a high presence. The Bifidobacteriaceae family of the Actinobacteria phylum showed lower abundance in the active microbiota, although no difference in presence was detected. The most abundant microbiota members of the inflamed tissue in UC patients were not the most active. Knowledge of active members of microbiota in UC patients could enhance our understanding of disease etiology. The active microbial community composition did not deviate from the total when comparing UC patients to non-IBD controls.",

The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD is still poorly understood, despite extensive research efforts during the last several decades. Several studies have revealed a pattern of reduced alpha diversity and abnormal microbial community composition with a decrease in a number of taxa within the phylum Firmicutes and an increase in the phyla Bacteriodetes and Proteobacteria4,5. At the species level, some candidates have been reported to have an altered abundance in diseased versus healthy subjects, but a microbial signature of disease has not been found3,6,7. The normal, healthy human gut microbiota, seen at the phylogenetic level, exhibits a generally high variability between and within individuals over time4,8,9. However, functional redundancy can reduce the effect of variations in microbial community structure, and the healthy gut microbiota is relatively stable at a functional level8,10.",

The Bland-Altman plot of the paired RNA and DNA samples showed some heterogeneity in the alpha diversity across the samples but few systematic differences between groups (Fig.\u00a01c).

However, none of these differences were observed when active (rRNA) microbial community compositions were compared. For the active microbiota, a significantly lower transcriptional activity in the Actinobacteria family Bifidobacteriaceae and a slightly lower transcriptional activity in the Proteobacteria family Alcaligenaceae was found in the inflamed mucosa compared to the non-inflamed mucosa. In addition, although not significant, the Prevotellaceae showed a higher transcriptional activity (Table\u00a0S4).",

As such, we aimed to study the active and total microbial members of the colonic mucosal microbiota in treatment-na\u00efve UC patients in search of bacterial taxa that may have a larger pathological role defined by their potential activity. In UC, the colonic mucosal tissue is inflamed, resulting in microbes with direct access to the epithelial layer. We believe that microbes thriving and having a potentially high metabolic activity in this environment will have a more important role in the disease than the total bacterial community occupying the same niche. The mucosal biopsy samples in the present study were subjected to an extensive nucleic acid extraction protocol optimized to extract and preserve DNA and RNA from both hard-to-lyse and more-prone-to-lyse bacterial taxa. This is an important step to obtain a balanced nucleotide purification and thus get a better representation of the microbes present in the samples. The DNA and RNA of each sample were isolated from the same single mucosal colonic biopsy, making it possible to perform a direct comparison between the active and total microbiota24,25. Other groups have purified DNA and RNA from single biopsies in their work on microbiota, but the purification methods have not been optimized for microbial nucleic acids17,26",

The alpha diversity analyses showed no significant differences when comparing the UC patients, the inflamed and non-inflamed tissue, and the symptomatic non-IBD control group in either dataset (Fig.\u00a01a and b). An explanation for the lack of differences in alpha diversity and the lack of large differences in the active and total microbial community compositions when analysing both within UC patients and between UC patients and symptomatic non-IBD controls could be the result of mixing disease severity in our study group (Table\u00a0S1). Walujkar27 and colleagues found in their study different shifts in the mucosal microbiota following UC severity stages. In the present study, we included patients suffering from different degrees of severity. Possible shifts in the diseased microbiota could be masked due to this mixing, hence shielding differences within the patient group. The control group of symptomatic non-IBD patients included patients suffering from IBD-like symptoms but not experiencing tissue inflammation. This patient group will most likely have a disturbed microbiota but probably to a lesser extent than the IBD patients. Thus, the analyses between the UC patients and the symptomatic non-IBD control group could also be affected by the mixing of disease severity in the former group.",

This sampling area was chosen in an attempt to use data from all the UC patients, including the total colitis patients. As the sampling area of the non-inflamed tissue biopsies varied between the two parts of the intestine, analyses were performed to investigate whether the sampling could affect the further microbiota analysis. The analyses did not reveal any significant difference in either the 16S rRNA gene or the transcribed 16S rRNA counts between the non-inflamed tissues sampled from different gut locations within the patients (Fig.\u00a0S1). Furthermore, our analysis revealed that even inflamed and non-inflamed tissue samples within the same patient were more similar with regard to both total and active microbiota than microbiota from the same location and with the same inflammation status in other patients (Fig.\u00a02). These findings support other studies, indicating that there is greater variability between subjects, regardless of diagnosis, location in the gut and inflammation status, than the internal variability1.",

This finding was contrasted by the active microbial community composition, which showed a lower transcriptional activity in the inflamed tissues, with an FC of 0.846. The Proteobacteria family level revealed a 2.455-fold higher abundance in Enterobacteriaceae of the total microbiota. The active microbiota was not found to have a significantly higher transcriptional activity, indicating that Enterobacteriaceae might not have an increased function or a more pathophysiological role in the inflamed tissue compared to the non-inflamed tissues of UC patients. The pairwise comparison within biopsies supported this finding, with less transcriptional activity of the bacterial family in the RNA dataset and higher abundance in the DNA dataset (Fig.\u00a05c). In the active microbiota, a 0.808-fold lower transcriptional activity was found in the Proteobacteria family Alcaligenaceae. This result was not found in the total microbiota. The contrasting difference in abundance and activity in tissues with different inflammatory statuses may indicate that Proteobacteria have important pathophysiological functions in UC patients, being more abundant and active compared to symptomatic non-IBD controls, but do not have any increased function in the area of the diseased tissue. The discrepancies observed between the active and total microbiota could possibly be explained by the increased activity of human immune system in inflamed tissue.",

Elucidation of this group was not performed in the IBD-Character study, but the group probably consists of several patients who were classified as IBS-like. Proteobacteria has been found to have a higher abundance in UC patients compared to healthy individuals29, but the relation to IBS patients has not been convincing30. In the present study, the Proteobacteria phylum in the UC patient group, for both the total and active microbiota, revealed a considerably higher abundance and transcriptional activity compared to the symptomatic non-IBD control group (Table\u00a03). Both the total and active microbiota revealed corresponding patterns with regard to significant differences in the fourth- to fifth-fold greater presence of the Proteobacteria family Enterobacteriaceae and the Firmicutes family Peptostreptococcaceae, indicating an important contribution of these two families to the diseased microbiota. Both bacterial families have been associated with disease and UC1,31\u201333, and they seem to have a greater function in the mucosal tissue of UC patients compared to the diseased non-IBD patients. Both bacterial families have been found to participate in xenobiotic/drug metabolism34, which is also a functional pathway found to be more present in UC patients in the present study. Enterobacteriaceae is a family of facultative anaerobes with an increased ability to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and have diverse energy sources. Peptostreptococcaceae, on the other hand, is a family of strict anaerobes with a fermentative metabolism. The latter family contains saccharolytic members and has been linked to colon cancer, but its function in the gut microbiota is still largely unclear33. The results of the functional analyses revealed a significantly greater abundance in the chemical carcinogenesis pathway in UC patients. UC is a well-known risk factor for colon cancer, and the results hint at a possible role for bacteria in modulating cancer risk35.",

In the present study, the most abundant microbiota members of the inflamed tissue in UC patients were not the most active.
