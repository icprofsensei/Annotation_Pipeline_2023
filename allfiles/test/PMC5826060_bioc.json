The oropharyngeal microbiota is the major reservoir of infection. This study explored the relative contributions of time in hospital and patient demographics to the community structure of the oropharyngeal microbiota in older patients with lower limb fracture. We collected 167 throat swabs from 53 patients (mean age 83) over 14 days after hospitalization, and analyzed these using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We calculated frailty/comorbidity indices, undertook dental examinations and collected data on respiratory tract infections. We analyzed microbial community composition using correspondence (CA) and canonical correspondence analysis. Ten patients were treated for respiratory tract infection. Microbial community structure was related to frailty, number of teeth and comorbidity on admission, with comorbidity exerting the largest effect. Time in hospital neither significantly changed alpha (t = \u22120.910, p = 0.365) nor beta diversity (CA1 t = 0.022, p = 0.982; CA2 t = \u22120.513, p = 0.609) of microbial communities in patient samples. Incidence of respiratory pathogens were not associated with time in hospital (t = \u22120.207, p = 0.837), nor with alpha diversity of the oral microbiota (t = \u22121.599, p = 0.113). Patient characteristics at admission, rather than time in hospital, influenced the community structure of the oral microbiota.",

Nosocomial respiratory tract infections increase the average cost of hospital care by up to 75% (Thompson et al., 2006), increase length of hospital stay by up to 12 days (Thompson et al., 2006; Redelmeier et al., 2010), require the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics which may act as a driver for antimicrobial resistance, increase mortality (Thompson et al., 2006; Burton et al., 2016), and are associated with loss of independence (Thompson et al., 2006). Approximately two thirds of these infections occur in patients who have not been intubated and mechanically ventilated in critical care (Health Protection Agency, 2012). The non-ventilated hospital population at risk is predominantly older, frail and characterized by multimorbidity (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2013; Burton et al., 2016).",

Tracheal and oral colonization with respiratory organisms is associated with subsequent increased risk of ventilator associated and hospital acquired pneumonia, respectively (Ewan et al., 2015; Kalil et al., 2016). Respiratory tract infections such as hospital-acquired pneumonia arise, by definition, at least 48 h, and on average 11 days after hospital admission (Hanson et al., 1992). However, little is known about the dynamics of the oropharyngeal microbiota during this window of infectivity in the population of frail, older patients at risk of respiratory tract infection. Oropharyngeal samples from older pneumonia patients in a previous study (de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2016) showed increased relative abundances of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Rothia, and Lactobacillus species, but because samples were taken after the onset of pneumonia, it was unclear as to whether these changes represented cause or effect. By studying the oropharyngeal microbiota prior to the onset of infection, we investigated whether patients who subsequently develop RTI are identifiable, either by a reduction in diversity or dominance of particular organisms, as is seen in ventilated patients prior to the onset of infection (Fourrier et al., 1998; Yeh et al., 2016).",

We investigated whether changes in diversity were observable in hospitalized patients prior to the onset of respiratory infection, in a group of patients with lower limb fractures (hip, femur, ankle). Operation is mandatory in patients with hip fracture, so the study patients were representative of a spectrum of frailty states and comorbidities. However, there was consistency in the course of each patient's medical episode (e.g., fall, fracture, operation, recovery). This allowed us to investigate how patient factors such as frailty, comorbidity and also dentition influenced the oropharyngeal microbiota.",

We used three complementary scales to identify frailty: Rockwood's Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) (Rockwood et al., 2005), the Barthel Index (which measures activities of daily living), and the Hierarchical Balance and Mobility scale (Rockwood et al., 2008) These were, to a degree, co-linear but focussed on different phenotypic manifestations of the syndrome. For example, the Barthel index only reduces from score of 20 once the person needs help with activities of daily living, while the clinical frailty scale increases as comorbidities increase, and as the person starts needing a nap in the daytime, despite being independent with activities of daily living. The direction and description of these scales is available in Supplementary Material (Supplementary Table 1).",

We used 100 forward primers, each with a unique error-correcting golay barcode (Fierer et al., 2008) which could then be used to distinguish pooled samples after sequencing. The reverse primer was as follows: 5\u2032-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAG-GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG-3\u2032). Amplification was performed by NewGene Ltd (Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne), and was as follows: samples were quality checked, and DNA quantified using picoGreen and purified using AmPure. Amplicons were checked for size and purity using the Agilent DNA 1000 kit and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Quant-iT Picogreen fluorescent nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen) was used to quantitate amplicons and then the amplicons were pooled into a library at equimolar concentrations (1 \u00d7 109 molecules/\u03bcl). emPCR and undirectional sequencing of the libraries was performed using the Lib-L kit and Roche 454 GS-FLX Titanium sequencer at the Centre for Genomic Research, Liverpool University.",

CA is an ordination approach that seeks to reduce the dimensionality of the data in order to identify major trends in the variation in taxonomic composition across the data set. Patients with similar ordination scores have similar oropharyngeal communities, whilst those with different scores have very different communities. CCA is a constrained ordination technique which seeks to explain trends in beta diversity in relation to potential drivers (such as, in this study, age, comorbidity, frailty and presence of teeth). A permutation test (permutations = 999) analyzing the marginal effect was undertaken to assess the significance of the constraining variables. Prior to undertaking the CA and CCA, OTUs that only appeared in <5 samples were removed from the data set and then these data were subjected to a Hellinger Transformation.",

The second trend in variation was related to Charlson index (\u03c72 = 0.109, F = 3.318, p < 0.001). Thus the oral microbiota of patients varied because of differences in frailty, comorbidity and presence of teeth. Extreme scores were observed for patients along the second axis, suggesting that the microbiota exhibited most differences at higher levels of comorbidity. Some samples from this area originated from two persons treated for RTI during the sampling period. The OTUs associated with negative CA2 scores at the extreme end of the tail were Lactobacillus oris (OTU 180), Lactobacillus crispatus (OTU 15) and the respiratory pathogen S. aureus (OTU 33) while the OTUs associated with positive CA scores were H. influenzae (OTU 27) and Enterobacteriaceae spp. (OTU 34) (Supplementary Figure 1).",

The hypothetical model is shown in Figure \u200bFigure3.3. The main trend in beta diversity represented by the first axis of the correspondence analysis of OTUs was related to the Charlson (z = \u22122.5105, p = 0.0157) and Barthel scores (z = 2.2261, p = 0.0311). In common with the univariate and multivariate analyses described above, this axis was not related to the duration in hospital (z = 1.1543, p = 0.2504), number of teeth (z = 0.2131, p = 0.8322) or clinical frailty scale (z = 0.3200, p = 0.7503). Axis two on the other hand was related to the Charlson index (z = \u22122.0192, p = 0.0494), and to number of teeth (z = \u22122.8192, p = 0.0071), but not to duration of time since admission (z = \u22120.1497, p = 0.8812), or Barthel score (z = 1.1548, p = 0.2542) or CFS (z = 0.966, p = 0.3392). Barthel, clinical frailty scale and Charlson scores were related to age (z = 19.428, p = 0.000; 11.586, p = 0.000 and z = 7.6443, p = 0.0000 respectively). The path diagrams showing observed significant pathways to effect is shown in Figure \u200bFigure4.4.

We have shown that in this relatively well cohort of non-ventilated patients, oropharyngeal alpha and beta diversity remained relatively stable over the early admission period and that the main drivers of beta diversity at admission were frailty, comorbidity and number of teeth. While there are no directly comparable studies, two longitudinal studies of sputum samples from COPD patients demonstrated similar stability of the microbiome over time (Huang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016). Overrepresentation of respiratory pathogens did not appear to occur solely as a result of time in hospital. These data challenge the idea that time is the dominant factor shaping the oropharyngeal microbiota in this population.",

However because a proportion of non-RTI participants experienced similar frailty to our RTI participants, we were able to demonstrate that loss of species richness in itself was not associated with the occurrence of respiratory pathogens, nor with subsequent respiratory tract infection. This is in contrast to a previous study which found reduced oropharyngeal diversity in older pneumonia patients, but whose controls were healthy community dwelling older people (de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2016). Lower diversity communities are generally thought to be less resilient to invasion by infecting pathogens (Keesing et al., 2010), and these results might suggest that the organisms concerned are occurring due to overgrowth or stagnation (loss of flow) rather than invasion, in keeping with a previous study (Palmer et al., 2001). However we did not examine total bacterial load, and therefore the colonization resistance issue, pertinent to Clostridium difficile infection in the gut (Vincent et al., 2013), and which may be important here, was not addressed.",

Older patients are particularly vulnerable after admission to hospital and recruitment is difficult, cognitive impairment notwithstanding (which may be in part why this population is understudied). These patients were too frail for bronchoscopy, therefore the diagnosis of respiratory tract infection was based on clinician-initiated antibiotics, and there were few sputum samples available with which we could compare oropharyngeal samples. However, there was a significant association between respiratory tract infection and prior detection of respiratory pathogens in the oropharyngeal flora (despite the lack of data on pneumococcus), corroborating this method of identifying cases of respiratory tract infection to some degree. In addition, oropharyngeal samples have been found to be comparable to sputum samples in exacerbation of COPD (Liu et al., 2017). There are also semantic difficulties because technically, though we would not consider these patients to have developed ventilator associated pneumonia, some were intubated and mechanically ventilated, albeit for a short period, intraoperatively. Nevertheless this cohort represents a different demographic group to the ventilated critical care patients, being older, frailer and less acutely unwell. However these issues do highlight some of the difficulties with labeling \u201ctypes\u201d of pneumonia.",

We did not systematically assess swallowing as a covariate, one of the strongest risk factors for hospital-acquired respiratory tract infections (Cabr\u00e9 et al., 2014). However, anecdotal observations made during the study suggested an important role for dysphagia in the occurrence of respiratory pathogens (data not shown). Systematic identification of patients with swallowing problems combined with immunological data are likely to be key to understanding why dysbiosis of the oropharyngeal microbiota occurs. Credible (non-RCT) evidence suggests that four times daily oral hygiene may reduce the rates of nosocomial RTI (Quinn et al., 2014), and such programmes are being instigated across a number of hospitals in the United States. This is an another important avenue for research in this area.",
