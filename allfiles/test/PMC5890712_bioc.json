Post-treatment microbiome analysis identified that these microorganisms increased in abundance from previously low numbers, whereas skin flora microorganisms such as Pseudomonas spp. decreased in abundance following treatment (indicating cadexomer iodine were effective).

Our rationale to provide a strong argument that planktonic microorganisms were of a negligible proportion of microbial cells, with the bulk of cells being biofilm, is supported by our visualization techniques using SEM and FISH. These methods identified significant aggregates of microbial cells with extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Furthermore, we vigorously rinsed all tissue samples during preparation as a method to reduce planktonic microorganisms not adhered to tissue. Alternative methods to reduce planktonic microorganisms from contaminating biofilm models have only been alluded to from ex vivo animal explants,10 with no reports of this approach on human tissue.",

Other commonly employed techniques such as molecular viability testing (pre-RNA analysis or RT-qPCR) are able to detect live or dead microorganisms. The problem with using these techniques for our diabetic ulcer samples is the predominance of biofilm phenotype cells present in the tissue. Pre-RNA rapidly responds to nutrition stimulation and target metabolism, not actual microbial load. Given that biofilm cells have low metabolism in comparison with planktonic cells, this may lead to variations in the 16S pre-RNA level between the biofilm and planktonic cells and different growth conditions.32 The log reductions noted in this study therefore represent the minimal response and we acknowledge that some of the bacteria detected by qPCR could be dead, resulting in a lower calculated efficacy for cadexomer iodine.",
