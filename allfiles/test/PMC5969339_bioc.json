It could be assumed that MBL deficiency in COPD, CF or bronchiectasis would have similar effects but there are clear differences in the inflammatory profiles and microbiota of these diseases. MBL undergoes oxidation in the COPD airway; oxidised MBL suppresses macrophage phagocytosis of Haemophilus influenzae, a key COPD pathogen.12 Failed macrophage phagocytosis in COPD has been extensively described and is likely to contribute to exacerbation risk.13 Paradoxically, MBL deficiency could be beneficial in COPD, by removing a key inhibitor of macrophage function and bacterial clearance.

Survival was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression from date of enrolment to death. Comparison of the average annual rate in decline of FEV1 between MBL deficient, intermediate and sufficient patients was performed using multiple linear regression. The annualised rate of FEV1 decline was determined from the difference between the FEV1 recorded at the final TARDIS visit and the baseline visit divided by follow-up time. Multivariable models were adjusted for gender, Deprivation Index, prescriptions for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), bronchodilators and other medications (listed in table 1), smoking status and pack years, FEV1, post bronchodilator FEV1, comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, liver disease, renal disease, hypertension and diabetes. Data were obtained from record linkage and so no missing data were encountered for prescribing, morbidity and mortality data. Subgroups were predefined including examining exacerbations requiring corticosteroids versus those requiring antibiotics, and moderate versus severe exacerbations (defined as those requiring hospital admission). All models used time-dependent analysis to account for changes in these variables over the course of follow-up. Differences between effect estimates were compared using interaction testing.15 Analysis of stable samples used only the first stable sample per patient.

In the microbiota subcohort, MBL deficiency was associated with a more diverse microbiota, and in particular, a reduction in Haemophilus spp OTUs. Loss of microbiota diversity with dominance of Haemophilus spp is associated with more severe disease, more frequent exacerbations and greater airway inflammation. Our finding that MBL deficiency is protective against Haemophilus spp infection is consistent with data showing that oxidised MBL disrupts MBL oligomer formation and inhibits phagocytic clearance of Haemophilus spp in COPD alveolar macrophages.12 Impaired phagocytosis of Haemophilus spp in COPD macrophages has been previously demonstrated; our data fit with the proposal that MBL has a role in inhibiting clearance of bacteria from the airway.13 17 MBL deficiency may be beneficial, by removing an inhibitory factor preventing bacterial phagocytosis. The 23% reduction in exacerbations we observed in the MBL deficient group is clinically important, and is equivalent to the reduction observed when ICS are added to long-acting \u03b2\u00a0agonists in randomised controlled trials.18",

MBL deficiency increases the frequency and severity of P. aeruginosa infections in humans and mice, while studies show lower mortality in patients infected with H. influenzae compared with P. aeruginosa and other bacteria.7 8 19 20 In the largest bronchiectasis cohort study, colonisation with H. influenzae was associated with a lower frequency of exacerbations compared with P. aeruginosa or Veillonella spp colonisation.21 COPD, bronchiectasis and CF have differing microbiota and inflammatory profiles and very different clinical presentations. Therefore, it is plausible MBL deficiency may have different impacts in different diseases. Indeed it has been long speculated that the high MBL deficiency frequency in the population suggests a balanced effect whereby it is harmful under some circumstances but beneficial under others.22",

While there are concerns that the oral microbiota may contaminate sputum,27 induced sputum was chosen due to its less invasive nature (compared with bronchoscopy) and the likelihood of obtaining sufficient sample for sequencing. Our results, showing a stable microbiota dominated by Haemophilus, Veillonella, Prevotella and Streptococcus\u00a0spp, are similar to those obtained by other sample collection methods,2 24\u201326 and from healthy smokers and non-smokers.27 Additionally our data indicating a reduction in \u03b1 diversity in more severe COPD and with a non-deficient genotype correlate with other studies which have compared the lung microbiota of different COPD stages with healthy smokers and non-smokers.2 We observed relatively few Pseudomonas genera OTUs.2 24\u201326 Our study was community based, examining a patient population with less severe COPD than other studies, and may be more representative of the wider patient population with COPD since Pseudomonas spp are known colonisers in more severe COPD and bronchiectasis.28 29 We observed a clear correlation between clinical disease severity and microbiota diversity using S-WDI, similar to the reduced lung microbiota diversity shown to be associated with more severe COPD in other studies.25",
