The aim of this study is to investigate the correlations between fatigue, diarrhea, and alterations in gut microbiota induced by pelvic radiotherapy. During the 5-week treatment of pelvic radiotherapy in 11 cancer patients, the general fatigue score significantly increased and was more prominent in the patients with diarrhea. The fatigue score was closely correlated with the decrease of serum citrulline (an indicator of the functional enterocyte mass) and the increases of systemic inflammatory proteins, including haptoglobin, orosomuoid, \u03b11-antitrypsin and TNF-\u03b1. Serum level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was also elevated, especially in the patients with diarrhea indicating epithelial barrier breach and endotoxemia. Pyrosequencing analysis of 16S rRNA gene revealed that microbial diversity, richness, and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio were significantly altered prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed diarrhea. Pelvic radiotherapy induced further changes in fecal microbial ecology, some of which were specific to the patients with or without diarrhea. Our results indicate that gut microbial dysbiosis prior to radiation therapy may be exploited to predict development of diarrhea and to guide preventive treatment options. Radiation-induced dysbiosis may contribute to pelvic radiation disease, including mucositis, diarrhea, systemic inflammatory response, and pelvic radiotherapy-associated fatigue in cancer patients.",

However, adverse effects following pelvic radiotherapy represent major complications and have been collectively termed pelvic radiation disease (PRD) [4]. Fatigue is a prevalent PRD symptom, which affects patients\u2019 physical and psychosocial well-being, consequently resulting in a cluster of other symptoms, such as pain, sleeplessness, and anxiety [5]. Radiation enteropathy (mucositis), frequently accompanied by diarrhea, is another PRD symptom [6], which further impairs the quality of life [7]. Moreover, fatigue and enteropathy may represent interdependent symptoms as suggested by the prospective study by Jakobsson et al.

The gut microbiota is a dynamic ecosystem and is highly susceptible to environmental influences such as dietary factors or inflammation. In a small study, Manichanh et al. [11] showed that patients which suffered acute post-radiotherapy diarrhea had altered gut microbial diversity, an observation recently recapitulated in mice [12]. Germ-free mice were more resistant to radiation-induced enteritis [13], whereas manipulation of gut microbiota through administration of probiotics improved the gastrointestinal toxicity of radiotherapy [14,15]. These published data, along with the emerging relevance of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) suggests that gut microbial ecology may represent not only a potential tool for risk assessment, but also for reducing the symptoms of PRD via manipulation of the intestinal flora [16].",

[17] described a significant correlation between fatigue and the release of IL-6. Moreover, intensity of fatigue is positively correlated with the severity of diarrhea [5]. Collectively, the available evidence suggests that fatigue, mucosal injury and diarrhea, and dysbiosis are really a continuum rather than a set of independent symptoms. However, no comprehensive and integrative molecular analyses have been performed to investigate gut microbial ecology along with fatigue and diarrhea induced by pelvic radiotherapy. In this study, we provide the first attempt to link those PRD symptoms through 16S rRNA-based microbial profiling, and describe associations among gut microbial dysbiosis and fatigue and diarrhea. Our pilot study also suggests that pre-existing changes in microbial gut ecology in cancer patients may not only play an etiological role in the development of post-radiation enteropathy, but that they may serve as a predictive tool, which may guide clinical approaches to the PRD prevention.",

According to the criteria of CTCAE diarrhea grade, 6 out of 11 patients suffered diarrhea with varying severity recorded on the 3rd and 5th week of radiotherapy (Table 1). Prior to treatment, the MFI-20 general fatigue score was identical in patients who did or did not develop symptoms of diarrhea post-radiotherapy (Fig 1). In patients without diarrhea, the fatigue score increased slightly after radiotherapy, but it did not reach statistical significance (Fig 1). However, patients with diarrhea reported dramatically increased fatigue score at both third and fifth week of radiotherapy (p<0.01; Fig 1), thus suggesting that diarrhea contributes to the patients\u2019 fatigue during radiotherapy.",

Plasma citrulline, a nitrogen end product of glutamine metabolism in the enterocytes, is an established indicator of the functional enterocyte mass [27], and has been described as a surrogate marker of radiation-induced small bowel mucosal atrophy [28]. Serum citrulline concentration significantly decreased during radiotherapy in all patients regardless of the ensuing diarrhea (Fig 2A). However, it was significantly lower in patients with diarrhea both three and five weeks into radiotherapy (Fig 2A). These results suggest that diarrhea was associated with a more significant intestinal epithelial atrophy during pelvic radiotherapy. Moreover, we observed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.648, p = 0.031; r = -0.658, p = 0.028 for 3rd and 5th wk respectively) between MFI-20 general fatigue scores and citrulline concentration in the following 5-week treatment.",

Of the three proteins, only haptoglobin showed significant further increase in patients who developed diarrhea during 3- to 5- week treatment (Fig 2B). At the 5th week time point, general fatigue was positively correlated with haptoglobin (r = 0.796, p = 0.003), with strong partial correlation under control variables of orosomucoid and \u03b11-antitrypsin (r = 0.718, p = 0.029).

The Good\u2019s coverage of each group was over 95%, showing that the 16S rRNA sequences identified in these groups represented the majority of gut bacteria appearing in the samples (Table 2). Analysis of alpha diversity showed that prior to radiotherapy, patients who later progressed to diarrhea had significantly lower fecal microbial diversity not only as compared to healthy controls (p<0.01), but more importantly, as compared to patients who did not develop diarrhea (p<0.01). This was especially pronounced in Shannon diversity index, which accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present (Fig 4A). Similar trend was observed for Chao1 species richness index, albeit without reaching statistical significance (Fig 4B).",

The relative abundance of Alistipes, Bacteroides, Clostridium_XI, Erysipelotrichaceae, Escherichia, Lachnospiracea, Megamonas, and unclassified (Genus: others) were significantly higher, whereas Clostridium_XIVa and Sutterella were significantly lower in the patients who developed diarrhea, in comparison with those who did not (Fig 5E). Interestingly, some genera, such as Alistipes, Bacteroides and Roseburia, changed inversely after pelvic radiotherapy, in comparison with healthy controls (Fig \u200b(Fig5B5B\u20135E).",

However, gastrointestinal symptoms induced by pelvic radiotherapy remain a long-standing and unresolved problem. Especially, fatigue and diarrhea, which are frequently experienced by pelvic radiotherapy patients, have harmful impact on the quality of patients\u2019 life and not infrequently lead to the suspension of treatment [29]. In this pilot study, we assessed the symptoms of fatigue and diarrhea, inflammatory markers, and fecal microbial ecology of 11 cancer patients over their five-week pelvic radiotherapy course. Within the limitation of the small patient cohort, we describe that fatigue is positively correlated with diarrhea and systemic markers of inflammation. Moreover, we showed that gut microbiota was not only affected by radiotherapy, but more importantly, that pre-existing changes in gut microbial ecology may serve as a predictive tool to identify patients who are more likely to progress to diarrhea after pelvic irradiation.",

The positive correlations between fatigue and the elevation of these three proteins suggest that inflammation may contribute to the experienced fatigue. Consistent with an earlier study [5], we also observed that patients with diarrhea suffered from more severe fatigue. It is plausible that these patients experience more severe inflammation, as the serum levels of the inflammatory biomarkers were elevated more significantly in patients reporting higher fatigue scores (Figs \u200b(Figs22 and \u200band3).3). This also suggests that inflammation actuates the pathophysiology of diarrhea.",

Tumor necrosis and collateral damage to normal tissues is accompanied by intestinal injury, compromised epithelial barrier and enhanced intestinal permeability, and an increased translocation of bacteria and proinflammatory luminal components. This viewpoint is supported by the findings of our study and previous reports that significant decrease in serum citrulline concentration, which indicates progressive intestinal epithelial atrophy [28,30], was accompanied by an increase in serum levels of TNF\u03b1 and LPS during the treatment, especially in patients who developed diarrhea (Fig 3). The fact that endotoxemia was primarily observed in patients with diarrhea who also showed more elevated TNF\u03b1 concentrations, suggests that mucositis and altered microbial-host interactions are at the heart of pelvic radiation disease.",

In our study, a significant difference in the abundance ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was observed in the cancer patients before and after pelvic radiotherapy. Moreover, we also found a remarkable decrease in the diversity and richness of gut flora after radiotherapy treatment, as well as significant differences in the relative abundance of selected genera between patients who developed or did not develop diarrhea. The latter finding may be related to differences in the severity of local mucosal inflammatory responses, or to changes in epithelial transport or peristalsis, factors which were not investigated in our patients.",

                    "text": "A more striking observation is related to changes in gut microbial ecology prior to pelvic radiotherapy. Patients who progressed to diarrhea had significantly lower microbial alpha diversity and higher Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio compared to those who did not develop diarrhea. In taxonomic analysis of the two patient groups pre-radiotherapy, we found significant differences in the relative abundance of Veillonella, Prevotella, Parabacteroides, Oscillibacter, Faecalibacterium, Dialister, Bacteroides, Clostridia clusters XI and XVIII, and unclassified (Genus: others) (Fig 5B). Although based on our results it is not possible to causatively link any of those taxa to the etiology of radiotherapy-induced diarrhea, it is of interest that Clostridia cluster XVIII, which has been linked to promotion of regulatory T cell expansion and protection from colitis and allergic diarrhea [32], was significantly less abundant in patients who developed diarrhea. Similar case can be made for Faecalibacterium genus, which includes a protective commensal, F. prausnitzii.[33] On the other hand, Clostridium cluster XI, which includes a known diarrheal pathogen C. dificile, although less abundant prior to radiotherapy in patients who later develop diarrhea, is significantly expanded post-therapy, while in non-diarrhea patients it followed the opposite trend. While due to the pilot nature of our study we are not able to specifically and authoritatively address the role of these changes in promoting diarrhea, inflammation, and fatigue, these results strongly suggest the need for further and more detailed studies with larger cohort of patients. Such studies, as well as studies with gnotobiotic mice with humanized microbiota, may also point to specific taxonomic changes, which may be of predictive value, and potentially guide the preventive treatment with cytoprotective, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, or probiotics [34].",
