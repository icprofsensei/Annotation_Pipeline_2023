We sought to use bacterial community abundance data to assess the feasibility of developing multivariate molecular signatures for differentiation of cutaneous psoriatic lesions, clinically unaffected contralateral skin from psoriatic patients, and similar cutaneous loci in matched healthy control subjects. Using 16S rRNA high-throughput DNA sequencing, we assayed the cutaneous microbiome for 51 such matched specimen triplets including subjects of both genders, different age groups, ethnicities and multiple body sites. None of the subjects had recently received relevant treatments or antibiotics. We found that molecular signatures for the diagnosis of psoriasis result in significant accuracy ranging from 0.75 to 0.89 AUC, depending on the classification task. We also found a significant effect of DNA sequencing and downstream analysis protocols on the accuracy of molecular signatures. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to develop accurate molecular signatures for the diagnosis of psoriasis from microbiomic data.",

Because the cutaneous microbiota is complex10,11, and its composition is site-specific12,13, we matched lesional skin with unaffected contralateral skin from the same subject. Likewise, the samples from demographically matched healthy controls were collected at standardized sites where psoriasis lesions commonly appear. The experimental specimen matching and sample collection protocols were designed to measure predictive microbial markers that are common across body-sites regardless of the inter-site variability. Each site may have additional specific markers which may not be detected by the current design. We used this set of specimens to obtain high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene for both the V1\u2013V3 and the V3\u2013V5 loci14. Using resulting microbiomic data, we then developed and evaluated multivariate molecular signatures of psoriasis aimed at the separation of cutaneous psoriatic lesions, the clinically uninvolved contralateral skin, and the similar skin loci in matched healthy control subjects. The availability of two different datasets, based on the V1\u2013V3 and the V3\u2013V5 16S rRNA gene loci, enabled us to study the effect of the DNA sequencing protocol on the classification accuracy of molecular signatures. Similarly, we experimented with 37 protocols for downstream analysis by using various methods for selecting features/taxa (taxonomic features) for inclusion in the molecular signatures. This approach allowed us to study the effects of downstream analysis protocols on the classification accuracy of molecular signatures.",

Detailed results and statistical comparison are given in Table S2 (for classification accuracy) and Table S3 (for number of selected features/taxa) in Supplementary Information.

The GLL feature/taxa selection method outperforms 34 of the 36 comparator methods on average over four classification tasks. While there are 2 methods (RFVS1 and RFVS2) that yield slightly higher classification accuracy than GLL, the differences in accuracy are not statistically significant. With respect to the number of selected features/taxa, GLL selects fewer features/taxa than 24 of the 36 comparator methods (including RFVS1 and RFVS2) on average over the four classification tasks. There are 12 methods that select fewer features than GLL (6 of these 12 methods select significantly fewer features), however there is no single method that both selects fewer features and yields higher classification accuracy than GLL.

The PL and PN specimens also showed decreased taxonomic richness and distribution evenness (Shannon index) compared with the CC (Control samples). These differences could be explained by the combined increased abundance of the four major skin-associated genera (Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus). The univariate analysis using the AUC determined that the three genera Cupriavidus, Methylobacterium, and Schlegelella statistically significantly (at 5% alpha-level) classify the groups of specimens. Interestingly, these genera also often participate in the multivariate molecular signatures of psoriasis constructed in the present study (detailed comparison is provided in Table S6 in Supplementary Information). Finally, based on partitioning around medoids clustering, the ecological study identified two distinct cutaneotypes: (1) Proteobacteria-associated, and (2) Firmicutes- and Actinobacteria-associated. Cutaneotype 2 was enriched in PL specimens compared to CC (OR 3.52 [1.44\u20138.98], p < 0.01).",

Specifically, this means that under sufficient assumptions of the method15, which are commonly accepted and used in causal discovery research16, GLL will output from observational data the set of direct causes, direct effects, and (optionally, depending on the version of GLL) direct causes of direct effects of the response variable (in this study, the response variable is a binary indicator of the phenotype). This theory has been tested in both biological and non-biological fields; see for example15,17,18. The output of non-causal feature selection methods, which are comparator methods used in this study, cannot in general be interpreted causally and often results in associated variables that do not have a causal relation with the phenotype; they can merely be passengers15,17,19. Nevertheless, we consider the current work to be an initial step in the discovery process. To causally validate and interpret the findings, several considerations must be addressed: the genetic composition and immune status of the host, prior exposure and entrance routes of potential pathogens, pathogenetic mechanisms of implicated taxa, and functional assessment of the impact of microbial community composition on the observed phenotype.",

We have shown that the accuracy of molecular signatures depends on the DNA sequencing and downstream analysis protocols. Using the 16S rRNA data from the V3\u2013V5 locus leads to accurate and statistically significant molecular signatures, whereas data from the V1\u2013V3 locus carries limited diagnostic signal. With respect to the downstream analysis protocol, our results suggest that the Markov boundary-based Generalized Local Learning (GLL) method works well for this type of data, returning molecular signatures based on very few (2\u20134) features/taxa with statistically optimal classification accuracy. Furthermore, the features/taxa selected by GLL have putative causal interpretation. This warrants their further study and quantifying their effect on phenotype. The approach presented in this study was designed as a general-purpose downstream analysis methodology and as such may facilitate the design and development of microbiomic molecular signatures of other diseases in addition to psoriasis.",

A barcoded primer design was completed using a set of algorithms developed at the JCVI. PCR reactions were completed as follows (per reaction): 2\u2005\u03bcl of gDNA, 1\u00d7 final concentration of Accuprime PCR Buffer II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA), 200\u2005nM forward and reverse primers, 0.75\u2005U of Accuprime TaqDNA polymerase high fidelity (Invitrogen), and nuclease-free water to bring the final volume to 20\u2005\u03bcl. PCR cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation of 2\u2005min at 95\u00b0C, 30 cycles of 20\u2005s at 95\u00b0C, 30\u2005s at 50\u00b0C, and 5\u2005min at 72\u00b0C. A negative control (water blank) reaction was examined after 35 cycles. Samples then were quantified, cleaned, and sequenced on the Roche 454-FLX (454 Life Sciences, Branford CT, USA) as described21, and a read processing pipeline consisting of a set of modular scripts designed at the JCVI were employed for deconvolution, trimming, and quality filtering, as described previously21. Finally, we included in our analysis only samples with more than 2,000 reads (the median number of reads per sample was 8,621). The sequencing effort was statistically similar across clinical skin types. The above protocol was repeated to obtain sequencing data from the V3\u2013V5 locus of the 16S rRNA gene.",

The number of samples in the dataset for the V3\u2013V5 locus was smaller than for the V1\u2013V3 locus primarily because of the lower sequencing quality and yield at the former locus, however as shown in the Results section the number of samples was sufficient to obtain molecular signatures and evaluate their statistical significance. The passing sequences were analyzed using the RDP classifier executed at a bootstrap confidence cut-off of 80%22 and were normalized. This criterion resulted in processed datasets with 791 and 660 taxonomic features (relative taxonomic abundance at phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels) for the V1\u2013V3 and the V3\u2013V5 loci, respectively. These datasets were used for development of molecular signatures and assessment of their classification accuracy with the methods described in the following subsection.",

We used Generalized Local Learning (GLL), a supervised multivariate method, as a key technique for feature selection in this study15,19. Under broad distributional assumptions, the taxa selected by GLL are theoretically guaranteed to achieve both maximal classification accuracy and maximal parsimony for the dataset at hand15,19. In addition, because the GLL method is based on Markov Boundary theory (a branch of formal causal graph induction), under broad distributional assumptions, it returns the local pathway members around the response variable of interest. GLL was executed with a default setup: Fisher's Z-test was used for assessing conditional independence at a 5% alpha level, and the max-k parameter, which represents the maximum size of the conditioning sets, was set to 3. In addition to GLL, we applied 36 comparator methods/variants that have been successful in other types of genomic data, as well as recent applications to microbiomics7,23. The reasons for such an extensive range of methods is to shed light on relative strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art methods for microbiomic molecular signature development, and to ensure that we obtain as highly predictive and as compact signatures as possible from our data. In brief, these methods include: support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE)24; univariate methods based on various statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA test, signal-to-noise ratio, ratio of between-group to within-group sum of squares, two-sample t-test, and \u03c72-test23,25,26,27, denoted as UAF-KW, UAF-S2N, UAF-BW, UAF-T, and UAF-X2, respectively); minimum redundancy and maximum relevancy methods (MRMR)28,29; random forest-based variable selection (RFVS)30; least angle regression elastic net (LARS-EN)31; soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA)32; principal component and sparse principal component analysis-based methods (PCA and SPCA)33; threshold gradient descent regularization (TGDR)34; and using all features/taxa in the dataset without feature selection (ALL).

We chose to use SVM classifiers because they have high utility in many genomic datasets23, and have outstanding empirical performance in microbiomic data (see36 and chapter 6 of 23). Furthermore, several theoretical considerations warrant application of SVMs to microbiomic data: SVMs perform well in data with limited sample size, are relatively insensitive to high dimensionality of the data, prevent overfitting by using regularization techniques, and can learn both simple and complex decision functions35,37,38. SVMs were applied with a polynomial kernel; the degree of the kernel (d) and penalty parameter (C) were optimized by nested cross-validation over values d = (1,2,3) and C = (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100) as detailed below.

This protocol proceeded as follows. First, all samples in the data were randomly split into five non-overlapping and approximately equal parts (folds) such that each fold retained a similar proportion of samples from two classes. Next, four of five folds (80% of the data; \u201coriginal training set\u201d) were used for feature/taxa selection and development of the molecular signature, and the remaining fold (20% of the data; \u201coriginal testing set\u201d) was used for estimation of classification accuracy of the molecular signature. The molecular signature was developed and evaluated five times so that each of the five folds could play the role of the original testing set, and its complement could play the role of the original training set. Then the entire process was repeated 100 times with different splits of the data into five folds. The resulting classification accuracy estimate was the mean over five different testing sets from each of 100 different data splits into folds. Since the methodologies for feature/taxa selection and development of molecular signature have parameters that require tuning, each of the original training sets (consisting of four folds) was further split into a smaller training set with three folds and a validation set with one fold, and a four-fold cross-validation protocol was used to estimate accuracy of each parameter configuration and select the one with the best average accuracy for application to the original training set. This protocol avoids overfitting and yields unbiased estimates since the testing set is not used for development of the molecular signature (i.e., no \u201cinformation leak\u201d occurs from the response variable back to the model selection, feature selection, and classifier fitting procedures).",
