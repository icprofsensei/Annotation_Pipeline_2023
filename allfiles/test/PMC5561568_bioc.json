Despite this, the mechanisms behind the putative effects of probiotics are poorly understood. One of the suggested modes of probiotic action is modulation of the endogenous gut microbiota, however probiotic intervention studies in adults have failed to show significant effects on gut microbiota composition. The gut microbiota of young children is known to be unstable and more responsive to external factors than that of adults. Therefore, potential effects of probiotic intervention on gut microbiota may be easier detectable in early life. We thus investigated the effects of a 6 month placebo-controlled probiotic intervention with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12\u00ae) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG\u00ae) on gut microbiota composition and diversity in more than 200 Danish infants (N\u00a0=\u00a0290 enrolled; N\u00a0=\u00a0201 all samples analyzed), as assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Further, we evaluated probiotic presence and proliferation by use of specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).",

Several mechanisms behind probiotic effects have been suggested, including modulation of the endogenous gut microbiota [2\u20134]. However, a recent meta-analysis of seven probiotic intervention studies showed that probiotic administration did not affect the adult gut microbiota as determined by analysis of fecal samples [5]. Still, in infants and children, the microbiota is known to be much more variable [6] and easier to manipulate [7] than seen for adults. Thus, if alteration of the gut microbiota composition is a mechanism by which probiotics exert their beneficial effect, this would be expected to be evident in early life interventions. In the present study, we have analyzed the fecal microbiota of healthy infants at the age of starting daycare (age 8\u201313\u00a0months), sampled before and after a 6 months intervention with a single daily dose of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG\u00ae) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB-12\u00ae) or placebo. Additionally, in contrast to previous studies, we specifically assessed the presence and proliferation of the probiotic strains in the gut, and evaluated the effect on the endogenous microbial composition and diversity based on probiotic propagation.",

Sequencing data were imported into CLC Genomic Workbench (version 8.5. CLC bio, Qiagen, Aarhus, DK) and using the NGS core tools, reads were assessed for quality (QC report), de-multiplexed according to barcode (Demultiplexing) and trimmed (Trim sequences) to remove barcodes and PCR primers (minimum alignment score 17/17, discard when both primers were not found) and to discard reads below 125\u00a0bp and above 180\u00a0bp. Quality filtering (\u2212fastq_filter, maxee 1.0), dereplication (\u2212derep_fulllength), OTU clustering (\u2212cluster_otus, minsize 4), chimera filtering (\u2212uchime_ref, RDP_gold database), mapping of reads to OTUs (\u2212usearch_global, id 97%) and generation of OTU table (python, uc2otutab.py) was done according to the UPARSE pipeline [9], generating a total of 1096 non-chimeric OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units). In QIIME [10], the OTU table was filtered (filter_otus_from_otu_table.py/filter_fasta.py) to exclude OTUs with average relative abundance below 0.005% of the total community, resulting in 330 OTUs. Taxonomy was assigned (assign_taxonomy.py), using the rdp classifier with confidence threshold 0.5 (recommended for sequences shorter than 250\u00a0bp [11]) and the GreenGenes database v. 13.8 [12]. In addition, the taxonomy of selected OTUs was confirmed/disconfirmed by BLAST [13] search against the 16S rRNA sequence database. Based on PyNAST alignment of representative OTU sequences (align_seqs.py, filter_alignment.py, default settings), including an archaea (Methanosarcina) full length 16S rRNA gene sequence as outgroup for rooting, a phylogenetic tree was created with FastTree (make_phylogeny.py, default settings) and re-rooted to the outgroup, which was subsequently pruned, using Dendroscope v3.5.7 [14]. Taxon abundances (average classification: Phylum: 100%, Family: 99.9%, Genus: 91.8%) and alpha diversity (Shannon index, Observed OTUs, Pielou\u2019s evenness index) and beta diversity (UniFrac distances) were calculated in QIIME (summarize_taxa.py, alpha_rarefaction.py, beta_diversity_through_plots.py), with the sequencing depth rarefied to 10,000 sequences per sample for diversity analysis. OTU abundances were estimated by total sum scaling.",

A significant shift in alpha diversity (Shannon index, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, Mann Whitney) and beta diversity (Weighted UniFrac, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.061, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, Adonis) was observed during the 6 months intervention period (Additional file 1: Figure S1), which confirm a strong impact of age on gut microbiota in agreement with previous reports [20, 21]. At baseline, no differences in beta diversity (Weighted UniFrac, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.010, p\u00a0=\u00a00.226, Adonis), or alpha diversity (Shannon index, p\u00a0=\u00a00.868, Pielou\u2019s evenness index, p\u00a0=\u00a00.562 and Observed OTUs, p\u00a0=\u00a00.821) were observed between the treatment group and the placebo group (Additional file 1: Figure S2). Further, no OTUs were significantly differently abundant between the two groups after FDR correction (Additional file 1: Table S3). After the intervention, Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances did not result in visible separation of samples according to treatment group (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1a),1a), although Adonis testing revealed a significant difference between the unweighted distances caused by the specific presence of the probiotics as described in the next section. Estimates of alpha diversity did not differ between treatment groups (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1b).1b). Only two OTUs were found to be significantly differently abundant following FDR correction (Table \u200b(Table2).2). These were designated OTU_17 and OTU_50, and were assigned to Bifidobacterium pseudolongum and Lactobacillus zeae respectively by the GreenGenes classifier. However, a BLAST search against the 16S rRNA gene database revealed that they had 100% homology to the V3 regions of the two probiotic strains included in the intervention, namely B. animalis subsp. lactis and L. rhamnosus strains, respectively (Table \u200b(Table2).2). Testing for differential abundances at family and genus levels revealed only Lactobacillaceae/Lactobacillus as significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (FDR adjusted p-valuefamily\u00a0=\u00a03.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214; FDR adjusted p-valuegenus\u00a0=\u00a09.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221214), reflecting the increased abundance of the LGG\u00ae strain in the probiotics group (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1c).1c). Exclusion of subjects known to have consumed infant formula containing any type of probiotics at any given point during the intervention yielded similar results.\n\n",

Strong correlations between qPCR-estimated abundances of the strain LGG\u00ae and relative abundance of OTU_50 (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.79, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) as well as between qPCR-estimated abundances of the strain BB-12\u00ae and relative abundance of OTU_17 (rho\u00a0=\u00a00.89, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), confirmed that the two OTUs represented the two probiotic strains. When these two OTUs were omitted, an unweighted UniFrac analysis with Adonis test no longer indicated any difference between the probiotic and the placebo group (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.004, p\u00a0=\u00a00.670). By specific qPCR, both of the probiotic strains were detected in 91.3% of the infants that received probiotics and only in 1.0% of the infants receiving placebo (Table \u200b(Table3).3). The strain LGG\u00ae was detected in 91.3% whereas the strain BB-12\u00ae was detected in 95.1% of the infants treated with probiotics. However, while the LGG\u00ae strain specific primers produced an amplicon in only 2.0% of the individuals receiving placebo, the BB-12\u00ae strain primers, which are subspecies-specific, but not strain-specific (Additional file 1: Figure S3), amplified a target in 31.1% of the placebo treated infants (Table \u200b(Table3),3), suggesting an endogenous occurrence of B. animalis subsp. lactis as found in previous studies [22], or eventual prior ingestion of infant formula containing related strains. The qPCR-estimated abundances of the strain BB-12\u00ae (range 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 to 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 CFU/g feces) and the strain LGG\u00ae (1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 to 1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 CFU/g feces) showed high inter-individual variation. Since this variation may reflect differences in colonization resistance of the endogenous microbiota, we investigated whether selected baseline gut microbiota signatures explained the variation in the quantified amounts of the probiotic strains after intervention. However, neither alpha diversity measures nor relative abundances of individual microbial taxa at baseline correlated with the qPCR detected abundances of the administered probiotics measured at the end of the intervention (data not shown).\n",

Intake of each of the probiotic strains, LGG\u00ae and BB-12\u00ae, was set as the daily dose of 109\u00a0CFU. The amount of excreted probiotics was calculated as the qPCR-estimated amount of CFU/g feces multiplied with the average weight of feces reported to be excreted by healthy individuals at the given age, which is 80\u00a0g/day [23, 24]. A ratio of fecal excretion to oral input (excretion/input) above 1 was considered to indicate that probiotic growth had occurred in the gut. In this context, it should be noted that a considerable fraction of probiotics are expected not to survive gastrointestinal transit, and that even a ratio just below 1 may thus imply probiotic proliferation. For the strain BB-12\u00ae, a ratio above 1 was found in 86 of the 103 individuals (83.5%), resulting in a median excretion/intake ratio of 29. While these estimates may be affected by occurrence of other B. animalis subsp. lactis strains (which we could not differentiate from the ingested BB-12\u00ae strain by qPCR), abundance of this subspecies was on average more than 100-fold lower in the placebo group (Table \u200b(Table2),2), suggesting that the other occurring subspecies of B. animalis subsp. lactis made only an insignificant contribution to the growth estimates. For the LGG\u00ae strain, a ratio above 1 was observed in 46 of the 103 infants (44.7%) treated with probiotics, resulting in a median excretion/intake ratio of 0.9. Noteworthy, all infants with a LGG\u00ae ratio above 1 also had a BB-12\u00ae ratio above 1 (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2a2a-\u200b-b).b). This shows that both of the probiotic strains were proliferating in the gut of at least 44.7% of the infants receiving probiotics. Comparison of the intestinal bacterial communities of the probiotics-treated infants with detected growth of either the BB-12\u00ae strain (n\u00a0=\u00a086) or LGG\u00ae strain (n\u00a0=\u00a046) to the placebo group (n\u00a0=\u00a097) did not reveal any differences in community structure assessed by weighted UniFrac distances (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2c2c-\u200b-d),d), when OTU_17 and OTU_50 (representing the probiotics) were filtered out. Nor did we find significant differences in alpha diversity measures (Additional file 1: Figure S4). Finally, no differentially abundant OTUs were detected in this comparison (Additional file 1: Table S4 & Table S5), indicating that the composition of the endogenous microbiota was not affected despite proliferation of the probiotic strains in the infant gut.\n",

We investigated the impact of a 6 months intervention with daily doses of 109\u00a0CFU of these two probiotic strains on the gut microbiota of infants aged 8\u201313\u00a0months at onset. Community structure and diversity of the endogenous infant gut microbiota were not affected despite the fact that the gut microbiota is characterized by low stability and high responsiveness in early life [25]. Several comparable reports on probiotic treatments exist. For example, a previous intervention study with the probiotic strains BB-12\u00ae, LGG\u00ae and L. acidophilus LA-5\u00ae given to pregnant women from the 36th gestation week until 3-months post-partum addressed gut microbiota development in the offspring at ages 10d, 3\u00a0m, 1y and 2y [21, 26]. While significant mother-to-infant transmission of LGG\u00ae (but not of BB-12\u00ae or LA-5\u00ae) is reported, no effects on infant gut microbiota composition or diversity were found [21, 26], which is in line with our findings. Similarly, oral administration of B. bifidum W23, B. lactis W52 and Lactococcus lactis W58 during the last 6\u00a0weeks of pregnancy and subsequently to offspring at high risk of atopic disease during the first year of life is reported to have no effect on the endogenous infant gut microbiota composition and diversity, neither during the intervention nor at a later follow-up [27]. Also, 8\u00a0weeks daily administration of either L. acidophilus NCFM or B. lactis Bi-07 to infants aged 7\u201324\u00a0months and diagnosed with atopic dermatitis is reported not to change the composition and diversity of the main fecal bacterial populations as compared to a placebo group [28]. While these studies together strongly suggest that exposure to commonly applied (non-endogenous) probiotics in early life does not interfere with the natural succession and development of the infant gut microbiota, they do not consider the fact that probiotics may not colonize or grow efficiently in all individuals. In the present study, we thus further conducted sub-analyses stratifying individuals based on estimates of probiotic proliferation of the given strain after ingestion, but still found no support of the hypothesis that ingestion of the given probiotics alter the endogenous gut microbiota. Although our assessment may have underestimated the number of samples characterized by proliferation of the ingested probiotics, the selected samples with excretion/intake ratios above 1 represent the most extreme examples and would be expected to have shown an impact on gut microbiota composition if this had been affected.",

However, this does not exclude a direct impact of the strains on the host intestinal barrier function, gut associated immune responses and/or systemic metabolic effects, which may or may not depend on probiotic proliferation.",
