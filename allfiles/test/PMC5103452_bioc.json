Investigation of the HIV lung bacterial microbiome using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid has suggested a greater abundance of Tropheryma whipplei in the HIV lung [4] and no significant impact of anti-retroviral therapy on the bacterial community composition in HIV-infected individuals [5]. However, the impact of the lung microbiota on the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases such as COPD in HIV is unclear.

We have recently shown, using lung tissue samples from non-HIV infected individuals with COPD, that shifts in the lung microbiome are associated with important changes in inflammatory response in these lungs [7]. One important limitation of that study was that the microbiome was characterized in a block of lung tissue and as such cell-specificity could not be ascertained. Moreover, this study did not include any patients with HIV infection. Here, we extend these observations by investigating the interactions between the host gene expression response and the bacterial microbiome in bronchial epithelial cells of small airways collected from the same site in patients infected with HIV. The specific aims of this study were to describe the bacterial community composition of the HIV bronchial epithelium and to determine whether the bacterial microbiome of the HIV bronchial epithelium is associated with specific gene expression signatures of the host that may reveal the underlying pathogenesis of chronic airways disease in HIV-infected individuals.",

The protocol established by Kozich, et al. was used for the sequencing and subsequent data cleanup within the program mothur (V1.34.4) [12]. After processing, sequence cleanup, and chimera removal, a total of 3,559,398 reads remained. Data analysis was performed in R (V3.2.0) and R studio (V0.99.441) employing the vegan (V2.3-0) package [13, 14]. In order to adequately perform alpha and beta diversity analysis subsampling to the lowest total reads (3164) was performed [15]. Along with a 97\u00a0% similarity threshold, a total of 451 different Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were identified. Sequence data has been deposited in the NCBI sequence read archive under the accession number SRP068430. The corresponding metadata can be found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP068430&go=go. Alternatively, one can use the following link http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/ and search for SRP068430 to bring up the relevant information needed. The relevant samples used for this study are BIDC1-4, BIDC7-10, BIDC14-26 for the HIV samples and Neg1-4 for the background negative control samples.",

A random forest algorithm with Boruta feature selection [18, 19] was used to identify any OTUs that could be discriminative of specific clinical traits in the patient population (e.g. smoking status, COPD, etc.). Traits were chosen for Boruta feature selection analysis based on whether or not their PERMANOVA value was less than or equal to 0.1. We determined differences in the bacterial community composition between groups by a Bonferroni corrected PERMANOVA [20] of\u2009\u2264\u20090.0125. Robustly co-expressed sets of genes (i.e. modules) were identified in airway expression data using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) [21, 22]. Modules eigengene vector values were then compared to alpha diversity measures (Shannon Diversity, OTU richness, and evenness) and phyla measures using the WGCNA (V1.46) R package [21, 22]. For this analysis no grouping was performed by smoking, CD4 cell count, or viral load status as these variables were not significantly associated with microbiome measures. The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [23] was used to identify the most relevant pathway clusters for each module that were significantly correlated to the specific bacterial microbiome measurements. The top 10 enrichment clusters were used as a guide to discovering pathways that were most strongly associated with each module. A false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05 was considered significant. In addition to this module comparison versus microbiome metrics for our network used p-values of less than 0.05 as well. The OTU data was reported to the lowest taxonomic identification, either within the text or in the respective figure.",

The Shannon Diversity was 2.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54, OTU richness was 37.52\u2009\u00b1\u200911.83, and evenness was 0.59\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13 for this patient population (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation). The distribution of Shannon Diversity, OTU richness, and evenness can be found in the Additional file 1: Table S1. On a cursory overview, the phyla distribution seems to be quite different than the experimental background negative controls. However, there was only a significant difference in the relative abundance of the Actinobacteria phylum, following Bonferroni correction, between the HIV group and background negative controls (p\u2009=\u20090.003) [Fig.\u00a01a]. This would suggest that apart from the Actinobacteria phylum the other phyla distributions are similar to the background negative controls. A total of 23.8\u00a0% of HIV subjects contained OTUs that aligned to Tropheryma.\n\n",

Using a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) with PERMANOVA, we found no significant difference in the bacterial community composition between those with and without COPD (PERMANOVA\u2009=\u20090.10) [Fig.\u00a02a].

In COPD samples, there was a paucity of OTU4 and OTU15, and a slight enrichment of OTU38 [Fig.\u00a02b].

Our study extensively examined the relationship between the bacterial microbiome and host gene expression from bronchial epithelial cells taken from the same small airways of patients infected with HIV. We found that the small airway microbiome of HIV-infected patients demonstrated only modest differences in the global bacterial community composition compared with background negative controls [Fig.\u00a01]. However, we did not find any significant differences in the global airway bacterial composition between those with and without COPD, between those with elevated or reduced CD4 counts, between those with bronchiectasis, or between those with and without emphysema on CT scans [Fig. \u200b[Fig.2].2]. However, when we investigated individual OTUs using an unocrrected PERMANOVA threshold of 0.10 or below, we discovered OTU signatures that were distinct for those with COPD (measured by spirometry), severe emphysema (detected on CT), and bronchiectasis. Spirometry-based COPD was associated with OTU4, OTU15, and OTU38, severe emphysema was associated with OTU4 and OTU30, while bronchiectasis was associated with OTU1 and OTU38. More importantly, we found that measures of the airway microbiome including alpha diversity measures, phyla, and OTUs, were significantly related to distinct host response in the same airway as captured by gene expression modules. Many of these modules involved immune and inflammatory responses, cell signaling, and cilia pathways suggesting immunomodulatory role of the airway microbiota in the host\u2019s ability to process and remove irritants and aeropathogens. Additional work will be needed to validate this hypothesis.",

                    "text": "Our findings may be consistent with previous studies on the lung microbiome in HIV, which found Tropheryma whipplei as a discriminative bacterium in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), occurring in 13.4\u00a0% of HIV subjects versus only 1.3\u00a0% of HIV-uninfected subjects [4]. In our study, which used bronchial brushes rather than BALF, we demonstrated the presence of Tropheryma in 23.4\u00a0% of the samples. Although these data are in line with the previous literature, additional molecular studies such as a qPCR assay targeting a gene specific for the species would be needed to confirm that the Tropheryma we identified was indeed T.whipplei. We extend the previous findings by characterizing the host gene expression response to the bacterial microbiome. For instance, we found that Shannon Diversity and evenness were negatively correlated with genes involved with lysosome formation and immune response. This finding is consistent with the evolving concept that reduction in bacterial diversity is associated with an elevated risk of clinical infection and increased inflammatory response by the host [26, 27]. It should be noted that certain organisms independent of their numbers, are more likely to elicit an inflammatory response compared with others that are less \u201cpathogenic\u201d. For instance, although in our study we found that bacteria in the Actinobacteria phylum were significantly more abundant in HIV lungs than in the background negative environmental controls, these bacteria were not significantly associated with gene expression modules. In contrast, bacteria in the Firmicutes phyla (though less abundant compared with Actinobacteria) were significantly associated with several different gene expression modules. Firmicutes were negatively related to pathways governing cilium and positively associated with gene expression modules associated with immune response and transcription regulation. When we explored all correlations that had a p-value under 0.05 [Fig.\u00a03] the Proteobacteria phylum was positively associated with gene expression pathways related to oxidation/reduction and intracellular orgnaelles, whereas the Firmicutes phylum was negatively associated with these pathways. This data is consistent with a previous study which reported a natural antagonism between the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla in the oropharynx [28]. These data are also consistent with the evolving concept that the lung microbiome is propagated by upper airway seeding [29, 30]. We speculate that the host immune response is regulated in the HIV lung by the seeding of certain organisms from the upper airways into the lower airway tract. We posit that the predominance of Firmicutes phylum leads to a heightened inflammatory state. Additional studies into the host interactions with the bacterial microbiome within the lung will need to be completed to confirm this hypothesis.\n",

Previous studies suggest that Haemophilus influenzae is an important pathogen in COPD [31] and a recent study using whole lung tissue has shown that this organism is found in control subjects but not in patients with GOLD 4 severity [7]. Consistent with this observation, in our study Haemophilus spp was found in airways of patients without COPD by spirometry and without significant emphysema on CT scan [Figs.\u00a02 and \u200band3],3], although there were no correlations under and FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 when exploring OTU correlations with gene expression modules. Intriguingly, those correlations that were under a p value of 0.05 showed that OTU4 negatively correlated with both pathways involved with cilia and antigen processing and presentation [Fig. \u200b[Fig.3].3]. This raises the tantalizing hypothesis that up-regulation of immune genes which activate the adaptive immune processes may enable processing and removal of Haemophilus spp in the airways. However, this result would need to be validated in a study with more power to asses this relationship. Up-regulation of genes involved in cilia may have a similar effect. We speculate that COPD airways have altered immune and/or cilia function that may prevent effective clearance of Haemophilus spp. Additional work will be needed to validate this hypothesis.",

                    "text": "There are several limitations to this study. First, the findings pertain exclusively to HIV-infected patients. Thus it is possible that these OTUs may not help to distinguish COPD, severe emphysema, or bronchiectasis in HIV-uninfected patients. However, a recent study suggests that the bacterial microbiome between HIV-uninfected patients and HIV patients on successful antiretroviral therapy may be similar [5]. Second, no oral wash was performed prior to the bronchoscopy. This could have led to minor contaminations of the bronchial brush samples. However, it was reassuring that the findings of the present study were consistent with others that used mouth rinsing procedures [6, 29, 32]. Thirdly, all patients enrolled in this study had a clinical indication for bronchoscopy. While great care was taken to sample epithelial cells from uninfected regions of the lung, and far away from nodules or masses, our results could be confounded by these underlying conditions. However, we did not find the bacterial species identified by routine clinical culture in those patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia in the analysis of 16S, which would support that sampling was indeed from the unaffected portions of the lung. This would explain the fact that there was no difference in the bacterial community composition between those with and without pneumonia. Another limitation is that we were unable to validate the microarray expression results with RT-PCR due to the large size of many of the modules. Thus it is possible that some of the genes within the modules are not accurate. However, a module is based on more than one gene and in order for a module to be wrong the majority of gene expression values within it would have to be incorrect. Finally, it is possible that some of the gene expression could be accounted for by infiltrating immune cells that were taken along with the epithelial cells during sampling. We cannot conclusively rule this possibility out but samples in this study were obtained away from locations with signs of clear inflammation. Future studies in which the bronchial epithelial cell microbiome is assessed in asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals would help to clarify the relationships between the microbiome and host response, and in certain pulmonary phenotypes.",

It supports the hypothesis that diversity and evenness of the community are important in modulating inflammatory responses of the host. This study also shows how bacteria in some phyla and OTUs may be important in disease pathogenesis by modifying either the host response and/or ecological niche areas. Our work supports the possibility that specific interactions between the bacterial microbiome and host cells within the airways of the lung occur and may be associated with distinct disease phenotypes; these findings would require additional studies for validation.",
