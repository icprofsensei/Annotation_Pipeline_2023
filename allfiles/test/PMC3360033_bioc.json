Statistical methods, including Kolmogorovo-Smirnov and Wilcoxon tests, were performed to evaluate the differences in vaginal bacterial community composition and metabolites between samples stored under different conditions. The results showed that there were no significant differences between samples processed immediately after collection or stored for varying durations. 1H-NMR analysis of the small molecule metabolites in vaginal secretions indicated that high levels of lactic acid were associated with Lactobacillus-dominated communities. Relative abundance of lactic acid did not appear to correlate with relative abundance of individual Lactobacillus sp. in this limited sample, although lower levels of lactic acid were observed when L. gasseri was dominant, indicating differences in metabolic output of seemingly similar communities.",

Prior studies on soil, fecal and urine samples have shown conflicting results of the effect of storage condition on bacterial composition [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] and the metabolome [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].

Pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed using the same method described by Ravel et\nal.[22]. The QIIME software package [23] was used for quality control of the sequence reads using the split-library.pl script and the following criteria: 1) no ambiguity base 2) minimum and maximum length of 220 bp and 400 bp; 3) an average of q25 over a sliding window of 50 bp. If the read quality dropped below q25 it was trimmed at the first base pair of the window and then reassessed for length criteria; 5) a perfect match to a barcode sequence; and 6) presence of the 338R 16S primer sequence used for amplification. Sequences were binned based on sample-specific barcode sequences and trimmed by removal of the barcode and primer sequences (forward, if present, and reverse). High quality sequence reads were first de-replicated using 99% similarity using the UCLUST software package [24] and detection of potential chimeric sequences was performed using the UCHIME component of UCLUST [25]. Chimeric sequences were removed prior to taxonomic assignments.",

We sought to test the hypothesis that there were no significant differences between a woman's samples stored under the three cold chain conditions. The vaginal bacterial compositions obtained from two different storage conditions within a women were compared by computing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two vectors of phylotype proportions representing the community compositions [27], which is a measure of the distance or dissimilarity between these two communities. In order to estimate the extent to which community states of samples stored at two different storage conditions differ from each other, we compared the distances between these community states to the distances between community states of samples stored at the same storage condition. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [28] was used to show that at the 0.05 significance level, the null hypothesis that these two samples of distances came from the same distribution cannot be rejected. The null distribution of distances between community states of samples stored at the same storage condition was estimated utilizing data from prior work in which sixteen vaginal sample triplets were collected, each triplet was collected from the same women by a physician [19]. In order to demonstrate that the results were not sensitive to the choice of a dissimilarity measure between community states, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were applied to the following measures of dissimilarity: relative entropy, Euclidean distance, Euclidean distance applied to log transformed relative abundances, Bray-Curtis metric.",

Similar sequences with less than 1% dissimilarity were clustered together and detected chimeras were removed using the usearch method [24]. The processed sequences were then aligned using Python Nearest Alignment Space Termination (PyNAST) [32], and gaps and parsimonious phylogenetically uninformative characters in the alignment were removed. The taxonomic ranks were assigned to each sequence using RDP classifier v.2.2 [26] with 0.8 confidence values as the cutoff to a pre-built greengenes database of assigned sequences (February 4, 2011 version) [33]. The de novo phylogeny was built based on filtered alignment using RAxML method [34], and the phylogeny-based weighted UniFrac distance metrics [35] were calculated to assess the difference in overall microbial community composition. To provide visualization of the sample distribution patterns, a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was then used to transform the UniFrac distance matrices into principal coordinates.",

All 1H NMR experiments were carried out at 25\u00b0C on a Varian AS500 spectrometer operating at a proton NMR frequency of 499.75 MHz. One-dimensional spectra were recorded using a standard Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence. An 80 ms CPMG pulse train was used to eliminate signals from large molecules, such as proteins from blood serum. Each spectrum consisted of 128 transients with a spectral width of 12 ppm and relaxation delay of 5.0 s. All free induction decays were Fourier transformed with an exponential function equivalent to a 0.3 Hz line-broadening factor and the spectra were zero filled to 32K points. The resulting spectra were manually phased and baseline corrected using ACDLABS (version 10.0, Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc.). For 1H NMR signal assignment purposes, two-dimensional (2-D) J-resolved spectroscopy [36] and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) [37] NMR spectra were acquired for two selected samples. J-resolved spectra were collected using 128 scans per 32 increments with 5,000 Hz spectral width in F2 and 36 Hz in F1. The TOCSY spectra were recorded with a data matrix of 2048\u00d7128 with spectral width of 5,000 Hz in F2 and F1. Sixty-four scans were acquired and a mixing time of 80 ms was used.

The first principal component explained 91.69% of the variation, and the second and third principal components explained 4.88% and 2.1% of the variation, respectively. Samples collected from the same subject cluster together, and within-subject UniFrac distances were generally smaller than between-subject distances, suggesting the community composition of samples from the same subject were more similar to each other and consisted of bacterial lineages sharing a common evolutionary history. Furthermore, our results indicate CST IV samples (S02, S03, and S08) displayed greater distance than samples of CST I, II, and III. This finding corresponds to the heterogeneity in community composition of CST IV samples, which reflect a diverse array of facultative and strictly anaerobic microorganisms from various taxonomic groups of bacteria [40], [41], compared to CST I, II and III which are largely dominated by Lactobacillus species.",

While it has been recommended that tissue samples be frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at ultra-low temperature in order to maintain their chemical integrity [8], biofluids, such as urine and blood serum, appear not to require instant deep-freezing. Several studies [9], [10], [11] have shown that urine and serum samples were biochemically stable after being stored at 4\u00b0C for 24 hours, and that short term deep freezing at \u221280\u00b0C did not affect their metabolic profiles. Saude et\nal. [12] evaluated the effect of storage conditions (22 \u00b0C, 4\u00b0C and \u221280 \u00b0C for up to 4 weeks) on urine metabolites and found significant changes for a number of metabolites when samples were stored at 22\u00b0C, while the changes were smaller at 4\u00b0C and storage at \u221280\u00b0C provided a metabolite profile that best reflected the original samples. A gas-liquid chromatography study of the short-chain fatty acids in feces, a bacteria-rich biological sample, showed no significant difference between samples analyzed immediately after collection and those stored at \u221220\u00b0C for seven weeks [13]. In contrast, after freezing fecal samples, a NMR-based metabolomic study observed visible changes in short chain fatty acids [14]. Differences in sampling methods certainly explain these different results. In human biological samples, which are rich in microbes, unlike blood and most urine samples, one could imagine that sample collection, hence environmental change (for example, anaerobic to aerobic conditions) would trigger a shift in the metabolism of the indigenous microbiota that could alter the chemical and metabolic composition of the samples.",

While we were able to evaluate the effect of storage conditions on the metabolic make up of the samples, we had the opportunity to study the abundance of lactic acid and that of lactic-acid producing Lactobacillus sp. Lactic acid is thought to be the primary vaginal acidifier [42], [43]. Lactic acid has also been shown to be more effective than pH alone at inhibiting bacterial growth and preventing HIV [44], [45]. We observed the presence of lactic acid, acetic acid and some other small molecule metabolites (Figure 3 and Table 3). Lactic acid was most abundant in the samples of subject#S06, who was classified by microbiome analysis as being dominated by L. crispatus. Subject #S03 had the lowest content of lactic acid even though the participant had a relatively high level of L. iners (near 50%). We hypothesize that L. crispatus may be able to produce more lactic acid than other Lactobacillus species. However, due to the small number of samples analyzed, caution should be taken in interpreting these results. Because of the extent of genomic diversity within microbial species, it is possible that certain strains of L. iners are good acidifiers, and conversely, some strains of L. crispatus could be poor acidifiers. Of note in this study is the finding that samples from the group IV community state type contained lactic acid in varying abundance. CST IV samples have lower abundance of Lactobacillus sp., yet also had higher numbers of other lactic acid bacteria such as Atopobium spp. and Megasphaera spp. This suggests that the production of lactic acid may be present in a low-Lactobacillus state although levels of lactic acid were not as high as in the Lactobacillus-dominated communities (3\u201312% vs 18\u201327%).",

Preliminary data using 1H NMR spectroscopy of vaginal secretions confirms that lactobacilli are robust, with varying degree, in their production of lactic acid and that vaginal bacterial communities lacking significant numbers of Lactobacillus sp. also produce a modicum of lactic acid. A critical area of research remains the functional differences between vaginal community state types and their association with reproductive health outcomes including STI acquisition, and development of pelvic inflammatory disease and adverse obstetric outcomes. Future research should engage the factors that lead to development and maintenance of specific vaginal microorganisms and their role in mucosal protection from pathogens [50]. This research validates the use of samples collected in a home setting for microbiome and metabolome analysis.",
