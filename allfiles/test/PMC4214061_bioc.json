The species identified in the respiratory\nsecretion microbiota from such patients can be classified into those that are common\nand abundant among similar subjects (core) versus those that are infrequent and rare\n(satellite). This categorization provides a vital foundation for investigating\ndisease pathogenesis and improving therapy. However, whether the core microbiota of\npeople with different respiratory diseases, which are traditionally associated with\nspecific culturable pathogens, are unique or shared with other chronic infections of\nthe lower airways is not well studied. Little is also known about how these chronic\ninfection microbiota change from childhood to adulthood.",

At least some underlying factors that predispose to infection in\nCF, bronchiectasis, and protracted bacterial bronchitis may be shared (e.g., mucus\nhypersecretion or stasis, impaired airway clearance), whereas others vary (e.g.,\ninflammatory response, intensity of antibiotic use, physicochemical mucus characteristics),\nand the associated infectious microbiota could therefore differ at the beginning or\nthroughout these diseases. In support of this concept, specific microbes have been\nassociated with the pathogenesis of each of these diseases in culture-based studies. For\nexample, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nare traditionally associated with CF lung disease (11). In contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella\ncatarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae are traditionally\nassociated with both protracted bacterial bronchitis and early bronchiectasis (10), with P. aeruginosa associated\nwith more advanced bronchiectasis disease (12).\nTreatment regimens, therefore, tend to differ for each disease, designed to target specific\npathogens. Moreover, it has been suggested that these bacteria play primary roles in\ninitiating or driving associated symptoms (13),\nwhich could imply disease-specific infection pathogenesis. However, it is now known that\nchildren with CF have lung disease without detectable infection by P.\naeruginosa or S. aureus (14, 15). The identification of diverse\nmicrobiota in even healthy airways further complicates the task of delineating\n\u201cinfected\u201d and/or \u201cpathogenic\u201d from \u201cnormal\u201d\nconditions. Therefore, comparing the earliest stages of chronic infection for diverse\nairways diseases could be helpful in understanding whether infection begins (and drives\ndisease) in distinct or similar ways in different conditions.",

Here, we compared the core and satellite microbiota in three very different\ncohorts of children with protracted bacterial bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and CF using\nnext-generation sequencing and ecological analytical approaches. Because these study\nsubjects were children, and therefore at relatively early stages of disease, we\nhypothesized that these cohorts would have similar, rather than disease-specific, early\ncore respiratory sample microbiota. We then compared pediatric and adult CF and\nbronchiectasis respiratory metacommunities, using data from two of our recent adult studies\n(16, 17), to identify evidence of disease-specific changes in microbiota as patients\nwith each disease progress to adulthood.",

Alternatively, it could be that the satellite species play key pathogenic\nroles in specific contexts or stages of infection; for example, infection at any stage\nwith specific low-abundance or infrequent bacteria could lead to increased inflammation,\nairway damage, mucus hypersecretion, and/or clinical deterioration. Although these\nquestions are not fully answered by the current study, the relative rarity of any\nspecific species in each satellite group may indicate a consistent, general role for the\ncore groups in pathogenesis.

A\nstudy using a relatively low-depth sequencing technique, 16S rRNA gene clone sequencing,\ncomparing microbiota in explanted lungs from adults with end-stage bronchiectasis and CF\nidentified diverse communities often dominated by Pseudomonas in both\nsample sets (24). Likewise, two studies using\nthe same technique applied to sputa from patients with CF and bronchiectasis found some\nsimilarities and some differences between the subject groups, but no formal comparisons\nwere made (25, 26). In support of our results (17), a recent pyrosequencing study of 21 older adults with non-CF\nbronchiectasis showed their sputum to contain diverse microbiota (27). Studies of sputum, BAL fluid, and explanted lung tissue from\npatients at various stages of disease due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and\nasthma, sometimes comparing with healthy subjects, have yielded varying and often\nconflicting results, in some cases demonstrating disease-specific microbiota, and, in\nothers, identifying substantial overlap (1,\n2, 23, 28, 29). In all of these studies, the effects of therapies that could\nconceivably impact airway microbiota, such as intubation, steroids, and antibiotics,\nwere difficult to control for. Our results suggest that the microbiota observed in those\nolder patients, at later stages of disease, likely had similar (or identical) beginnings\nand diverged over time. Whether those changes resulted from features of the underlying\ndisease or from differences in treatment are not yet clear. Although the differences in\nantibiotic use among study cohorts support the idea that antibiotics did not have a\nprofound, lasting impact on airway microbiota (similar to observations from CF [8, 30]),\nand there was no evidence that differences in steroid use resulted in differences in\nmicrobiota in these children, chronic or repetitive drug exposure could have gradual\neffects (as indicated by longitudinal studies in CF [9]). Regardless, these findings suggest that factors intrinsic to airways\npredominate in establishing the early microbiota in these chronic respiratory\ninfections.",

The groups were not\nmatched for age, treatment, disease severity, or demographics, limiting our ability to\ndetermine relationships between microbiota and these factors. However, the similarity in\nmicrobiota among demographically and clinically divergent pediatric groups could be\ninterpreted to further support the concept of a common early pediatric respiratory\nmicrobiota; additional study with demographically well matched cohorts would be required\nto test this idea. Because the four \u201ccontrol\u201d children in this study\nunderwent bronchoscopy for respiratory symptoms (usually stridor [18]), they cannot be considered to be truly healthy, but they\noffered convenient comparison samples, because they had no clinical evidence of\ninfection. We did not distinguish between viable and nonviable cells in the current\nanalysis, due to the small volumes of many of the samples analyzed, and thus the\ndetection of a microbe cannot definitively be said to indicate its persistence (although\neven transient or nonviable bacterial cells could potentially contribute to airway\ninflammation). Similarly, it could be proposed that the microbial diversity found in our\nstudy and others is due to contamination by upper airway bacteria during sample\ncollection. However, the significant similarity in microbiota among sputum and BAL\nsamples from the children with bronchiectasis in our study, as observed in studies of\nchildren with CF (5, 22), as well as the high abundance of microbes in our samples,\nargue against this issue significantly altering our findings.",

These results indicate that different chronic airway infections\nbegin similarly, remaining similar even after symptoms have begun, but diverging by\nadulthood. Our findings provide a baseline to compare with in future, longitudinal\nmicrobiota studies of diverse chronic airway infections, which would provide vital\ninsight into the microbial determinants of chronic lung disease progression, and could\nlead to improved treatments.",
