Here, we report an analysis of 380 whole-genome shotgun samples from 100 subjects from the NIH Human Microbiome Project. By mapping their reads to 1,751 reference genome sequences and analyzing the resulting relative strain abundance in each sample we present metrics and visualizations that can help identify strains of interest for experimentalists. We also show that approximately 14 strains of 10 species account for 80% of the mapped reads from a typical stool sample, indicating that the function of a community may not be irreducibly complex. Some of these strains account for >20% of the sequence reads in a subset of samples but are absent in others, a dichotomy that could underlie biological differences among subjects. These data should serve as an important strain selection resource for the community of researchers who take experimental approaches to studying the human microbiota.",

Species of the human microbiota have been studied for decades, and the model species have been chosen based on culturability and genetic tractability, among other characteristics.

Our analysis took advantage of the last of these techniques, which has been evaluated previously and was used to taxonomically classify 22.4 billion 100 bp microbial Illumina reads (after subtraction of the human reads) originating from 380 samples from 6 body sites; this method has a very low percentage of incorrectly classified reads (33% at the strain level and just 0.0003% at the species level) [24]. The WGS metagenomic reads were aligned to a reference genome database containing 1,751 bacterial genomes representing 1,253 species [24].

First, it has difficulty distinguishing closely related strains of the same species, since reads that map to highly conserved genomic regions are assigned randomly to one of the strains. Second, species with a single strain in the reference database appear more abundant on the strain level than species with multiple strains, since reads are often divided among strains in the latter case. To make the limited but important effect of these drawbacks easy to understand, we ran two of our analyses at the species level in addition to the strain level to facilitate a direct comparison (Figures S5, Figure S6 and Table S2). An obvious limitation of using reference genomes is that the actual strains present in the subjects will often differ from the reference strain. However, the reads will be recruited to the closest genome in the database and the reference genomes have been chosen to be representative of the human microbiome [21], [9], [10]. The reference strains will thus be a great starting point for experimentalists.",

Our metric was chosen to represent the probability of a genomic fragment to be sequenced in a sample. The abundance of a strain was divided by the total abundance of that sample to obtain the relative abundance of each strain in each sample. We represent these data as a series of heat maps showing the calculated relative abundance of each reference strain in the samples from our set (Figures S2, S3, S4 and S5). To inspect whether the coverage maps generated by this method show a reasonably even depth across most of the genome, we visually inspected three coverage maps for each of the 30 strains discussed below: one each for the samples in which the strain has the maximum, minimum, and median breadth of coverage (Figure S1B). While the map for the minimum coverage samples is often sparse, the maps for the median coverage samples generally appear even.",

Because we do not report strains with a depth of coverage below 1%, the reported relative abundance will differ by at most two orders of magnitude. However, reference strains with a low breadth but high depth of coverage most likely represent genomic fragments that are missing from the reference strains that otherwise best match the actual strains present in the sample and can lead to an overestimate of the number of total strains present in a sample. Conversely, the relative abundance of strains with a high depth and breadth of coverage will likely be underestimated. The number of strains in a sample can also be underestimated. For example, two strains that differ from each other but are both most similar to one strain in the reference genome database will be counted as one strain with the combined abundance of the both strains that are actual present.",

However, the additional information provided by the whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data as compared to the 16 S data (Figure S7A\u2013G, Table S3) as it pertains to the composition of strains in a sample has not yet been explored quantitatively. Does WGS allow us to determine which specific strains are present in a sample or is this composition so invariable as that it can be deduced from 16 S data? To answer this question, we calculated an average rank order of strain abundance for each 16 S operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in the WGS data and quantified the degree of difference between the observed rank order and the average rank order (Figures 2 and S7H\u2013L). For most genera such as Bacteroides, the rank order of strains within the genus is highly variable among samples, suggesting that a WGS analysis provides much additional information beyond what can be deduced from the 16 S data. For example, 16 of the stool samples have Bacteroides stercoris ATCC 43183 as the most abundant strain in the genus, while another 10 have Bacteroides vulgatus PC510 as the most abundant strain. These two strains share a core set of 2585 genes, while 1192 are unique to B. stercoris ATCC 43183 and 1371 are unique to B. vulgatus PC510 (as compared using the Integral Microbial Genome (IMG) Platform (http://img.jgi.doe.gov/) [27]).

Here, we focus on strains whose levels are unusually variable across our sample set. We used two methods to identify these strains: the first involved constructing a coefficient of variation distribution and identifying its outliers (Figure S8A), and the second sought to find strains whose rank order of abundance across the samples was bimodal (see methods). Any effect such a strain has on host physiology would be prominent in some people and nearly absent in others; thus, strains with highly variable distribution patterns could reveal bases for microbiota-linked variability in the human population (Figures 3, S8B and S9A\u2013B).",

Surprisingly, 14 strains account for 80% of the mapped reads in the average gut community, while for the oral communities of the cheek, tongue, and teeth, 12, 16 and 18 strains are needed respectively. As expected, the number is lower for samples from the anterior nares and posterior fornix (4). Among communities from the same body site, the 80% are sometimes few and sometimes many: in stool, samples range from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 25 strains making up the 80% and in supragingival plaque, the range is 4\u201330 (Figure 5). Even in a community as complex as the gut, just 5 strains account for 50% of the reads in a typical sample (Figure 4C). If the analysis is performed at the species level instead of the strain level, the numbers are even more striking: 7.3 species account for 80% of the mapped reads in the average stool sample, and just 2.8 species account for 50% (Figure S6).",

Strikingly, communities dominated by the same genus can differ quite dramatically at the species level. For example, two common configurations of Bacteroides-rich samples are dominated by B. ovatus or B. vulgatus, while rarer configurations feature B. eggerthii, B. cellulosilyticus, B. fragilis, or B. dorei as the most abundant strain (Figure 7). Notably, for a typical pair of Bacteroides species, one-third of the genes in each genome will be unique. Given the heterogeneity of Bacteroides species, a B. vulgatus-dominated community may well be as phenotypically different from a B. ovatus-dominated community as either one is from a Prevotella-dominated community. Since enterotypes are most usefully defined as communities with important phenotypic differences, our results indicate that there may be more enterotypes than are currently recognized, especially within Bacteroides-dominated communities.",

To generate a crude estimate of how well the most broadly distributed species in our samples have been studied, we searched the PubMed database for the number of references that list the genus and species names of each strain in the title or abstract (Figure 8B). Surprisingly, of the 100 most abundant species, only 11 have more than 1000 publications; 64 have 100 or fewer publications. 44 of these 64 make up >1% of an average body site community (Figure 8B), including 13 common species from the gut. These numbers are remarkably small in comparison to the number of publications for common pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, 73,134; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 43,883) and model organisms (Bacillus subtilis, 20,362; Escherichia coli, 292,086). Importantly, the most well-studied species in this set had their genomes sequenced prior to the start of the HMP reference genome sequencing effort in 2007 [39], and in each case the number of publications rose quickly thereafter. Our heat maps of strain and species abundance will be a useful resource for guiding experimentalists to the key reference organisms for future study, including those with an unusually broad or variable distribution in the human population.",

At the time of our analysis only 380 samples were available for the 6 body sites. Sequencing and analytical processing of the 16 S RNA and whole genome shotgun metagenomic data was done as previously described [9], [10]. Alignments to the reference genomes were made using a random top-hit strategy which involves reporting only a single, best hit per query, and in the case of a query having multiple equally strong best hits (i.e. mapping quality 0; [41]), one of those hits was chosen at random. The method also includes optimized parameters enabling accurate taxonomic assignments of WGS reads and a detection cutoff of 1% breadth and 0.01\u00d7 depth of coverage [24]. The database of reference genomes used for taxonomic classification of the WGS reads has undergone a process of removing highly redundant bacterial strains [24]. In summary, i) the complete and draft genomes were categorized on a species level, resulting in categories that range from single strains to many strains per species; ii) For pairs of genomes with over 90% similarity on a genome-wide level based on genome-wide similarity at a pair-wise level, the genome that is longer and provides the most unique sequence was kept; iii) in the case of a large numbers of strains, a slightly relaxed homology (as low as 83%) was used and iv) bacterial strains that were collected from humans as part of the HMP were retained without being subject to redundancy removal, because these strains were deemed informative to profile human-associated microbiomes.",

To allow for the different number of input base pairs per sample and normalize across samples, the depth of coverage was normalized per 100 million base pair. In short, the average depth of coverage per reference genome was calculated using Refcov by taking the sum of the lengths of all the reads that align to that reference, divided by the total length of that reference. Because a single genome can span many references, the average coverage value was aggregated on a per genome basis. To obtain the normalized value, the total number of bases that mapped to the genome was divided by 100 million and applied to the average depth values as a modifier.",

The Shannon index was calculated with e as the base of the logarithm. Low diversity can be caused either by a small number of total strains in the data set or by strain domination of the body site.
