Based on culture data, the microbiology of both infections are similar, both involving Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus species. This begs the question \u2013 why would different patients start with seemingly similar infections and end with drastically different clinical courses? One factor is the patient\u2019s immune response, but it does not fully account for many NSTIs that occur in otherwise healthy individuals. We hypothesize that anaerobes, which are difficult to detect via culture and thus are under-detected, worsen the infection, favoring the NSTI pathology. Our objective in this study was to better understand the impact of anaerobes in\u00a0NSTIs.",

We found that a higher proportion of obligate anaerobes in the wound is correlated with increased BMI and mortality in NSTIs. The wound microbiomes of patients who died from their infections also seem to cluster together. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that NSTIs may also have a higher proportion of obligate anaerobes and higher microbial diversity compared with abscess infections. Lastly, we noted significant disconcordance between data obtained by our institution clinical microbiology laboratory and our 16S\u00a0data.",
