While excavating a Byzantine cemetery in Troy, we discovered calcified abscesses among a woman\u2019s remains. Scanning electron microscopy of the tissue revealed \u2018ghost cells\u2019, resulting from dystrophic calcification, which preserved ancient maternal, fetal and bacterial DNA of a severe infection, likely chorioamnionitis. Gardnerella vaginalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus dominated the abscesses. Phylogenomic analyses of ancient, historical, and contemporary data showed that G. vaginalis Troy fell within contemporary genetic diversity, whereas S. saprophyticus Troy belongs to a lineage that does not appear to be commonly associated with human disease today. We speculate that the ecology of S. saprophyticus infection may have differed in the ancient world as a result of close contacts between humans and domesticated animals. These results highlight the complex and dynamic interactions with our microbial milieu that underlie severe maternal infections.",

One species, called Gardnerella vaginalis, is found in modern pregnancy-related infections. The DNA of the ancient samples was similar to that of modern bacteria. The other bacteria species was an ancient form of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, a type of bacteria that causes urinary tract infections. However, the DNA of the ancient S. saprophyticus bacteria is quite different to that of the bacteria found in modern humans. Instead, their DNA sequence appears more similar to forms of the bacteria that infect currently livestock. As humans lived closely with their livestock at the time the woman lived, her infection may be due to a type of bacteria that passed easily between humans and animals.",

The high concentration of S. saprophyticus and G. vaginalis DNA suggests an origin in genitourinary tissue. To exclude an exogenous environmental source of the bacterial DNA and to further investigate the tissue of origin, we performed metagenomic profiling of the nodules, ulna and sediment from the gravesite. The similarity in abundance of G. vaginalis in the nodules and modern Human Microbiome Panel (HMP) vaginal samples (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7) points to a likely origin for the nodules in the female reproductive tract. The metagenomic profile of the nodules (minus their associated blanks) is distinct from the sediment, whereas the reads from the ulna group closely with the sediment sample (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8). These results indicate that the nodules were less prone to leaching of environmental DNA. Our SEM-EDS and XRD findings suggest that bacterial and inflammatory cells were replicated in calcium phosphate minerals (\u2018ghost cells\u2019); it is likely that this mineralization provided a remarkable degree of protection from DNA degradation and environmental leaching as seen in the bones. The ectopic, inflammation-related calcification observed here is an apparently highly effective mechanism of bacterial fossilization that rivals mineralization occurring at much slower rates in the environment.",

The\u00a0length distributions of the reads overlapped with those mapping to the X chromosome and autosomes, suggesting an endogenous, ancient origin (Supplementary file 1G, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5); we searched for but did not find similar bona fide ancient Y chromosome reads in sequence data from the ulna, the sediment, or any negative control (Supplementary file 1G). The presence of Y chromosome reads in the nodule but not in the ulna could be explained by a placental origin of the mineralized abscesses, indicating chorioamnionitis in the decedent while pregnant with a male fetus. Chorioamnionitis \u2013 inflammation and infection of the placenta and fetal membranes \u2013 involves an inflammatory response on the part of the fetus as well as the mother (Kraus et al., 2004), which would explain a female (maternal) origin of the nodular tissue with a minority male (fetal) component.",

Even in the core genome alignment, which contains just 44% of per-isolate gene content, we estimate that 20% of sites have been affected by recombination. This high rate of recombination may help to explain the remarkable preservation of genetic diversity in G. vaginalis. A recent study of Helicobacter pylori, which has similarly high rates of LGT, found that genetic diversity within the species has been preserved for more than five thousand years (Maixner et al., 2016).",

Molecular epidemiological surveys also suggest S. saprophyticus is primarily acquired from an environmental reservoir, rather than as a result of person-to-person transmission (Widerstr\u00f6m et al., 2007; Widerstr\u00f6m et al., 2012). These observations suggest that the bacteria cycle between host-associated and environmental stages, with seasonal climatic effects on their abundance in the environment.",

In addition to producing rate variability, periods of dormancy in the environment \u2013 e.g. during the winter in northern climates, as suggested by seasonal patterns in cultivability \u2013 would be predicted to lower the overall rate at which S. saprophyticus evolves (Bromham, 2009; Weinert et al., 2015).

This may mean that the ecology of S. saprophyticus differed in the Byzantine world, with human infections arising from a different reservoir of bacteria than they do today. S. saprophyticus is readily cultured from the environment around livestock (Hedman et al., 1993; Cherif-Antar\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016), and Byzantine era peasants in Anatolia typically shared their households with cattle (Lefort, 2007). This and other historical settings are likely to have facilitated spillover events and, perhaps, the circulation of bacteria that were adapted to both livestock and humans.",

In either event, it appears that S. saprophyticus can transition to a human pathogenic niche with relative ease. We did not identify any gene content uniquely shared (or absent) among the pathogenic strains in our sample, which suggests that pleiotropy underlies S. saprophyticus\u2019 flexible association with diverse niches. For many bacterial genera, genetic distances between free-living organisms and pathogens are larger than observed here, and pathogen emergence is a singular event characterized by genomic decay and loss of functions required outside the pathogenic niche (Parkhill et al., 2001; Larsson et al., 2009; Reuter et al., 2014). More studies and wider sampling are needed to fully characterize the niche of S. saprophyticus, but our observations reinforce the notion that the adaptive paths to bacterial virulence are more diverse than has previously been appreciated.",

S. saprophyticus, an organism the decedent is likely to have acquired from her environment, and G. vaginalis, a member of the native human biota, are the dominant bacterial species of the infection. S. saprophyticus Troy belongs to a lineage that appears to be uncommonly associated with human disease in the modern world, whereas G. vaginalis Troy nests among modern commensal and pathogenic strains on its phylogeny. This highlights the complexity of virulence as a bacterial trait and a potential role of interactions among bacterial species in shaping pathologic outcomes of infection.",

The details of these can all be found in Supplementary file 1J. As the elemental analyses of the nodules suggested a highly mineralized constituent, we extracted them in a similar fashion to bone and they are labelled as such in Supplementary file 1J hyphenated (\u2018bone\u2019). \u2018Bone\u2019 (nodules) DNA extractions, consisted of demineralization (DM), removal and freezing of DM supernatant, incubation of non-demineralized tissue with a custom digestion buffer (DB), removal and freezing of DB supernatant, organic extraction of one/both supernatants, and concentration via filtration. They were performed as follows. For Set A (Supplementary file 1J), multiple consecutive rounds of DM (with 0.5M EDTA) and digestion were performed on a shaker (1000 rpm), with the supernatant(s) from each round subjected to organic extraction and filtration. DB consisted of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5% sarcosyl, 250 \u03bcg/ml Proteinase K, 5 mM CaCl2, 50 mM DTT, 1% PVP, and 2.5 mM PTB. The breakdown of DM/DB rounds is as follows: round 1\u00a0=\u00a01 st 0.5 mL overnight (ON) DM at room temperature (RT), second 0.5 mL DM at RT for 24 hr, and 7 hr digestion at 55\u00b0C, rounds 2\u20135 = ON 1 mL DM\u00a0+\u00a07 hr digestion at 55\u00b0C, and round 6 = ON 1 mL DM only. For subsequent extraction, all round one supernatants were combined and all round 2\u20136 supernatants were treated separately: supernatants were subjected to organic extraction using half-volume of phenol-chloroform-isopropanol (centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 5m), the aqueous phase of which was extracted with 750 \u03bcl chloroform (centrifuged as before). The final aqueous phase was filtered using Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL 10 kDa columns (EMD Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA): columns primed with 450 \u03bcl 0.1xTE, followed by sample filtration, washed twice with 450 \u03bcl 0.1xTE, and eluted in 50 \u03bcl 0.1xTE. For Set B, nodule two, 1 mL DM was performed ON rotating at RT and the supernatant was frozen. Digestion was performed for 7 hr rotating at 55\u00b0C using 0.5 mL of DB (same recipe as Set A) and the supernatant was frozen. These supernatants were combined and subjected to organic extraction and filtration as in Set A. Set D, which was the ulna, followed the same protocol as Set B, except they were subjected to an additional initial 30 min demineralization with 500 \u03bcl 0.5M EDTA that was not extracted, and the DB did not contain DTT, PVP, or PTB and was performed ON.",

Extract input volumes into library preparation were 10 \u03bcl (L25-L13), 20 \u03bcl (L01-L20), or 25 \u03bcl (L28-L38, 1 a-1j, and 1a-blk to 1j-blk). In non-UDG libraries L25-L38, the blunt-ending step was modified with an extended (3 hr) T4 PNK incubation prior to adding the T4 polymerase, in the same manner as the UDG protocol. Double-indexing amplification was performed as in (Wagner et al., 2014) for 10 cycles each, with 20 \u03bcl non-diluted library template input (except L25 and L13 which were used at 0.1x dilution) and included at least one no-template negative control reaction. All reactions were purified to 15 ul EB with the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).",

The resulting assembly was imported into Geneious (v.6.1.6, Biomatters, Ltd, RRID:SCR_010519) and a strict (50%) consensus sequence was generated. From this consensus, 65 large contigs (880 bp \u2013 170,993 bp) that corresponded to regions of average coverage (and that did not span rRNA/tRNA regions) were manually extracted, which represented the non-gap regions of the assembly. As gap regions could represent indel regions (e.g., lateral gene transfer events), rearrangements, or divergence, these contigs were subjected to an iterative assembly process using a set of unmapped reads in order to attempt to span gaps and connect the contigs. The primary set of reads used for iterative assembly was generated by trimming 100 bp from each end of the contigs, assembling all original reads using the above settings to this set of trimmed contigs, and removing these assembled reads from consideration. A subset of the unmapped reads (20\u2013100% as required, depending on assembly success) along with the full set of contigs were then subject to iterative assembly using Geneious (v.6.1.6), seeded with the first or last 50 bp of a contig (settings: maximum gaps per read 10%, maximum gap size 2, word length 20, index word length 14, ignore words repeated\u00a0>8x, maximum mismatches per read 1%, maximum ambiguity 4, map multiple best matches randomly).

Trimmed paired end reads from Nod1_1h-UDG reads were mapped to the concatenated reference. All paired and unpaired reads that mapped were extracted and subjected to de novo assembly using Velvet 1.2.1 (Zerbino et al., 2008) with settings kmer 23, insert length 51, expected coverage 75, minimum contig length 24, and coverage cutoff auto (parameters for expected coverage were chosen based on previous observation of assembly to strain ATCC 14019).

Twenty contigs were excluded due to the top hit being S. saprophyticus, leaving a final set of 1187 G. vaginalis contigs (total length 1,435,761 bp).

Paired-end assembly of Nod1_1h-UDG reads to the final set of contigs with bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and removal of duplicates with samtools rmdup (Li et al., 2009) consists of 2,034,514 readpairs. Total reads mapping to G. vaginalis from paired end-assemblies are listed in Supplementary file 1L.",

CASAVA (RRID:SCR_001802) processed reads were trimmed and merged with leeHom (Renaud et al., 2014) (RRID:SCR_002710) using its ancient DNA parameter (--ancientdna). We restricted reads from the UDG-treated shotgun nodule libraries (Nod1_1h-UDG and Nod2-UDG) to those of minimum 35 bp length and blasted all reads against the GenBank nucleotide database retaining only the top hit. For all libraries, we additionally mapped to the S. saprophyticus ATCC 15305 (NC_007350) and G. vaginalis ATCC 14019 (NC_014644) with a customized version of the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (Li and Durbin, 2009) obtained from https://github.com/mpieva/network-aware-bwa) with a maximum edit distance of 0.01 (-n 0.01), allowing for no more than two gaps (-o 2) and with seeding effectively disabled (-l 16500), retaining only those mapped reads which were merged or properly paired [https://github.com/grenaud/libbam/retrieveMapped_single_and_ProperlyPair.cpp]. Molecules that were less than 35 bp in length, had a mapping quality score of less than 30, or were marked as duplicates based on both 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 coordinates were removed [https://bitbucket.org/ustenzel/biohazard.git]. We then pooled all nodule reads DNA originating from the shotgun DNA libraries (Nod1_1h-UDG, Nod1_1h-nonU, Nod2-UDG, Nod2-nonU) and the S. saprophyticus and G. vaginalis mappings and further removed any duplicated molecules found between libraries (Supplementary file 1L). For both mapping assemblies, the average coverage at each reference position was calculated using the bedtools (Quinlan et al., 2010) (RRID:SCR_006646) genomecov function and then averaged over 100 bp blocks and visualized with Circos (Krzywinski, 2009) (RRID:SCR_011798, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3). Fragment length distributions for all pooled libraries and damage plots for the non-UDG treated libraries (Nod1_1h-nonU and Nod2-nonU) were calculated through mapDamage2 (J\u00f3nsson et al., 2013) (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1).",

Consensus sequences were called and contamination was estimated using Schmutzi, which implements iterative probability models to infer the endogenous bases given read length and deamination patterns (Renaud et al., 2015). Contamination was estimated at 12% and 13%, respectively, for the round 1 and round 2 enriched ulna libraries. These estimates are consistent with estimates from other aDNA studies (Posth et al., 2016). Contamination could not be confidently assessed from the shotgun nodule library as it had been UDG treated, which obfuscates deamination patterns and thereby lessens the differentiation between endogenous and contaminant molecules. mtDNA consensus sequences were uploaded to the HaploGrep webserver [http://haplogrep.uibk.ac.at/] and haplogroups were determined in reference to Phylotree Build 16 (Kloss-Brandst\u00e4tter et al., 2011; van Oven and Kayser, 2009) (RRID:SCR_012948) and found to be U3b and U3b3. Haplogroup U3b was assigned to the consensus sequence generated from the first round enrichment of the ulna because there was missing data for polymorphisms diagnostic to the haplogroup U3b3 (Supplementary file 1E). All three consensus sequences shared an additional five private polymorphisms not diagnostic to haplogroup U3b3. 137 sequences assigned to haplogroup U3 were collected from all human complete mtDNA genomes in GenBank (18 June 2015), and aligned along with the Troy consensus sequence generated from the nodule shotgun (Nod1_1h-UDG) library with MUSCLE v3.8 (Edgar, 2004) (RRID:SCR_011812). It was determined that the best model of nucleotide substitute for this group of 138 sequences was HKY+I+\u0393 using the program jModelTest2 (Darriba et al., 2012) and the built-in Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike, 1974). A Bayesian Maximum Clade Credibility tree was calculated using BEAST v1.8 (Drummond et al., 2012) (RRID:SCR_010228) and TreeAnnotator (Drummond et al., 2007) with the nucleotide data partitioned between coding and non-coding and a strict molecular clock with evolutionary rates of 1.708\u00d710\u22128 and 9.88 3\u00d710\u22128 nucleotide substitutions/site/year following Soares et al. (Soares et al., 2009) (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6).

Additionally, the reads originating from the four nodule libraries were pooled together for comparison (\u2018Nodule Pooled\u2019). We mapped the libraries to a hard-masked hg38 reference genome downloaded from the UCSC genome browser [http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/] and recorded the number of reads mapping to chrX, chrY, mitochondrial genome and all autosomes. We first filtered for mapped merged or properly paired reads with a minimum length of 35 bp and a minimum mapping quality filter of 30. Percent coverage was calculated by tallying the number of positions covered by at least one read and dividing by the total genome length with masked regions subtracted. We calculated the coverage depth by summing coverage of all positions and dividing the total by this same masked genome length (Supplementary file 1G).",

One of these (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1), in quadrat x24, excavated in 2005, yielded 30 individuals from sixteen graves, including the woman described in the main text (Grave 14, context x24.177). The cemetery was dated to the early thirteenth century A.D., based on stratigraphy, topographical situation and relationship to other monuments at Troy, grave construction techniques and mortuary practices, pottery found in and around the graves, and comparison to other Late Byzantine graveyards at Troy (Kiesewetter, 2014; Jablonka, 2006).",

From the skull only the calvaria (cranial vault) was well preserved, the facial part including the maxilla was missing, and from the mandible only the left portion was present. No teeth were found, which is also due to ante-mortem tooth loss observed on the mandible. Both scapulae were present but fragmented. The right clavicle was missing; the left clavicle was preserved, but distal and proximal ends were missing. All long bones were represented; the proximal half of the right humerus was missing, right radius and ulna were complete, the left arm was almost complete, both femora and tibiae were almost complete, and from the fibulae only fragments remained (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9). Ribs and vertebrae were fragmented, and some thoracic vertebrae were missing. The left pelvis was well preserved, while the right pelvis was very brittle and fragmentary.

The corresponding calibrated date is 1154\u20131224 AD (0.98 probability distribution at two sigma) which is in agreement with the archaeologically established date for the quadrat x24 Troy burials in the 13th century AD (Kiesewetter, 2014;\u00a0Jablonka, 2006). The collagen yield of 4.5% and the carbon and nitrogen content (16.0% N, 46.1% C, atomic C/N ratio 3.3) are typical of results from well preserved bone, and the stable isotope values (13C\u00a0=\u00a0\u221219.6\u2030, 15N =\u00a0+\u00a08.2\u2030) suggest an individual whose dietary protein was largely derived from terrestrial plant sources. The diversity of 14C dates (460\u20131130 yrs BP, Supplementary file 1A) from the carbonate and organic fractions of the nodules (for example, the extremely young date on the 10% leached carbonate sample) is suggestive of possible ground water leaching and exchange. We made an additional attempt to date organic residues from demineralized nodule one, using base treatment (0.1N NaOH) to remove possible soil carbon contamination. This resulted in a very old date of 4680 yr BP, possibly due to the presence of residual refractory soil carbon (humin). Given these discrepant ages, the results for the nodules must be viewed with caution, in contrast to that of the bone.",

The role of commensal and environmental bacteria in the decomposition of soft tissues is becoming increasingly clear (Briggs, 2003a; Metcalf et al., 2016). Despite their ubiquity, however, bacteria themselves decay rapidly and are only occasionally mineralized in fossils, where they may be preserved in association with soft tissues (within-host environments) (Briggs et al., 1997, 2005). Melanosomes, which are commonly fossilized in association with colored structures such as feathers (Vinther et al., 2008), were originally mistaken for fossilized bacteria (Wuttke, 1983), an interpretation that persists in some cases (Moyer et al., 2014), but melanin, in contrast to bacteria, is very resistant to degradation (Vinther, 2016). Soft tissue fossilization relies on microbial activity to release mineral-forming ions and establish geochemical gradients, and microbial films (biofilms) may control diffusion (Briggs, 2003a). Biofilms, which are composed of spatially organized bacterial cells attached to a common surface and embedded within a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS - a glycocalyx secreted by the cells), rarely preserve cellular details, but individual microbial morphologies, such as coccoids, may become mineralized (Briggs, 2003b; Briggs et al., 1997).",

We interpret the coccoid structures evident in the images (Figure 2, red arrows) as the superficially mineralized remains of bacteria. The rounded shape and clustering (without chain formation) are typical of Staphylococci, which measure between 0.5 and 1.0 microns in diameter. The size of the cocci in the electron micrographs (Figure 2) vary between 0.5 to 3.5 microns; the range in size may represent cells with varying degrees of biomineralization (i.e. precipitation of apatite and carbonate on the cell wall) thereby increasing their overall dimensions. The structures in Figure 2 (yellow arrows) have an appearance typical of EPS, suggesting that the Staphylococci were organized into a biofilm during active infection. Given the likely origin of the nodules studied here (see below), the presence of biofilms is not surprising. Biofilms are commonly associated with chronic infections and have been found in many tissues, including within the amniotic cavity (Romero et al., 2008). Larger irregular structures (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2, blue arrows) more than five microns in size, are likely to represent neutrophils, which would be expected at the site of an active infection. The nodule appears to capture a \u2018Kodak\u2019 moment, with the cellular combatants of severe infection frozen in time by replication in minerals.",

Early morphological assessment of the nodules (multistratified concentric layering, overall shape and size) suggested possible renal or bladder calculi. Urinary calculi (kidney/bladder stones) are mineral aggregates formed under a variety of different physiological conditions (Balaji and Menon, 1997) and composed predominantly of whewellite, weddellite (two forms of calcium oxalate (CaC2O4H2O)), struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate - Mg(NH4)(PO4)6H2O) and hydroxylapatite (bioapatite - Ca5(PO4)3(OH)) with other, minor mineral components (Supplementary file 1C,D) (Pak, 1987).\u00a0Supplementary file 1D compares the relative frequency of these mineral components (individually and in combination) found within kidney and bladder stones in modern populations sampled from the US, UK and Germany, as well as material identified as possible stones from archaeological excavations. Most modern and ancient kidney stones (Supplementary file 1D) are composed predominantly of calcium oxalate, struvite and apatite, and in a few cases small amounts of ammonium acid urate and calcium carbonate (Steinbock, 1989; Giuffra et al., 2008; D\u2019alessio, 2005; Giuffra, 2011). Ancient bladder stones have also been shown to be comprised of calcium oxalate, struvite and calcium carbonate. Interestingly a few large stones identified in archaeological material (Brothwell and Sandison, 1967; Piperno, 1976; Szalai and J\u00e1vor, 1987; Hawass and Brock, 2003; Anderson, 2003; \u00d6zdemir et al., 2015) have a predominantly apatite or carbonate-phosphate signature similar to the Troy nodules (Supplementary file 1D). While most earlier works (1967\u20131987) lack specific elemental details, precluding a more thorough comparison, the recent analysis of an ancient bladder stone from Oluz H\u00f6y\u00fck showed it to be composed almost exclusively of calcium phosphate (\u00d6zdemir et al., 2015). However, without further molecular/metagenomic characterization, it is difficult to pinpoint the tissue of origin of these ancient stones, or to compare them with the nodules studied herein. Notwithstanding the small sample size, the absence of calcium oxalate and struvite \u2013 as seen in XRD and SEM-EDS analyses of the Troy nodules (average 42.3% oxygen, 42.1% calcium, 7.53% phosphate, and 3.18% magnesium, by weight; Supplementary file 1B) \u2013 argues against a diagnosis of kidney or bladder stones.",

Rates of stone disease are typically higher in men than in women (2.7:1, 2006) except in cases of infection-associated calculi, where they are higher in women (3:1) (although again these stones are composed almost entirely of struvite, magnesium ammonium urate, newberyite and ammonium hydrogen urate and not apatite) (Knoll et al., 2011).",

                    "text": "Dystrophic or ectopic calcifications of various tissues (resulting in calculi, similar in shape and size to urinary stones) can occur as a result of infectious disease, injury or aging (Giachelli, 1999; Ronchetti et al., 2013). Calcification of the placenta in particular is common, and is associated with both normal pregnancies and a range of pathological conditions. Placental calcifications occur in most pregnancies after week 33 (>50%) and are universal in post-date pregnancies (Tindall and Scott, 1965; Spirt et al., 1982). Chorioamnionitis, a potentially fatal infection in which urogenital bacteria gain access to the amniotic membranes and placenta (Redline and Frcpa, 2007), can also result in marked tissue calcification. When chorioamnionitis progresses to involve the umbilical vessels (funisitis), for example, concentric rings of calcification are commonly visible to the naked eye and umbilical cord mineralization may be so pronounced that the cord cannot be clamped (Kraus et al., 2004; Benirschke et al., 2006). Based on the propensity of placental tissues to undergo dystrophic calcification, the elemental composition of the Troy nodules, their appearance under SEM, the urogenital bacteria recovered, as well as the age and sex of the decedent, chorioamnionitis is a probable underlying diagnosis. Reproductive-associated infections can cause premature labor and maternal and fetal sepsis (Redline and Frcpa, 2007). These and other obstetric complications were undoubtedly major factors in the mortality of women throughout history (Sayer and Dickinson, 2013), as they remain today (WHO et al., 2014). Archaeological palaeodemographic findings from Late Byzantine Troy reveal low overall life expectancies \u2013 32 for females, 39 for males \u2013 and a higher mortality rate for females of reproductive age (Kiesewetter,\u00a02014), emphasizing the importance of pregnancy complications as a cause of death among women in this setting.",

First, while urolithiasis can develop at any age, young women have the lowest rates of disease across a range of settings (Romero et al., 2010). By contrast, paleodemographic data implicate pregnancy complications as the leading cause of death among women in the Late Byzantine world (Bourbou, 2010). Urinary stones commonly harbor viable bacteria (Tavichakorntrakool et al., 2012), and urinary tract infection with S. saprophyticus and other urease-producing bacteria may lead to stone formation (Fowler and Jackson, 1985). Elemental analyses of the nodules were not, however, typical of either infection-related (i.e. struvite) or other types of urinary stone. The abundance of human DNA in the nodules also argues for their origin in human tissue, as opposed to inorganic stone material with entrapped human cells. Lastly, a diagnosis of urinary stones does not explain the endogenous Y chromosome in the nodules.",

The median for reads (>35 bp, Qm\u00a0=\u00a030) mapping to the X, Y and autosomes were 45, 44 and 45 bp respectively and thus nearly identical suggesting that they stem from the same pool of damaged human endogenous DNAs found within the abscess. The damage profiles for these same reads, restricted to the two non-UDG treated shotgun libraries) clearly shows damage in those mapping to the X and the autosomes. While there is more noise in the Y, due to overall fewer reads present, they still have a decided increase in C to T and G to A transitions at terminal positions, again suggestive of their authenticity (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5). We used a Fisher\u2019s exact test to assess whether the number of unique reads mapping to the Y chromosome was significantly greater in the nodule than the ulna or sediment samples, despite unequal sequencing depths (893/33262468 nodule vs 3/4558127 bone). We found the nodule to have significantly more Y-mapped reads than either the ulna and sediment samples (p<2.2E-16 for both tests). There was no significant difference in the proportion of Y-mapped reads between the ulna and sediment samples. We attempted to sex the remains (i.e calcified nodules, ulna and their associated blanks as well as the surrounding sediments and blanks) using the method developed and published by Skoglund et al. (2013). Our input consisted of all reads\u00a0>35 bp, mapping to the hard masked version of hg38 with map quality\u00a0>30. As can be seen (Supplementary file 1F) all libraries derived from nodule DNA extractions are consistently assigned as female (XX). It is worth noting that in addition to this assignment (XX), all libraries also show the consistent presence of Y reads. The sediment has no assigned sex and the ulna is \u2018consistent with XX\u2019 but read numbers are low (n\u00a0=\u00a022). Importantly, blanks, also with low read counts (n\u00a0=\u00a01\u201335) are labelled as \u2018consistent with XX\u2019 with 95% confidence intervals (at those levels) of 0. Considering (a) that the skeleton is biologically female and of child-bearing age, (b) that the nodule and ulna share the same mtDNA haplotype, and (c) the relative abundance of X chromosome reads in both nodules, we interpret the significantly higher Y-mapped reads in the nodule over the ulna as evidence to support that the human DNA recovered from the nodule originated from that of two individuals, a female and her male fetus.",

The duplicated region precluded straightforward iterative or de novo assembly due to challenges in resolving which version was found in the same location as the reference and which version was found in the novel region. The challenges arose from the partially conserved, partially highly divergent nature of the duplicated region (which is problematic for both reference-guided and de novo assembly) as well as the short reads precluding the spanning of SNPs (haplotypes) by long paired-end reads. Proper gene sequences were established via a combination of (a) manually working inwards from the shared flanking regions with liberal assembly to manually determine correct sequence and (b) iterative assembly to de novo reconstruct highly divergent sections. For the majority of positions, the ancient versions of SSP0354-56 do match the reference genome and the novel copies are the 'unmatching' positions; however, in several instances, the reads support that the 'reference matching' positions are in fact on the paralogous copies instead of the homologous ancient SSP0354-56 genes. SSP0117, SSP0118, and SSP0788. As for SSP0354-0356 and their paralogs discussed above, the sequences of the Troy versions of the SSP0117, 0118, and 0788 paralogous hypothetical proteins were obtained through a combination of manually working inwards from the shared flanking regions with liberal assembly to manually determine correct sequence and iterative assembly to de novo reconstruct highly divergent sections.",

BaTS randomizes the taxon-trait values and uses the distribution of trees to determine null distributions of these statistics. The significance of the observed distribution of these statistics, calculated across the distribution of trees, is then determined in comparison to the null distributions. For our data, samples were coded as having either \u2018pathogenic\u2019 (n\u00a0=\u00a020) or non-\u2018pathogenic\u2019 (n\u00a0=\u00a06) traits. We found that the observed distributions were significantly different from null expectations for all tests (PS: observed mean\u00a0=\u00a02.0, null mean\u00a0=\u00a05.51, p<0.001; AI: observed mean\u00a0=\u00a00.265, null mean\u00a0=\u00a01.127, p=0.007; MC of pathogenic trait: observed mean\u00a0=\u00a019.0, null mean\u00a0=\u00a05.1, p<0.001). These results indicate that pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates in our sample are extremely structured by lineage.",

The authors hypothesize that the infection may have been linked with pregnancy, due to some Y chromosome reads preserved within the nodule. The preservation of the Staphylococcus saprophyticus DNA, especially, inside the calcified nodule is astounding, providing opportunity for reconstructing a complete, high-quality genome sequence.",

(Accurate sex identification of ancient human remains using DNA shotgun sequencing) analysis to the data from both the nodule and the ulna, and then illustrate this result with a main figure, since this differential diagnosis is a key finding of the paper. The Y chromosome damage patterns presented in the supplementary information are not sufficiently robust (due to the limited number of reads) to determine if the DNA is ancient. The number of nuclear genome SNP sites covered by one or more reads in both the ulna and the nodule is likely insufficient for an assessment of relatedness.

Human mtDNA genome sequences obtained from both the nodule and from aDNA extracted from the individual's ulna were identical. The authors interpret this result as evidence that the nodule and the ulna come from the same individual. Of course, the authors elsewhere in the manuscript suggest a placental origin for the nodules, via chorioamnionitis with a male fetus. This underscores the inability for mtDNA to facilitate confident individual identifications, since it is inherited maternally without recombination. Thus, the authors should be more circumspect in their identification based on this evidence. If this is DNA from a male fetus, then all evidence is indeed pointing to an association with the female whose skeletal remains were recovered, but please ensure precision when discussing this evidence.",

Human mtDNA genome sequences obtained from both the nodule and from aDNA extracted from the individual's ulna were identical. The authors interpret this result as evidence that the nodule and the ulna come from the same individual. Of course, the authors elsewhere in the manuscript suggest a placental origin for the nodules, via chorioamnionitis with a male fetus. This underscores the inability for mtDNA to facilitate confident individual identifications, since it is inherited maternally without recombination. Thus, the authors should be more circumspect in their identification based on this evidence. If this is DNA from a male fetus, then all evidence is indeed pointing to an association with the female whose skeletal remains were recovered, but please ensure precision when discussing this evidence.\n",
