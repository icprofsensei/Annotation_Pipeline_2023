Here we present a study of methods for surveying bacterial communities in human feces using 454/Roche pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene tags. We analyzed fecal samples from 10 individuals and compared methods for storage, DNA purification and sequence acquisition. To assess reproducibility, we compared samples one cm apart on a single stool specimen for each individual. To analyze storage methods, we compared 1) immediate freezing at -80\u00b0C, 2) storage on ice for 24 or 3) 48 hours. For DNA purification methods, we tested three commercial kits and bead beating in hot phenol. Variations due to the different methodologies were compared to variation among individuals using two approaches--one based on presence-absence information for bacterial taxa (unweighted UniFrac) and the other taking into account their relative abundance (weighted UniFrac). In the unweighted analysis relatively little variation was associated with the different analytical procedures, and variation between individuals predominated. In the weighted analysis considerable variation was associated with the purification methods. Particularly notable was improved recovery of Firmicutes sequences using the hot phenol method. We also carried out surveys of the effects of different 454 sequencing methods (FLX versus Titanium) and amplification of different 16S rRNA variable gene segments. Based on our findings we present recommendations for protocols to collect, process and sequence bacterial 16S rDNA from fecal samples--some major points are 1) if feasible, bead-beating in hot phenol or use of the PSP kit improves recovery; 2) storage methods can be adjusted based on experimental convenience; 3) unweighted (presence-absence) comparisons are less affected by lysis method.",

Amplification, sequencing, and comparison to databases allow the identification of bacterial lineages and their proportions in a community [22,23]. Uncultured bacterial communities have been studied extensively using Sanger sequencing to determine 16S rRNA gene sequences, and multiple studies have helped optimize methods [24,25].

Feces have been shown to contain a representative collection of the bacterial taxa from the lower gastrointestinal tract, allowing convenient sampling for characterization of the gut microbiota [5,6,27]. Linking the human microbiome to gastrointestinal disease often requires large sample sizes, so there is a need for practical specimen acquisition methods that allow analysis of large numbers of human subjects, focusing attention on methods for collecting and analyzing fecal samples. For that reason, we investigated reproducibility within a specimen, effects of storage time and temperature, and effects of lysis and DNA purification methods on the bacterial communities detected. Trends of interest often involve comparisons between individuals, so the variation due to the above factors within a specimen from a single individual was compared to the variation between subjects. We have also compared methods for 16S rDNA gene amplification and deep sequencing. With issues of sampling and analysis clarified, we are able to reinforce the finding that human subjects show drastic differences in the compositions of their gut microbiomes.",

Figure \u200bFigure2A2A shows that bead-beating in phenol (Table \u200b(Table2,2, method 9) led to improved recovery of some Firmicutes compared to the Qiagen method. Figure \u200bFigure2B2B shows that results were more similar between the MoBio method and the Qiagen method, though some differences were detected. Figure \u200bFigure2C2C shows that most of the storage methods yielded indistinguishable results, at least for proportional recovery within the major groups. Storage in PSP (Figure \u200b(Figure2D)2D) was associated increased proportions of several Firmicutes, though the increase was not as pronounced as with the phenol and beat-beating method. For both the phenol/bead-beating and PSP methods, the Bacteriodetes declined in abundance, likely because of the proportional increase in Firmicutes. Thus storage method had little effect, but use of phenol bead-beating or PSP led to increased recovery of some Firmicutes.",

Also present in each individual cluster are the two replicates from 1 cm apart, emphasizing the reproducibility of the method. Statistical analysis was carried out by asking whether unweighted UniFrac distances were greater within groups than between groups, then 10,000 label permutations were used to generate an empirical P-value. Clustering by subject was highly significant (P < 0.0001). No significance was seen for clustering by extraction method (P = 0.16) or storage method (P = 0.98).

Again UniFrac distances were analyzed for within group and between group comparisons, and an empirical P-value generated from 10,000 permutations. No significant clustering was seen in the unweighted analysis. However, using weighted UniFrac significant clustering was seen for the phenol-bead beating method (P = 0.041) and the Qiagen method (P = 0.0014). The strong effect of the Qiagen method was driven in part by the fact that the most samples were analyzed using the Qiagen method, so the sample size was relatively large. Comparison of each method to the two gold standards using NP-MANOVA showed that the phenol bead beating and PSP methods both achieved p = 0.001. Given the significant differences for these methods, we investigated which taxa were most strongly affected, and found that in both cases the recovery of Firmicutes was increased while the recovery of Bacteriodetes was decreased (asterisks in Figure \u200bFigure2A2A and \u200band2D),2D), possibly a result of improved lysis of Firmicutes with these methods (discussed below).",

We studied the following issues: 1) methods for storing feces prior to analysis, which is critical to the feasibility of sample collection on a large scale; 2) the effects of DNA purification from feces by different methods; 3) the effects of sequence analysis using shorter versus longer pyrosequence reads (454/Roche GS FLX standard versus Titanium chemistry); 4) the influence of amplicons querying different variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene; and 5) the efficiency of recovery of different 16S rRNA gene sequences from a cloned 16S rRNA gene mock community.

Slight differences were seen between replicated gold standard samples, which could be due either to variations introduced during sample workup and analysis or geographic variations in the composition of the stool specimen itself. The PSP method has several advantages, including storage of fecal specimens at room temperature for up to 48 hours, the use of a self-contained storage and isolation tubes, and a greater DNA yield than other isolation methods. No method of storage correlated with communities that showed a statistically significant difference in composition from the collection of communities from each subject.

The V6-V9 set yielded the lowest proportion of calls at the genus level, though proportions were similar to other sets at higher taxonomic levels.

This supports the idea that the sequencing method used is suitable for quantifying the composition of complex bacterial communities, but some caution is warranted. It will be useful to compare mock DNA communities made from genomic DNA specimens rather than plasmids containing cloned 16S rRNA gene sequences, and also mock communities of whole organisms. It may well be more difficult to obtain proportional representation in more demanding tests.",

Thus we suggest that where possible communities should be compared where either all were purified using phenol-bead beating or PSP, or all were purified using one of the other methods. In cases where it is important to know the exact proportions of Firmicutes, it may be best to use the phenol-bead beating or PSP methods. iii) Use of either 454 GS FLX or 454 Titanium yielded similar patterns dominated by the subject of origin, so either sequencing method can be used depending again on convenience. iv) When carrying out comparisons among multiple data sets it is important to be aware of differences among primer regions, and if possible to avoid mixing data from the v6-v9 region with data from other regions. v) The differences among subjects was the most prominent source of variation among communities. Consequently, any attempt to detect the effects of additional factors on microbiome composition, such as disease state, diet, drug use, etc., will need to take in to account the substantial variation among individuals.",
