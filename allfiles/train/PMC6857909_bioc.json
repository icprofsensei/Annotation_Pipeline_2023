For example, approximately one-third of female patients with NMDAR encephalitis have an ovarian teratoma, which contains neuronal elements expressing NMDAR and is thought to trigger the encephalitis.16,27 In contrast, tumors are rare in patients with NMOSD. Another potential difference is the role of T cells for disease. Although T cells in patients with NMOSD proliferate in response to AQP4 protein,26,28 no such role has yet been established for T cells from patients with NMDAR encephalitis. In fact, neuropathologic findings including the absence of relevant numbers of T cells in the brain suggested that NMDAR encephalitis is a predominantly humoral autoimmune disease.27,29 Furthermore, molecular mimicry of NMOSD T cells between AQP4 and a Clostridium protein might contribute to NMOSD pathogenesis, whereas no cross-reaction of T cells and antibodies were so far observed in NMDAR encephalitis. The absence of detection of a consistent infectious agent makes an immune response by molecular mimicry unlikely.14",
