Controls were individuals accompanying patients to clinics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), other than clinics where patients with PDAC or IPMN were seen. Since there is no defined population from which patients with PDAC at MSKCC come, this method enabled us to enroll individuals who are likely to be similar in background characteristics to the patients with PDAC. Patients with IPMNs were being followed at MSKCC. Thirty-two had surgery for their IPMN; those who did not have surgery had IPMNs detected by endoscopic ultrasound and elevated cyst-fluid CEA levels (>= 200 ng/dl).",

Other frequent reasons for being ineligible were recent use of antibiotics (9%), smoking (8%), and not speaking English (7%). Seventeen percent of the cases declined to take part, most before screening for eligibility. For controls, 182 individuals who were visitors accompanying patients at MSK clinics were approached; 33% declined (most before screening for eligibility) and 30% were ineligible. Reasons for being ineligible were similar to those in the cases, excluding cancer therapy. We approached 75 patients with IPMNs; 31 were ineligible and 4 declined (one was later excluded).

DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of TE buffer with 100 \u00b5l/ml RNase. The QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for DNA purification, and the Invitrogen Qubit fluorescence assay (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA) for quantifying DNA. For amplification of samples, duplicate 50-\u00b5l PCR reactions were performed with primers designed to amplify the V4\u2013V5 regions using universal primers 563F (5'-nnnnnnnn-NNNNNNNNNNNN-AYTGGGYDTAAAGNG-3') and 926R (5\u2032- nnnnnnnn-NNNNNNNNNNNN-CCGTCAATTYHTTTRAGT-3\u2032). The primers were preceded by a unique 12-base barcode to identify samples [17]. Quality control measures included use of extraction blanks and PCR blanks to ensure that they do not contain amplicons prior to sequencing. All but one sample (from a patient with IPMN) were successfully amplified. Replicate PCR products were pooled and amplicons were purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Illumina barcodes and adaptors were ligated on using the Ilumina TruSeq Sample Preparation protocol. The completed library was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform following the manufacturer\u2019s recommended procedures with a paired end 250\u00d7250 bp kit. Sequence data were compiled and processed using MOTHUR [18]. Paired-end read files were converted to standard FASTQ format before being merged. Poor quality sequences were excluded from the analysis. Sequences were aligned to the 16S rRNA gene, using as template the SILVA reference alignment [19], and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [20] with the default scoring options. Potentially chimeric sequences were removed using the UChime algorithm [21]. After filtering, 2000 sequences were randomly selected from the filtered reads for each individual for analysis. To minimize the effect of pyrosequencing errors in overestimating microbial diversity [22], rare abundance sequences that differ in 1 or 2 nucleotides from a high abundant sequence were merged to the high abundant sequence using the pre.cluster option in MOTHUR. Sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the furthest neighbor algorithm. Sequences with distance-based similarity of 97% or greater were assigned to the same OTU. Each sequence was classified using a modified in-house database containing sequences from GreenGenes 99 and retrieved 16S sequences from Genbank through the Bayesian classifier algorithm described by Wang and colleagues with the bootstrap cutoff of 60% [23]. The relative abundance of the microbiota is represented by the percentages of the classified taxa sequences out of the total sequences present in the sample.",

Similar comparisons were made between PDAC cases and those with IPMNs. Because of differences in the gender and age distribution of the groups, we used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these variables adjusted for gender and age (<60, 60\u201369, >=70). Several measures were used to evaluate potential differences in the oral microbiota between groups. The non-parametric (NP) Shannon Index and Inverse Simpson statistic were used to evaluate the richness (number of species) of microbial communities and the evenness of their distribution in each individual (alpha diversity, or the diversity within each sample [24]). We also compared the groups with respect to species richness (the number of OTUs). Higher scores indicate more diversity. We calculated means and standard deviations on these measures for each of the three groups. We also used LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size) analysis [25] to evaluate global differences between groups in the overall distribution of taxa, using the non-parametric Kruskal Wallis statistic. For those taxa for which there were statistically significant overall differences, a second step tested each pairwise comparison to determine which pairs differed, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The results were then used to construct a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model that ranked the individual taxa according to the effect size with which they differentiate between groups. We also compared the mean relative proportions of individual taxa between cases and controls, and between cases with PDAC and those with IPMNs, using t-tests, considering those taxa for which the mean relative proportion among all respondents was >=1% and excluding those that were unclassified; this resulted in a total of 68 taxa (Supplemental Table). As another way of comparing the groups, we used qualitative (unweighted) UniFrac [26] to obtain distance measures that reflect differences in phylogenetic lineages among groups. Each pair of participants was compared with respect to the unique fraction of phylogenetic branches that they shared [27]. Based on these data, principal component analysis was used to determine how individuals clustered, based on their similarity.",

The variables included: respondent characteristics (age, gender); risk factors for PDAC (body mass index (BMI), diabetes, smoking history (past/never), allergies); oral health factors (number of missing teeth, history of gum disease, number of dental visits for checkups in the past 10 years, use of mouthwash at least once a week); and prior use of antibiotics and use of alcohol. Because of our small sample size, and because there were few differences between IPMNs and controls, we combined these two groups for this analysis. Among the variables studied, only age and use of mouthwash were consistently related to the mean relative proportions of specific taxa; therefore we used regression models to obtain p values adjusted for age (<70 and >=70) and mouthwash use (yes/no) for analysis of individual taxa.",

Patients with PDAC reported significantly less use of antibiotics than IPMN cases. PDAC patients were more likely to be non-drinkers (Table 1).

In Table 3, comparing individual taxa between PDAC cases and IPMNs, we observed that for Firmicutes and related taxa, the mean relative proportions among the IPMNs were lower than that among the PDAC cases, and generally similar to that in the controls. These adjusted differences between PDAC and IPMNs were nominally significant (p<0.05), but few were significant after correction for multiple comparisons. For other taxa, the mean relative proportion among IPMNs was generally between that for the cases and the controls. Adjustment for age and mouthwash use did not influence results (unadjusted data not shown). LDA confirmed some of these differences, and also identified some others. There were no differences between the 12 patients whose IPMNs showed more dysplasia and those with mild or moderate dysplasia (data not shown). Principal component analysis based on UniFrac measures did not indicate presence of clusters and explained <4% of the variance.",

The only exceptions were that individuals who consumed alcohol had somewhat lower diversity on the NP Shannon index (5.1 vs 5.4, p=0.03) and lower richness (590.7 vs 663.9, p=0.03). For the 17 individual taxa with significant differences between cases and controls, we found that age had a consistent influence, with Proteobacteria and related taxa having higher mean relative proportions in respondents <70 years of age. Regular use of mouthwash in the past 5 years also influenced the mean relative proportions of the taxa studied: users had higher levels of Firmicutes and related taxa, while non-users had higher levels of Proteobacteria and related taxa (Table 4). Women and former smokers had higher levels of Haemophilus and H. parainfluenzae, and those with fewer teeth missing also had higher levels of H. parainfluenzae. Individuals with diabetes had higher levels of Betaproteobacteria, Neisseriales, Neisseriaceae, and Neisseria. Those who consumed alcohol had lower mean relative proportion of Firmicutes and higher levels of N. flavicens. There were no statistically significant differences in mean relative proportion of the taxa studied according to BMI, allergies, history of gum disease, number of dental visits for checkups in the past 10 years, or prior use of antibiotics (Table 4).",

We observed some differences in the mean relative proportions of specific taxa, with PDAC cases having higher levels of Firmicutes and related taxa, and controls having higher levels of Proteobacteria and related taxa. Differences between patients with PDAC and IPMNs generally mirrored those between PDAC cases and controls, although fewer comparisons were statistically significant. This reflects both the generally smaller differences between PDAC cases and IPMN cases as well as the smaller sample size for IPMNs than for controls.",

Farrell et al [29] reported lower proportions of both N. elongata and S. mitis in cases compared to controls. Our results for N. elongata were in the same direction as those reported by Farrell et al [29] but our results for S. mitis were not; the mean relative proportions were very low for these species.

Other results showed that taxa within Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla were associated with decreased or increased risk of PDAC, respectively. We did not find similar results in our study. Other prospective studies have also highlighted a role for P. gingivalis. In one study [13], higher levels of serum IgG to P. gingivalis were associated with death from orodigestive cancer in individuals with normal dental exams, although pancreatic cancer was not reported separately. In another study [14], high levels of antibodies to P. gingivalis ATTC 53978 increased risk of PDAC two-fold while respondents with overall higher levels of antibodies had 45% lower risk. Our study did not find P. gingivalis in any samples, and the associated phylum, class, order, family, and genus were not found to be different in cases and controls. The other case-control studies also did not report on P. gingivalis. It is possible that P. gingivalis was present in our study participants but that the primers used may not have amplified these bacteria. Changes in the oral microbiota related to presence of disease may also have influenced these results.",

In a study of male smokers, those who had lost all their teeth were at 63% increased risk of pancreatic cancer compared to those missing 10 or fewer teeth [12]. In contrast, the number of missing teeth was not related to risk of death from pancreatic cancer in a cohort of elderly Japanese [32]. Among male health professionals, self-reported periodontal disease significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer, particularly in those who also reported tooth loss [15]. Using data from the National Health and Examination Study, in which periodontitis was ascertained by clinical exam, Ahn and colleagues [13] found at least doubled risk of death from any orodigestive cancer (including pancreatic cancer) and from pancreatic cancer in those with periodontitis; there were only 18 deaths from pancreatic cancer in this young cohort. While these studies present mostly consistent evidence of associations with pancreatic cancer, it is not clear which particular aspects of oral health are important for risk.",

There were some differences according to alcohol use, age, and use of mouthwash, indicating that these factors should be considered in planning future studies of the oral microbiota. We are not aware of other publications that have reported on how these factors influence the oral microbiota. In our study we sought to avoid the influence of smoking (within one year) and antibiotic use (within 30 days) by exclusion criteria. A number of studies have reported that smokers and non-smokers differ in the oral microbiota [33\u201335] and other aspects of oral health [36,37]. Differences between smokers and non-smokers have also been noted in studies of the microbiota at other sites [38,39].",

We limited eligibility for PDAC cases to those without prior treatment for pancreatic cancer, to avoid any possible effects of systemic treatment on the oral microbiota; we are not aware of data on the influence of chemotherapy on oral microbiota. Although all cases with PDAC were diagnosed within 3 months of enrollment, they may have been atypical of patients at our institution because they were too ill for consideration for treatment. Studies of the oral microbiota before and after treatment would help determine whether case-control studies are feasible for this investigation, or whether prospective studies are needed. Another potential limitation is that the oral samples were taken at only one time. Overall, based on this pilot study, the oral microbiota does not seem to be strongly related to risk of PDAC or IPMNs; however, differences in mean relative proportions of individual taxa should be evaluated in larger studies. Larger studies are also needed to address more thoroughly the question of confounding of associations between case-control status by respondent characteristics.",
