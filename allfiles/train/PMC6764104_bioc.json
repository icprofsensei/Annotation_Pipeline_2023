When compared with patients with inactive CD, the microbiota of CD patients during an exacerbation is characterized by increased members of Enterobacteriaceae11,12 and Bacteroides spp.,11,13 and a reduction of F. prausnitzii14\u201316 and Clostridium coccoides group,14,17 although these associations vary between studies. These inconsistencies may in part be due to differences in assessing disease activity, in applied molecular methods, and in study populations, but also to potential confounding factors such as medication use. Many studies are based on a cross-sectional design, comparing patients with active CD with those with inactive CD. Considering the inter-individual variation in microbiota composition and the heterogeneous nature of CD, longitudinal studies are particularly relevant.",

As for the baseline data, no discrete separation between RR and RA samples could be observed. However, the temporal stability in microbial community structure between two subsequent samples, as indicated by the weighted Unifrac distance, was significantly higher in HCs than in the RA patients [Figure 6b]. When performing similar analyses based upon the unweighted UniFrac, the microbial community structure of HCs appeared to be more stable than that of both RR and RA patients [Supplementary Figure 3]. We next examined whether subjects switched enterotypes over time. None of the HCs changed enterotype during the sampling period, whereas 9 CD patients switched from one enterotype to another, again indicating a lower stability in [some] CD patients as compared with HCs.

The present study confirmed previous observations that the faecal microbiota of CD patients is less diverse compared with that of HCs.33 This lower stability in CD was for some indices [weighted Unifrac] only statistically significant for the RA patients, whereas for other indices of microbial stability [unweighted Unifrac], both RR and RA patients showed a lower temporal stability when compared with HCs. However, for none of the indices of microbial stability did we find a significant difference between the RA and RR patient groups. Altogether, these results showed that HCs had a stronger temporal stability of the microbial community structure when compared with CD patients, regardless of whether these patients maintained remission or developed an exacerbation. Our results thus can be used to confirm that CD patients have a less diverse microbiota with larger intra-individual variations. Moreover, we observed that it was especially patients with colonic disease who had lower temporal microbiota stability.",

This might explain why previous cross-sectional studies, with large variations in medication use between subjects, have reported stronger associations between disease activity and microbiota composition. This suggests the need for longitudinal studies with repeated sampling to rule out confounding, but also calls into question the involvement of the overall microbiota in the development of exacerbations. Nevertheless, small shifts in [a combination of] specific taxa may be present in CD patients with changing disease activity over time. It is also plausible that patient-specific changes are present, but due to our focus on the overall microbiota composition, these changes remained undetected. Therefore, further analyses focusing on [small] changes in individual taxa are warranted in large groups of patients with longitudinal follow-up, taking into account disease phenotype, medication use, surgery, and dietary habits. The latter factor was not included in the present study because dietary information was not available, but it could be a potential reason for the lack of consistent changes in the microbiota community structure among CD patients.",

Subgroups of CD patients clustered apart from other CD patients and HCs have also been demonstrated in previous studies.6,23,34,35 Consistent with the recent study of Halfvarson et al.,23 we found this subgroup of CD patients to be characterized by lower F. prausnitzii abundance and low microbial richness, but in our study this subcluster was not restricted to patients with ileal CD. The existence of a subgroup of CD patients with a deviating microbiota composition might [in part] be explained by disease-related factors. We could, however, not find clear differences in age at onset, disease localization, disease behavior, disease activity before and after inclusion in the study, number of liquid stools per day, surgery, or medication use when studying the CD patients with a more deviant microbiota profile versus those with a more \u2018healthy\u2019 microbiota profile. It should, however, be noted that numbers were relatively small. Larger studies are needed to further characterize the subgroup of CD patients that does not cluster with HCs, and to investigate whether this altered microbiota might be related to a more microbiota-driven disease etiology or certain host or environmental factors. Incorporation of host genetics, metabolomics, and/or transcriptomics data in future large-scale studies could potentially explain the reason for this subgroup of CD patients. Using PERMANOVA, we did rule out the possibility that our study results were confounded by Montreal classification factors, medication use, age, gender, number of liquid stools/day, surgery, or original sequencing depth. We did find, however, a different microbiota structure in patients with penetrating disease. So far, the limited number of studies available has not been able to provide clear evidence for increased numbers of bacteria within fistula tracts,36,37 but it would be interesting to investigate whether such perturbations may impact the physical and/or immunological intestinal barrier, and thereby fistula formation.",

Although cross-sectional microbiota studies are restricted by the large inter-individual variation of the microbiota, most microbiota studies on disease activity in adult CD patients are based on a cross-sectional design. Longitudinal studies are able to circumvent this limitation. Furthermore, only small numbers of patients in each group [RR and RA] had a change in medication use between the consecutive samples, further limiting potential bias due to confounding. Moreover, repeating our analyses without these patients did not impact our findings [data not shown].",
