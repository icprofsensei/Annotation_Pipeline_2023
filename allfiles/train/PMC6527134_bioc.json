Pre-surgical disruption (dysbiosis) of the microbiota is likely to be associated with an increased risk of post-operative dysbiosis, potentially increasing post-operative UTI risk.

Extraction negative controls (no urine or swab suspension) and PCR-negative controls (no template) were included to assess the contribution of extraneous DNA from reagents. Ten-microliter aliquots of each reaction mixture were run on a 1% agarose gel.

Chimeric sequences were removed using UCHIME within the mothur package 14. Subsampling at a depth of 5000 sequences was performed to correct for different sequencing depth of each sample. The sequences were clustered into species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with identity cutoff at 97% 15. The OTUs were classified using RDP classifier (v2.11) at the genus level 15 and BLCA 16 at the species level. All the statistical analyses were performed with open-source R packages. For each sample, the alpha diversity indices, Chao1, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson, were calculated using the vegan 17 package in R. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) (ape package in R 18) was applied to cluster microbiome samples based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (ecodist package in R 19). K-means clustering was applied to confirm PCoA clustering results. Dispersion of the PCoA clusters was compared using the betadisper command in R vegan package 20,\n21. The PERMANOVA test, using the vegan 17 package in R, was performed to determine whether there are statistically significantly separation between different sample groups (e.g., urine vs. vagina). Student\u2019s t-test and chi-squared test were applied to compare the demographic and clinical variables (e.g., age and premenopausal status) among different urogynecologic surgical groups (i.e., SUI and POP). Using the glmmADMB package 22 in R, generalized linear regression with a negative binomial model was applied to identify the association between bacterial abundance and post-operative UTI status, DOS result, and PCoA clusters. Fisher\u2019s exact test was applied to examine the association between DOS/UTI status and PCoA clusters. Multiple testing correction was performed with the standard Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.",

The difference in dispersion was highly significant (p<2.2\u00d710\u221216). Women in the LDC were younger (average age 51 years) and their urinary microbiome was more likely to contain Lactobacillus iners (Table 3). The women in the MDC were older (average age 59 years) and their urinary microbiomes were enriched in a diverse set of pathogens, including members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, the genera Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, and the species L. delbrueckii, Actinotignum (formerly Actinobaculum) schaalii, Anaerococcus obesiensis, Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, Streptococcus anginosus, Aerococcus christensenii and Anaerococcus murdochii (Table 3).",

In the vagina (Supplemental Table 2), a few taxa were associated with a positive DOS result, but not a positive UTI status. The species L. gasseri and an OTU of the family Enterobacteriaceae were both abundant and enriched in DOS-positive women; the less abundant genus Veillonella and the species Bacteroides coagulans also were enriched in DOS-positive women. The genus Ureaplasma was enriched in DOS-positive women relative to DOS-negative women, but most enriched in DOS-positive women with a positive post-operative UTI status. In the perineum (Supplemental Table 3), two taxa were enriched in women with a negative DOS result: an OTU in the genus Lactobacillus and the species Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum. Others were enriched in women with a positive DOS result, including OTUs in the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Bifidobacterium and Peptoniphilus. Finally, a few taxa were enriched in women with a positive DOS result and a positive post-operative UTI status relative to women that were negative for both: the species Megasphaera massiliensis, Bacteroides coagulans, and Bacteroides fragilis and an OTU in the genus Enterococcus.",

This analysis provides important insight into the associated microbial mechanisms that may allow effective risk-stratification through pre-operative phenotyping. For most clinicians, absence of UTI-associated symptoms (variably defined) and/or negative urine testing (variably performed) has provided confidence that the patient does not have a current UTI. Yet, clearly, there is an opportunity to reduce the occurrence of post-operative UTI given our finding that most post-operative UTIs are related to depletion of Lactobacillus and enrichment of uropathogens in the bladder prior to surgery. The findings from this analysis extend the impact of our prior analysis 11, which demonstrated that a pre-surgical DOS standard urine culture effectively identifies a group of urogynecologic patients at increased short-term risk for UTI.",

Our findings demonstrate that there is a relative depletion of certain Lactobacillus species in their bladder microbiomes. Although the Lactobacillus OTUs that are present in the bladder are similar in women with and without UTI, there is a significant difference in the frequency and abundance, especially of L. iners. Clinicians have prescribed estrogen (often topical vaginal estrogen) with the intent of increasing or restoring vaginal Lactobacillus; these findings suggest that vaginal estrogen may also be a potential therapy aimed at improving the bladder microbiome in order to reduce post-operative UTI risk. The depletion of L. iners also was associated with a more diverse microbial community with a higher risk of uropathogenic taxa. Further research will be necessary to determine whether pre-surgical vaginal estrogen in hypoestrogenic, older women is associated with a reduced risk of post-operative UTI. If so, one would hypothesize that the risk-reduction mechanism may be associated with a healthier peri-operative bladder microbiome (more L. iners, fewer uropathogenic taxa and the appropriate microbial diversity). Given the possibility of uropathogen reservoirs in the vagina and perineum, such future studies should also include analyses of effects on these adjacent pelvic niches.",

We were intrigued to detect potential uropathogens in women who did not develop UTI. This may be related to a variety of biologic scenarios: (1) her immune system could resist infection, (2) the standard surgical prophylaxis effectively eradicated the organism, and/or (3) the bacterium detected by standard culture was a non-pathogenic strain of a known uropathogenic species. For example, we found that the OTUs of Pseudomonas, a genus that includes a known uropathogen, were identical in women with and without UTI. This was also true for Staphylococcus. This finding should cause us to reconsider \u201cpathogenicity\u201d since, at the genomic level these bacteria are identical (at least by the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene). For E. coli, other investigators have recently shown that there is no genomic difference between strains associated with UTI or no UTI; the investigators report that the differences appear related to transcription rather than core genetics 24.",

Although clinicians could initiate routine or selective pre-operative (or day-of-surgery) urine culture testing to screen for women at increased UTI risk, standard urine culture results typically do not become available to the clinician until 24-48 hour following initial plating. The window for optimal intervention may close prior to the availability of urine culture results. Culture-independent testing of urine is still a research tool that is not used for clinical care in the pre-operative setting. There is currently no evidence for the clinical utility of rapid culture-independent diagnostics (sequencing or PCR of known or suspected uropathogens) that could expedite identification of individuals at increased risk for post-operative UTI.",
