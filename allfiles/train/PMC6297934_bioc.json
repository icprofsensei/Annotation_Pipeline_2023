The pathogenesis of NAFLD is described by \u201cmultiple hits\u201d on a nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) that progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The intestinal microbiota is one of the \u201cmultiple hits\u201d and is the focus of recent studies in NASH patients with different technical and methodical approaches leading to some inconsistent findings. In one study NASH patients showed a lower percentage of Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides/Prevotella) compared to NAFL patients and healthy controls (HCs),1 whereas in another study higher abundance of Bacteroides and lower abundance of Prevotella were observed in NASH patients.2 Loomba et\u00a0al. detected higher abundance of Firmicutes in mild/moderate NAFLD and higher abundance of Proteobacteria in NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis (no change for Bacteroidetes).3 Different mechanisms are proposed for the microbial contribution in NAFLD including regulation of gut barrier and inflammatory responses as well as bacterial metabolites, e.g. short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).4",

On the one hand, SCFAs provide additional energy to the host and play a pivotal role in lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis, but on the other hand SCFAs increase satiety by activation of free fatty acid receptors and weight loss can thereby be sustained.5 In human studies fecal SCFA concentrations were higher in obese volunteers compared to lean individuals.6,7 In animal and in vitro studies, SCFAs affect proinflammatory cytokine production,8 promote conversion toward regulatory T-cells (Tregs) under specific conditions9 and enhance Foxp3 expression of colonic T-cells via G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) 43 activation,10 but also facilitate conversion of na\u00efve T-cells into Th1 or Th17 cells depending on cytokine milieu and histone deacetylase inhibitor activity.11",

Study participants were all >18 years old. Twenty-four patients were morbidly obese and underwent bariatric surgery, and eight obese NAFLD patients were included without bariatric surgery, but with histologically diagnosed NAFLD. Significant alcohol consumption (women >20\u2009g/d and men >30\u2009g/d) and other liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus infections as well as autoimmune liver diseases (hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HCV, antinuclear antibodies) were excluded. Patients had no standardized diet before surgery. In general, a low-carbohydrate diet is recommended two weeks prior to surgery. Patients without bariatric surgery had no specific diet. Blood samples were taken at the day of inclusion while fecal samples were harvested immediately before bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery followed up to 14 days after study inclusion. Patients had not received any antibiotic treatment the last six months prior to study inclusion. Biopsies were taken from subcapsular liver tissue during bariatric surgery or percutaneously from the right liver lobe in participants without bariatric surgery. All liver biopsies were analyzed by an experienced pathologist and classified using the Steatosis, Activity and Fibrosis (SAF) score.13 HCs were all individuals without evidence or history of liver or metabolic diseases. In HCs liver ultrasound and liver stiffness as determined by transient elastography measurement (FibroScan\u00ae) were normal. In HCs liver enzyme levels were measured and laboratory analysis showed no elevation for Glutamate oxalacetate tranasminase (GOT) and Glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT).\n",

No significant difference was observed in the PCA on the OTU level between bariatric patients and obese patients without bariatric surgery to exclude preoperative diet as possible bias (Supplemental Figure 1). In our previous work NASH patients were successfully differentiated and characterized by increased Th17 (CD4+IL17+)/resting Treg (rTreg/CD4+CD45RA+CD25++) ratio in peripheral blood compared to NAFL patients.12 Here we observed a significant correlation (R2\u2009=\u20090.171, p value\u2009<\u20090.01) of Th17/rTreg ratio, with the ordination configuration of the first two axes (Figure 3(a)). In Figure 3(b) PCA of microbiome data separate clearly the study cohort into high- and low-Th17/rTreg ratio subgroups (Th17/rTreg low\u2009<\u20090.38, Th17/rTreg high\u2009\u2265\u20090.38). There was thus a good correlation between the observed changes in the gut microbiome and peripheral T-cells. In a supervised ordination approach (RDA), NAFL, NASH and HCs could be successfully differentiated as well (Figure 3(c)). A permutation test based on 10,000 random permutations yields a highly significant effect (p\u2009<\u20090.001) of the study group factor.\n",

Fusobacteriaceae as well as Prevotellaceae are bacterial families characterized by SCFA-producing capacity.19,20,22 Differences in species levels between NAFLD (NAFL/NASH) patients and HCs showed a significantly higher abundance of species such as Prevotella copri, Megashpaera, Fusobacterium, Ruminococcus torques and Eubacterium biforme (Table 2). Interestingly, these species are well described as SCFA-producing bacteria or belong to families with high capacity of SCFA production.19,20,22 Thus the observed differences in family and species level in gut microbiome analysis of NAFLD patients are functionally relevant and correlate well with higher fecal concentrations of acetate and propionate in these patients (Figure 4(a)).",

Even though many studies support the idea that SCFAs induce an anti-inflammatory profile of T-cells, there is also evidence that SCFAs induce pro-inflammatory T-cells (e.g. Th1 and Th17) under specific conditions and depending on disease model.11,30",

Our data suggest that higher prevalence of SCFA-producing bacteria in feces of NAFLD patients could contribute to disease progression by maintaining low-grade inflammatory processes with influence on circulating immune cells and impact on peripheral target organs such as the liver. The present study further contributes to elucidate the still controversial role of SCFAs in the context of obesity in humans and targets the field for future studies of intestinal immune cell activation to better understand the final impact of fecal SCFAs in humans. Furthermore, increased permeability in the gut-liver axis as well as other bacterial metabolites (e.g. endotoxins, bacterial ethanol) and fecal bile acids are important targets influencing disease progression in NAFLD and should be the focus of future studies together with fecal SCFAs.31,32",
