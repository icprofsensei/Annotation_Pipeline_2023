Our aim was to compare the vaginal and urinary microbiomes between premenopausal women with ICBPS and unaffected controls. This cross-sectional study screened premenopausal women with an O'Leary-Sant questionnaire (ICBPS if score \u22656 on either index; controls <6 on both). Women completed questionnaires on health characteristics, pelvic floor symptoms (OABq, PFDI-20), body image (mBIS), and sexual function (PISQ-IR). Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from vaginal and clean-catch urinary specimens; the bacterial 16 rRNA gene was sequenced and analyzed using the QIIME pipeline. We performed UniFrac analysis (\u03b2-diversity) and generated Chao1 estimator (richness) and Simpson index (richness and evenness) values. We analyzed 23 ICBPS and 18 non-ICBPS patients. ICBPS patients had increased vaginal deliveries, BMI, and public insurance as well as worsened OAB-q, PFDI-20, mBIS, and PISQ-IR domain scores. Lactobacilli was the most abundant genus in both cohorts, and anaerobic or fastidious predominance was similar between groups (p = 0.99). For both the urine and vagina specimens, Chao1 and Simpson indices were similar between ICBPS and unaffected women. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac analyses showed no differences between groups. A significant correlation existed between the urinary and vaginal Simpson indices in ICBPS women, but not in unaffected women. Premenopausal women with ICBPS, despite worsened socioeconomic indicators and pelvic floor function, were not found to have significantly different urinary and vaginal microbiomes compared to women without ICBPS.",

It is known that urine is not sterile and holds microbes that correspond greatly to the vaginal microbiome (Wolfe et al., 2012), but urine still holds less bacterial genomic material than the genitalia (Gottschick et al., 2017). Lactobacilli are associated with health of the vaginal microbiome (Stapleton, 2016; Lewis et al., 2017) and are predominant in the premenopausal urinary microbiome as well (Thomas-White et al., 2017). It appears that the vast majority of bacteria communicating between the urine from the vaginal environments are Lactobacilli, which is both statistically probable and physiologically sensible (the urethral epithelium has inherent defenses against more pathologic bacteria) (Stapleton, 2016). Nevertheless, the Lactobacilli composition in the urine or vagina was similar between ICBPS and non-ICBPS groups in this detailed study, so we cannot conclude that vaginal Lactobacilli disturbance is related to ICBPS pathology.",

Genetic analyses are known to be more reliable than simple culture or enzyme-testing, particularly in urinary samples (Wolfe et al., 2012; Mouraviev and McDonald, 2018). This study also included the vaginal microbiomes in the analyses, as opposed to former studies that only investigate the urinary microbiome (Pearce et al., 2014; Thomas-White et al., 2017). As the urine and vaginal microbiomes are likely to be closely related, ignoring the vagina may fail to capture the entire pathophysiology. Finally, this study collected and investigated multiple possible confounders of the genitourinary microbiome, an intricate system that cannot be considered without patient factors.",

                    "text": "Limitations of this study are mostly due to the smaller size of the study population, limiting power and ability to analyze subpopulations. The vaginal microbial environment in the premenopausal woman is extremely complex and changes with factors such as diet, the menstrual cycle, and vaginal medication use (Ravel et al., 2011; Nunn and Forney, 2016). We attempted to account for the days since a woman's LMP, but many women lacked these data, and the cycle day may be inaccurate or not correlate to the hormonal phase. Another limitation was our use of clean-catch urine. Past studies have found microbiome differences between clean-catch and catheterized urine specimens (Wolfe et al., 2012), but we cannot know what proportion of the urinary sample is vaginal contamination. Also, we did not explore viral or fungal data in these analyses, which focused only on the bacterial microbiome. Lastly, this population included a variety of genitourinary complaints within the sample group, making it difficult to isolate ICBPS pathology. Furthermore, the control population was mostly recruited from a subspecialty clinic where gynecological/urinary pathology is common regardless of the presence of ICBPS. ICBPS has varied presentation, and the \u201cgold standard\u201d used to validate some screening tools, the potassium challenge test, is known to be unreliable (Hanno et al., 2011). It is well known that ICBPS is a clinical diagnosis, but is extremely hard to diagnose with high specificity and sensitivity with current tools, given the large amoung of overlap with other pelvic pain syndromes and irritative voiding symptoms (Hanno et al., 2011; Patnaik et al., 2017). We gave preference to a questionnaire proven to correspond to disease severity and treatment response (Lubeck et al., 2001), which are most meaningful to patients and clinicians.",
