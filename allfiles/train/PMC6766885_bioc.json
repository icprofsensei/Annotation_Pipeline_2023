In our study, we investigated association of gut flora and antibiotics in the prognosis of patients with liver cancer who have undergone chemotherapy by analyzing two independent clinical studies. We retrospectively subanalyzed a previously reported randomized controlled trial (RCT) on hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to investigate the association between use of antibiotics and prognosis. In the other study, we prospectively determined the abundance of specific bacterial genus in patients with HCC by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA and assessed its association with survival. Subanalysis of the RCT data showed that, of 26 types of antibiotics used, administration of carbapenem before or during chemotherapy was associated with poor progression\u2010free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with HCC (carbapenem + vs. \u2212; median PFS, 78\u2009days vs. 154\u2009days, p\u2009=\u20090.0053; median OS, 177\u2009days vs. 475\u2009days, p\u2009=\u20090.0003). Multivariate analysis revealed that antianaerobic drug use is an independent predictor of poor prognosis. In the prospective study, the abundance of Blautia in fecal microbiota correlated positively with both PFS and OS of patients with HCC who underwent chemotherapy. Use of antibiotics targeting anaerobes is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with HCC who have undergone chemotherapy, whereas the intestinal anaerobic bacteria, Blautia is associated with a good prognosis. These findings might indicate the need for caution regarding overuse of broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics targeting anaerobes in patients with HCC.",

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kanazawa University. After screening with CT or MRI imaging, 32 patients with HCC with vascular invasion, extrahepatic lesions or multiple tumor nodules who were unsuitable for radical treatments such as hepatectomy or radiofrequency ablation were enrolled in our study. All participants received both written and oral information before consenting to participate in the study. Immediately after enrollment, a sample of feces was collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Twenty\u2010six of the participants started chemotherapy within 3 months after the fecal collection and their survival was followed up to November 2017. The chemotherapy comprised systemic IFN injection and 5\u2010FU plus cisplatin via hepatic arterial infusion in all cases, as was administered in the previous RCT.16 Progression of HCC during chemotherapy was evaluated by CT or MRI imaging at 4\u2010week intervals. Spearman's correlation coefficients between abundance of specific bacterial genera in the feces before starting chemotherapy and PFS, OS, tumor number, tumor diameter, serum level of \u03b1\u2010fetoprotein (AFP), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) or white blood cell (WBC) counts were calculated.

Genus level taxonomy was summarized and used for the subsequent correlation analysis. After the phylogenetic tree had been calculated, unweighted Unifrac distances of gut flora communities were calculated at a depth of 2,000 reads and the resultant distances were visualized by principal coordinate analysis.

To investigate this, we examined associations between period of antibiotic use and prognosis and found that use of antianaerobics before chemotherapy was significantly associated with worse PFS (mPFS, antianaerobics+70\u2009days, antianaerobics\u2212159\u2009days, p\u2009=\u20090.0009, Fig. \u200bFig.33\na); however, use of antianaerobics during chemotherapy did not affect PFS (mPFS, antianaerobics+92\u2009days, antianaerobics\u2212138\u2009days, p\u2009=\u20090.226, Fig. \u200bFig.33\nb). OS was worse in patients who received carbapenem either before or during the chemotherapy than in those who did not (Figs. \u200b(Figs.33\nc and 3d). Next, we examined whether both short\u2010 and long\u2010term administration of antianaerobics influenced the prognosis. Both use of antianaerobics for fewer than 8 days and long\u2010term use were associated with poor PFS and OS compared to participants who had not received any antianaerobics (Figs. \u200b(Figs.33\ne and 3f). We therefore hypothesized that impairment of prognosis is attributable to alterations in gut microbiota caused by drugs targeting anaerobes rather than direct effects on tumors and hosts or interactions with cytotoxic drugs; the effect on the prognosis was apparent even after short\u2010term use of these drugs.",

We found that a higher proportion of patients who had received antianaerobics had extrahepatic lesions than of those who had not received them (p\u2009=\u20090.0080); however, BCLC stage did not differ between the groups (p\u2009=\u20090.129; Supporting Information Table S1). Because we had mostly antianaerobics to treat infections, the group that had received antianaerobics contained a greater proportion of patients with a history of infection (p\u2009=\u20090.022; Supporting Information Table S1). According to univariate analyses, the following six factors were significantly associated with PFS after chemotherapy: use of antianaerobic drugs before chemotherapy, tumor diameter, vascular invasion, extrahepatic lesions, AFP and treatment with cisplatin. Use of antianaerobics before chemotherapy was the only independent unfavorable factor for PFS, whereas treatment with cisplatin was an independent favorable factor according to multivariate analysis with Cox's proportional hazards regression model (Table \u200b(Table1).1). OS was associated with the following factors: use of antianaerobic drugs before chemotherapy, age, Child\u2013Pugh class, tumor diameter, vascular invasion, extrahepatic lesions and AFP. Of these factors, administration of antianaerobics before chemotherapy was the only independent unfavorable factor for OS according to multivariate analysis (Table \u200b(Table2).2). Although a part of antianaerobic drugs were used to treat infectious diseases which can occasionally affect survival of the subjects, the presence of history of infection was not associated with both PFS and OS (Tables \u200b(Tables11 and \u200band2).2). While HCC progression was associated with use of antianaerobics according to influence on PFS, course of hepatic reserve after starting chemotherapy was not affected by use of antianaerobics (Supporting Information Fig. S2). In addition, a cause of death of most patients was HCC progression despite use of any antibiotics, and contribution of use of antibiotics such as antianaerobics, third\u2010generation cephem and new quinolone to the death due to the other causes was marginal (Supporting Information Tables S3\u2013S5). Taken together, antianaerobic drug use before chemotherapy is an independent predictor of poor prognosis of chemotherapy\u2010treated patients with HCC.",

Most of the microbiota were consisted of class Bacteroidia, Bacilli and Clostridia (Supporting Information Fig. S3). Relative abundance of Blautia in fecal microbiota was positively correlated with both PFS and OS whereas abundance of Acidaminococcus was negatively correlated with OS. As to tumor status, abundance of Lactobacillus was negatively correlated with number of tumors, whereas abundance of Bilophila, Coprobacillus, Methanobrevibacter and Bulleidia were positively correlated with number of tumors. Abundance of Anaerostipes, Oxalobacter, Bacillus and Corynebacterium were negatively correlated with diameter of tumors. Interestingly, several bacterial genera were significantly associated with serum CRP concentration before starting chemotherapy. Abundance of fecal Lactobacillus, Anaerostipes, Corynebacterium, Parvimonas, Porphyromonas, Ruminococcus and Collinsella were negatively correlated with CRP, whereas Enterococcus and Microbacterium were positively correlated with it (Fig. \u200b(Fig.44\na). Patients with high proportions of fecal Blautia before starting chemotherapy had significantly better PFS than those with low proportions of Blautia (mPFS, Blautia\nhi 165\u2009days, Blautia\nlo 42\u2009days, p\u2009=\u20090.0072, Fig. \u200bFig.44\nb). OS was also longer in patients with intestinal Blautia\nhi than in those with Blautia\nlo (mOS, Blautia\nhi 467\u2009days, Blautia\nlo 113\u2009days, p\u2009=\u20090.0170, Fig. \u200bFig.44\nc). No baseline characteristics were significantly different between Blautia\nlo and Blautia\nhi groups (Supporting Information Table S6). Patients with intestinal Blautia\nhi and Acidaminococcus\u2010negative microbiota showed further longer OS than other groups (mOS, Blautia\nhi\nAminoscidcoccus\nneg 602\u2009days, Supporting Information Figure S5). Because Blautia is an obligate anaerobic bacteria, these bacteria were less abundant in patients who had received carbapenem before fecal collection (Fig. \u200b(Fig.44\nd). Gut flora communities of patients who had received carbapenem clustered closely in principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac matrices (Supporting Information Fig. S4). Difference of microbial communities between patients who had and had not received carbapenem was significant (Supporting Information Fig. S4), indicating that administration of carbapenem alters both composition of gut microbiota and relative abundance of the specific bacterial genus, Blautia. One of the characteristics of Blautia is that they produce the SCFA acetate.27 Measurement of the fecal SCFA revealed that fecal concentrations of acetate and propionate correlated positively with OS but not with PFS (Fig. \u200b(Fig.44\ne). Thus, abundance of intestinal Blautia and SCFA was positively correlated with good prognosis after the chemotherapy.",

Given that improvements in the efficacy of anticancer chemotherapies for hepatic and gastrointestinal cancers are still required, our study provides a novel and important focus on gut flora and antibiotics in chemotherapy\u2010treated patients with the cancer. Antibiotics are one of the most frequently prescribed categories of drugs worldwide. In the USA, 833 antibiotics per 1,000 outpatients were prescribed in 2010.28 It has been estimated that more than 20% of prescription of antibiotics may be unnecessary.29 In this retrospective study, cefazolin, third\u2010generation cephalosporins (cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefdinir, cefcapene and sulbactam/cefoperazone), new quinolones (levofloxacin and pazufloxacin) and carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, panipenem/betamipron and doripenem) were used for HCC patients. Evidence has recently been emerging that gut microbiota play critical roles in hosts\u2019 physiology and that dysbiosis of microbiota causes pathological abnormalities.5, 30 Administration of antibiotics induces drastic changes in microbiota, and even after cessation of them microbiota do not completely recover to the former composition.31, 32 In this study, use of antibiotics targeting anaerobes before starting chemotherapy in patients with HCC was significantly associated with poor prognosis. Because a history of infection, which was the major reason for use of antibiotics, did not affect PFS or OS, it seems that alterations in gut microbiota might persist even after cessation of antianaerobics use and are directly associated with poor prognosis. The composition of gut flora changes even after short\u2010term administration of antibiotics and the change persists, at least in part, for a long time.22, 32 Our analyses showed that even patients who received antianaerobics for less than 8 days showed significantly shorter PFS and OS than those who received no antianaerobics. Thus, short\u2010term administration of antianaerobics can change gut flora composition and prevent prolongation of survival of patients with HCC. These findings suggest that even short\u2010term inappropriate administration of broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics to patients with HCC should be avoided.",

Anticancer effects of cisplatin, oxaliplatin and cyclophosphamide on mouse cancers are impaired by depletion of gut flora with antibiotics.9, 10, 33 Tumor\u2010infiltrating myeloid cells promote apoptosis of platinum\u2010treated tumors by generating ROS. The presence of intact gut flora promotes apoptosis of tumor cells by activating ROS\u2010producing myeloid cells.9 The mechanisms underlying promotion of anticancer effects by gut flora differ between cyclophosphamide and platinum\u2010based drugs. Treatment with cyclophosphamide alters the composition of the microbiota in the small intestine and promotes translocation of gram\u2010positive bacteria into the second lymphoid organ, resulting in generation of Th17 cell, which in part mediate the anticancer effects of cyclophosphamide. Effects of immunotherapies against cancer are also promoted in mice by specific members of the gut flora.11, 12 Unlike mouse subcutaneous tumor models, bacterial species involved in survival of the clinical liver cancer patients need to be further investigated with detailed mechanisms.",

                    "text": "Use of antianaerobics was associated with HCC progression, but not changes of hepatic reserve, indicating that alteration of gut flora might directly influence HCC progression and the subsequent course of prognosis. A possible mechanism underlying the unfavorable association between antianaerobics and HCC progression may be the decreased abundance of Blautia and SCFA production in the gut caused by the antianaerobics. Butyrate, one of the beneficial SCFAs, is produced by the Lachnospiraceae family, including Anaerostipes,34 which correlated negatively with number of tumors and serum CRP concentrations. Butyrate maintains the mucosal barrier by preserving the integrity of the junction with the intestinal epithelia and decreases apoptosis of epithelial cells.35, 36 This barrier is also preserved by T regulatory cells controlling inflammation and IgA generated by plasma cells. Butyrate induces differentiation of colonic T regulatory cells,37, 38 and also promotes differentiation of B cells to plasma cells, which generate IgA type antibodies.39\nBlautia is abundant in the gut of healthy people, but not in the gut of older persons and patients with various diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, liver cirrhosis and colon cancer.40, 41, 42, 43\nBlautia produces acetate, which is a SCFA and the substrate of butyrate. Acetate also directly strengthens the barrier of colonic epithelial cells, decreasing permeability44 and promoting IgA production from plasma cells like butyrate.39\nBlautia also helps growth of other bacterial strain by metabolite cross\u2010feeding.45 Taken together, SCFA\u2010producing Lachnospiraceae family members, including Blautia and Anaerostipes may play roles in maintaining the mucosal barrier in the intestines of patients with HCC, thus decreasing local and systemic inflammation. Because systemic inflammation is associated with malignant cancer phenotypes such as growth promotion, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, resistance to cell death and immunosuppression,46 abundant SCFA\u2010producing intestinal bacteria and low levels of inflammation may be associated with a good prognosis in patients with HCC. More research is required to investigate a possible causal relationship between SCFA\u2010producing intestinal bacteria and prolonged survival of the patients.",
