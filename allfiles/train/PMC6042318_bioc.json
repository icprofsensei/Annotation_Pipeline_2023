Long-term in vitro growth of natural biofilms would enable use of these biofilms in both in vitro and in vivo studies that require complex microbial communities with minimal variation over a period of time. Understanding biofilm community dynamics in continuous culture, and whether they maintain distinct signatures of health and disease, is necessary to determine the reliability and applicability of such models to broader studies. To this end, we performed next-generation sequencing on biofilms grown from healthy and disease-site subgingival plaque for 80\u00a0days to assess stability and reliability of continuous oral biofilm growth.",

Profiles were steady through the ten generations, as determined by species abundance and prevalence, Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient, and Faith\u2019s phylogenetic distance, with slight variation predominantly in low abundance species. Community profiles were distinct between healthy and disease site-derived biofilms as demonstrated by weighted UniFrac distance throughout the ten generations.

Ecological theories of oral infectious diseases such as Marsh\u2019s ecological plaque hypothesis [3] and the recent polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis model of disease development [4] emphasize the role of complex community changes as drivers of disease. It is now clear that oral biofilms differ between sites of health and disease at the gene/genomic level [5], the transcriptional level [6, 7], and the metabolic level [8]. However, despite substantial research into cause of these infectious oral diseases, relatively little progress has been made in understanding how community dynamics and species interactions drive disease. Studies employing polymicrobial communities, which are necessary to elucidate oral disease pathology, are rare due to the difficulty of independently culturing many oral bacterial species, and the uncertainty in working with undefined samples derived from dental plaque or saliva.",

For example, murine oral co-infection with Tannerella forsythia and Fusobacterium nucleatum [9] or with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola [10] induces greater alveolar bone resorption than either species alone, while a polybacterial inoculum of P. gingivalis, T. denticola, T. forsythia, and F. nucleatum elicits a unique immune/inflammatory response and physiologic changes compared to individual oral infection with each of the species [11\u201316]. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) patients and healthy patients respond uniquely to stimulation with bacterial surface components, intact complex oral biofilms, and dispersed complex oral biofilms [17] indicating that the choice of stimulant in immunological assays can skew the conclusions drawn about cellular responses in infectious diseases. In contrast, cytokine responses of whole blood from both LAP and periodontally healthy individuals are indistinguishable between stimulation with LAP site-derived and healthy site-derived dental plaque [17]. Additionally, unique subgingival plaque community profiles correlate with distinct gingival crevicular fluid cytokine profiles in generalized aggressive periodontitis patients and healthy patients [18], chronic periodontitis patients, and clinically healthy sites in chronic periodontitis patients [19].",

Bacteria in dental plaque have complex nutritional relationships that determine community composition and structure [20, 21], by enhancing and promoting growth of neighboring species [22, 23], and altering expression of surface markers, such as LPS [24, 25]. Comparative genome analysis of P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia revealed that certain metabolic pathways are covered between the three that are not complete in any individually [26], suggesting that close proximity of these species may be necessary for specific metabolite use. Such intimate dependency may explain their frequent co-detection in plaque samples, which led to their grouping as Socransky\u2019s \u201cred complex\u201d, particularly and strongly associated with periodontal disease [27].",

The subgingival plaque growth model developed by Walker and Sedlacek [28] demonstrated, using DNA-DNA checkerboard hybridization and scanning electron microscopy, that in vitro biofilm growth and development closely resembled the known succession of bacteria in dental plaque, and the mature community at ten days growth had species composition and proportions highly similar to the original plaque inocula [28]. There were promisingly also distinguishable differences between biofilms grown from healthy site plaque and periodontitis-affected site plaque. Further characterization of this model, again by culture-dependent DNA-DNA checkerboard hybridization, found it possible to perpetuate the biofilms up to seven times/generations and maintain the community composition [33]. Here we have further characterized this model by using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to trace the community dynamics of subgingival biofilms grown from healthy site and periodontitis-affected site plaque through ten generations of subcultures. We demonstrate stable biofilm communities that maintain differences between healthy site and periodontitis-affected site plaque inocula, as well as between individual donors, making it a useful model for long-term study of biofilm microbe-microbe interactions and biofilm-host interactions.",

In brief, four subgingival biofilm samples were collected by paper point for growth and propagation: one from each of two periodontally healthy subjects, and one from a localized aggressive periodontal disease (LAP)-affected site in each of two LAP patients. Samples were collected as part of a larger clinical study approved by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board (IRB #201400349, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01330719). The LAP patients had at least 2 sites with \u22655\u00a0mm pocket depth and a history of site progression based on radiographic assessment, attachment loss of \u22653\u00a0mm and bone loss on first molar or incisor and in no more than two teeth affected by bone loss other than first molar and incisor, and had not yet received any periodontal treatment in the previous 6\u00a0months, while periodontally healthy individuals presented with no pocket depth\u2009\u2265\u20095\u00a0mm and absence of clinical attachment loss by full mouth probing and no evidence of bone loss by radiographic imaging [34, 35]. Each plaque sample was collected from a first molar. Paper points were immediately placed in tubes containing reduced Ringer\u2019s solution and stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C while saliva was collected and prepared.

Hydroxyapatite disks were placed into wells of two sterile 24-well cell culture plates, one for disease-site biofilms and one for healthy-site biofilms, with two wells for each biofilm source to ensure growth (four biofilm lineages).

In brief, HOMINGS uses V3-V4 region-specific 16S rRNA gene primers for amplification and library generation, then libraries are sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Reads are identified using the program ProbeSeq by matching to primers that uniquely identify the 16S rRNA gene of 638 bacterial and archaeal species known to reside in the oral cavity based on the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Reads not matching species probes are assigned to a genus when possible, and all remaining reads are unmatched.

Rarefaction curves show slightly higher diversity in LAP site-derived biofilms than healthy site-derived biofilms for each metric, which were significantly different despite overlapping confidence intervals (Fig.\u00a02a). Further substantiation of this observation was seen in rarefaction curves using the Chao1 and Shannon metrics (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S1A). Diversity metrics were significantly different between healthy and disease site-derived biofilms at 20,000 reads, (Phylogenetic distance p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05; Observed species p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001, Shannon p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) with the exception of Chao1 (Fig.\u00a02b, Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S1B). Outliers in the boxplots for each diversity metric are not consistently the same samples, nor are they all early or late generation samples.

Therefore, we determined differentially abundant taxa between healthy and disease-site derived biofilms by comparing the difference in species mean proportions using the program STAMP, first by comparing all detected species (Fig.\u00a05) and then comparing only species that were detected at >\u20090.1% abundance (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Figure S7). Removing organisms present in less than 0.1% abundance resulted in a species table with 43 species, just 17% of the 257 total species detected, however this had no effect on the species that met cut-off criteria for differential abundance (q\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 and an effect size >\u20092). Fourteen species were differentially abundant between healthy and disease site-derived biofilms (Fig.\u00a05, Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Figure S7). Seven species were more abundant in healthy site-derived biofilms (blue bars/dots), while six were more abundant in disease site-derived biofilms (red bars/dots).",

Of note, V. dispar was significantly more abundant in healthy site-derived biofilms for the first two generations, then for the remaining 8 generations was more abundant in disease-site derived biofilms, while F. nucleatum subsp. animalis displayed opposite dynamics, initially more abundant in disease-site derived biofilms, but after the first generation was more abundant in healthy site-derived biofilms.",

                    "text": "A unique advantage of growing complex plaque-derived biofilms compared to defined polyspecies biofilms is the inclusion of rare and uncultured microbes. The role of these organisms in oral biofilm structure and activity is difficult to study in vitro due to the difficulty in culturing these organisms in the lab, but next generation sequencing has opened a way to study their abundance, distribution, and gene content in silico, which may facilitate their independent culture in a laboratory setting. Both the LAP site-derived and healthy site-derived biofilms contained numerous uncultured oral organisms identified in the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD). Several uncultured species were detected in biofilms throughout the generations, including Peptostreptococcaceae [XI][G-3] sp. oral taxon 495 Prevotella sp. oral taxon 300, Prevotella sp. oral taxon 304, Prevotella sp. oral taxon 315, Fusobacterium sp. oral taxon 204, Fusobacterium sp. oral taxon 205, Stomatobaculum sp. oral taxon 097, and Stomatobaculum sp. oral taxon 910. Members of the phylum TM7 (now Candidatus Saccharibacteria), which has only one cultured member [46], were detected in both healthy site-derived biofilms, up to 7 generations and up to 10 generations, respectively, while they were detected in disease site-derived biofilms up to 4 and 5 generations, respectively. Additionally, members of the uncultured phylum SR1 were detected in the 4th generation of one healthy site-derived biofilm, and in the 3rd, 7th and 9th generation of one disease site-derived biofilm. This indicates that our biofilm model is capable of sustaining growth of these poorly characterized organisms and may be useful for their in vitro study.",

Such models need to maintain viable communities for long-term studies and reproduce consistent communities to reduce variability in study conditions. The developers of the model we used here determined that the biofilms could not be reliably grown longer than ten days, because the biofilms would release from the disks [28], necessitating the development of a method to perpetuate the biofilms [33]. Here we have demonstrated longevity and reproducibility of biofilms seeded from a single source by Next Generation Sequencing technology, and shown that stationary growth of subgingival plaque-derived biofilms can maintain complex multi-species microbial communities including uncultivatable species, even sustaining signatures of health and disease when grown in identical media. These results are highly promising for use of this model as a complex oral biofilm for studies of plaque development, microbial-microbial interactions, and microbial-host interactions, while further development and refinement of the model are likely to broaden and enhance its applications.",

In these circumstances, it may not be possible to recall the same plaque donor, and patients with periodontal disease who undergo treatment cannot be re-sampled. We recently published an application of this model to stimulating patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells [34], where patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were enrolled over several months. We aimed to measure immune cell responses to stimulation with biofilms from the same source to reduce potential variability in responses, in contrast to our study that used fresh plaque collected from a new patient to stimulate each new set of patient samples [17]. Maintaining several biofilm lineages allowed us to have biofilms grown from the same source ready for stimulation each time patient blood samples were collected. Additionally, serially grown biofilms can be used for murine oral infection models of periodontal disease, which require serial infection over 3\u201324\u00a0weeks [15, 16, 47] to develop symptoms. Multi-species infection models could use serially grown biofilms from human plaque, rather than independently growing several bacterial species and combining them just before infection, which is the current standard [15, 16].",

However, a comparison with initial plaque inocula was previously done for our model [28, 33], and our goal was instead to demonstrate consistent and long-term reproducible biofilm growth. There are no in vitro oral biofilm growth models that support greater than 80% of the species present in the initial plaque or saliva inoculum, and based on assessments by Walker and Sedlacek [28] and Shaddox, et al. [33] as well as comparison of the plaque sample used to inoculate DB3 with the biofilms of that lineage here, our model our model supports 53\u201380% of the initial community. This is comparable to four independent oral biofilm microcosm models that reproduced 64% [29], 78% [30], 62% [31] and 44% [32] of the OTUs present in the initial inocula. Biofilms grown from plaque rather than saliva appear to lose a greater amount of diversity, a phenomenon that suggests that there are some fundamental components necessary for in vivo plaque growth that have not yet been elucidated and replicated in vitro. For example, Fernandez y Mostajo, et al. [32] found that supplementing growth media with high amounts of serum was necessary to support growth of Treponema species, and further studies of plaque biofilm ecology are clearly needed to improve in vitro models. Despite this limitation, we were able to demonstrate here that serially-grown biofilms could consistently reproduce similar, stable communities, through several generations.",

If this holds true for other bacterial species, especially when growing in complex biofilm communities such as dental plaque, selecting the source of biofilm inoculum becomes important, and thus, plaque biofilm inoculum may be preferential to saliva inoculum or defined species inoculum for seeding in vitro biofilms. The bacteria in dental plaque are already established, transcriptionally and translationally, for biofilm growth and are likely to be more closely related to each other than are bacterial cells in saliva because of constant mixing and turnover of saliva. Further, initial characterization of the subgingival plaque model used in our study demonstrated that biofilm growth was inhibited when sterilized saliva from individuals other than the dental plaque donor were used to initiate biofilm growth [28]. This suggests that an individual\u2019s microbiota are optimally adapted for surface attachment in their native saliva, while salivary components from other donors may contain inhibitory molecules such as antibodies or small antimicrobial peptides that the microbiota are not adapted to combat. Therefore, dental plaque inocula may be more likely develop in vitro biofilms that maintain metabolic characteristics of healthy and disease site plaque, and thus, this warrants further investigation.",

Saliva- and plaque-derived biofilms as well as subgingival plaque develop continuously over at least seven days [28, 30, 49], which supports using more mature biofilms (older than 72\u00a0h) in studies of biofilm-host interactions, as older biofilms are more representative of plaque collected from subgingival sites, which themselves require days to develop familiar community profiles.",

Hall, et al. [50] demonstrated that a core set of microbes were consistently present over time in temporally sampled supragingival plaque, tongue swabs, and saliva, but that there was substantial change in low abundance organisms, which caused community drift. Our biofilm generations similarly have a core community with a few species that comprise a majority of the reads in each sample, and the changes in the community are predominantly due to the low-abundance species. Additionally, our biofilm communities do not appear to drift beyond a defined profile, just as is reported in plaque communities over time. These dynamics suggest that oral biofilms, while influenced by their environment, are stable and resilient communities, wherein the metabolic and physical interactions of the members prevent drastic community profile changes.",

Many of the species that were significantly more abundant in LAP plaque samples were fastidious asaccharolytic organisms, which propagate poorly in our model. Even though we do not detect high levels of species traditionally associated with periodontitis in our disease site-derived biofilm samples, we do detect several species that were recently associated with LAP by NGS [52], including Solobacterium moorei, Parvimonas micra, Capnocytophaga sp., Filifactor alocis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythia. There is very little overlap between the core species in the biofilm lineages and the most abundant species reported in LAP plaque and healthy control plaque samples using HOMIM technology [52], despite consistency between HOMIM and HOMINGS technologies [36]. However, there is substantial overlap between the core communities of healthy and periodontitis sites as has been reported previously [5].",

Although it is not possible to directly compare HOMIM and HOMINGS data, the significant difference within each dataset supports that plaque at healthy and disease-affected sites harbor uniquely diverse communities, which has also been reported in other in vitro biofilm models [32]. An unrelated study of dental plaque communities in periodontal health and disease found that periodontitis-associated communities cluster into two groups related to periodontitis clinical parameters [53], while another found several distinct communities within generalized aggressive periodontitis site plaque [18]. Distinct microbial profiles within LAP plaque samples have not yet been investigated, but is a possible explanation for the differences we observe.",

Both species are common in sites of disease and health [5], and may have flexible metabolic requirements that allow them to rapidly multiply in the presence of a wide variety of other bacterial species. Promisingly, the healthy and diseased site-derived biofilms still maintain a differentiated profile through the generations, and a potential unique metabolic profile as well, evidenced by the distinct difference in smell, although this was not directly tested here. This may be related to the production of short chain volatile fatty acids and volatile sulfur compounds, which are attributed to proteolytic, disease-associated species [54]. Recent reports on the transcriptional activity of biofilm plaque from healthy and periodontitis-affected sites suggest that community activity is more uniform across disease sites than is microbial profile [6, 7, 55], and further investigation of protein expression and metabolic output in healthy and disease-site derived biofilms is warranted [56].",

This method of biofilm perpetuation may be useful for growing biofilms to use in in vivo oral infection studies, patient immune cell stimulation studies, biofilm transcriptional, translational, and metabolic studies, and to study the effects of anti-biofilm agents.",
