One of the reasons for these differences is that various methods have been used for pathogens identification (9, 10, 16\u201319). Previously, microbial species and pathogens were identified using culture method, which was based on phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of microorganisms and associated with many limitations (20). Considering the wide-spread use of molecular biology techniques in recent years, 16S rDNA sequencing has played a major role in precise identification of isolated bacteria in modern microbiology. This method can not only diagnose the etiology of endodontic infections, but also gives clinicians, according to the existing microorganisms, the opportunity to determine the appropriate antimicrobial therapeutics, the duration of the treatment and the methods of infection control in the best way (2). Therefore, the current study was conducted to identify different bacterial species, some viruses, and one fungus strain in secondary or persitent endodontic infections with respect to clinical and radiographic findings in adult Iranian patients using culturing and the 16S rDNA sequencing methods.",

This procedure was completed with 3% sodium hypochlorite. The restorations were removed and the access cavity to the pulp was prepared by a sterile high-speed carbide bur fully and rapidly. Then each tooth was isolated by rubberdam. Afterwards, the tooth and operatory field was disinfected again using 30% hydrogen peroxide followed by 3% sodium hypochlorite and finally neutralized by 5% sodium thiosulfate. The purpose behind repeating this action is to prevent the entry of microorganisms and debris from the access cavity into the root canal. This action was performed on the tooth surface as well as on the rubberdam. Sampling from the surrounding area was later performed to ensure the effectiveness of the isolation and the sterility of the area around the tooth and then investigated as with other specimen taken from the root canal (4, 7).",

The contents of the canal were also transferred to the transport medium of thioglycolate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), if possible. A #20 Hedstrom file was inserted 1 mm shorter than the length of the canal, which was roughly measured by radiography, and removed after a brief filing operation. The cutting part of the file was separated from the file's handle with a sterile clipper and dropped into the same transport medium. The canal was then humidified by 9% normal saline and a #20 paper point (Dentsply-Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) was later inserted into the approximate length of the canal. The paper point was removed from the canal after one minute and transferred to the previous transport tube medium. In the next step, the shaving of the canal walls was performed using the #25 Hedstrom file. The cutting part of the file was separated and transferred to the same transport tube medium.

In this study, Atopobium parvulum bacterium was discovered in persistent endodontic infections for the first time. The Atopobium parvulum is an uncultivable, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacterium belonging to Actinobacteria phylum, which was identified in 1993 for the first time (27). This bacterium had a prevalence of 10% in Iranian patients with a persistent / secondary endodontic infection, which has not been found in any other country, such as Germany, China, Japan, Brazil, South Korea and Sudan (5, 9, 16, 18, 19, 28). In a previous study, a bacterium of the same genus named Atopobium rimae was recovered from teeth with chronic apical abscesses only in Germany in 2015 (10).",

E. faecalis can survive in endodontically treated teeth and has to resist intracanal disinfection procedures and intra canal medications such as calcium hydroxide (29). So this microorganism could have a role in endodontic treatment failures but the causation is unproved (30). This finding is consistent with the findings of studies in Germany (10), Brazil (7) and Japan (2), which indicates higher prevalence of this bacterium. However in some of the previous studies in other countries E. faecalis was not the predominant bacterium in secondary endodontic infections, even if present (3, 17). In this study the prevalence of E. faecalis in teeth with radiographic lesions smaller than 5 mm is higher. Kaufman found the higher prevalence of E. faecalis in endodontically treated teeth without periradicular lesions (31).",

The differences in results may be due to a variation in sample sizes, studied specimens, studied populations, detection methods, and/or presence of some interventional factors. Other potential reasons for the debates may be attributed to the differences in the microbial communities of the various studied populations (34).",

Tannerella forsythia was the most common bacterium found in the symptomatic teeth. This finding was not consistent with other studies including the study conducted in Sudan (15), where the common bacteria were firmicutes and fusobacteria. This point may indicate that the spread of bacterial species in symptomatic lesions is greater than asymptomatic lesions. Also according to metagenomics studies it is possible to suggest a close relationship between several clinical features and greater microbiota diversity with persistent endodontic infection (36). It should be noted that the number of patients is different among these studies and the presence of only 4 symptomatic patients in our study is not enough to make any conclusion in this regard.",
