These non-redundant protein sequences were aligned against the reference databases that include NR and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) using TBLASTN (e\u00a0<\u00a010\u22125) and then analyzed by MEGAN (Metagenome Analyzer) (Huson et al. 2007). The BLAST comparison thus allowed association of the proteins to their GO-term classification, as well as to a series of KO numbers. The genes and their associated information were thus projected based on their associated KO numbers onto the reference pathways in KEGG using the iPath tool (Letunic et al. 2008).",

MG-RAST annotation based on SEED subsystem was retrieved and the extracted nucleotide sequences encoding proteins were searched against the HMP oral reference genomes using BLASTN to identity their originating genomes.

First, alignments of the human reads to the reference human genome (version hg18) were performed using BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) (Li and Durbin 2009). Second, variants calling was performed using SAM (Sequence Alignment Map) tools (v 0.1.16) (Li et al. 2009a, b) and GATK (The Genome Analysis Toolkit) (v1.0) (McKenna et al. 2010) with default parameters, respectively. Third, the intersection of the variants predicted by SAM tools and GATK were taken as the final variant calls. Functional classification of point mutations was performed using ANNOVAR (functional annotation of genetic variants from high-throughput sequencing data) (Wang et al. 2010). To test the correlation between the identified SNPs and the potential phenotypes of the human hosts, the SNPs were firstly filtered with the criteria of a minimal read depth of 30 (thus more likely to represent functional variations; (Oetting 2011)). Correlations of these filtered SNPs with potential diseases and phenotypes were subsequently identified by searching the Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies (http://www.genome.gov/).",

In each of the four datasets, a significant portion of reads (30% for H samples and 50\u201360% for C samples) was found originated from microbes (Additional file 1: Table S2). The annotations by MG-RAST based on SEED subsystems (Additional file 1: Table S3) consist of four levels: Subsystem hierarchy 1, 2, 3 and \u201cfunction\u201d. In hierarchy 1, the predominant functional categories included Proteins Metabolism (~6.0%), Carbohydrate Metabolism (~9.4%), Amino Acids and Derivatives (~6.8%), Cofactors, Vitamins, Prothetic groups and Pigments (~6.0%); DNA Metabolism (~6.0%), RNA Metabolism (~5.4%). The four saliva microbiota encoded totally 5854 recognizable functions, derived from 509,644 gene sequences (Fig.\u00a01a). However, a core (shared by each microbiota) of 2203 functions derived from 33,487 gene sequences was identified (Fig.\u00a01a). At each of the three Subsystem hierarchies, saliva microbiota from different hosts exhibited a high degree of functional similarity (Fig.\u00a01b, Additional file 1: Table S3), a finding also supported by comparison based on Gene Ontology (Additional file 1: Table S4). Thus the high degree of divergence in taxonomy (OTU; Yang et al. 2012) contrasts sharply with the relative functional conservation among the four saliva microbiota. However, reconstructed metabolic maps of the four saliva microbiota revealed that the two H microbiota harbored higher levels of unique proteins in the pathways of \u2018Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis\u2019 (~40.5% enriched), \u2018Pyruvate metabolism\u2019 (~26.9% enriched) and \u2018Pentose phosphate metabolism\u2019 (~16.9% enriched) than the two C microbiota (Additional file 3: Figure S1A, B, C and D). Thus saliva microbiota of each human host represents an \u2018island\u2019 inhabited by protein collections that encode globally similar functions yet with difference at specific metabolic pathways and with even higher divergence at their residential organisms.\n",

We found that, First, for the most dominant genomes (those genomes with the top five most abundant hits; Fig.\u00a02 and Additional file 4: Figure S2), the two H microbiota featured Neisseria subflava NJ9703, while the two C microbiota featured Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. For a specific organismal lineage (i.e. a genome or a set of genomes from a phylogenetic clade), the encoded dominant functions were similar across different samples. However, different organismal lineages could encode distinct functions. For example, Prevotella veroralis F0319, Prevotella tannerae ATCC 51259 and Streptococcus mitis ATCC 6249 encoded significantly more carbohydrates metabolism genes (16\u201320%), while Eubacterium saburreum DSM 3986 and Eikenella corrodens ATCC 23834 encoded significantly fewer of them (5\u20137.52%) (Fig.\u00a02). Second, at each level of the functional hierarchy, with the decreasing abundance of the dominant genomes, diversity of the encoded functions showed a gradually decreasing trend (Fig.\u00a03a, Additional file 5: Figure S3). Thus the dominant genomes encoded more diverse functions. Thirdly, the dominant functions, at each level of the hierarchy, were similar across the four microbiota (Fig.\u00a03b), suggesting functional gene structures were more conservative among hosts than organismal structures.\n\n",

Recently, despite numerous studies analyzing species richness in oral microbiomes through sequencing of PCR-amplified rRNA genes (Griffen et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2011; Yang et al. 2012), the true genomic composition of the oral microbiota remains elusive. Xie et al. (2010) was the first reporter of the oral metagenome based on one plaque sample, followed by Belda-Ferre\u2019s et al. (2012) study on six supragingival plaque samples from different caries status. However, for saliva microbiota, there\u2019s only one report on a single sample from a healthy individual (Lazarevic et al. 2012), yet what they focused is the bacterial profile, instead of functional feature. In this study, we choose unstimulated saliva as the origin of saliva samples, to avoid the potential that procedure of stimulated saliva sample collective may dilute or lead to quantity difference of the saliva microbiota (Schafer et al. 2014; Yakob et al. 2014; Belstrom et al. 2016).

However, as were observed from these four saliva samples, microbial DNA can represent 30\u201360% of total saliva DNA (the remaining 40\u201370% was human-originated), suggesting the need to consider microbial activities as additional contributors to normal salivary function. For example, the enrichment of denitrification-gene in saliva microbiota (mainly in Neisseria and Actinomyces) provided a potential biogenesis mechanism for the observed NO2\n\u2212 and NO in human mouth (Duncan et al. 1995). Dietary NO3\n\u2212 is concentrated in salivary glands after being absorbed from intestine into blood, resulting in millimolar concentration of salivary NO3\n\u2212 (Lundberg et al. 2008). Conversion of oral NO3\n\u2212 to NO2\n\u2212 or NO is implicated in periodontal and caries diseases, and moreover, regulates signaling in human immune system, stimulates gastric blood flow, and regulates vasodilatation (Brennan et al. 2003; Lundberg et al. 2008). On the other hand, NO exhibits microbial cytotoxicity by facilitating nitrosative stress and inhibiting heme-containing proteins within the aerobic respiratory chain (Forrester and Foster 2012). Interestingly, flavohaemoglobin (flavoHb), another function specifically enriched in saliva microbiota (mainly Actinomyces and Gemella), converts NO to inert nitrate (NO3\n\u2212) and undergoes catalytic NO regeneration via flavin-dependent reduction (Forrester and Foster 2012). These predicted microbial functions in saliva will need to be experimentally validated in in vitro or in vivo models.",

Our result suggested that (i) functional profiles of saliva microbiota can be sensitive to the caries state; and (ii) changes in host health state can be more important than difference in ecological sites in determining the functional profiles of oral microbiota. The roots of such sensitivity in microbial function to host disease/health state can be traced to the genome-function links in saliva microbiota. We have previously demonstrated a high degree of divergence in organismal structure and a minimal organismal core in human saliva microbiota among host individuals (Yang et al. 2012), however it was not clear how the collective functions of saliva microbes were assembled from the component organisms. Based on our result, conservation of human saliva microbiomes is higher at the functional level than at the organismal level. Each genome tends to encode specific functions, thus the abundance-change of community structure can result in functional alteration of the community. However, dominant genomes tend to encode more diverse functions, while their contributions to dominant functions are not apparent. A set of core functions encoded in multiple abundant organismal lineages with a high degree of redundancy is present, thus not a single phylotype is irreplaceable. Each individual microbiota can thus be viewed as an \u2018island\u2019 inhabited by unique collections of microbial phylotypes: different species assemblages converge on shared core functions provided by distinct organismal components. These findings explained the absence of a microbial organismal core among hosts (Yang et al. 2012), as well as the presence of a large functional core characteristic of the disease state of caries.",

Among the 1485\u20137341 exonic SNPs in each dataset, 44\u201347% corresponded to non-synonymous changes. Distributions of SNPs derived from our shallow sequencing of total saliva DNA were actually similar to those from human-genome deep-sequencing (where 0.7\u20130.9% SNPs are exonic and 48\u201352% of the exonic SNPs are non-synonymous (Xue et al. 2010; Le and Durbin 2011), with the differences between the two strategies as low as from 0.5% for exonic regions (t test p value =\u00a00.005) to ~5% for non-synonymous coding-sequence changes (p value =\u00a00.020). In H114, two non-synonymous mutations in MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau), which was associated with inheritable Parkinson\u2019s disease (Trotta et al. 2011) were identified. This genotype was subsequently found consistent with the host\u2019s family history. Therefore, in addition to microbial genotypes, saliva can provide readily and valuable access to host genotypes (Quinque et al. 2006). These results demonstrated that the representation of human genomic DNA in saliva is largely complete and unbiased and that human genetic polymorphisms such as SNPs can be unraveled via saliva whole-ecosystem-sequencing without apparent physical or sequence bias.",

The primary purpose of this pilot study was to describe the genomic composition of the saliva, showing a number of technical and practical issues in metagenomic sequencing and data analysis, like the percentage of human-originated or microbiome-originated content in salivary DNA, what software or database should be used for functional assignment or SNP analysis, the link between the members and function among the community and indication of microbial activities\u2019 contribution to host\u2019s normal or diseased state etc. It is our hope that this information will prove useful for other investigators in the oral microbiome research community. The results obtained are interesting but are secondary to the technical issues resolved during this pilot study. We expect that in the future, upon availability of funding, more biology-oriented and large-sample based study could be applied to unravel previously unappreciated microbe-mediated functions in salivary, as well as new strategies for manipulating the role of saliva in health and diseases.",
