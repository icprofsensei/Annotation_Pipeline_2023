The microbiome associated with this disease may be an important component of the disease, though studies to date have been based on sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and have revealed unequivocal results. Here, we employed metagenomic sequencing of the upper bronchial tract (UBT) microbiome to allow for greater elucidation of its taxonomic composition, and revealing functional changes associated with the disease. The bacterial metagenomes within sputum samples from eight COPD patients and ten \u2018healthy\u2019 smokers (Controls) were sequenced, and suggested significant changes in the abundance of bacterial species, particularly within the Streptococcus genus. The functional capacity of the COPD UBT microbiome indicated an increased capacity for bacterial growth, which could be an important feature in bacterial-associated acute exacerbations. Regression analyses correlated COPD severity (FEV1% of predicted) with differences in the abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and functional classifications related to a reduced capacity for bacterial sialic acid metabolism. This study suggests that the COPD UBT microbiome could be used in patient risk stratification and in identifying novel monitoring and treatment methods, but study of a longitudinal cohort will be required to unequivocally relate these features of the microbiome with COPD severity.",

COPD is usually caused by smoking in the developed world and is an umbrella term for a multisystemic inflammatory state, including several diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Patients experience acute exacerbations which may be triggered by environmental pollutants or infection. Approximately 75% of acute exacerbations are attributed to viral or bacterial infection, or a combination of both [2]. Characterisation of bacteria cultured from the airways of COPD patients has linked exacerbations with pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis [3]. Since the advent of culture-independent techniques, especially amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, the lung microbiome of COPD has been more widely studied [4\u201310]. However, to date, these studies have had conflicting results in terms of the taxonomic composition of the lung microbiome in COPD.",

More recent work, with a larger cohort of moderate and severe COPD patients, suggested increased microbial diversity in more severe COPD [5]. Due to the heterogeneous nature of COPD, the concept of a \u2018core\u2019 microbiome in the lung has proved difficult to establish for the disease. Candidate genera constituting the core microbiome, from a number of COPD lung microbiome studies, include Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Prevotella and Fusobacteria [2].",

However, because it is limited to the sequencing of a single region of DNA, it is not able to robustly describe the functional capacity of the microbiome. It has been suggested that changes in the functional capacity of the human microbiome may be of higher importance in health and disease, than changes in its taxonomic composition [11]. Shotgun metagenomics approaches allows for sequencing of the entire genomic component of the human microbiome. This means that both the taxonomic composition and functional capacity of the microbiome can be investigated in much greater detail than previously possible [12]. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, no metagenomic study of the COPD microbiome exists within the literature. Other respiratory conditions have been studied with this method, such as cystic fibrosis, though with relatively small sample numbers, such as two [13], five [14], and ten [15].",

A number of possible sampling biofluids are possible, such as BAL, tissue biopsy, or sputum. In this study, we have chosen to use spontaneously produced sputum as it offers a non-invasive sampling method, and thus could offer the easiest method of sample collection if analysis of the microbiome in COPD patients becomes clinically useful. Recent work has suggested that sputum and BAL samples offer spatially distinct representations of the lung microbiome. BAL samples appear to represent the lower bronchial mucosal flora and sputum samples the upper bronchial tract [8]. Therefore, care should be taken in the interpretation of COPD microbiome studies in view of the difference between spatially distinct regions of the lung.",

The MINITAB 14 package was used for regression analyses of taxonomic and functional assignments associated with COPD severity. The MINITAB 14 package uses the computational routine Givens transformations using LINPACK routines [20]. The regression model uses the equation y = \u03b20 + \u03b21X1 + e where y equals the response, \u03b2K equals the population regression coefficients, X equals the predictors, and e equals the error term with a normal distribution, mean of 0, and standard deviation of \u03b1. Within this regression model, the FEV1% of predicted was considered the independent variable. The pairwise correlation of variables are performed by multiple Pearson analyses using the well-established correlograms (corrgrams) programme [21]. The outputs are hierarchically clustered based on dissimilarity measures. The outputs are given in piecharts where the filled portion of the pie indicates the magnitude of the correlation and the depth of the shading indicates the magnitude of the correlation.

At the crudest functional classification; Level 1, (S1 Fig), there were significantly fewer alignments to carbohydrate genes in COPD patients but increases in clustering-based subsystems, horizontal gene transfer and nucleosides and nucleotides. At the more resolved Level 2 functional classification (S2 Fig) 26 classifications exhibited significant differences, with 22 higher in COPD patients. Only significantly higher abundance differences in COPD patients were observed at the most resolved Level 3 (Fig 4). These latter metagenomic alignments appear to centre on functional classifications involved in bacterial growth, including bacterial cell division, nucleosides and nucleotides and amino acid, protein and RNA metabolism.",

Notable positive functional correlations for smoking pack years were with bacterial DNA repair, potassium homeostasis and the protease modulator YbbK [22]. With regards to age, the Ochrobactrum genus showed a significant positive relationship with age (R2 = 51.6%, P = 0.045), and specifically O. anthropi (R2 = 51.6%, P = 0.045).

The correlation coefficient by corrgrams indicates a positive correlation (blue colour) and negative correlation (red colour) with the colour intensity indicative of the strength of the correlation. The order of variables is determined by the hierarchical clustering in which the correlation is the dissimilarity measure. R2 values are displayed in S3 Fig. Focusing on FEV1% of predicted, corrgrams analyses indicated positive correlations with mono, di and oligo-saccharides, age, and sialic acid metabolism indicative of sugar changes within the sputum linked to COPD severity. FEV1% of predicted significantly correlated with changes in the Streptococcus class / Streptococcus pneumoniae but with no other bacterial species. Age may have been a confounding factor in our analysis of the COPD metagenome, and in fact, age appeared to exhibit distinctive correlations with a number of metagenome features. Significant negative correlations with age were seen with proline, hydroxyproline, glutamine and glutamate metabolism and uptake indicative of altered, most likely reduced, bacterial nitrogen (N) metabolism as the patients aged. Negative correlations with age were seen with Ochrobacterium sp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The abundance of these species appeared to be strongly correlated with alterations in proline, hydroxyproline, glutamate and glutamine metabolism. Examining other strong correlations reveals a particularly strong node positively correlates Neisseria sp., YbbK and bacterial DNA repair. These appear to be negatively correlated with smoking pack years but not with FEV1% of predicted. Smoking pack years also negatively correlated with potassium homeostasis and metabolism.",

However, due to the limitations of the extent of sequence information obtained from (for example) 16S rRNA amplicons these have not unambiguously identified the species present. Further, functions of the bacterial population can at best only be suggested. Our study therefore, being the first metagenomic study of the microbiome in patients with COPD provides a more accurate description of the bacterial population structure down to the species level of resolution.

One of the suggestions arising from this work was that changes in certain functional classes could be used as a personalised disease risk factor. This is a valid possibility given increasingly reducing sequencing costs and the accessibility of DNA sequencing platforms. Within the context of COPD, any personalised medicine strategy would need to be based on minimally invasive sampling, thus, our study was based on spontaneous sputum rather than BAL sampling [25]. A wide range of features have been suggested as biomarkers for the progression of COPD making risk stratification of patient cohorts to improve monitoring and treatment plausible [26]. The microbiome may prove to be an effective source of such biomarkers in COPD and has already been suggested as useful for risk stratification in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [27].",

Importantly, we noted increases in four bacterial species\u2014all pathogens\u2014to above detection limits, only in COPD patients. Interestingly, although none of our patients were exacerbating, we commonly found S. aureus and S. maltophilia in the UBT microbiome of COPD patients although these have been linked with acute exacerbation [28]. Indeed, S. maltophilia has also been linked to exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients [29]. Our observations, could suggest that these species may also be linked to reduced FEV1% of predicted as much as exacerbation. Thus, besides offering increased understanding of the developing underlying pathology, these four bacterial species could act as biomarkers for higher risk COPD patients.",

Our analyses did not suggest any significant correlation between P. aeruginosa and FEV1% of predicted. However, as P. aeruginosa does not appear to be part of the detected core UBT microbiome of our baseline COPD patients, it may be that any change in the abundance of this opportunistic pathogen is linked to exacerbation rather than COPD severity [32]. Conversely, H. influenzae was part of the common and possibly \u2018core\u2019 microbiome and did not change in abundance in our COPD patients. Taken together, these observations indicate that abundance changes in these bacteria species would be poor biomarkers for COPD progression. We did find a significant positive correlation with S. pneumonia and FEV1% of predicted, suggesting that as airflow obstruction increases (i.e. low FEV1% of predicted), the percentage abundance of S. pneumonia decreases. S. pneumonia is frequently cultured from the sputum samples of patients during exacerbations [30,31], and it is the main target of initial treatment with penicillin antibiotics. Detecting subtle changes S. pneumonia load, may allow prediction of COPD progression and allow earlier interventions.",

These observations suggesting increased bacterial cell division were in line with a non-microbiome study where greater bacterial load has been linked to periods of COPD exacerbation [9]. We also noted increases in genetic factors linked to horizontal gene transfer which could indicate that large-scale genetic exchanges may be a characteristic of the COPD UBT microbiome, similar to the bacterial genomic flux which appears to be a feature of cystic fibrosis patients [33]. Our functional analysis also revealed the significant increase in alignments to the heat shock dnaK gene cluster, which in bacteria is responsible for producing the heat shock protein Hsp70. Analogues of Hsp70 have been shown to have significant anti-inflammatory responses in many inflammatory diseases [34]. Thus, Hsp70 could provide a mechanism for bacterial defence from the inflammatory mediators inherent within the lungs of COPD patients.",

                    "text": "A further, significant, positive correlation was observed between FEV1% of predicted and the percentage abundance of genes associated with sialic acid metabolism; i.e. they decreased as COPD symptoms worsened. Sialic acids are nine carbon sugars backbone monosaccharides mainly decorating the outside of vertebrate cells, but also some microbes [35\u201337]. Extracellular sialic acid moieties have many roles in vertebrate immunology and can act to mask cell surface receptors or act as recognition sites for various lectins and antibodies. These roles include the modulation of leukocyte trafficking via selectins and influencing complement activation [38]. Sialic acid binding immunoglobulins (Ig)-like lectins (siglecs) are found in immune cells and will recognise different linkage-specific sialic acids. Examples of siglecs are siglec-3/CD33 related-siglecs found on haematopoietic cell lineages, siglec-9 on natural killer (NK) cells and siglec-8 only on circulating eosinophils. After binding sialyated moieties, siglecs can drive the internalisation of sialyated pathogens and crucially, modulate pathogen-/damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMP)-mediated inflammation along with inhibition of NK cell activation. Sialic acid-Siglec interaction therefore, serves to maintain a baseline non-activated state of innate immune cells, and limit inflammatory response activation through PAMP/DAMP recognition [39]. The pathological advantages to the pathogen of acquired sialic acid decoration is therefore to augment siglec mediated avoidance of PAMP/DAMP recognition [39\u201341]. Additionally, the presence of sialylated lipopolysaccharide on the bacterial surface can prevent complement activation by binding to the C3 component of the complement cascade [42]. Our study suggests that with decreasing FEV1% of predicted scores decreasing sialic metabolite would indicate a shift towards a lesser capacity to avoid recognition and thus suppress inflammation\u2014a key feature of COPD. Thus, a reduction in sialic acid metabolising capacity in the bacteria bacterial population could be an important pathological feature in COPD progression.",

Here, we have associated a number of taxonomic and functional features of the microbiome with COPD severity. Of these, two features, S. pneumonia and sialic acid metabolism have regression associations with the age of COPD patients with significance P values of less than 0.1. Albeit not significant, these values suggest that in a longitudinal study associating COPD severity and progression with taxonomic and functional features of the microbiome, the age of COPD patients may be a confounding variable that needs to be controlled for.",
