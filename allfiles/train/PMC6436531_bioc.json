Although host genetics predispose toward food allergy (4), genetic change does not occur on this time scale. Increasing attention has been paid to environmental factors, including the microbiome, that may be contributing to food allergy risk.

Because microbiota associated with individual food allergies may differ by food allergen, and the goal of this study was to examine microbiota associated with egg allergy in particular, we removed from the analysis CoFAR subjects with any other food allergies at enrollment or during the CoFAR observational period so that we could optimally compare subjects with egg allergy only to subjects with no food allergy. Specifically, among the 492 CoFAR subjects with available stool samples, we removed 345 samples from subjects with non-egg food allergy at any point during the CoFAR study and 6 samples that failed sequencing or quality control, leaving 141 samples, of which 66 had egg allergy only and the remaining 75 had no food allergy (control group) (Figure 1).",

To map the 16S rRNA reads into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (23), defined as taxonomic units based on DNA sequences that share high identity, we used closed reference OTU picking as previously described (7). Each read was assigned to an OTU based on sequence similarity of at least 97% to the representative sequence of the OTU collection from the GreenGenes Database (v13.8) (http://greengenes.secondgenome.com). Alpha diversity (the richness and/or evenness) of a sample in terms of the diversity of OTUs observed in it) was calculated based on the Chao1 Index (24), Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity (25), and Shannon (H) index (26) by sub-sampling ten times at maximum rarefaction depth of 2,000 reads. To assess between-sample composition differences, beta diversity was measured using unweighted UniFrac distances (27). PERMANOVA (permutational multivariate analysis of variance) (28) was used to test beta diversity based on UniFrac distances. PERMANOVA is a non-parametric test similar to ANOVA but that does not require the data to be normally distributed. PERMANOVA P values were calculated by performing 2000 permutations and were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (<5% FDR). To identify fecal microbiota differentiating subjects with and without egg allergy, as well as subjects with and without egg sensitization, we used linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) (29), a method for biomarker discovery, on the normalized relative abundances of taxa. LEfSe scores measure the consistence of differences in relative abundance between taxa in the groups analyzed (e.g. egg allergy vs. controls), with a higher score indicating higher consistency. As LEfSe does not allow for multiple covariate adjustment, we then used logistic regression to identify bacterial genera associated with egg allergy in models adjusted for these potential confounders: age, breast-feeding status, antibiotic usage, and baseline atopic dermatitis score. Solid food intake was considered as a potential confounder but not included in the adjusted model due its colinearity with age based on variancePartition (30) analysis (Figure S1). We used an analogous approach to identify genera associated with egg sensitization (egg sIgE \u2265 0.35 kUA/L).",

In analyses stratified by age, atopic dermatitis, breastfeeding, and antibiotic use, alpha diversity indices were also higher in subjects with egg allergy vs. controls (Figure S2-S5), although significance was not observed in some strata due to smaller sample sizes.",

Relative abundances at the phylum level based on egg sensitization status are shown in Figure 5A, which showed an enrichment of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia in egg sensitized subjects concordant with what was seen for egg allergy. Univariate analyses for potential confounders showed that age and race were associated with egg sensitization (P = 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 and P = 7 \u00d7 10\u22124, respectively), but there were no significant associations between other covariates (sex, atopic dermatitis, breastfeeding, mode of birth, antibiotic use) and egg sensitization. LEfSe analysis and logistic regression models adjusted for age and race identified 2 genera that were enriched in egg sensitized children: Roseburia (family Lachnospiraceae) and Faecalibacterium (family Ruminococcaceae) (Figure 5B).",

For example, obese individuals have fewer types of gut bacteria than their lean counterparts (34). A beneficial association between bacterial diversity and disease is not always the case, however, as multiple studies of asthma have shown that airway bacterial diversity can be higher in individuals with asthma vs. controls (35, 36). Linked epidemiologically by the atopic march (37), egg allergy and asthma have some shared etiological origins, and observing a consistency in their respective associations with increased bacterial diversity suggests a nuanced relationship between microbial diversity and specific diseases. It is likely that the role of the microbiome in health and disease is not easily captured by any one dimension such as alpha diversity and should be considered with component taxa, their interactions, and their metabolic effects in the context of specific disease phenotypes (6, 38).",

Consistent with our findings, a murine study of food allergy demonstrated differential abundance of taxa from Lachnospiraceae in ovalbumin-sensitized food allergy-prone mice with a gain-of-function mutation in the IL-4 receptor-a chain (39). Microbial communities dominated by Lachnospiraceae have also been reported in children with milk allergy (14). However, the same study detected lower levels of Streptococcaceae in milk allergic children. We note that the associations from our and others\u2019 studies are from cross-sectional analyses, so causation cannot be inferred. In children without egg allergy, we found enrichment of Leuconostoc. Consistent with potentially protective effects from this genus on allergy diathesis, strains from this genus inhibit serum levels of total IgE, IgG1, IgG2, and increase OVA-specific IFN-gamma production in an ovalbumin-induced allergy mouse model (40). A limitation of cross-study comparisons is that implicated taxa are often reported at varying taxonomic levels (6). Because the biological impacts of microbiota are likely at the strain level, different strains within the same family may have disparate effects. Additionally, the heterogeneity of food allergy and different practices in clinical phenotyping, sample collection, and sample processing can lead to disparate results in microbiome studies (6).",

To better understand the implications of the bacterial taxa associated with egg allergy, we used metagenomic functional prediction to infer metabolic pathways impacted by these microbiota. Interestingly, we found differential purine metabolism by the gut microbiota of egg allergic subjects. Metabolomic studies have shown that the purine pathway may be involved in the induction of peanut allergy, with peanut allergic children and mice undergoing peanut sensitization both demonstrating altered levels of uric acid, a product of purine metabolism (42). Depletion of uric acid in mice changes the development of peanut-specific IgE and IgG1 and anaphylaxis, while exogenous manipulation of uric acid can modulate the peanut allergic phenotype (42). It is possible that the altered purine metabolism associated with the early-life gut microbiota of egg allergic children in our study reflects a related role for purine metabolism in egg allergy.",

In contrast, other studies have reported no association between gut microbiota and food allergen sensitization (7, 43, 44). The studies that found no association between sensitization and gut microbiota focused on sensitization to different foods (e.g. milk (7)) or several foods simultaneously (43, 44). Gut microbiota may be specific to individual food allergens (6).",

It would have been ideal for our controls to have been completely nonatopic, but we were constrained by the inclusion criteria for the overarching CoFAR study (17). That said, our controls had no egg allergy or other food allergy. Some were sensitized (without clinical allergy) and most had atopic dermatitis. Because large population studies have shown that a significant proportion of sensitized individuals have no clinical allergy (45), it was reasonable not to exclude sensitized non-allergic individuals from the control group. Further, we specifically performed a secondary analysis focused on egg sensitization. To address the limitation of high atopic dermatitis prevalence, we adjusted for atopic dermatitis (and other potential confounders including age, breastfeeding, and antibiotic usage) in our analyses. We applied bioinformatic approaches to 16S rRNA data to infer metabolic pathways affected by the gut bacteria differentially abundant in egg allergy. Bias by the 16S region targeted is possible and future work could include direct metabolite profiling to corroborate these inferences. Last, although our sample processing was consistent with well-established protocols (19\u201321) and was uniformly implemented for all samples, we cannot rule out that results for particular taxa could be influenced by methodological parameters (46\u201349). By studying children from CoFAR, we examined a well-established and large, multi-center sample of children with and without egg allergy determined by rigorous criteria (18) with contemporaneous stool collections at enrollment. We emphasize that this is one of the largest studies of the microbiome in food allergy (6), and the only to focus on egg allergy.",

The distinct gut microbiota in egg allergic and egg-sensitized children identified by our study may point to targets for preventive or therapeutic intervention, especially if specific strains within these taxa can be identified via deeper sequencing. Our finding of differential purine metabolism by gut microbiota associated with egg allergy should be independently validated. The results from this study contribute to an evolving picture of egg allergy and food allergy overall, where resident bacteria may have more mechanistic impact on allergy than previously thought.",
