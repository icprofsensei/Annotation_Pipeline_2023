The laboratory findings were comprehensively analysed against demographical and clinical data. A total of 527 isolates were enrolled with a higher proportion of Saudi citizens (76.5%), elderly (>60 years) patients (34.2%), and male gender (65.3%) respectively. Overall, 75.1% isolates were pulmonary origin with a proven clinical significance of 44.7%. In total, 34 NTM species including 17 rare species were identified, in addition to 8 \u2018undefined\u2019 isolates. M.simiae (22.6%), M.fortuitum (18.1%) and M.abscessus (17.8%) were predominant species. Interestingly, 27 new cases of clinically relevant M.riyadhense were also noticed (Primary data on emergence of rare NTM species and M.riyadhense has been recently reported). Results showed, rare clinical events such as mycobacteremia, cecum abscess, peritonitis and ascites caused by M.wolinskyi, M.holsaticum, M.duvalii and M.monacence respectively. Diabetes mellitus (P value-0.04) and previous history of tuberculosis (P value- 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases.",

Pulmonary and extrapulmonary Infections caused by NTM\u2019s increased globally in immune-suppressed and immune-competent individuals without an exemption to Saudi Arabia. However, recent developments in diagnostic platforms improved the identification of several new and rare species of NTM\u2019s. Interestingly, recent studies linked the direct impact of species spectrum on clinical outcome and therapies. To date, in Saudi Arabia, no systematic nationwide surveillance study was conducted on the challenges of NTM causing diseases. Therefore, for the first time, a nationwide inventory study on the spectrum of clinically relevant pulmonary and extra pulmonary diseases with an attempt to explore epidemiological data has been carried out. The study results showed a huge species spectrum of NTM\u2019s causing highly diverse clinical manifestations. Clinical relevance pulmonary infection was relatively high and several very rare extrapulmonary infections also were observed. The study reported the emergence of a rare pathogen, Mycobacterium riyadhense and predominance of Mycobacterium simiae as the most common species. As the first large scale study from the GCC region, the findings cements the growing potential of various NTM species to cause significant clinical implications in the country and warrants an immediate change on disease management priorities.",

Although, immunosuppressive illnesses and therapies are regarded as major predisposing factors, there was recent increase of NTM incidences among immunocompetent patients. Despite this rise, NTM diseases are not yet considered as serious public health threat and these diseases remain largely neglected in most parts of the world. Unlike tuberculosis, NTM causing diseases are not notifiable conditions in most of the countries, except in regions like Australia [6]. Scarcity of evidences to support human-to-human transmission and the facultative nature of NTM entities have contributed remarkably towards such negligence. To date, almost 150 species of NTM\u2019s are officially recognized as per the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature (http://www.bacterio.net/mycobacterium.html). The pathogenic potential of most of the species is still not fully defined and hardly few dozen are only familiar to clinicians and microbiologist [7]. Species spectrum of NTM\u2019s are mostly associated with geographical distribution, thus the diversity varies from region to region [8].",

Clinical relevance of pulmonary group was defined according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines [9]. Briefly, clinical relevance was confirmed if cases meet any of the following criteria, culture positivity detected in a minimum of two separate sputum or tracheal aspirates; one lung tissue with histopathological relevance; or bronchio-alveolar lavage. All the extrapulmonary cases were considered as clinically relevant. Mortality data has been collected after referring to the laboratory records at the end of sample collection period (month 22\u201324) from each study sites.",

Demographical data revealed a higher proportion of NTM infection among Saudi nationals and particularly male, which is consistent with similar findings from recent but rather limited studies [11, 12]. Dominance of male gender is in concordance with a small study from Korea, while countries like USA showed female gender predominance in larger studies [1, 19]. The real reason behind such increased proportion among male gender is totally unclear. However, majority (80.5%) of Saudi patients have at least one underlying risk conditions including several cases with multiple comorbidities. The severe immunocompromised conditions such as lymphomas, carcinomas and leukaemia were mostly found among Saudi (>90%) patient cohort. Moreover, increased frequency of genetic predisposing conditions among the Saudi nationals mainly due to higher rate of consanguinity, increasing rate of different immunosuppressive therapies and various malignancies could be additional risks factors to increase the susceptibility to NTM infections [20\u201322]. Current data showed, individuals aged above 60 years were under particular risk of NTM infections, similar to studies reported with a higher isolation rate of NTM\u2019s among elderly from Saudi Arabia and rest of the world [3, 12, 23]. Positive HIV cases were very much limited (2.6%) and comparably lower to other countries. It is worth mentioning that, the HIV prevalence among Saudi population (<4 cases/100000 populations) is very low and hence the same is reflected in our cohort [24].",

All of these provinces are major regions for agriculture in the country, with several natural water sources. However, the central province has relatively different species diversity. M.simiae was dominant in the province followed by M.riyadhense and M.fortuitum. Central region is a landlocked province with lesser agriculture lands and limited water sources (mostly depending on desalination plants in other regions). We assume M.riyadhense is emerging as a new pathogen highly confined to the Central province of the country. M.simiae domination may probably relate to an outbreak as it was not evident in previous studies [12, 25]. Although, the sample size was small, Northern Province showed predominance of M.fortuitum followed by M.kansasii. The relatively low isolation may be linked to the overall low population density in the region.",

Presence of rare species of NTM\u2019s which cause both pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases to the Saudi population may show the potential adaptability of them in the country. Higher prevalence of Saudi population with NTM diseases must be investigated thoroughly to rule out the possibilities of NTM disease vulnerability.
