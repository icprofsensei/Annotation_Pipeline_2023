Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) created by DADA2 were assigned taxonomy, using a self-trained Na\u00efve Bayes classifier and the Silva database [24].

This was performed at the genus level, after omitting ASVs containing < 1% of the total amount of sequences. Differential abundances of taxa between disease states were analysed using an ANOVA-like differential expression procedure (Aldex2) in R [27]. Diversity analyses were performed after sub-setting all samples at the number of sequences of the sparsest sample (rarefaction). Beta-diversity visualized as non-metric multidimensional scaling plots (NMDS), were analysed with permutation tests of multivariate homogeneity of variances, permuted analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and Procrustes analyses in the Vegan package in R [28]. For analyses of clinical data relative to measurements from biological samples StataSE (StataCorp LP. Release 14. College Station, TX) was used.

In a previous study from the BCCS and BCES, we have shown the same disease state related pattern of change as found in the current study [18]. In patients where the composition of the taxa in sputum changed with disease state, SLPI was significantly lower during exacerbations compared to those patients where the sputum composition was unchanged. Presumably this is a response to the microbial shift, for instance by degradation of SLPI by host and microbial proteases. However, in theory it could also be opposite; that during an exacerbation the immune response leads to changes in taxonomic compositions. In vitro studies are likely necessary to elucidate specific mechanisms. For the other markers, we could not find an association with shifts in taxonomic composition. Low sample size is perhaps the most likely explanation for this, in addition to the inherent heterogeneity of the COPD exacerbations.",

This was the case for both stable state and exacerbation, and there were no significant changes in its abundance across disease states. Even though several studies have found Haemophilus to be of importance related to inflammation and exacerbation risk [36, 37], we could not find that Haemophilus discriminated between disease states when measured in induced sputum. This could reflect the sample size in the current study, and should not be interpreted as changes in Haemophilus being without importance. An imperative consideration when evaluating taxonomic composition is that increasing levels of one taxon invariably will result in decreases in others, since the sum total is 100%. We have used the Yue-Clayton index (1-\u03b8YC) in an attempt to quantify the difference, but the cut-off value of 0.2 is arbitrary and no established consensus on what constitutes a biologically meaningful cut-off value exist. If the entire ecological content of a sample, or the overabundance of one low-abundant pathogen is more relevant to exacerbation risk, then a cut-off of 0.2 may be too high.",

We used the Decontam algorithm in R to identify likely contaminants, which were then excluded from the study. However, the lack of negative controls remains a weakness, as that could possibly have led to a more precise identification of contaminants. Second, over the three years of the study, two different technicians performed the initial processing of the samples, although with the same protocol. And, although the same study personnel later analyzed all samples with the same protocol, all paired samples were not always analyzed on the same laboratory runs. Analyses of taxonomy and beta diversity did not reveal clear differences in relative abundance between runs or significant differences in beta-diversity, and thus no adjustment for runs were used. However, some laboratory induced inter-pair variation cannot be excluded. Third, since the study compares pairs both where the stable state comes prior to the exacerbation and vice versa, the study is a comparison between disease states, and no chronological sequence of events can be assumed. Fourth, the sample size of the study is too small to make inferences about whether some subgroups like patients with different disease severity have larger variations in their microbiota than other subgroups. Fifth, variability between consecutive samples could not be addressed as participants delivered only one sample at each visit. Sixth, sputum was examined and discarded if the number of cells was < 1 million/mL or number of epithelial cells > 20%. However, even if deemed representative of the lower airways, sputum will invariably contain some microbial contamination from the relatively high-biomass oral cavity. For less contamination prone sampling of the lower airways, bronchoscopy is preferred, however, that is not feasible during COPD exacerbations. Seventh, the true stability of the airways\u2019 microbiome is yet unknown, thus some of the change between the stable state and the exacerbations, may just reflect the fluctuating nature of the microbiome. Finally, amplicon sequencing only tells us which bacteria are present and their relative abundance based on the amplicon sequenced (in our case 16S rDNA).",

This is indicative of future challenges in development of applicable anti/pro-biotic treatment for groups of COPD patients. At the same time local inflammation is associated with the changes in microbiota, indicating the microbiota has significant implications for respiratory health. Further mechanistic studies are needed to examine the interaction between the microbiota and local inflammation.",
