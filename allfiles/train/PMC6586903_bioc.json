Gold standard approaches require laborious measurements of total microbial load, or absolute number of microorganisms, to accurately determine taxonomic shifts. Therefore, most studies rely on relative abundance data. Here, we demonstrate common pitfalls in comparing relative abundance across samples and identify two solutions that reveal microbial changes without the need to estimate total microbial load. We define the notion of \u201creference frames\u201d, which provide deep intuition about the compositional nature of microbiome data. In an oral time series experiment, reference frames alleviate false positives and produce consistent results on both raw and cell-count normalized data. Furthermore, reference frames identify consistent, differentially abundant microbes previously undetected in two independent published datasets from subjects with atopic dermatitis. These methods allow reassessment of published relative abundance data to reveal reproducible microbial changes from standard sequencing output without the need for new assays.",

Further, there was no correlation in p-value distribution between the relative and absolute abundance data (Spearman r\u2009=\u20090.09), highlighting issues when the null hypothesis is not consistent between the relative abundances and the absolute abundances.",

Here, we highlight Actinomyces and Haemophilus species, which have very different ranks. Actinomyces tend to have low ranks and Haemophilus have high ranks. The difference in ranks between these taxa correctly suggests that Haemophilus taxa are more prevalent relative to other taxa before brushing, and Actinomyces taxa are more prevalent relative to other taxa after brushing. From the t-test results on relative abundances it appears that Actinomyces significantly increased (t-statistic\u2009=\u20093.74, p-value\u2009=\u20090.002) after brushing teeth and that Haemophilus significantly decreased (t-statistic\u2009=\u2009\u22123.67, p-value\u2009=\u20090.002).

Haemophilus is typically found on the periphery of oral biofilms and was likely removed from the biofilm during the brushing process, whereas Actinomyces is generally found on the surface of the tooth and acts as an anchor for biofilm attachment25. Importantly, this experiment demonstrates the potential fallibility of relying on relative abundance; it is incorrect to conclude that Actinomyces increases after tooth brushing despite the increase in relative abundance. As demonstrated by flow cytometry, total microbial load decreases, and while both Haemophilus and Actinomyces decrease, Haemophilus decreases more.",

ANCOM identified multiple significantly changing microbes. One of these detected microbes was Veillonella, which conflicts with absolute abundances suggesting that Veillonella is not significantly changing (t-statistic\u2009=\u20091.04, p-value\u2009=\u20090.315).

A recent shotgun metagenomic study examined the skin microbiome over time during an AD flare and recovery. The authors observed a decrease in Staphylococcus aureus relative abundance in the healthy, recovered skin (non-lesioned) compared to AD flare (lesion), but no significant changes in the relative abundance of Malassezia species over time in these AD patients27.",

In this dataset, the relative abundance of M. globosa significantly increased between lesioned and non-lesioned skin (Fig.\u00a03e, t-statistic\u2009=\u20094.135, p-value\u2009=\u20090.0001). But the ratio of M. globosa: P. acnes increased even more dramatically in lesioned skin (t-statistic\u2009=\u20097.298, p-value\u2009=\u20099.729\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22129) (Fig.\u00a03d). These results are congruent with a previous report that M. globosa was cultivated more successfully from lesioned versus non-lesioned sites in AD29. Thus, DR analysis can identify novel, clinically significant microbial changes, which can be validated across cohorts by choosing insightful reference frames.",

To remove human cells and salivary debris, samples were filtered using a sterile 5\u2009\u03bcm syringe filter (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH). 5\u2009\u03bcl 20x SYBR green (SYBRTM Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain, Invitrogen) was added to 1\u2009mL of the microbial suspension (0.1x final concentration) and incubated in the dark for 15\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Finally, 50\u2009\u03bcl AccuCount Fluorescent Particles (Spherotech, ACFP-70-10) were added for assessment of microbial load. Samples were processed on a SH800 Cell Sorter (Sony Biotechnology) using a 100\u2009\u03bcm chip with the threshold set on FL1 at 0.06%, and gain settings as follows; FSC\u2009=\u20094, BSC\u2009=\u200925%, FL1\u2009=\u200943%, FL4\u2009=\u200950%. The gating strategy was adapted from Vandeputte et al.12 Briefly, fluorescent microbial cells were gated from background on a FL1-Fl4 density plot. Aggregates were excluded by taking the linear fraction on a plot of FL1-height versus FL1-area as previously described49, and remaining background was removed by eliminating large events detected on a FSC-BSC density plot (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Negative controls (sterile PBS stained identically to samples) were run between each sample set to exclude cross-contamination. Settings were identical among all samples.",
