Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is the most common disorder among FGID[5], affecting 10-20% of adults and adolescents in the US[6]. Traditionally, IBS has been viewed as a disorder of altered intestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity, in which the clinical presentation and the severity of the symptoms can be influenced by various psychosocial factors[7]. IBS can present as diarrhea, constipation, or mixed bowel type predominant. Despite intensive research over the past two decades the etiology of IBS remains poorly understood, thus leading to limited effective treatments for patients with these disorders[8].",

However, the results of these studies are not consistent, and a consensus has not been reached regarding the specific differences in the microbiota between clinically-defined IBS subgroups of patients and healthy controls[13, 19]. This can be partly ascribed to methodological biases, and limited depth of characterization of complex microbial communities in the intestine. To better understand the role of the intestinal microbiota in IBS we used high throughput 454 pyro-sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the composition and diversity of the complex intestinal microbial community in an unbiased manner[20-22]. Since IBS is a heterogeneous disorder, and it is likely that differences in intestinal functions between different IBS subgroups may further affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota, the current study specifically focused on diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS).",

Briefly, sequences that were less than 200 bp or greater than 1,000 bp in length, contained incorrect primer sequences, or contained more than 1 ambiguous base were discarded. The remaining sequences were assigned to D-IBS and HC groups based on their unique nucleotide barcodes, including error-correction[24]. Chimeric sequences were removed using ChimeraSlayer[27]. Sequences were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on their sequence similarity at 97% sequence similarity (similar to species level) using UCLUST[28]. A representative sequence for each OTU was chosen for downstream analysis based on the most abundant sequence from each OTU. PyNAST was used to align sequences with a minimum length of 150 bp and a minimum percent identity of 75.0[29]. OTUs were assigned to a taxonomy using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Naive Bayes classifier[30]. The RDP classifies a 16S rRNA sequence based on Bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology[31] (a main resource for determining bacterial species). A bacterial group is designated as unclassified if the 16S rRNA gene sequence from an organism does not show significant homology to any known classified bacterium in the RDP. \u03b1-diversity (diversity within samples) was assessed and rarefaction curves were generated for each experimental group. \u03b2-diversity (diversity between groups of samples) was used to generate principal coordinate plots for each sample using un-weighted and weighted UniFrac distances[32-34]. \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity measurements were combined with each group (D-IBS and HC) to produce visualizations (\u03b1-diversity - rarefaction plots; \u03b2-diversity - Principal Co-ordinate Analysis [PCoA] plots, and OTU network plots) that allow composition of the intestinal microbiota between groups to be readily interpreted. \u03b1-rarefaction was used to measure the distribution of bacterial taxa richness in sample groups. PCoA plots were used to visualize the similarities or dissimilarities of variables that best represent the pair-wise distances between sample groups. An OTU network-based analysis was used to visualize OTU sharing between sample groups where a bipartite network was generated in which D-IBS and HC samples were designated as one node type, and bacterial OTUs were designated as a second node type. A given sample was connected to a given bacterial OTU node through a line (edge) if that OTU was detected in the subject.",

Each PCR was carried out in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl and contained the following: 1 \u00d7 SYBR green master mix, 0.5 \u03bcM of each primer and 10 ng of purified fecal DNA. PCR conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 20 s at 50\u00b0C, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. Each plate included duplicate reactions per DNA sample, the appropriate set of standards and a \u2018no template\u2019 negative control for each primer set. qPCR standards were generated by PCR amplification of target sequences from genomic DNA of an appropriate positive control strain. Analysis of melting curves confirmed that the fluorescence signal originated from specific PCR products and not from primer-dimers or other artifacts.",

When a data set was identified as not having a normal distribution it was transformed by square root and retested for normality. Data sets normally distributed were compared using a Student's t-test. All statistical comparisons were carried out using GraphPad software (v4.0a; Prism, San Diego, CA). We used taxon and phylogenetic-based analyses to compare the 16S rRNA gene sequences between D-IBS patients and healthy controls. Taxon-based: The means and standard deviations of abundances of bacterial groups (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, and genus) were calculated and compared between D-IBS patients and healthy controls. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Phylogenetic-based: Phylogenetic trees for D-IBS patients and healthy controls were generated using the QIIME pipeline[26]. Each tree was subjected to weighted and un-weighted UniFrac analysis[32-34] through the QIIME pipeline. UniFrac distances represent the fraction of branch length that is shared by any two samples' communities in a phylogenetic tree built from 16S rRNA sequence data from all samples. A \u2018weighted\u2019 UniFrac analysis indicates microbiota community differences between sample groups due to differences in relative taxon abundance, whereas an \u2018un-weighted\u2019 UniFrac analysis indicates microbiota community differences between sample groups based on the presence or absence of taxa[32-34]. UniFrac distances (weighted and un-weighted) were compiled into matrices and average UniFac distances were calculated for each group and compared using a student's t test. For qPCR the percentage of F. prausnitzii was determined in all fecal samples ([copies 16S rRNA gene for F. prausnitzii/copies of 16S rRNA gene for all bacteria] \u00d7100). qPCR data was transformed to normality by square root and means were compared using a Student's t-test.",

Microbial richness was slightly lower in D-IBS patients when compared to HC based on the V6 16S rRNA variable region; however this reduction did not reach statistical significance (Supplemental Figure 3). Although a relatively large number of 16S rRNA gene sequence reads were generated from each sample, these rarefaction curves indicate that species discovery is still increasing at this sequence depth.

The 16S rRNA gene contains nine variable regions, all of which have been used to characterize complex microbial communities[35]. The depth of our analyses is strengthened by the investigation of four variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (V1-3 and V6). We chose to investigate the V1-3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene as it has been reported that combining variable regions to make longer sequences (specifically V1-3) provides a more accurate resolution of the intestinal microbiota[36]. We also chose to use the shorter V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene as it has been used previously to investigate the intestinal microbiota[37], and also to provide comparative and complementary data for the longer V1-3 region. Using this approach we investigated over 680,000 16S rRNA gene sequences with an average of over 8,000 and 6,500 sequences per sample for the V1-3 and V6 regions, respectively. The results of our study indicate an intestinal microbial dysbiosis in D-IBS patients, with alterations in specific bacterial groups (ranging from genus to Phylum level), and microbial community diversity. Taxonomic analysis revealed a significant increase in unclassified Enterobacteriaceae in D-IBS patients. Unclassifed Enterobacteriaceae refers to bacterial genera encompassed by the Enterobacteriaceae Family, yet little is known about this group or their function. The Enterobacteriaceae Family contains thirty seven genera which include several pathogenic bacteria such as; Escherichia, Shigella, Salmonella, and Yersinia. The significant increase of unclassified Enterobacteriaceae in our D-IBS samples raised the possibility of recent infection or a post-infections etiology (PI-IBS). However, none of our patients reported the onset of IBS symptoms after intestinal infection (in response to specific question at screening), and all our study subjects were screened for intestinal infections by routine stool culture for intestinal pathogens. In regard to this, it should be noted that the Enterobacteriaceae Family does not solely encompass pathogenic bacteria.",

                    "text": "At the genus level, our study also found a significant reduction in the concentrations of the Fecalibacterium genus in D-IBS patients when compared to healthy controls. Currently, it is thought that the Faeclibacterium genus consists of one bacterial species; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a major constituent of the Clostridium leptum group[38-40]. Interestingly, reduced numbers of this organism has been shown in ileal Crohn's disease[41, 42], suggesting protective and anti-inflammatory properties of this organism. Our finding of reduced numbers of F. prausnitzii in patients with D-IBS further supports the possibility of an inflammatory component in this condition. Given the finding of increased unclassified Enterobacteriaceae and a reduction in the Faeclibacterium genus, it can be speculated that the intestinal microbial dysbiosis in D-IBS is associated with an imbalance in the ratio of detrimental and beneficial bacterial groups, a phenomenon also reported in inflammatory bowel disease[20]. Our study used a deep and comprehensive sequencing approach to characterize the intestinal microbiota, and as such we have identified additional bacterial groups not yet reported as being altered in D-IBS compared to healthy controls. At the genus level we found a significant increase in the concentration of Ethanoligenens in D-IBS patients. Additionally, Enterococcus, Fusobacterium, Pediococcus, unclassified Lactobacillaceae and Veilonella species were found in D-IBS patients but were below detection limits in healthy controls. The biological relevance for these organisms and their association with D-IBS remains to be determined.",

Changes in \u03b1-diversity (diversity within a sample) and \u03b2-diversity (diversity between collections of samples) are important independent measures for complex microbial communities. Diversity measures provide additional important information on the overall structure of intestinal microbial communities. Our study found a significant reduction in \u03b1-diversity measurements (rarefaction analysis) in the fecal microbiota of D-IBS patients suggesting that the fecal microbiota of D-IBS patients has lower microbial richness. In addition, we found a significant reduction in \u03b2-diversity measurements (UniFrac distance analysis) in the fecal microbiota of healthy controls indicating that the fecal microbiotas in healthy controls are more similar to each other than to the fecal microbiotas of D-IBS patients. Intestinal microbial richness is a result of co-evolution between host and microbe [44], and has been shown to be stable over time in healthy individuals [45] and reduced in disease conditions such as ileal Crohn's disease[20]. Thus, a departure from the normal microbial richness of the intestinal microbiota may reflect a disease, possibly inflammatory, state in D-IBS. Given the significant differences in bacterial taxa and \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity measurements between the microbiotas in D-IBS patients and healthy controls, it can be speculated that a microbial intestinal dysbiosis exists in D-IBS patients that is a result of the increase or decrease in specific bacterial groups and changes in the global structure of the intestinal microbiota[34].",

However, many of these studies have used molecular techniques that provide a limited resolution of complex intestinal microbial communities. Two recently published studies have used advanced molecular techniques based on the 16S rRNA gene that provide deep characterization of the intestinal microbiota in IBS patients and healthy controls. In the first study Saulnier et al.[57] used high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the microbiota in a mixed group of 22 children with IBS and 22 healthy controls. Differences in specific bacterial taxa were reported between the groups suggesting an intestinal microbial dysbiosis in pediatric patients with IBS. \u03b3-proteobacteria were found to be increased in the microbiota of IBS patients, and a novel Ruminococcus-like microbe was also enriched pediatric patients with this disorder. The study population from this report significantly differed to our population as we investigated adult patients with a defined sub-group of D-IBS. In the second study Rajili\u0107-Stojanovi\u0107 et al.[58] used a 16S rRNA gene microarray (the Human Intestinal Tract Chip \u2013 HITChip) to compare the intestinal microbiotas between a mixed group of adult IBS patients (n=62) and healthy controls (n=46). Interestingly, consistent with our finding, this group also reported a significant decrease in the Faeclibacterium genus in their IBS patients. Similarly to the Saulnier et al.[57] study, our current study differs from this report as it focuses on a specific subgroup of IBS patients. Our decision to focus on a single subgroup of patients with D-IBS was based on the assumption that differences in bowel habits (e.g., diarrhea and constipation) could potentially mask differences in the levels of bacterial taxa and diversity between specific subtype of IBS and healthy controls.",

In contrast, the V1-3 region found that the Fecalibacterium genus was significantly reduced in D-IBS patients; however a decrease in the Fecalibacterium genus was also found for sequences from the V6 region that did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, a significant decrease in average weighted and un-weighted UniFrac distances was found when analyzing the V6 16S rRNA region in healthy controls. A decrease in average weighted and un-weighted UniFrac distances was also found when analyzing the V1-3 16S rRNA region in healthy controls; however this did not reach statistical significance.

Although our study does not answer the question of causality or confirm an etiological role for the altered microbiota in this disorder, our study findings emphasizes the importance and provides the rationale for further investigation of the role of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Future studies will need to address the association between intestinal functions (such as motility) and the gut microbiota, and how these factors influence IBS symptoms. This investigation will advance our understanding of the disorder and lead to new therapeutic options for patients with functional bowel disorders.",
