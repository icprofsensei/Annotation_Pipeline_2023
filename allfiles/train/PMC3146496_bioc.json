Complete genetic sequencing of complex microbial ecosystems in humans have been accomplished [5], however, higher-throughput methods are needed for larger-scale epidemiologic investigations relating microbiome profiles to disease risk. The major approaches to cost-efficient high-throughput characterization of the human microbiome exploit the high variability in microbial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence, uniquely found in prokaryotes and considered as a barcode that can be used to identify specific microbes, characterizing the broad spectrum of both culturable and non-culturable organisms. The development of these methods has opened the possibility of conducting large population-based studies of human microbiome, providing insight into the diversity and community structure of the human microbiome in relation to health and disease. Our interest is in the 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing assay [6] and the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) hybridization assay [7], two well-validated methods for microbiome profiling by assessment of microbial 16S rRNA gene diversity in human samples, with pyrosequencing selected as a broad-based approach applicable generally to the microbiome and HOMIM focused specifically on the oral microbiome.",

As shown in Table 2 (and Table S2), >98% of classifiable bacteria in the subject samples were assigned in these 37 genera by both methods. Although 16S rRNA sequencing detected an additional 40 classifiable genera not identified by HOMIM microarray, most of these are found at very low densities (1.6% of identified bacteria), after exclusion of 17.5% unclassified taxa. Similarly, an additional 12 genera were detected only by HOMIM; their contribution to the overall percentage was also small (1.9%), yet this may represent false positives on the HOMIM due to cross hybridization on short prove reads. This could also be due to the misidentification or incorrect nomenclature from the RDP database.",

Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Leptotrichia, were positive by pyrosequencing and HOMIM in most study subjects (20 positive for Streptococcus and Veillonella; 19 positive for Leptotrichia) with 100% concordance (Table 3) and high correlations for relative abundance (r\u200a=\u200a0.71\u20130.80). Concordance of Prevotella, Haemophilus, Capnocytophaga, Granulicatella, Lactococcus, Camplylobacter, Gemella, Neisseria, Fusobacterium, Parvimonas, Kingella, and Mycoplasma were 85% or higher. For less common genera, including Atopobium, Slakia, and Filifactor, concordance and correlations were low or modest. As expected, relatively uncommon genera were more likely to be positive in pyrosequencing methods, but to be negative in HOMIM which was designed to identify the more common bacterial forms.",

Moderate correlations in rarer taxa could also be due to the different quantitative estimation methods: HOMIM was based on discrete numbers in an intensity scale and 16S rRNA sequencing was based on sequence reads on a continuous scale. Furthermore, laboratory assay error (i.e., cross-hybridization between probes in HOMIM and annealing bias, cloning bias and RDP misclassification [9] in 16S rRNA sequencing) could also have contributed to the discrepancies. Our findings of high correlation at the phylum level and for common genera, with relatively lower correlations for the overall genera level, are consistent with two smaller studies reporting quantitative comparisons of gut microbiome profiles using similar methods [10], [11].",

For microbiome discovery, the pyrosequencing approach has the distinct advantage of broader-spectrum identifications, although the costs and labor involved are currently somewhat greater. The approaches may, however, be similar in utility for epidemiologic investigations relating the oral microbiome to disease status. The great majority of genera are identified by both methods and epidemiologic investigations, unless very large, may not be powered to adequately investigate risk differentials related to the rarer taxa uniquely identified by pyrosequencing. For the same reasons, the capacity to find sequence reads for a large variety of rarer unclassified taxa may be of little importance at least in the earlier stages of epidemiologic investigations. Currently, these approaches provide a similar level of information for identifying etiologic associations in epidemiologic studies. Pyrosequencing does, however, provide a broader spectrum of taxa identification, has a distinct sequence-read record, may have greater detection sensitivity and, as costs and analytic complexity decrease, will likely prove in the near-term to be the method of choice for high-throughput epidemiologic investigations of the oral microbiome, at least until capacity develops for cost-effective metagenomic analysis of entire genomic ecosystems.",

Subject sample 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified from DNA extracts using 16S rRNA universal forward and reverse primers and labeled via incorporation of Cy3-dCTP in a second nested PCR. The labeled 16S amplicons were hybridized overnight to probes on the slides. After washing, the microarray slides were scanned using an Axon 4000B scanner and crude data was extracted using GenePix Pro software. After microarray scanning the slides, the median background intensity for each individual feature was subtracted from the median feature intensity, yielding a normalized \u201cmedian intensity score.\u201d The generated files were exported to the HOMIM tool website (http://bioinformatics.forsyth.org/homim/) to determine the presence or absence of a particular microorganism, based on specific criteria set for that individual spot, thus generating microbial profile maps for each sample.",

Specifically, for each phylogenetic group in each sample, all of the downstream probes were sorted according to their microarray-based relative abundance estimates to calculate the sum relative abundance for all nonoverlapping probes. As a result, the specific probes added together to represent a given taxonomic group, depending on which specific probes had the greatest hybridization signal in that sample.
