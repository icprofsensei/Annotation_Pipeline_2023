Most HPV studies focus on chronic infections and cancers, and we know little about the early stages of the infection. Our main objective is to better understand the course and natural history of cervical HPV infections in healthy, unvaccinated and vaccinated, young women, by characterising the dynamics of various infection-related populations (virus, epithelial cells, vaginal microbiota and immune effectors). Another objective is to analyse HPV diversity within hosts, and in the study population, in relation to co-factors (lifestyle characteristics, vaccination status, vaginal microbiota, human genetics).",

Additional analyses are outsourced, such as titration of circulating anti-HPV antibodies, vaginal microbiota sequencing (16S and ITS1 loci) and human genotyping. To increase the statistical power of the epidemiological arm of the study, an additional 150 women are screened cross-sectionally. Finally, to maximise the resolution of the time series, participants are asked to perform weekly self-samples at home. Statistical analyses will involve classical tools in epidemiology, genomics and virus kinetics, and will be performed or coordinated by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Montpellier.",
