To understand such interactions in detail, we investigated how the salivary microbiome in the oral cavity would be regulated by host-related signals. Here, we show that the microbial abundance and gene participating in keeping the human salivary microbiome exhibit global circadian rhythm. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences of salivary microbial samples of six healthy adults collected at 4-h intervals for three days revealed that the microbial genera accounting for 68.4\u201389.6% of the total abundance were observed to significantly oscillate with the periodicity of \u223c24\u2009h. These oscillation patterns showed high variations amongst individuals, and the extent of circadian variations in individuals was generally lower than that of interindividual variations. Of the microbial categories oscillated, those classified by aerobic/anaerobic growth and Gram staining, Firmicutes including Streptococcus and Gemella, and Bacteroidetes including Prevotella showed high association with the circadian oscillation. The circadian oscillation was completely abolished by incubating the saliva in vitro, suggesting that host\u2019s physiological changes mostly contributed to the microbial oscillation. Further metagenomic analysis showed that circadian oscillation enriched the functions of environmental responses such as various transporters and two-component regulatory systems in the evening, and those of metabolisms such as the biosynthesis of vitamins and fatty acids in the morning.",

Some of the papers also showed more shared species and lower taxonomic changes among the individual salivary than gut microbiomes.13,24 Unlike the gut microbiome, these observations further suggested that host-related internal signals had more impact on the salivary microbiome than external signals related to individual lifestyles. However, more recently, the individual salivary microbiomes collected with 4-h intervals in a day was reported to show little or no change in the microbial profiles.26",

We enumerated sequences of the 16S rRNA gene V1\u2013V2 region by pyrosequencing the salivary DNA with the Roche 454 platform (see Materials and methods). The 16S reads were clustered to obtain the OTUs for each subject, and the generated OTUs were assigned to taxa by blasting against the 16S databases (Supplementary Table S3). The phylum- and genus-level assignment apparently showed the diurnal change in the microbial abundance for all the subjects (Supplementary Fig. S2). We next performed the UniFrac distance analysis of the microbial communities, in which the distances between the samples at the same times (ST) and those at different times (DT) for 3 days were measured, respectively. The results revealed that the UniFrac distances between the ST samples were lower than those between the DT samples for all the subjects, of which the five subjects showed a statistical significance, indicating that the overall structure of the ST samples was more similar than that of the DT samples (Fig. 1a).",

Furthermore, we found a correlation between the relative abundance of the genera and the P value of the circadian periodicity in toto, which indicated that the higher abundant genera tended to have the stronger circadian periodicity, and vice versa (Fig. 1c). For the major four phyla, the PDM analysis also indicated the high circadian periodicity of them in most of the subjects as well as the autocorrelation analysis mentioned above (Supplementary Table S5). We also evaluated the circadian periodicity of the genera and phyla by JTK_CYCLE32 (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). In the genus level, JTK_CYCLE and PDM both showed the significant periodicity in Prevotella for the five subjects, Neisseria for the four subjects, Gemella and Streptococcus for the three subjects.

                    "text": "We characterized the oscillation pattern of salivary microbes at the phylum and genus level. We found that the relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased in the evening, whilst that of Bacteroidetes was in the daytime in all the subjects, indicating that these two major phyla had an inverse relation in the circadian oscillation pattern (Fig. 2a). At the genus level, we showed proliferation time zones of the circadian oscillation of the 12 genera with\u2009\u2265\u20091% relative abundance in all the subjects, respectively (Fig. 2b). Among the 12 genera, Prevotella, Gemella, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus showed the significant circadian periodicity for all the subjects, but the other eight genera showed non-significant periodicity in a few subjects (Supplementary Table S4). The relative abundance of Prevotella was increased in the morning (from 4:00 to 12:00) in all the subjects, and those of Gemella and Streptococcus were increased in the evening (from 16:00 to 0:00) in all the subjects. The relative abundance of Haemophilus was proliferated in the morning (around 8:00) in all the subjects, but different proliferation time zones were also observed in three subjects. These genera are typical examples that had almost same circadian oscillation patterns shared among all the six subjects. The inverse oscillation pattern between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes described above could be largely due to the strong circadian periodicity of the top two pre-dominant Streptococcus and Prevotella genera belonging to these two phyla, respectively. Rothia had similar proliferation time zones in the relative abundance among four subjects but no significant circadian periodicity in two subjects. The other genera such as Granulicatella and Veillonella did not share similar proliferation time zones among the subjects with the significant circadian periodicity. These data revealed that a few but highly abundant genera had the strong circadian periodicity and similar circadian oscillation patterns shared with most of the subjects. Many of the genera had the significant circadian periodicity but their oscillation patterns were considerably varied among the subjects. Thus, these data suggested the high inter-subject variation in the circadian oscillation profile.",

The PDM analysis revealed that the relative abundance of AE, FA, and AN had significant circadian oscillations in all the six subjects, respectively (Supplementary Table S7). We analysed changes in the average relative abundance of the three microbial categories through the three days (Fig. 3a). The results showed differences in the circadian oscillation patterns among the three categories, in which AN was proliferated in the morning between 4:00 and 12:00, and FA was in the evening between 16:00 and 4:00, indicating the circadian oscillation pattern of AN and FA had an inverse relation. On the other hand, the proliferation time zone of AE was the daytime between 8:00 and 20:00, which was intermediate between those of AN and FA. In the 19 genera with\u2009\u22650.1% relative abundance in all the subjects, Neisseria, Rothia, and Campylobacter were included in the typical AE pattern, Prevotella and Solobacterium were in the typical AN pattern, and Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Gemella were in the typical FA pattern, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7). These data revealed that the three categories defined by the bacterial aerobicity were sequentially proliferated in the relative abundance with some overlap among them in a day. The periodicity of the three microbial categories was also evaluated by JTK_CYCLE, showing similar results to those by the PDM (Supplementary Table S7).",

In the 19 genera with\u2009\u22650.1% relative abundance, oscillation patterns of several Gram-negative Prevotella and Haemophilus were similar to that of the all Gram-negative species, and those of several Gram-positive Streptococcus, Rothia, Actinomyces and Gemella were similar to that of the all Gram-positive species (Supplementary Fig. S8). Furthermore, the oscillation pattern of Gram-positive bacteria shown in Fig. 3b appeared to be overlapped with those of AE and FA shown in Fig. 3a, whereas that of Gram-negative bacteria appeared to be overlapped with those of AE and AN.

We obtained the several pieces of evidence for the circadian oscillation from significant differences in the UniFrac distances between the samples collected at the same and DT in each subject, and apparent diurnal changes in the relative abundance of taxa at the phylum and genus level with the highest autocorrelation coefficient of \u223c24-h interval. Furthermore, the circadian periodicity of each taxon was also statistically evaluated by the PMD originally developed in this study. The basis of the PDM is to assess the reproducibility of proliferation time patterns of the relative abundance of each taxon by the Fisher exact test, so that the PDM is also applicable to the relatively minor taxa of which the 16S read number is zero in several samples. Therefore, the PDM generally enables us to detect more taxa with the periodic pattern than the JTK_CYCLE.32 The PDM analysis found that the major genera had the tendency of relatively high circadian periodicity compared with minor genera in the salivary microbiome, similar to the observation in the gut microbiome.33 However, on the contrary, the recent study reported almost no significant diurnal variation in the salivary microbiome by using the clustering analysis of two sample sets collected every 4\u2009h in 24\u2009h with a 1 week interval from five subjects.26 We similarly performed the hierarchical clustering of the same sample sets, but could not clearly show the closest relation between the samples collected at the ST by this clustering. Therefore, this inconsistency suggested that the hierarchical clustering was insufficient to differentiate subtle changes in variations within individuals.",

The salivary microbiome is thought to be formed by microbes adhered to various intraoral surfaces because the saliva is sterilely secreted from the salivary glands into the oral cavity.3 This implies that the microbes associated with intraoral surfaces may change their releasing level from the surfaces to the saliva and/or their growth rate in the saliva. The microbes in the throat, tonsil, and tongue may be the resources of the salivary microbiome because the salivary microbiome composition is similar to that of these microbiomes.4\u20136 In this context, the recent paper showed that the plaque microbiome exhibited little circadian oscillation,34 suggesting that the sensitivity to stimuli in the oral cavity differed between the plaque and salivary and possibly tongue and tonsil microbiomes.",

These oscillation patterns were clearer than those of the others. These data suggested large associations of these microbial categories to the circadian oscillation of the salivary microbiome.
