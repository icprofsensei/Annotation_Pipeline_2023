Moreover, it is now clear that some important factors that connect intestinal microbiota to CRC are microbial metabolites 10. As biochemical converters, gut microbes are capable of converting the complex chemical space presented by the dietary and host nutrients into a milieu of metabolites 11. These metabolites can exert either genotoxic or tumor-suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms, such as by providing supportive metabolic flux to promote anabolic metabolism, by acting as competitive enzyme inhibitors, or by modifying signaling proteins 12. Therefore, the disruption in the balance of metabolites by the microbiome may result in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the interplay between gut microbiota and metabolites and their roles in CRC development have not been effectively addressed, and the study of this interplay is limited by invasive and expensive sampling techniques that are often biased with unidimensional classical approaches. Thus, taking advantage of this critical gap in the literature, we envisaged this study to systematically and comprehensively interrogate the microbiome and metabolome of human CRC fecal samples, to identify microbial diversity and metabolite abundance and to decipher the association of CRC with gut microbiota and fecal metabolites.",

The written informed consents were obtained from the CRC patients and the H volunteers. Their general clinical data including age, gender, educational background, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and histories of smoking, hypertension, appendectomy, and FOBT were recorded. All patients and volunteers were Shanghai Han Chinese with similar geographic areas and eating habits. All patients were diagnosed by postoperative pathological examinations. The clinical pathological features of CRC, such as tumor stage, tumor location, tumor size, tumor differentiation, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), were recorded. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients older than 80 years or younger than 25 years; patients with a history of familial CRC, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); individuals who received preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy; patients with other coexisting malignant tumors; and patients with complications of complete intestinal obstruction. All the H volunteers had a normal bowel habit. The H volunteers had no history of IBS, IBD, CRC, other malignant tumors or other severe gastroenterological diseases. All patients and volunteers using antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics within two months of sampling were excluded. The flow chart displaying the enrollment and analysis process is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1. Three H volunteers with a positive FOBT were further detected by fiber electron colonoscopy and confirmed to have stage I internal hemorrhoids without neoplasia throughout the entire large intestine, thus, the 3 H volunteers were included in our study. Four volunteers with colon polyps were excluded in our further study after colonic endoscopy. All qualified stool samples were self-sampled prior to mechanical bowel preparation and were transported immediately to the laboratory, divided into two portions per sample, packed into two frozen pipes, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen overnight and preserved under -80\u00b0C for further testing.

HCl solution (20 mg/mL in pyridine) was added to each tube, followed by incubation and shaking at 1200 rpm for 120 min at 37\u00b0C. Then, 60 \u03bcL N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was added into the mixture and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 90 min for trimethylsilyl derivatization. Pooled samples were used as quality control (QC) samples over batches of 10 samples, and samples were blinded and randomized and were served as QC checks by injecting at scheduled intervals for monitoring shifts in retention indices (RI). Deionized water was used as the control sample to account for the background noise produced during sample processing and data analysis.",

At the phylum level, Firmicutes (p < 0.001) and Actinobacteria (p = 0.00812) were significantly more abundant in the H group than in the CRC group; however, Fusobacteria (p = 0.00176), Lentisphaerae (p = 0.0313), and Proteobacteria (p = 0.00163) were also significantly more abundant in the CRC group than in the H group (Supplementary Figure S3A). At the genus level, a total of 307 genera were found to be significantly different between the two groups. Of these discriminatory taxa, Escherichia-Shigella (p < 0.001), Parvimonas (p = 0.0123), Fusobacterium (p = 0.0196), CFT112H7_norank (p = 0.0195), and Porphyromonas (p = 0.0329) were found to be significantly more abundant in the CRC group than in the H group (Supplementary Figure S3B). Given that the left and right colon have different physiological functions, we further stratified the analysis by tumor location in the CRC group but did not find any significant differences (all FDR > 0.05) between the proximal and distal colon subgroups. When we further stratified the analysis at the genus level by lymph node metastasis in the CRC group, only Peptostreptococcus (p = 0.0391) was found to be abundant in CRC patients with positive lymph node metastasis.",

We identified 76 discriminatory OTUs as key discriminants. Several opportunistic pathogens including Gammaproteobacteria (Proteobacteria), Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacteriales), and Fusobacteriales (Fusobacteria) were all significantly overrepresented (all LDA scores (log10) > 4) in the feces of patients in the CRC group, whereas Firmicutes, Clostridiales, Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Selenomonadales, Negativicutes, and Faecalibacterium were the most abundant microbiota in the H group (LDA scores (log10) > 3.6). The relative abundances of these 76 OTUs were further analyzed by clustering analysis represented by a heat map (Figure \u200bFigure33). The H group was enriched with 58 OTUs, while the CRC group was enriched with 18 OTUs (Supplementary Table S3). These data suggest that the abundance of microbes was much less in the CRC group than in the H group, and these differentially abundant microbiota were sufficient to differentiate the microbiota of H volunteers and CRC patients.",

Therefore, we subsequently performed metabolome analysis of fecal samples using a nontargeted GC-MS-based metabolomics approach. We successfully quantified 226 metabolites in both the H and CRC groups, of which 164 were shared (Supplementary Table S4). These metabolites were mapped onto ~40 different KEGG metabolic pathways including protein biosynthesis (14 metabolites), ammonia recycling (5), and galactose metabolism (6) (Supplementary Figure S4A).",

Consistent with these findings, a metabolite-metabolite Pearson correlation analysis also showed a significant correlation between the abovementioned metabolites and the CRC phenotype (Supplementary Figure 4B, Supplementary Table S8). Specifically, higher abundances of sugars and sugar alcohols, such as fructose, iditol, sedoheptulose, maltose, glycerol, galactosamine, and fatty acids, such as 9, 12-octadecanoic acid, oleic acid, hexanedioic acid, and pentanedioic acid, were observed in the H group. Amino acids, such as Phe, Pro, Ala, Lys, 5-oxo-Pro, Val, Leu, and Orn, were also overrepresented in the CRC group. PCA clearly showed differences between the H and CRC groups based on the first two principal components, PC1 (6%) and PC2 (4%), suggesting CRC group-specific metabolomic abundance and signatures (Figure \u200bFigure55B).

Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that the microbiome and its metabolome contribute to tumorigenesis in CRC 18. Therefore, using the gut microbiome and its metabolites as screening tools for early detection of carcinoma is a promising field 19. Omics approaches show great promise for the development of biomarkers as they generate large scale data sets containing thousands of variables in a high-throughput manner that may be predictive and thus offer a lucrative approach when presented with a biological system with extremely high complexity, i.e., CRC disease diagnosis from fecal matter 19. Compared with omics approaches using biofluids, such as serum and urine, the fecal metabolome reflects direct interactions among genetic, environmental, and dietary factors 20. Thus, metabolomics research efforts involving fecal samples may be more effective at identifying biomarkers. Given that > 80% of fecal metabolites overlap with mucosal metabolites, only < 50% of CRC-specific metabolites can be found in feces, which poses a challenge in correlating CRC with fecal metabolite abundance 21. Thus, the global nontargeted metabolomics analysis applied herein on fecal sample provides insights into the association between bacterial populations from a microbiome sequencing approach and may allow identification of CRC-derived metabolic biomarkers.",

Interestingly, polyamines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which showed a higher abundance in the CRC group than in the H group, have been previously implicated in cancer 25.

Further, we detected greater amounts of poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids and deoxycholic acid in the H group, which are known to be present in fecal samples from healthy adults 26, 27. For instance, acetate, an important short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) for keeping gut health and a precursor for endogenous cholesterol production, was also increased in the H group.

In our study based on a Han Chinese population, we observed strongly correlated Lachnospiraceae OTUs in the H cohort, which was in accordance with the findings of previous reports in which several chronic diseases (including liver cirrhosis and IBD) were independently associated with lower levels of Lachnospiraceae\n32. However, in CRC patients, a 3-fold increase in Proteobacteria, a 60-fold increase in Fusobacteria and a 0.5-fold decrease in Firmicutes were observed compared with the H group; this demonstrates a staggering shift in the complex yet consistent dynamics of the human fecal microbiome. Indeed, a previous study has shown that genera such as Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, and Blautia were reduced while Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas were increased in CRC tissues, which is a trend that is consistent with our findings.33.

For instance, as observed in the LEfSe analysis, Selenomonadales was one of the most abundant genera in the H group and was correlated very well with enriched selenoamino acid metabolism for metabolites that were detected only in the H group. Furthermore, Firmicutes (Lactobacillus) was enriched in the H group, which aligns well with the increased lactose in this group. The microbiome also helps in converting complex carbohydrates into reabsorbable substrates, such as simple sugars 35. The higher diversity and amounts of simple sugars in the H group are indicative of a metabolically healthy status of the gut microbiome. In patients with CRC, we clearly observed reduced microbial and metabolic diversity. We observed increases in amino acids in the CRC group, indicating their association with disease phenotype. In summary, the use of an integrative analysis has the potential to be applied to personalized and predictive medicine.",

Moreover, without a controlled diet and for the simplicity of the study design, we could only associate metabolites with disease phenotypes at one timepoint in both groups. Additionally, the simple aqueous-methanolic sample extraction technique used failed to capture most of the nonpolar fatty acids, i.e., SCFAs, unconjugated secondary bile acids and other specialized metabolites and volatiles that are typically released by the gut microbiome and the host's gut cellular landscape 36. This study has some limitations but opens new avenues to explore the gut microbiome-metabolome associations for biomarker discovery.",

Furthermore, fecal microbiome data displayed the signature microbiota representing the H and CRC patient groups, i.e., enrichment of Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria in CRC and Firmicutes in H groups as well as an uneven and lesser microbial diversity in CRC. Given that all the patients were from a single ethnicity, i.e., Han Chinese, identifying specific biomarkers for CRC prediction in a global population may not be straightforward. However, polyamines (cadaverine, putrescine) in CRC are potential biomarkers for discriminating CRC versus H status, pending further validation studies across georacial landscapes in larger cohorts performed over a longer time. This integrated analysis of the putative microbial metabolism based on the identified microbes and fecal metabolites provides more functional insights than either of the single datasets. Nonetheless, individual metabolites, i.e., polyamines, and OTU differences among individuals are helpful in differentiating between CRC and H status.",
