The V1-V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes was amplified by PCR using saliva lysates and broad-range primers. The bar-coded PCR products were pooled and sequenced unidirectionally to cover the V3 hypervariable region. Of 50,708 obtained sequences, 31,860 passed the quality control. Non-bacterial sequences (2.2%) were removed leaving 31,170 reads. Samples were dominated by seven major phyla: members of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and candidate division TM7 were identified in all samples; Fusobacteria and Spirochaetes were identified in all individuals, but not at all time-points. The dataset was represented by 3,011 distinct sequences (100%-ID phylotypes) of ~215 nucleotides and 583 phylotypes defined at \u226597% identity (97%-ID phylotypes). We compared saliva samples from different individuals in terms of the phylogeny of their microbial communities. Based on the presence and absence of phylotypes defined at 100% or 97% identity thresholds, samples from each subject formed separate clusters. Among individual taxa, phylum Bacteroidetes and order Clostridiales (Firmicutes) were the best indicators of intraindividual similarity of the salivary flora over time. Fifteen out of 81 genera constituted 73 to 94% of the total sequences present in different samples. Of these, 8 were shared by all time points of all individuals, while 15-25 genera were present in all three time-points of different individuals. Representatives of the class Sphingobacteria, order Sphingobacteriales and family Clostridiaceae were found only in one subject.",

Inclusion of all available samples from more distant time points (up to 29 days) confirmed this observation. Samples taken at closer time intervals were not necessarily more similar than samples obtained across longer sampling times. These results point to the persistence of subject-specific taxa whose frequency fluctuates between the time points. Genus Gemella, identified in all time-points of all individuals, was not defined as a core-microbiome genus in previous studies of salivary bacterial communities. Human oral microbiome studies are still in their infancy and larger-scale projects are required to better define individual and universal oral microbiome core.",

Metagenomics offers an attractive alternative, bypassing the need to culture bacteria. The sequencing of the entire microbiome, used to characterize communities dominated by a small number of species [8] cannot be readily applied for the analysis of highly-complex human microbiota. Therefore, high-throughput sequencing of amplified partial 16S rDNA sequences of a bacterial community currently provides the best compromise between sequence coverage, analytical speed and experimental costs.",

Therefore, not all of the identified taxa are expected to be present in the same subject and at the same time [7]. In the current study, we assessed the inter- and intra-individual variations of salivary microbiota, by means of a culture-independent approach based on the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rDNA V3 region. We compared salivary bacterial communities of five individuals at three time-points using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing in order to assess their short-term stability and interindividual differences.",

For comparison, 16S rDNA amplicons were analyzed using the RDP classifier with a 80% confidence level [13]. In the RDP-based taxonomic analysis, 64% of sequences assigned to Protobacteria were placed at the genus level.

This 216-nt long sequence, which matches the relevant 16S rDNA segment of several species of genus Streptococcus exactly, occurred 3291 times and was found in all samples. Then we identified sequences that: (i) differed from the most frequent sequence by deleting, inserting or changing any single nucleotide and (ii) lacked exact matches in the reference database. As expected, nucleotide substitutions were the rarest error type with 8 examples (6 distinct sequences). Deletions were more frequent with 26 counts (19 distinct sequences), followed by insertions represented by 58 sequences (35 distinct sequences), which is similar to the trend observed by Huse et al. [14]. The longest homopolymer stretch associated with a putative insertion or deletion was a 4T which became 5T (3 occurrences). All potential error products represented together 2.8% of the most abundant sequence. However, this may be an overestimation since the single-read accuracy of pyrosequencing with the GS FLX System is 99.5% and the majority of errors are undercalling or overcalling the length of homopolymeric stretches [15].",

For individual samples, 3 to 15% of sequences could not be assigned to any of the genera. These sequences, representing 9.5% of the full dataset, were placed into a total of 35 taxa above the genus level. Although specific genera varied significantly in frequencies among the same and across different individuals, many had a consistent presence across most samples (Figure \u200b(Figure3).3). Fifteen out of 81 genera constituted 73 to 94% of the total sequences present in different samples. Eight genera (Streptococcus, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Granulicatella, Actinomyces, Gemella, Campylobacter, Selenomonas) were found in the three time points of all subjects. Of these eight genera, all except Gemella were found previously in microbiomes of all of the three investigated subjects assessed by a pyrosequencing approach [11]. Between 15 and 25 genera were present in all three time-points of different individuals. Fifty-six genera were relatively rare, occurring at a frequency lower than 1.25% across all samples.",

The number of 97%-ID phylotypes appears to be dependent on the total number of sequences in a given sample. This trend has been lost on the genus-level and higher-taxonomic levels. As shown in Figure \u200bFigure4C,4C, the genus-richness was higher in subject #1 than in subject #2, although the samples from the latter showed better coverage. Of course, the number of phylotypes may be overestimated due to PCR errors, undetected PCR chimeras and sequencing errors [20]. On the other hand, inefficient lysis of some bacteria and the presence of sequences deviating from the broad-range 16S rDNA primers targets will lead to underestimation of bacterial diversity. Chao1 richness estimations (Additional File 2) were the lowest for samples with lowest coverage. This underestimation of less sampled communities has been observed in other studies [21].",

For this purpose, phylotypes including 16S rDNA hypervariable positions were defined at 100% identity, i.e. a threshold which is higher than the widely assumed species-level of 97-99% [23]. We used this stringent cutoff in order to calculate distances between samples with the highest possible resolution. Based on the presence and absence of 100%-ID phylotypes (unweighted UniFrac), samples from each subject formed distinct clusters (Figure \u200b(Figure5A).5A). Hierarchical clustering of UniFrac distances based on phylotypes defined at an identity threshold of 97% resulted in grouping of samples for 5 subjects when the alignment of OTUs003 was performed with MUSCLE and included hypervariable positions (Figure \u200b(Figure5A).5A). However, when hypervariable 16S rDNA positions were removed from the analysis of OTUs003, resulting in OTUs003-hv with 187 comparable positions, samples of only 3 subjects were grouped. This removal of hypervariable regions is conducted automatically as part of the alignment procedure of the RDP alignment algorithm [24], which allows for tidy comparison of sequences with the same number of positions, but also may eliminate valuable information. Distances between samples were also subject to principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on the presence/absence of 100%-ID phylotypes (unweighted UniFrac; Figure \u200bFigure5B)5B) or including their abundance (weighted UniFrac; Figure \u200bFigure5C).5C). The results of the PCoA show that samples from the same subject formed clusters with generally little overlap and that samples from different subjects were better separated using unweighted UniFrac.",

To explore this concept, we calculated the frequency of all taxa and searched for those that were detected in all time points of all individuals and those that were shared between all time points of some (1-4) individuals but absent in all time-points of other individuals (subject-specific taxa). The proportion of taxa belonging to the universal core decreased when moving from the higher taxonomic level (phylum) down to 100%-ID phylotypes, whereas the frequency of subject-specific taxa were more stable across the different taxonomic levels (Table \u200b(Table1).1). The universal core was represented by 0.3% of distinct sequences and 1.9% of OTUs003, which corresponds to 23.3% and 37.6% of the full dataset, respectively. The number of subject-specific phylotypes, calculated at 100% identity, was 4-fold higher than at the 97% identity. Therefore, the interindividual diversity includes the presence of subject-specific phylotypes which are not detected using a 97%-ID phylotype identity cutoff. For instance, 11 100%-ID phylotypes belonging to genus Veillonella were shared in all time points of 1 to 3 subjects, whereas no 97%-ID phylotypes of this genus were found to be subject-specific. However, we cannot exclude that some low-abundance subject-specific 100%-ID phylotypes identified were due to sequence errors. In view of the possibility that different subject may be preferentially colonized by different strains of the same species, studies looking to understand the variation in human oral microbiotas may benefit from an identity cutoff greater than 97% in the formation of OTUs. Studies of microbial diversity in the ocean have also used phylotypes that are defined more stringently, with 100% identity, and found that rare organisms are more useful for clustering members from similar communities than more abundant phyla, although they found that this was true both for the 100%-ID phylotypes and a less stringent ~94%-phylotype [26].",

Including samples from more distant time points (15-29 days) performed for three subjects confirmed subject-specific grouping. Moreover, our results show that within the same subject, samples taken at closer time intervals were not necessarily more similar than samples obtained across longer sampling times. These results point to the persistence of subject-specific taxa whose frequency fluctuates between the time points. Because of its relative stability, salivary microbiota may be potentially applied as an alternative or complementary approach in forensics for person identification, as it has been recently proposed for skin bacterial communities [27].",

The fact that the same genera are not uniformly considered as universal core members across different studies shows that the metagenomic studies of oral microbiota require larger-scale high-throughput approaches to better define their individual and universal core.",

Applying the latter procedure (partly in order to minimize the influence of sequencing errors) some of the sample diversity is masked. Therefore, the impact of the sequence alignment procedure and the identity threshold used for phylotype grouping on clustering of bacterial communities may depend not only on the frequency of sequencing errors but also on the bacterial community composition.",

Distances between 100%-ID and 97%-ID phylotypes were calculated using MUSCLE (-maxiters 2 and -diags) [32]. Alternatively, the 97%-ID phylotypes were aligned using Aligner of the RDP pyrosequencing pipeline [24] and the hypervariable regions were removed leaving 187 comparable positions. Then, a phylogenetic tree of these phylotypes (OTUs003-hv) was constructed using FastTree [34]. Bacterial diversity was assessed using RDP pyrosequencing tools: Aligner, Complete Linkage Clustering, Rarefaction, Shannon Index and Chao1 Estimator [24,35].
