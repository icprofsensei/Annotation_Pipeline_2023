The aim of this cross-sectional analysis was to investigate whether insulin resistant women with previous gestational diabetes (pGDM), a high risk group for T2D, differ in their stool microbiota from women after a normoglycemic pregnancy (controls). Bacterial communities were analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing using fecal samples from 42 pGDM and 35 control subjects 3\u201316 months after delivery. Clinical characterization included a 5-point OGTT, anthropometrics, clinical chemistry markers and a food frequency questionnaire. Women with a Prevotellaceae-dominated intestinal microbiome were overrepresented in the pGDM group (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Additionally, the relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes was significantly lower in women pGDM (median 48.5 vs. 56.8%; p\u2009=\u20090.013). Taxa richness (alpha diversity) was similar between the two groups and with correction for multiple testing we observed no significant differences on lower taxonomic levels. These results suggest that distinctive features of the intestinal microbiota are already present in young adults at risk for T2D and that further investigations of a potential pathophysiological role of gut bacteria in early T2D development are warranted.",

Finucane et al. concluded in a recent review that there are no simple taxonomic compositions, consistent over different studies, which differentiate between obese and lean individuals12. Reduced relative abundance of Firmicutes and of the class Clostridia was found in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D)13,14,15. On a functional level, several groups reported a reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in diabetic individuals14,15,16. A causal role of the gut microbiota in the development of T2D and also metabolic syndrome is supported by transplantation studies, both in animal models and in humans17,18.",

To examine the bacterial community structure in the stool samples, we analyzed the dataset by a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) on the basis of Bray-Curtis distances and a permutational MANOVA (pMANOVA)23. We found no significant clustering of the predefined post-GDM and control group (p\u2009=\u20090.1). However, the samples from 13 women (cluster P) showed a bacterial composition distinct from the rest of the study cohort (cluster B) (Fig. 1, p\u2009=\u20090.001 in pMANOVA). The relative abundance of 35 OTUs was significantly different between these two groups after correction for multiple testing (Table S2). In particular, members of the family Prevotellaceae were more abundant in samples within cluster P (24.9 [17.8\u201330.2] vs. 0.08 [0.02\u20131.01] %, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), whereas the sequence proportion of the family Bacteroidaceae was decreased (6.2 [4.4\u20137.7] vs. 21.9 [15.9\u201330.8] %, p\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig. 2). OTU2, which could be assigned down to the species level as Prevotella copri, was highly enriched in the subpopulation of cluster P (23.3 [13.1\u201328.5] vs. 0.01 [0.00\u20130.02] %, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Cluster P was significantly associated with belonging to the post-GDM group (11 out of 13 individuals in cluster P; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). EPIC-FFQ data revealed no differences in consumption of macronutrients and of different food groups (meat, fat, vegetables, fruits and cereals) between the women in cluster P and those in cluster B. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and permutation tests showed no significant influence of age (p\u2009=\u20090.664), bmi (p\u2009=\u20090.806), time since delivery (p\u2009=\u20090.309) and plasma leptin levels (p\u2009=\u20090.294) on the beta diversity data.",

Family history or a prediabetic glucose tolerance status have been used for this purpose but these approaches have significant limitations (discussed in20). We therefore used an alternative method to define a young adult at risk cohort and studied women with recent GDM, who remained insulin resistant after delivery. Women with GDM have an about 10-fold increased risk for T2D within 10 years compared to women normoglycemic during pregnancy21. Among those post GDM, this risk is further increased if insulin resistance persists after giving birth19,20.",

This finding was not explained by differences in dietary habits and is in line with a model of two enterotypes proposed recently24,25. This model remains controversial26 and our study lacks the sample size to settle the issue. Nevertheless, a Prevotellaceae-rich microbiome was associated with belonging to the high risk group for T2D in our study. Our finding adds to previous reports of an inverse association between the Bacteroides/Prevotella ratio and obesity27, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis28 and elevated total plasma cholesterol25. Potential causative links remain speculative. Prevotella are mucin degrading bacteria, which may be associated with increased gut permeability29 and P. copri, the most dominant molecular species within the taxa Prevotella in our study, has recently been associated with new-onset rheumatoid arthritis30. It could therefore be related to low-grade inflammation, which is also detrimental with respect to metabolism.",

The V4 region of 16S rRNA genes was amplified (25 cycles) as described previously35 following a 2-step procedure to limit artifacts36. Amplicons were purified using the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter GmbH, Krefeld, Germany) and sequenced in paired-end modus (PE200) using the MiSeq system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA). The raw read files were demultiplexed (allowing a maximum of 2 errors in barcodes) and each sample was processed using usearch37 following the UPARSE approach38. First, all reads were trimmed to the position of the first base with quality score <3 and then paired. The resulted sequences were size filtered, excluding those with assembled size <200 and >260. Paired reads with a number of expected error >3 were further filtered out and the remaining sequences were trimmed by 10 nucleotides on each side to avoid GC bias and non-random base composition. For each sample, sequences were de-replicated and checked for chimeras with UCHIME39. Sequences from all samples were merged, sorted by abundance and OTUs representatives were picked at a threshold of 97% similarity. Finally, all sequences were mapped back to the representative sequences resulting in the OTU table for all samples. The RDP classifier40 was used to assign taxonomic classification to the OTUs representative sequences (80% confidence). OTUs of particular interest were identified more precisely using the EzTaxon server: http://www.ezbiocloud.net/eztaxon41. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using fasttree42. Only OTUs with a relative abundance above 0.5% total sequences in at least one sample were kept. The OTU table was rarefied to the minimum count of sequences observed. After processing (quality- and chimera-check as well as OTU filtering) a total of 2,655,517 16S rRNA reads were used for analysis. We obtained a median of 33,807 sequences per sample with a range of 21,812\u201351,777 and used 20,000 sequences per sample for rarefaction.",

Differences in beta diversity were calculated by pMANOVA46 and illustrated by a PCoA of Bray Curtis distances23. The Chi-square test was used for comparing the two subtypes of microbiota composition identified by pMANOVA. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and permutation tests were done using the R package phyloseq. The relative abundances of the taxonomic ranks phylum, class, order, family and of the molecular species are shown as median, interquartile ranges and minimum (min) and maximum (max). The Mann-Whitney U test, the Fisher Exact test or the \u03c7-square test were used for comparisons between groups. The phylum Firmicutes was further analyzed together with the variable \u2018time since delivery\u2019 as independent variables by a binary logistic regression model for the dependent variable pGDM status.
