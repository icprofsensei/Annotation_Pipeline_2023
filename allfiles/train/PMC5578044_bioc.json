However, little is still known about the overall gene functions harbored by the resident microbial populations and which specific genes are associated with various stages of CF lung disease. In the present study, we aimed to identify the microbial gene repertoire of CF microbiota in twelve patients with severe and normal/mild lung disease by performing sputum shotgun metagenome sequencing. The abundance of metabolic pathways encoded by microbes inhabiting CF airways was reconstructed from the metagenome. We identified a set of metabolic pathways differently distributed in patients with different pulmonary function; namely, pathways related to bacterial chemotaxis and flagellar assembly, as well as genes encoding efflux-mediated antibiotic resistance mechanisms and virulence-related genes. The results indicated that the microbiome of CF patients with low pulmonary function is enriched in virulence-related genes and in genes encoding efflux-mediated antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Overall, the microbiome of severely affected adults with CF seems to encode different mechanisms for the facilitation of microbial colonization and persistence in the lung, consistent with the characteristics of multidrug-resistant microbial communities that are commonly observed in patients with severe lung disease.",

The respiratory microbial composition is particularly relevant for patients with CF. In fact, bacterial lung infections reduce life expectancy in patients with CF (the median predicted survival age is equal to 41.6, as reported in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry [1]), and represent the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients [2]. In the last decade, the emergence of high-throughput sequencing approaches, coupled with the development of new bioinformatics pipelines designed to cope with metagenomics data, has revolutionized the study of complex bacterial communities such as the airway microbiota of CF patients, thereby improving our understanding of this largely unknown \u201cmicrobial black-box\u201d. This understanding of how a bacterial community changes over time and over the course of CF disease progression has revealed a different bacterial community structure upon pulmonary exacerbations (such as a reduced bacterial diversity and an increasingly conserved community composition) coupled with a decline in pulmonary health, antibiotic treatment, and patient age [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. No overall changes in total bacterial density with exacerbation was observed [12], suggesting that shifts in the relative abundance of bacterial community members, rather than changes in total bacterial density, are more likely to be associated with alterations in clinical state [12].",

Although the description of taxonomic groups colonizing the airways of CF patients has helped in the understanding of how bacterial species change during disease progression, the overall gene content harbored by these communities remains largely unknown. Since metabolic and functional features of a microbial species are the dominant factors determining its ability to survive in a given environment (e.g., CF patients\u2019 lungs) [15], untargeted metagenomic approaches may provide deep insights into the microbial CF lung metagenome, permitting the identification of gene sets involved in functional pathways associated with a worsening clinical condition [16].

We aimed to investigate whether patients with different disease severities may indeed have a different representation of \u201ckeystone genes\u201d in their lung microbiota. To the best of our knowledge, only a few works have already inspected the CF microbiome through shotgun metagenomes, and most of them are case reports on a limited number of patients [17,18] or on specific metabolic functions [19]. Moving away from taxonomic inventories towards a better understanding of CF microbiome genes opens a new avenue for the identification of the microbial gene repertoire associated with CF lung disease.",

The normal/mild (FEV1\u2009 > 70% predicted) and severe (FEV1\u2009 <\u2009 40% predicted) groups also differed in the extent of repeated antibiotic exposure and in their mean age being equal to (mean \u00b1 standard error) 25.33 \u00b1 2.216 and 33.83 \u00b1 3.146 years in the normal/mild and the severe group, respectively (two-tailed t-test; p value = 0.0313). In addition, the severe group tended to receive more uniform antimicrobial agents by the inhalation of aerosolised antibiotics during maintenance therapy, such as aerolized colistimethate and azithromycin, with respect to the normal/mild group (Table 1). Traditional culture-based diagnostic microbiology revealed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, being the dominant bacterial species in patients with severe and mild respiratory function, respectively (Table S1).

As expected, efflux mediated systems were the most abundant categories, all reporting higher values for severe patients than for normal/mild ones (Figure 5 and Figure S8).

Principal components with an eigenvalue > 1 in total accounted for more than 85% of the total variance and were therefore chosen for training boosted regression trees (Table S4). In boosted tree models, measures of relative influence quantify the importance of a given predictor; the variables that have a weak effect on prediction therefore have, by extension, scarcely an influence on the variable that the model tries to predict [23]. Therefore, factors that have a minimal relative influence in predicting the abundance of a given taxon are poorly connected with the distribution of that taxon. Although the use of orthogonal composite variables (as reported in the method section) reduced type I errors, the contribution of each original variable cannot be inferred directly. To partially overcome this limitation, the most dominant variables contributing to each component (top-50% eigenvalues of K, E, A, and V) were reported in Table S4. ",

To date, in CF metagenomics, published studies have focused on the sputum derived from CF patients [17,32,33,34].

In the present work, the abundances of metabolic pathways encoded by microbes inhabiting CF airways of patients with high/low pulmonary function were reconstructed from the metagenome. The metabolic pathway distribution described in this work was in accordance with the one described in other studies [19,32], with pathways related to amino acid catabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and stress responses reporting high values in both normal/mild and severe patients. Several pathways were uniformly distributed among patients, regardless of their clinical condition, reflecting a large set of core functions typical of host-associated microbes. Indeed, according to the previous studies mentioned above [19,32], there was little variation in the metagenome pathway distribution, with sixteen pathways only reporting different abundance values between the two groups of patients inspected here. Interestingly, we identified a set of metabolic pathways correlated with the worsening of patients\u2019 clinical conditions; in particular, two pathways, the bacterial chemotaxis pathway (Ko:02030) and the flagellar assembly pathway (Ko:02040), were reported as clinically relevant according to previous works [35,36,37,38,39]. Indeed, one pathway was associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection (bacterial chemotaxis pathway), whereas the second (flagellar assembly pathway) was classified as a potent mediator of virulence in Gram-negative bacteria such as P. aeruginosa strains. Moreover, the motB gene (a component of the flagellar assembly pathway) is known to aid bacterial chemotaxis and flagellar assembly; also, its product (a membrane protein, flagellar motor protein) was recognized as a potential novel vaccine target in Vibrio cholerae [40]. We can hypothesize that the difference in the representation of the above-mentioned pathways (Ko:02030 and Ko:02040) could rely on both P. aeruginosa strain differences (between the two disease groups) as well as on the presence of other bacteria in the CF microbiome which carry the same gene sets. The presence of P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative strains that could be responsible for the appearance of these pathways were also revealed by cultivation methods analysis, as reported in Figure S9. However, the limited number of patients analyzed in our study does not allow for definitive, statistically-based conclusion on this issue.",

                    "text": "In addition to microbial genes involved in metabolic metabolism, genes involved in antibiotic resistance are also powerful indicators of the microbial community\u2019s adaptation to the CF lung [17]. Indeed, the top-50% KEGG pathways (reported in Table S4) were mainly involved in the metabolism of amino acids and nucleotides and may be linked to bacterial proliferation and adaptation in the lungs. An increased presence of genes involved in both nucleotide and amino acid metabolism may, in fact, indicate a huge presence of both types of molecules which, in turn, may come from neutrophil extracellular traps, bacterial biofilms and the action of human and bacterial proteases [32,41,42,43,44]. Moreover, a large number of genes classified with eggNOG belonged to the transporter families. Their further analysis by using the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) permitted us to identify a massive presence of families connected with antibiotic resistance mechanisms, especially in patients with severe lung disease. The presence of genes related to antibiotic resistance mechanisms was confirmed by the Hidden Markov model (HMM) (Resfams), which accurately predicts new resistance functions from sequence alone [22]. The efflux-mediated system, which represents the widespread drug resistance mechanism common to many microorganisms, was the most represented gene function. Interestingly, the presence of P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was not related to the differential abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors. Indeed, virulence and resistance genes have been found to be spread throughout the whole CF bacterial community and are poorly related to the presence of single taxa, suggesting that the emergence of these mechanisms should be attributed to a particular clinical condition (normal/mild or severe lung disease) of CF patients. In fact, significant differences in the percentage of total Antibiotic Resistance (AR) functions encoded in microbial genomes between normal/mild and severe groups were found. Overall, there was a significant AR mechanism enrichment in patients with severe lung disease due to several years of exposure to antimicrobial drugs. It is well known that several antimicrobial agents and complex regimens are used for prophylaxis, eradication, treatment of exacerbations, and chronic suppressive therapy [45,46], paving the way for the emergence and spreading of AR mechanisms throughout the lung microbial community. In particular, oral, intravenous, and inhaled antibiotic courses are often frequent and prolonged, especially with increasing age and declining pulmonary status [47] as those characterizing the patients with severe lung disease. As underlined by Zhao and colleagues [28], an antibiotic administered closer to the time of sampling would be expected to have a greater impact on the microbial community than that same antibiotic would have when administered at a longer interval from the sampling time. Even if, on the date of sampling and in the 30 days before sample collection, antibiotic administration through an IV route was not given to our patients, we can hypothesize that patients with severe lung disease, having an average higher age than those from the normal/mild group, experienced several years of exposure to antimicrobial drugs, leading to periodic selection for an AR microbiota and resulting in a higher frequency and diversity of AR genes in their lung microbiota. The depth and diversity of AR genes uncovered by metagenomic studies in CF patients with different disease statuses brings to light the need for new strategies to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens [48]. As reported by King and colleagues [49], the metagenomic profiles of human microbiota are becoming increasingly characterized, and growing data suggests that imbalances of the microbiota could lead to a disease status [50].",

The cohort consisted of clinically stable patients without any pulmonary exacerbation and who were not undergoing antibiotic therapy (i.v. or oral) in the previous four weeks before specimen collection [51,52]. Patients were treated according to the current standards of care [53] with at least four microbiological controls per year [54]. At each visit, clinical data collection and microbiological status (colonizing pathogens with available cultivation protocols) were performed according to the European CF Society standards of care [55]. Forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of predicted (%FEV1) is a key outcome of the monitoring of lung function in CF [56]. All enrolled patients had an absence of an acute pulmonary exacerbation. Patients were classified into two groups, \u201cnormal/mild\u201d (FEV1 > 70%) and \u201csevere\u201d (FEV1 < 40%), by estimating their average annual FEV1 value on the basis of multiple spirometric measurements over the two years before their enrollment. FEV1 values were measured according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards [57,58]. The lower limit of age for subjects with \u201cnormal/mild\u201d disease was 15 years old, while that of subjects with severe disease was 25 years old.

Bowtie2 [61] was used to screen out human-derived sequences from metagenomic data with the latest version of the human genome available in the NCBI database (GRCh38) as reference. Sequences displaying a concordant alignment (a mate pair that aligns with the expected relative mate orientation and with the expected range of distances between mates) against the human genomes were then removed from all subsequent analyses. Metabolic and regulatory patterns were estimated using HUMAnN [62] and considered only those pathways with a coverage value \u2265 80%, whereas the taxonomic microbial community composition was assessed using MetaPhlAn2 [63]. Reads were assembled into contigs using the SPAdes microbial assembler [64] with automatic k-mer length selection. To establish an airway microbiome gene catalog [65], we first removed contigs smaller than 500bp and then used MetaGeneMark [66] to predict open reading frames (ORFs). Translated protein sequences obtained from assembled contigs were classified using Hmmer [67] with the eggNOG [68] database trained on bacterial sequences (bactNOG). Each protein was classified according to its best hit with an e-value lower than 0.001 as suggested in [69]. Proteins classified as transporters were further inspected using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) against the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) [70] to obtain a more detailed classification. Similarly, the MvirDB [71] database was used to inspect the distribution of virulence factors among our samples. We classified each sequence based on its BLAST best hit with an e-value lower than 1 \u00d7 10\u221220 in order to minimize the number of alignments that could be found by chance. Proteins that did not match any reference sequence were excluded from the analysis. Finally, predicted proteins were screened for antibiotic resistance activity based on the workflow described in [22] and validated for the Resfams database. ",

The distribution of metabolic pathways was assessed using the principal component analysis (PCA) on normalized data using the \u201crda\u201d function of the vegan package version 2.3.2 [72]. The 20 metabolic pathways that varied greatly between normal/mild and severe groups were selected through the similarity of the percentages analysis (\u201csimper\u201d function) and used for PCA analysis (vegan 2.3.2). The Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used to test whether the metabolic and regulatory pathways of different patient groups originated from distinct distributions using the \u201cKruskal\u201d function of the agricolae package (version 1.2.3). The distribution of ortholog genes, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance mechanisms was normalized by the total number of open reading frames (ORFs) detected for each sample, and the differences between normal/mild and severe groups were assessed using the two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test for each category (\u201ct.test\u201d function). The correlation between two dissimilarity matrices, obtained from metagenomics data such as the metabolic pathway or gene distribution, was assessed by using the Mantel test (vegan 2.3.2) as reported in other studies [73,74]. Basically, each table was transformed into a dissimilarity matrix using the \u201cBray\u2013Curtis\u201d dissimilarity index. By doing so, all dissimilarity matrices were reduced to the same rank, making it possible to use the Mantel test to inspect the correlation between them. The influence of gene patterns, metabolic modules distribution, virulence factors, and antibiotic-resistance genes on the taxonomic microbial composition was evaluated using \u201cboosted regression tree\u201d models [23] with 5000 trees, 10-fold cross-validation, and three-way interactions (gbm package version 2.1.1). Testing multiple individual variables assumed to be correlated with each other may inflate type I errors due to the high number of comparisons made [75]. To reduce the number of comparisons, and therefore to minimize the number of false positive correlations [75], orthogonal composite variables were derived from principal component analysis (PCA) for each factor explored, retaining only those components with an eigenvalue > 1. The derived variables were used for training boosted regression trees, minimizing the number of comparisons and, thus, reducing potential type I errors. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed based on the average linkage method with \u201cPearson\u2019s distance\u201d metrics (\u201chclust\u201d function). All graphical representations of data were performed using the ggplot2 package version 2.0.0 [76]. To minimize the type I errors in multiple comparisons, p-values where adjusted using a false discovery rate (FDR).",

In particular, an imbalanced distribution of virulence factors along with AR genes and metabolic pathways has been found. Understanding the role of the CF airway microbiome and detecting microbiome genes associated with lower lung function are key challenges for the delivery of new potential biomarkers for the management of bacterial infection in CF patients and the improvement of health care treatment. Our study was limited to twelve subjects; therefore, a larger scale study is needed to more completely characterize the spectrum of microbiome changes associated with the decreasing of pulmonary function. Longitudinal metagenomic analysis, which we plan to evaluate in ongoing studies, may help in understanding imbalances down to the single gene level, possibly helping to find new therapeutic strategies for targeting personalized disease phenotypes.",
