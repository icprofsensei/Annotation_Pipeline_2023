Rapid weight gain (RWG;\u00a0>+0.67 change in weight-for-age Z-score) and feeding practices from 0\u20136 months (mo) of life are strong determinants of obesity. Both RWG and feeding practices may influence the gut microbiome (GM), which in turn can affect obesity risk by increasing susceptibility to weight gain during infancy. Our goal was to evaluate differences in GM community structure at 36 months of age in relation to feeding practices and RWG in infancy.",

RWG was categorized as\u00a0>0.67 positive change in weight-for-age Z-score over the first 6 months of life. Microbial DNA from feces collected at 36 mo were sequenced using primers for the 16S rRNA gene V4 region.
