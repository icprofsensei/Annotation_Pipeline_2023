Poultry farms in particular are known to emit large quantities of air pollutants such as PM and endotoxins [12\u201315]. Exposure levels in stables have been shown to cause airway inflammation, respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction in farmers [16, 17]. Despite ambient pollutant concentrations being considerably lower than levels in stables, there is growing evidence of respiratory health effects in susceptible individuals living near livestock farms as well [18]. Exposure to PM air pollution may predispose these individuals to respiratory infections through chronic airway inflammation and subsequent host\u2013immune responses [4, 7], which might be amplified by exposure to environmental endotoxin [19].",

Spread of overgrown pathogens originating from the URT to the lower respiratory tract could perturb the lung microbial ecosystem and lead to respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia [21]. Indeed, recent studies have shown that CAP in adults was associated with dysbiosis of the oropharyngeal microbiota, characterized by increased abundance of pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, and the absence of facultative anaerobic commensals [22]. We hypothesized that environmental exposure from poultry farms may contribute to a shift in the oropharyngeal microbiome, and thereby facilitate the development of lower respiratory infections.",

In this model it is assumed that each poultry farm independently generates a probability for individuals of experiencing GP-diagnosed pneumonia within this year. This probability is modelled through a function dependent on the distance between farm and home address (i.e. the spatial kernel). The parameterization of the spatial kernel utilizes three parameters and offers sufficient flexibility for identifying any distance dependency from the data, from short-range to long-range patterns and from very sharp to more gradual dependencies on distance. In addition, a constant background probability is assumed to allow for quantification of the part of CAP incidence that is not associated with proximity to poultry farms. The background probability and the three parameters of the kernel are all estimated from the data by maximum likelihood (ML).

The study visualized the association between the vicinity of poultry farms and the overall bacterial community composition by non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric and assessed its statistical significance by permutation analysis of variance [28]. Differentially abundant bacterial community members that might be related to changes in the overall microbiota composition were detected by Mann-Whitney U-tests, comparing patients living <1\u00a0km versus \u22651\u00a0km from poultry farms. The 1\u00a0km radius was chosen based on the original findings [8]. Sensitivity analyses were performed using a 1.15\u00a0km radius, based on the spatial kernel analysis results. The false discovery rate was controlled for by using the Benjamini-Hochberg technique [29]. Additionally, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to group patients based on similarity of microbial composition, which was visualized in a dendrogram [30]. The optimal number of clusters was based on clustering indices [22], and only clusters including >3 patients were considered for subsequent analyses. Fisher\u2019s exact tests were exploited to compare the proportion of patients living <1\u00a0km from a poultry farm over all patients in the cluster of interest versus that proportion in the other clusters.",

In total, 993 patients (702/70,142 adults and 221/22,406 children) were diagnosed with CAP in 2009. Two alternative models were used: a distance-independent model with one estimable parameter (namely a constant per-individual probability of GP-reported pneumonia), and a model with a distance-dependent risk component (three additional estimable parameters) added to a constant background risk. Estimation of the distance-dependent risk component (spatial kernel) yields the results displayed in Fig.\u00a02. The distance dependence of the fitted distance-dependent risk component (full line) is sharp, displaying a stepwise decline to zero at a distance of approximately 1.15\u00a0km. The excess CAP risk is approximately equal to 0.001 (per person year) per poultry farm within 1.15\u00a0km, which compares to a total background risk of 0.009 per person year (0.001/0.009\u2009=\u2009~11% increase in risk). Comparison with the distance-independent model shows that the distance-dependent component significantly contributes to the model fit (p\u2009=\u20090.0067, likelihood-ratio test, see Additional file 1). The sharp bound at 1.15\u00a0km of the distance-dependent risk model is largely maintained, even in the model including the 95% lower confidence bound value for the parameter determining the sharpness of the distance dependence (dashed line). For this lower confidence bound it was calculated (see Additional file 1) that 81% of the total CAP incidence attributed to proximity to individual poultry farms occurs within a 1.15\u00a0km distance from farms, and 95% within 1.35\u00a0km. To investigate potential age effects, kernel estimation was repeated for the partial datasets of 70,142 adults, and 22,406 children. No significant differences were observed between the parameter values estimated for these partial datasets, implying that both subpopulations show similar excess risks at close proximity from poultry farms (see Additional file 1).\n",

Furthermore, the results suggested an association between living close to a poultry farm and the abundance of S. pneumoniae in adult patients hospitalized with CAP. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show an association between the residential environment and the respiratory microbiota composition in adults. Because of the lack of a healthy control group and the relatively small sample size, results should be interpreted with caution. The abundance of S. pneumoniae in relation to living in the vicinity of poultry/livestock farms needs to be reassessed in future studies.",

                    "text": "Kernel analysis confirmed the excess risk of CAP in the vicinity of poultry farms, as identified earlier using regression analysis [8]. In addition, it indicated that the excess risk has a sharp bound at around 1.15\u00a0km. The advantage of the kernel analysis compared to earlier analyses is that instead of regressing CAP occurrence to distance-to-the-nearest-farm, it models the distance-dependent per-farm contribution to the risk of CAP. Thus, the kernel models can assess the incremental risk per every additional poultry farm as well as local accumulation of risk due to the presence of multiple farms in the vicinity of an individual\u2019s home. In the earlier analyses, we considered an individual exposed when poultry farms were present within a 1\u00a0km radius of the home address. The distance dependence of the fitted kernel model is remarkably sharp, suggesting that the risk is strongly localized, possibly as a result of movement patterns around the home. This suggestion is supported by considering the kernel corresponding to the lower confidence bound of the parameter determining the sharpness of the distance dependence. Even for that kernel parameter set, we calculated that as much as 81% (on average) of the CAP incidence attributed to proximity to individual poultry farms occurs within a 1.15\u00a0km distance. This roughly corresponds to the earlier assumed 1\u00a0km radius around the home address. It should be realized that all risk estimates make use of the distance between a poultry farm and the home address as a proxy of exposure. Activity patterns lead to exposure misclassification and this may have modified the shape of the kernel function to some extent.",

An imbalanced URT microbiome may lead to decreased colonization resistance and reduced containment of commensals that may become pathogens (pathobionts) such as S. pneumoniae, consequently increasing the risk of respiratory tract infections [20].",

                    "text": "We speculate that PM and endotoxin emissions from intensive agricultural operations are central to our findings, putatively by modulating innate immune responses resulting in an imbalanced respiratory microbiome, which is supported by animal and in vitro experiments [31, 32]. Alveolar macrophages remove inhaled PM by phagocytosis and release pro-inflammatory mediators, including reactive oxygen species. Their function is altered by particulate loading, which was shown to result in reduced phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae [33]. Furthermore, PM increases adhesion of S. pneumoniae to human airway epithelial cells, which is mediated by oxidative stress and upregulation of platelet-activating factor receptors (PAFR) [34, 35]. In aged rats, a single exposure to ambient PM reduced the ability to handle ongoing pneumococcal infections [36]. It was recently shown that the composition of the lung microbiota shifted towards endogenous opportunistic pathogens in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced lung inflammation mouse model [32]. It has earlier been proposed that a perturbed respiratory microbiome may be involved in the association between cigarette smoking and respiratory tract infections. Both culture-based and culture-independent studies have shown that smoking can simultaneously deplete members of the normal commensal airway flora and enrich for potential pathogens [37]. Morris et al. [38] showed significant differences in the microbiome of the oral cavity of smokers compared with nonsmokers. We postulate similar mechanisms are responsible for the current observations. Smoking status (and other potential confounders such as COPD) were not associated with residential proximity to a poultry farm, thus it is unlikely that confounding has influenced the results.",

It has been demonstrated that COPD patients living near livestock farms are more likely to use inhaled corticosteroids and report respiratory symptoms than patients living further away from farms, suggesting an increased risk of exacerbations [18, 24]. Dickson et al. [41] proposed that exacerbations of COPD are occasions of respiratory dysbiosis: disorder and dysregulation of the microbial ecosystem of the respiratory tract, coupled with a dysregulated host immune response. A similar mechanism as proposed in the present study, hinging on farm-related air pollutants and dysbiosis of the respiratory tract, may play a role in individuals with COPD living near livestock farms. We intend to study a rural population of both COPD patients and control subjects in a larger-scale future study. Including control subjects will help to interpret results, because the microbiota changes within patient groups may be a cause or a consequence of disease, or merely coinciding with disease status [22].",

However, hospitalized patients living near a poultry farm and those living further away from poultry farms did not differ with regard to potential confounders such as age, smoking, COPD, or pneumonia severity. Residual confounding due to demographic differences between the two groups (e.g. household size), contact with children or other risk factors for pneumonia or pneumococcal colonization cannot be entirely dismissed. Because of the relatively small sample size, the results are sensitive to the effect of outliers. In addition, there may be false positive results due to multiple comparisons. This should therefore be regarded as a hypothesis-generating study, and results need to be confirmed in larger, preferably longitudinal, studies.",

Oropharyngeal microbiota of patients with CAP living within 1\u00a0km of a poultry farm showed an increased abundance of S. pneumoniae. Exposure to air pollutants such as PM and endotoxin may contribute to dysbiosis of URT microbiota in susceptible individuals, which may consequently result in respiratory infections.
