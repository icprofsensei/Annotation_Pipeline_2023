The disease is characterised by persistently elevated blood glucose levels as a result of insufficient insulin production or insulin resistance. This leads to many serious complications affecting the heart, kidneys, eyes, blood vessels and nerves (World Health Organisation, 2016). The development of foot ulcers is the culmination of several of these complications, estimated to affect 15 % of diabetes sufferers (Reiber, Boyko & Smith, 1995). These wounds are often slow to heal, difficult to treat, and prone to infection. They have a severe impact on a patient\u2019s quality of life, and are estimated to increase the risk of lower limb amputation by 15 fold (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008). The cost of treating these chronic wounds is estimated at up to $13 billion annually in the US alone (Rice et al., 2014), and is set to rise with the increasing incidence of diabetes worldwide.",

Dysbiosis of the human microbiome is increasingly recognised to play a role in many diseases, through mechanisms such as altered intestinal barrier function (Kelly et al., 2015), triggering or exacerbating inflammation (Strober, 2013) and regulation of energy metabolism (Samuel et al., 2008). Given the physical changes that occur in the skin as a result of diabetes, such as increased dryness and pH, and glycosylation of structural skin proteins (Behm et al., 2012), it is feasible that diabetes may also affect the microbiome of the skin.",

For example, the most common skin isolate, Staphylococcus epidermidis, has been shown to down-regulate inflammation following skin injury (Lai et al., 2009), and to up-regulate the production of antimicrobial peptides in the host (Lai et al., 2010), which work synergistically with antimicrobial peptides from S.\u00a0epidermidis to inhibit pathogens such as Staphyloccocus aureus and Group A Streptococcus (Cogen et al., 2010a). Another skin commensal, Acinetobacter lwoffii, has been shown to protect against allergic sensitization and inflammation by promoting TH1 and anti-inflammatory responses in the skin (Fyhrquist et al., 2014). Given the importance of the skin microbiome in preventing infection, any shifts to these communities could affect their ability to protect against infection, and may have an effect on wound healing.",

Three swabs were collected for each diabetic subject every two weeks for a 10 week period using sterile rayon tipped swabs (Copan) that had been pre-moistened with a sterile solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20. Two skin swabs were collected from intact foot skin (1) adjacent to the chronic wound (skin adjacent, SA) and (2) contralateral site to the chronic wound (skin contralateral, SC). Skin swabs were collected by firmly rubbing the moistened swab over the base of the foot skin surface for a period of 30 seconds. The whole base of the foot was used to maximise the DNA yield. Skin swab samples were taken prior to any cleaning of the skin surface that routinely took place before debridement of wound tissue. Chronic wounds were cleaned by applying gauze soaked with Prontosan wound irrigation solution (B. Braun Medical, Sheffield, UK) for ten minutes prior to sharp debridement of tissue from the top of the wound (wound debridement, WD). Wound debridement samples were only taken where debridement was deemed to be necessary for the standard wound care. Wound swabs were taken after irrigation of the wound with Prontosan to remove loose tissue, using a dry swab and the Z swab method (wound swab, WS). The Z swab method was the routine method used in the clinic at the time of sampling.",

Different barcoded primers were used for each sample. For skin samples, the V4 region was amplified from 500 pg template DNA; for wound samples template DNA started at 10 ng, but in some cases up to 50 ng was used where a PCR product was not obtained with lower amounts of template DNA. Each sample was subjected to 10 cycles of PCR with 0.5 \u00b5M each of V4_forward and V4_reverse barcoded primers in a 50 \u00b5l PCR reaction that contained 1 \u00d7\u00a0Taq core PCR buffer (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), 1 \u00d7\u00a0Q solution, 250 \u00b5M dNTPs, and 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase.

Excess primer was removed via a magnetic bead clean-up using 0.8 volume of Axygen\u00ae AxyPrep Mag beads (Corning, NY, USA) and the eluted amplicons were subjected to a further 20 cycles of PCR with 0.25 \u00b5M enrichment primers (Illumina_E_1 and Illumina_E_2; Table 2). The PCR reaction and cycling was performed as described above, except that the annealing temperature was increased to 55\u00b0C and 20 thermal cycles were performed. Following confirmation of the PCR product on a 1% agarose gel, the amplicons were purified using Axygen\u00ae AxyPrep Mag beads (Corning, NY, USA) and quantified on a Qubit\u00ae 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with a Qubit\u00ae dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Repeated attempts were made with increased amounts of template for those samples that did not initially yield a PCR product, however no PCR product was obtained (detailed in Tables S1 and S2). Amplicons from the remaining 257 samples were pooled and paired-end sequenced over two separate MiSeq runs with V2-500 cycle kits. Sample from four diabetic and four control subjects were sequenced in each run (Table\u00a0S4). A median coverage of 73,599 sequences per sample was obtained (minimum 1,683, maximum 297,817). Negative controls (two blank swab and 2 no DNA PCR controls) had between 1,508 and 27,840 sequences assigned. The final sequencing coverage obtained for each sample can be found in Table S4 . Because negative control samples contained taxa that are similar to those found on skin (e.g., Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Acinetobacter) specific taxa were not removed from the data, rather samples with less than 30,000 sequences (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were removed from the analysis, based on the highest level of sequencing reads obtained from negative controls. A PERMANOVA test was run on a weighted unfrac distance matrix generated from variance stabilising transformed counts to assess the amount of variance attributable to the two different sequencing runs, (run + subject). Sequencing run was a significant factor accounting for 3.0% of the variance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while inter-individual differences accounted for 34.5% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).",

Of the eight wounds, six are dominated by the most abundant skin OTU, at the majority of time points measured (Staphylococcus OTU 1084865). Only Patients 6 and 10 showed wound profiles dominated by non-skin associated taxa across the time period surveyed. No significant correlations were found between any abundant OTUs (average abundance >\u00a0 1%) and wound duration or healing status. No significant correlation was found between the overall degree of wound healing, and inter-visit weighted unifrac distances in individual wounds (Fig. S2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.29). However, some interesting observations were made that correlated to clinical events. For example, the wound of Patient 6 had been present for 24 months at the start of the study. It was dominated by Enterobacteriacaea and showed little healing until time point 3, which coincided with an angioplasty procedure to improve blood flow to the foot. This was followed by resolution of the wound within two weeks. When Patient 7 presented to the clinic, the wound had been present for 12 months, and was dominated by an OTU from the Neisseriaceae family. Following the standard treatment of debridement and wound dressing, rapid healing was observed, as well as a shift to a community dominated by the most abundant skin OTU.",

The top 10 most abundant OTUs per person were similar in abundance and not significantly different between groups. Many low abundance OTUs were identified as significantly different, with the vast majority of these being more abundant in control skin. One limitation of this study is that, although commonly used in microbiome studies (Cope et al., 2017; David et al., 2014; Halfvarson et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2016), the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene does not allow differentiation between Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus species found on skin, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis (Conlan, Kong & Segre, 2012). Additionally, the V4 primers have mismatches that prevent detection of Propionibacterium, an important genera in the skin microbiome (Kuczynski et al., 2011). The clinical consequences of these organisms may be important, and this should be taken into consideration for the experimental design of future studies (Gohl et al., 2016; Meisel et al., 2016).",

This is in contrast to a previous study of diabetic skin (Redel et al., 2013) where the opposite result was observed. It is possible that changes to the skin environment associated with diabetes, such as increased pH (Yosipovitch et al., 1993) advanced glycation end products in the skin matrix (Gkogkolou & Bohm, 2012), or increased levels of skin inflammation (Tellechea et al., 2013) could drive a decrease in diversity. It is also possible that activities associated with diabetes, such as increased exposure to antibiotics (Mor et al., 2016), contribute to the observed effect despite our attempts to control for recent antibiotic exposure as a confounding variable. Another limitation of the current study is the small sample size, and as such this result should be confirmed on a larger cohort.",

While in some body sites an increase is microbial diversity is associated with disease states, particularly the vagina (Van de Wijgert et al., 2014), decreased diversity of the microbiome has frequently been correlated with disease and inflammation in the skin (Alekseyenko et al., 2013; Ellebrecht et al., 2016; Seite et al., 2014; Williams & Gallo, 2015), gut (Giloteaux et al., 2016; Sze & Schloss, 2016) and airways (Yu et al., 2015). However it is not known whether decreased diversity in these sites is a cause or merely an indicator of inflammation. Diversity is commonly used as an indicator of ecosystem health, with decreased diversity typically signalling a disturbed and less resilient state (Oliver et al., 2015). In the context of the human skin microbiome, decreased diversity could allow potential pathogens to overgrow, and these may be capable of triggering inflammation and triggering or exacerbating a disease state. Alternatively, inflammation could be triggered by genetic and environmental factors, and the inflammation itself could drive down bacterial diversity by creating an inhospitable growth environment.",

This meant that the foot ulcers analysed in this study were considered to be clinically non-infected wounds. No significant correlations were found between any OTU in diabetic skin or wounds with wound size, duration or healing status. This is possibly due to the small sample size, as a previous study found correlations between the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa and ulcer duration and depth (e.g., Staphylococcus was negatively correlated with wound duration) (Gardner et al., 2013). Another possible limitation of this study is the use of the z-swab method which samples across the entire wound base regardless of size, as this will possibly increase heterogeneity with increasing wound size.",

Gardner et al. (2013) found that diabetic ulcers clustered into three types, depending on the dominant taxa in the wounds, which were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, or a mixture of anaerobic bacteria or Proteobacteria. Similar results were found in a later study where two wound clusters were dominated by either Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, and genera such as Corynebacterium and Finegoldia were frequently observed (Loesche et al., 2017). These same genera were observed in most wounds here, while other genera such as Serratia and Proteus were specific to individuals.",

The cohort of this study was small, and these observations should be verified in a larger study. The long-term effects of reduced diversity are not yet well understood, but low diversity continues to be linked to disease and poor health outcomes (Hua et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2016; Rook, 2013). One possible effect is increased infection susceptibility (Seto et al., 2014), and it is intriguing to consider whether decreased skin microbiome diversity could be contributing to the high incidence of skin and wound infections associated with this disease (Peleg et al., 2007). There are, of course, many other well-documented factors such as immune dysfunction that can contribute to an increased rate of infections (Geerlings & Hoepelman, 1999); however, the skin microbiome may be an as yet unconsidered contributor to this phenomenon.",
