Previous studies have focused on characterizing the biological variation in the microbiota, and less is known about how factors related to sampling contribute to the results. Our aim was to investigate the impact of a sampling device and anatomical sampling site on the quantitative and qualitative outcomes relevant for vaginal microbiota research. We sampled 10 Finnish women representing diverse clinical characteristics with flocked swabs, the Evalyn\u00ae self-sampling device, sterile plastic spatulas and a cervical brush that were used to collect samples from fornix, vaginal wall and cervix. Samples were compared on DNA and protein yield, bacterial load, and microbiota diversity and species composition based on Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We quantified the relative contributions of sampling variables versus intrinsic variables in the overall microbiota variation, and evaluated the microbiota profiles using several commonly employed metrics such as alpha and beta diversity as well as abundance of major bacterial genera and species.",

Alterations in the vaginal microbiota and host-microbe interactions have been implicated in a number of gynecological and obstetric conditions, such as bacterial vaginosis [1], cervical cancer [2,3], infertility [4], preterm birth [5] and sexually transmitted infections (STI) [6]. Apart from disease, the vaginal microbiota is affected by various intrinsic factors such as menstrual cycle [7], pregnancy [8], ethnicity [9] and menopause [10] and by external factors such as smoking [11]. Evidently, understanding the normal variation of the vaginal microbiota and the role of different host-associated factors is imperative for interpretation of the data and identifying diagnostic microbiota signatures. The contribution of technical variation introduced by specimen collection and storage, DNA extraction, and sequencing should also be known and optimally minimized to enable cross-comparison of the different studies, and to unmask the underlying biological variation.",

On the other hand, the Human Microbiome Project sampled 113 women from vaginal introitus, mid-vagina and posterior fornix, and concluded based on pyrosequencing that the taxonomic profiles between the sites were essentially similar [14,15].",

A Flocked swab (Floqswab regular, Copan, USA) was chosen for ease of use and offers high sample elution. A cervical brush (Cytobrush Plus, Medscand, USA) is already routinely used in colposcopy and offers accurate sampling from a specific site. The Evalyn\u00ae self-sampling device (Rovers, Netherlands) developed for hrHPV-testing was included to address the quality of self-collected microbiota samples. The Evalyn\u00ae device has a brush that is inside a protective plastic tube during insertion, and hence does not collect material from vaginal introitus or the lowest parts of vagina. After insertion, the brush comes out of the tube and rotates when a plunger at the end of the device is pushed and rotated. The tube has small wings as stoppers so that the depth of the insertion is about 2 cm (see Fig 1). We chose this device for self-sampling to minimize skin contamination and to collect microbiota from specified and reproducible depth in vagina. Scrape samples taken from the lower and upper third as well as from the entire vaginal wall with plastic spatulas (sterile PS-plastic, Aylesbury-shape) were used as a reference to estimate the sampling depth, possible skin or vulvar contamination of self-sampling, and to gather possible adherent bacteria from the vaginal wall. All samples were fresh frozen in dry 2 ml Eppendorf tubes except the left fornix flocked swabs, which were frozen in 1 ml saline to test the potential effect of storage buffer (sample 3. in Fig 1.). The Eppendorf tubes were frozen in a container filled with dry ice in the examination room and transported to -20C freezer by the end of the day. The samples were processed for analysis within 2\u201310 days from collection. All sampling devices were sterile except the cervical brush. The samples, except for the self-taken sample, were collected by three experienced physicians right after insertion of speculum. The speculum was lubricated with small amount of sterile saline if needed.",

Before the removal of the sampling device with sterile forceps the samples were vortexed for 30 secs to dislodge the bacteria and briefly spun down to avoid spills when opening the tube. An aliquot of the clarified supernatant was taken for the measurement of soluble protein content. The rest of the sample, including both the mucous pellet and the supernatant, was moved to 2 ml screw-cap tube and an equal volume of lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM EDTA, 4% SDS) was added. To break to cells, samples were bead beaten using a Precellys 24 high-throughput tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, France) with 0.1 mm zirconium-silica beads (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA) for 2 x 30 sec at 5500 rpm. DNA from the lysates was purified using QIAamp DNA Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) without the lysis step according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The samples were eluted in 200 \u03bcl of kit elution buffer.",

The composition of mock communities used in parameter optimization has been described elsewhere [29]. The forward reads were truncated to length of 150 bases with mare\u2019s \u201cProcessReads\u201d command. We used default settings for minimum quality score (2) and maximum expected errors (1). Reads with abundance below 0.0001 were removed. Chimera removal and dereplication of the reads was done using USEARCH8 [30].

To control for the effect of the variable read count between the samples, the number of reads was used as an offset in all statistical models. Basic statistical inference in mare is based on generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution utilizing glm.nb function of the R package MASS [33]. Community dissimilarity was estimated with principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity as the distance measure. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is 0 for identical samples and 1 for communities that do not share any species [34]. PCoA was calculated with the capscale function of R package vegan and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities with function vegdist of the same package [35]. Continuous variables in the PCoA-space were interpolated with gstat function of the gstat package in R [36]. To calculate the relative contribution of different variables in the microbiota variation, permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices was performed with adonis function in the vegan package. Taxonomic alpha-diversity was estimated as the number of observed OTUs and by the inverse Simpson\u2019s diversity index. For univariate data (DNA yield, protein content, qPCR results, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, richness, diversity) the differences between the samples was determined by repeated measures ANOVA in combination with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc tests. We compared the relative abundances of the bacterial species collected with different methods with generalized linear mixed models within \u201cGroupTest\u201d function of the mare package using subject as the random factor. This function uses the glmmADMB package (generalized linear mixed models built on AD Model Builder) of R software on background and assumes negative binomial distribution of abundance (for the command and source code see S2 Appendix) [37,38]. P-values for taxon-specific differences were collected for false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini\u2013Hochberg [39]) with function p.adjust of the stats package in R [26].",

We then multiplied the number of 16S rRNA copies per ng with the DNA yield (corrected for the protein aliquot) to get the number of copies per sample. The mean amount of bacterial DNA varied 74 -fold between the methods and 648-fold between the patients. There were no statistical differences in the amount of bacteria collected across the tested devices and locations (Fig 3C), and no correlation between the DNA yield and bacterial load (Spearman r = 0.24, p = 0.07). Bleeding did not affect the bacterial content, but BV was associated with significantly higher bacterial counts compared to other clinical groups based on microscopy (Fig A-C in S1 Appendix).",

After preprocessing, we had an average of 79 500 high-quality sequences per sample (range 43 000\u2013107 000). Due to the excess number of reads, there was no association between the read count and microbiota richness (Fig C in S1 Appendix). In the studied 10 Finnish asymptomatic women, we detected altogether 45 bacterial species. Most abundant bacteria were Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Megasphera paucivorans/sueciensis, Prevotella bivia and Atopobium vaginae. The variation of microbial composition was high between the individuals, six out of 10 women having Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota and the rest had Enterobacter, Lachnospiraceae BVAB1, Prevotella or Megasphera dominated community (Fig 4). Four patients had L. iners dominated (Community State Type III; CST III) and two L. crispatus dominated bacteria (CST I) [40]. We did not detect Gardnerella vaginalis in any of the samples, despite the fact that nine patients had abnormal bacterial findings suggestive of bacterial vaginosis in the Pap smear. The lack of Gardnerella sequences is likely reflecting PCR bias as the used V1 forward primer does not capture Bifidobacteriales including G. vaginalis [41].",

Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of all the samples revealed that the vaginal microbial communities clustered according to the patient (Fig 5.). Permutational multivariate ANOVA, with Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, was used to assess the proportion of variation in the microbiota composition attributable to different biological and technical factors, such as the sample donor, sampling site and device as well as microscopic findings (clinical phenotype). Of the tested variables, microscopic findings (BV-status) explained most of the microbiota variation (53%, p-value 0.0001) followed by bleeding status (19%, p-value 0.0001), the sample donor (11%, p-value 0.0001) and the read count (6%, p-value 0.005). As the read count was significantly associated with the microbiota variation, it was used as offsets in all statistical models. The sampling method explained only 2% (p-value 0.89) of the total variance and hence was practically not associated with the overall microbiota variation. The use of storage buffer (flocked swabs stored dry versus in sterile saline) did not affect the microbiota composition (1%, p-value 0.90).",

Evalyn collected less Prevotella cluster 2 than scrape 1/1 (p-value 0.026, fold change 1.40).

Our results, based on excessively high 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence coverage of one self-sampled and six different physician-collected samples from 10 women, indicate that both the sampling device and anatomical site have little effect on the representation of the cervico-vaginal bacterial community membership and abundance. In contrast, the amount of the captured total genomic DNA, but not the proportion of bacterial DNA, is strongly dependent on the sampling device and to a lesser amount on the anatomical site of the sampling.",

The self-sampling brush collected a mean of 19 \u03bcg of genomic DNA per sample, vastly exceeding the DNA yields obtained with the other tools (mean ranging from 0.6 \u03bcg to 9.1 \u03bcg), making it therefore ideal for applications requiring a large amount of cells or DNA. We further observed a non-significant, descending trend in the DNA yield from fornix and cervix to vaginal walls (Fig 3B). All scrapes collected invariably low amounts of DNA (Fig 3B). Based on the visual inspection of the cell pellets during DNA extraction, the large surface area of the self-sampling brush collected several times more vaginal content than the other devices, especially the scrapes, and this evidently contributed to the large difference in the DNA yields between the devices. We did not attempt to normalize the DNA concentrations for sample weight but rather calculated the total yield of genomic DNA per each device to reflect the real-life situation. We are not aware of other studies that have compared genomic DNA yield from different types of vaginal samples. Self-collected vaginal Dacron swabs have been reported to yield 2.5 to 5 \u03bcg of total DNA [7], which is ca. 2-fold lower than our DNA yields from physician-collected, spatially constrained flocked swabs.",

To normalize for the high device-driven variation in the ab-solute DNA yields, we calculated the results per fixed amount of template DNA (1 ng). While the sampling device had the largest impact on the DNA yield, the amount of bacterial DNA in the samples was driven strongly by inter-individual variation with minor, non-significant differences arising from the sampling methods (Fig 3C). This indicates that each woman had a characteristic bacterial load in the vagina that was robustly collected with all the tested methods. Hence, although self-sampling brush collected significantly more DNA in absolute terms, these samples had similar bacterial content to the scrapes and other samples, highlighting that the majority of the DNA collected by the self-sample is of non-bacterial origin.",

We also observed somewhat lower amount of bacteria in the lower third compared to the rest of the vagina. However, these differences were minor compared to the biological variation independent of the sampling strategy. In line with an earlier study [45], the BV samples had ca. 10-fold higher total bacterial load compared to other samples. In summary, our results of the quantitative analysis indicate that the vaginal DNA yield depends on the sampling method, but the bacterial counts in the vagina are regulated by biological factors, being insensitive to the choice of the sampling strategy. This also applied to the microbiota diversity and richness that were significantly affected by the sample donor, bleeding and BV-status, but not by the sampling site or device.",

However, our results disagree with the only previous study that has addressed the impact of vaginal microbiota sampling device and anatomical sampling site in parallel in the same women [46]. The authors reported that both the vaginal sites and sampling methods introduce substantial variation to the detected microbiota profiles. Comparison of the swabs collected from the cervix, fornix and lower 1/3 of the vaginal canal of eight women showed marked, up to phylum-level microbiota differences that however were inconsistent across the study subjects.",

Hence, the detected microbiota variability between the samples may at least partly reflect stochastic variation due low sampling depth. Our MiSeq data was saturated in terms of the read counts, and in that sense our results, showing negligible effect of the sampling device on the microbiota profile, can be considered more reliable. Therefore the single swab that has been used to sample the vaginal microbiota in majority of the large-scale studies to date [2,40,42,43] seems to be representative.",

We did not do any direct comparison to other self-sampling methods, since we did not want to risk losing possible spatial variation by mixing the bacteria across vaginal sites with multiple self-sampling. There are other devices for self-sampling on the market, but we chose Evalyn because of the protective tube, the Finnish-language patient manual available and the fact that we happened to have few extra devices left from another study at our disposal [48].",

Four patients had L. iners dominated (Community State Type III; CST III) and two L. crispatus dominated bacteria (CST I) [15]. Our small cohort represents the first study to measure the vaginal microbiota with culture-independent methods from Finnish women. Species composition was similar to what has been reported in studies from our neighboring countries Estonia and Sweden [49,50] and in the most recent large meta-analysis of vaginal microbiota [51]. This suggests that our results on the robustness of the microbiota profiles to sampling strategy can be generalized also to healthy women even though many of the 10 women sampled in this study happened to have bacterial vaginosis and/or abnormal cells in Pap smear. The limitation of our study is the relatively small number of study subjects. Hence, we cannot prove that the sampling methods or locations would always produce equal results.",

The three bacteria (Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera paucivorans/sueciensis, Prevotella cluster 2) reaching statistical significance differed between cervical brush versus flocked swab, and cervical brush versus upper 1/3 scrape. All the differences had very low fold change in relative abundance (maximally 1.4-fold) and hence the biological relevance of these differences seems virtual. With the targeted 10 patients, we did not identify bacteria that would have been unique e.g. to cervix, or to the adherent material collected from the vaginal wall by the scrapes. Also previously, the microbiota composition between cervical and vaginal samples has been reported to be similar [44]. G. vaginalis, an important species in the vaginal microbiota, was not covered in our analysis due to the mismatch of the forward primer 27F. Consequently, our study cannot evaluate performance of these sampling methods for G. vaginalis or any other bacteria belonging to order Bifidobacteriales [41]. The parameters used in the preprocessing pipeline filtered low abundant bacteria and thus this study does not address possible variation in the very low abundant species between sampling sites and devices.",

Hence, biological variability of the vaginal microbiota exceeds the extent of technical variation rising from the sampling collection technique (this study) and DNA extraction method [21].Therefore past and future vaginal microbiota studies employing different sampling strategies should be comparable in the absence of other technical confounders, such as sample storage, sequencing strategy or bioinformatic parameters. The Evalyn\u00ae self-sampling device performed equally well compared to samples taken by a clinician, and hence offer a good-quality microbiota sample without the need for a gynecological examination. The self-sampling option enables higher participant rates e.g. in large longitudinal epidemiological studies. Our results emphasize the fact that the DNA yield from vaginal samples is merely a qualitative readout, which cannot be used as an indication of bacterial load or microbiota diversity in the samples. However, it might have practical implications for study design, e.g. when selecting a method for other down-stream applications than NGS that require larger input sample volumes, or when aliquoting the samples for multiple assays.",

Ultimately the choice for optimal sampling device depends on the sampling conditions, e.g. if gynecological examination is feasible or not, and on the sampling location of interest. Combined protein and microbiota sampling from one sample should also be possible with a brush or a flocked swab, if multiple sampling is not possible, but a single sample for multiple purposes is very vulnerable and might also lead to multiple freeze-thaw cycles in the laboratory compromising the sample quality.",
