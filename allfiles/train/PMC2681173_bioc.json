These conflicting data may relate to sample collection. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of the collection parameters of time and temperature on bacterial community composition. Samples were taken from healthy children and immediately divided in 5 sub-samples. One sample was frozen immediately at -80\u00b0C, while the other aliquots were frozen 12, 24, 48, and 72h later DNA extracted from each sample was used to amplify the 16S rRNA with barcoded primers. The amplified products were pooled and partial 16S rRNA sequences were obtained by pyrosequencing. Person-to-person variability in community diversity was high. A list of those taxa that comprise at least 1% of the community was made for each individual. None of these were present in high numbers in all individuals. The Bacteroides were present in the highest abundance in three of four subjects. A total of 23,701 16S rRNA sequences were obtained with an average of 1,185 reads per sample with an average length of 200 bases. Although pyrosequencing of amplified 16S rRNA identified changes in community composition over time (~10%), little diversity change was observed at 12 hours (3.06%) with gradual changes occurring after 24 (8.61%), 48 (9.72%), and 72 h (10.14%), post collection.",

Bacteria inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract may affect mucosal permeability and/or lead to abnormal immunoregulation as has been reported in multiple sclerosis, allergy and inflammatory bowel disease [5]. The influence of gut bacteria on human disease is not limited to immunologically mediated disorders as altered gut microbiota have also been related to a propensity for obesity [6]. ",

[7]. The barcoded 16S rRNA primers were attached to the 454 Life Sciences\u00ae primer B and A, and a two-base linker sequence was inserted between the 454 adapter and the 16S rRNA primers to reduce any effect the composite primer might have on PCR efficiency (see supplementary material). Six independent PCR reactions were performed for each sample. The PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes, 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45s; 55\u00b0C for 45s; and 72\u00b0C for 1 min extension; followed by 72\u00b0C for 6 minutes. The six PCR replications for each of the 20 samples were combined and purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The DNA concentration of the PCR products was measured using on-chip gel electrophoresis with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and DNA LabChip\u00ae Kit 7500. Finally the reactions were combined in equimolar ratios to create a DNA pool that was used for pyrosequencing from adaptor A.",

The resulting phylogenetic tree from MUSCLE, a text file containing the number of sequences found within each out, and the subject from which the samples were derived were uploaded into the online UniFrac program [11]. The weighted and unweighted UniFrac significance tests and a phylogenetic P-test were performed.

With the distance matrix, DOTUR [15] was used and the output files from DOTUR were used to run SONS. A list of shared OTUs comprising the number of sequences from each OTU at different time of storage was then generated. To identify changes in specific bacterial lineages and obtain a quantitative description of the bacterial lineages, only those OTUs that were 1% or more abundant were used in the dataset. For each OTU (defined as 97% similarity or greater) an exact Chi-square test (based on 50000 Monte Carlo iterations) was calculated to obtain a p-value for the null hypothesis. That is, H0: equal success probabilities, which means that there are no differences in that specific OTU after sample storage at room temperature. The p-values were ordered and processed to find a false discover rate (FDR) less than 1%.",

However, genus-level identification allows us to estimate the general physiological characteristics of these organisms. No genus was represented by more than 1% of sequences in all four subjects. This is largely owing to the lack of diversity in the subject D samples. Only five taxa representing over 90% of the bacterial communities across all time points could be identified in the subject D samples.",

In Crohn\u2019s disease, a T-RFLP fingerprinting method was used to shown that bacterial diversity is higher in stool from healthy subjects compared to their twin diseased subjects. Two rodent models for type 1 diabetes have shown that feeding antibiotic or probiotics can delay the onset of the disease [1, 24-27]. In addition, a germ-free environment increases the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice [28, 29]. ",

A larger prospective study in the United States, Germany, Sweden, and Finland called The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) (seeking to determine possible environmental triggers of autoimminty) has been collecting samples since 2004 from genetically high risk children on a monthly basis [30].
