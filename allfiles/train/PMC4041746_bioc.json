PRRs, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) and the recently discovered retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), are all known to play important roles in pathogen recognition, cell activation and regulation of immune responses [3], [4], [5].

The most recently discovered PRR members are the RLRs, comprising three homologues: RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP-2) [11]. RIG-I and MDA-5 detect RNA from replicating viruses in infected cells, which leads to the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) through the activation of the IFN regulating factor 3, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines by the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling pathway [12]. It has recently been shown that RIG-I is responsible for sensing viral RNA bearing triphosphate, while MDA-5 functions as a dsRNA sensor [13].",

Evidence suggests that there are intrinsic or locally induced deficiencies in epithelial barrier function of the nasal mucosa in patients with allergic rhinitis, due to persistent inflammation [14]. This inflammation is characterized by increased release of cytokine such as GM-CSF, infiltration of inflammatory cells and up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [15]. Defects in the host response to external pathogens, including viruses, have also been suggested to underlie the persistence of the inflammatory state [16]. Clinically, respiratory viral infections are also often implicated as triggers of flare-ups in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and these infections are also known to damage the function of human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) [17], [18]. Several studies have shown abnormalities in the immune responses in patients with CRS, such as an exaggerated response to TLR3 [19]. dsRNA is known to bind to TLR3 and stimulate the expression of IL-8 in airway epithelial cells [20]. However, the role of all virus-recognizing PRRs on nasal epithelial cells has not yet been established. The aim of the present study was to characterize the expression and explore the activation of virus-recognizing PRRs on nasal epithelial cells as well as their functional response in the nasal mucosa. To this end, the nasal biopsies, primary human nasal epithelial cells and two complementary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells were used.",

The present study extends the perspective of these findings by focusing on virus-recognizing PRRs in the nasal epithelium. We investigate the activation of the PRRs and demonstrate their specific role and function in the nasal mucosa. We initially noted that nasal biopsies expressed all receptors investigated. However, to fully understand the PRR expression in primary nasal epithelial cells, both mRNA and protein levels of the PRRs were analysed in isolated epithelial cells. The cell content in nasal biopsies primarily consists of nasal epithelial cells but also consists of neutrophils, leukocytes, goblet cells, brush border cells and endothelial cells lining the vessels. Therefore, through nasal brushing, we were able to collect chunks that consisted mainly of epithelial lining that were subsequently well preserved and thereby provided a culture of only HNEC for further analysis. Using this method, we found that TLR3, RIG-I and MDA-5 was expressed at both mRNA and protein levels in HNEC. These receptors were also expressed in all epithelial cell lines which is in line with a previous report by Broquet et al. stating a role for TLR3, RIG-I and MDA-5 in viral detection in the intestinal epithelium [27]. The discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression of TLR7 and TLR9 in Detroit-562 and FaDu can be explained by differences in posttranscriptional regulation, such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation, mRNA and protein turnover rates, or mRNA secondary structures that all have the ability to affect the protein translation efficiency [28]. It has been shown that mRNA has a shorter half-life compared to proteins in human cell lines, this could be an alternative explanation for the lower levels of the mRNA [29]. In combination, mRNA and protein levels provide us with a detailed understanding of the receptor's gene function [30].",

However, there is always a risk for unwanted parallel effects of this defense system, especially if the patient is suffering from an ongoing chronic inflammatory disease [16]. In this study we directed our efforts on epithelial cell activity, induced by specific ligands of virus recognising PRRs in the nasal mucosa. IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion were chosen as markers for epithelial cell activation, as they are powerful mediators of airway inflammation. IL-6 induces antibody production in B cells and T-cell activation and differentiation [31]. IL-8 is a major chemoattractant for neutrophils, and it stimulates these cells to release enzymes and produce reactive oxygen species [32]. Similarly, GM-CSF can prime both neutrophils and eosinophils for activation [33]. Several studies have also demonstrated that these cytokines are involved in virus induced exacerbations of inflammatory diseases [34], [35].",

In addition to the ability of the TLR3 agonist to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines, it also promoted an upregulation of the viral epithelial cell receptor ICAM-1 (unpublished data). In line with our study, other reports have demonstrated that poly(I:C) induce the production of inflammatory cytokines/chemokine in nasal epithelial cells [36], as well as increased production of both IL-6 and IL-8 in human airway epithelial cells [37]. Rhinovirus (RV), a common dsRNA virus inducing cold in healthy individuals, is also recognized by TLR3 [38]. Studies have demonstrated elevated IL-6 and IL-8 production in nasal lavage fluids during common cold [39], [40]. This highlights the importance of epithelial TLR3, as a major mediator for the inflammatory and antiviral response in the nasal mucosa. TLR3 activation also causes unwanted parallel effects when the defense is activated [16]. Upregulation of TLR3 has been reported in the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis [41]. Subauste et al. state that IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF produced by RV increase the susceptibility to further upper airway infection [42]. A recent study using a mouse model also suggested that TLR3 contributes to the exacerbation of virus-induced asthma [20]. This highlights the importance of TLR3 on epithelial cells, not only as a major mediator for the antiviral response, but also as an important player in virus-induced exacerbations of inflammatory diseases.",

A similar cytokine production was also seen in epithelial cells, emphasizing the importance of TLR7 on epithelial cells in response to infections in the nasal mucosa. In line with this, Chehadeh et al. have demonstrated a TLR7 dependent IL-6 production after enterovirus infections [43]. This further emphasizes the role of TLR7 in viral recognition. Presently, CpG stimulation of the nasal mucosa significantly increased IL-8 secretion, whereas no such thing was seen in supernatants from the epithelial cells. Zhao et al. have reported that TLR9 is highly up-regulated in CRS patients with nasal polyps [44]. This indicates that also TLR9 activation could have an important role in exacerbation of inflammatory airway diseases like CRS.",

A similar release was also seen in our epithelial cell lines, demonstrating that epithelial cells are responsible for the nasal mucosa release of IFN-\u03b2 early upon viral infection. IFN-\u03b2 is essential for the induction of a robust immune response in response to viral infections and previous studies have shown that epithelial cells pre-treated with IFN-\u03b2 are protected against subsequent viral infections [45], even days after stimulation [46]. Wark et al. show that the impairment of virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 expression is associated with enhanced viral replication in cell cultures [47]. Liu et al. has also suggested that IFN-\u03b2 secreted from respiratory syncytial virus-infected epithelial cells induces TLR expression in a paracrine fashion in A549 cells [48]. This underscores the importance of RIG-I/MDA-5 on epithelial cells mediating an early antiviral response to viral infections in the nasal mucosa. RIG-I and MDA-5 have also been suggested to be involved in various inflammatory diseases, like asthma. Asthmatic patients are known to be more susceptible to RV infection due to impaired RIG-I/MDA-5 production of IFN-\u03b2 [47], among the infected epithelial cells. In analogy, MDA-5\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit decreased IFN mRNA expression five days after a virus infection, resulting in increased mortality and severe histopathological changes in the lower airway [49]. Further, RV-infected, OVA-treated, MDA-5\u2212/\u2212 mice have shown even more reduced IFN levels compared to wild-type mice. This suggests that virus infections via the activation of RIG-I/MDA-5 on epithelial cells could be involved in virus induced exacerbations of inflammatory diseases in the nasal mucosa.",

The obtained differences could also be related to the diverse origin of the epithelial cell lines. FaDu cells originate from primary hypopharyngeal carcinoma, Detroit-562 cell line from a metastasis of pharynx carcinoma, whereas HNEC are isolated from the inferior turbinate of healthy individuals. Hence, HNEC is therefore probably the cell type that best reflects the nasal response to a viral attack.",
