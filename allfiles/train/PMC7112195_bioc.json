We sought to determine the association between a woman\u2019s birth mode and her vaginal microbiota in adulthood. We re-contacted 144 adult women from two U.S. studies and administered a brief survey. Vaginal microbiota was characterized on a single sample by amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene and clustered into community state types (CSTs). We evaluated the association between birth mode and a CST with low relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. (\u201cmolecular bacterial vaginosis\u201d [Molecular-BV]) compared to Lactobacillus-dominated CSTs in logistic regression modeling which adjusted for body mass index, a confounder in this analysis. Twenty-seven women (19%) reported C-section. Overall, C-section showed a non-significant trend towards increased odds of Molecular-BV (aOR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.45, 3.32), and Prevotella bivia was the strongest single taxa associated with C-section. However, because the two archived studies had different inclusion criteria (interaction p = 0.048), we stratified the analysis by study site. In the study with a larger sample size (n = 88), women born by C-section had 3-fold higher odds of Molecular-BV compared to vaginally-delivered women (aOR = 3.55, p = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.97\u201313.02). No association was found in the smaller study (n = 56, aOR = 0.19, p = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02\u20131.71). This pilot cross-sectional study suggests a possible association between C-section and Molecular-BV in adulthood. However, the analysis is limited by small sample size and lack of comparability in participant age and other characteristics between the study sites. Future longitudinal studies could recruit larger samples of women, address the temporal dynamics of vaginal microbiota, and explore other confounders, including maternal factors, breastfeeding history, and socioeconomic status, which may affect the relationship between birth mode and vaginal microbiota.",

We hypothesized that a woman\u2019s birth mode, that is, the method through which she was delivered by her mother, is an important early life factor in determining how a woman\u2019s vaginal microbiota is initially seeded and transitions into adulthood. Thus, any differences in the composition of vaginal microbiota attributable to birth mode must persist through known hormonally-driven transitions in the microbiota during early childhood and puberty, including the longitudinal dynamics observed among reproductive-age women in menstruation and pregnancy.",

Logistic regression was used to examine the association between birth mode and Molecular-BV. As the two archived studies differed in participant characteristics and inclusion criteria, we planned a priori to assess potential effect modification due to study site. Several confounders identified in the literature as being associated with birth mode and/or Molecular-BV were considered for inclusion in the final adjusted model, including race/ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI) at the time of sampling, and age and weight status at the first menstrual period. Because L. iners-dominated CST III is often associated with transitions to a Molecular-BV state [33], we conducted sensitivity analyses in which CSTs III and IV were each individually compared to the other Lactobacillus-dominated states (CSTs I, II, and V) in a multinomial model. These analyses were conducted using STATA/SE 14.2 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas). In addition, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis (performed in R [R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria]) and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) [34] were used to determine whether specific taxa differed significantly in relative abundance between women born by C-section or vaginal delivery. A heatmap, also created in R, included the 25 most abundant bacterial taxa found in the samples and were color-coded based on the relative abundance of each taxa in the samples.",

Samples identified as Molecular-BV (CST IV), representing 20.8% (n = 30) of the study population, were compared to samples with high-Lactobacillus states (i.e., CST I, II, III, and V). Overall, birth mode was not significantly associated with Molecular-BV (CST IV); however, the OR estimate suggested increased odds of CST IV with C-section delivery (aOR = 1.22, p = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.45\u20133.32) (Table 2). BMI, the only variable that was associated with both C-section delivery and Molecular-BV, was the only confounder included in the adjusted models. Due to significant effect modification based on parent study site (interaction p = 0.048), we also stratified the analysis. In the HCL study stratum, women born by C-section had 3-fold higher odds of having low-Lactobacillus vaginal communities compared to vaginally-delivered women (n = 88, aOR = 3.55, p = 0.056, 95% CI: 0.97\u201313.02). No association was found within the VM400 study stratum (n = 56, aOR = 0.19, p = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02\u20131.71). Sensitivity analyses excluding L. iners-dominated CST III from the high-Lactobacillus reference showed similar trends for the relationship between Molecular-BV and C-section. In a multinomial logistic regression analysis of HCL study participants, the odds of having vaginal microbiota characterized as CST III was not associated with C-section (aOR = 1.29, p = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.31\u20135.22) and the odds of having CST IV retained its magnitude of association with C-section (aOR = 3.91, p = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.95\u201316.23) compared to other Lactobacillus-dominated CSTs.",

                    "text": "We found qualitative interaction between study site and birth mode in the pooled analysis, which led us to stratify results by parent study. As with all subgroup analyses, the stratified results should be interpreted with caution as there is high likelihood of spurious findings. In addition, the sample sizes within strata were small, leading to concern for inadequate power. However, the low p-value of the test for interaction indicated low likelihood that the subgroup differences were due to chance.[35] The subgroup differences that were observed could be linked to marked differences between the study sites in age at sampling, weight, personal hygiene behaviors, and recent antibiotic use. As HCL participants were younger in age and were less likely to have given birth vaginally, we could reasonably hypothesize that the effect of birth mode could be stronger in this population. While the swabs used between the two studies were the same, the sample processing and sequencing methods differed. Our group\u2019s recent paper comparing vaginal samples processed using the dual-indexing one-step and two-step library preparation methods on the Illumina MiSeq (one-step and two-step) and HiSeq (two-step only) platforms found complete within-subject agreement among the CST assignments from all three methods.[25] Therefore, we have evidence to suggest limited variability in the CST outcome measurements between studies. CST in this study was determined from one vaginal sample collected at baseline. Our group and others have confirmed that the vaginal microbiota is dynamic for many women and can change at various points in the menstrual cycle and in pregnancy.[33,36\u201340] Basing the overall CST assignment on one sampling day may have resulted in misclassification of the typical bacterial composition of the participants. However, longitudinal studies have also demonstrated that women tend to stay in the same plane of fluctuation over many months and possibly years of observation.[33,38] Women who are found in CST IV at a single time point tend to most often fluctuate between IV and the L. iners-dominated CST III, which may represent an enduring pattern that favors Molecular-BV.[33] In addition, from an epidemiologic perspective, if there was non-differential misclassification of CSTs, that would serve to dampen the point estimates toward the null.[41] A finding of higher likelihood of Molecular-BV with CST IV, even within a cross-sectional analysis, still provides evidence for concern and could be indicative of long-term risk for BV and STIs.[42] The characterization of the vaginal microbiota was based on relative abundances of bacterial taxa. Although absolute abundances estimating the total bacterial loads [43] would complement the relative abundance results, they were not calculated in this analysis. Absolute abundance data provided by species-specific qPCR would also allow for observation of rare taxa and their relationship to birth mode. Our phylotype-level results indicating a higher relative abundance of P. bivia among women born by C-section reiterates the Molecular-BV findings in the CST-level analysis. Prevotella spp. have been associated with both BV and increased inflammation.[44\u201348] Si et al. also reported that Prevotella is a heritable bacteria that is associated with genetic variants of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-5) and obesity risk.[49]",

While these, and likely other variables, are undoubtedly important potential confounders, it may be difficult for adult daughters to recall these details accurately. In addition, there were many missing values in the breastfeeding variable, prohibiting use of this variable in assessing confounding. Like birth mode, there are conflicting findings in the literature on the effect of breastfeeding on the gut microbiota,[19] so it is not certain whether this factor would influence our analysis. Though the inability to adjust for breastfeeding history and other birthing/infancy characteristics may indicate unresolved confounding, the finding that these factors are not reliably obtained from adult women through direct questioning will inform future studies.",

To our knowledge, there are no available data on vaginal microbiota in adulthood as it relates to birth mode. Overall, the efforts to re-contact past participants were successful. We re-engaged over 72% of the former HCL participants who consented to be contacted for future research. However, former VM400 participants were less responsive, with less than 15% participating in the follow-up. The time interval between the end of the parent study and re-contact for this study on birth mode was much greater for VM400 than for HCL. Many participant phone numbers and email addresses had been disconnected. Self-selection bias was a minor concern, as women who participated in multiple follow-ups for the parent studies have proven to be very motivated and may be different from women who refused to participate. Only 37.5% of VM400 participants were able to report whether or not they were breastfed, which hindered further analysis of this variable. However, participants showed greater confidence when answering all other items, including their birth mode, in phone and online questionnaires, and in the few instances when participants were unsure of an answer, they were prompted to confirm their answers with a family member. The adult women were uniformly very confident in reporting their birth mode; any misclassification is likely to be independent of the Molecular-BV outcome.",

The establishment of stable adult vaginal microbiota may rely on several early environmental factors. There is conflicting evidence on the extent to which the acquisition of infant microbiota at several body sites is determined by birth mode.[57,58] While babies born by C-section delivery do not transit through the environment of the mothers\u2019 vaginal bacteria, they still acquire human microbes shortly after birth, possibly through contact with the operating room environment [59] as well as through breastfeeding, diaper changes, and other close contact. After infancy, the vaginal microbiome undergoes significant transitions. In early childhood, girls tend to be colonized by stable aerobic, anaerobic, and enteric bacteria.[60] Important findings by Hickey et al. suggest that the vaginal microbiota of girls begins to resemble those of adults (typically dominated by Lactobacillus spp.) before menarche, while girls are still in the early and middle stages of puberty.[61] It is thought that the composition and function of the vaginal microbiota change in puberty due to increased estrogen production.[62] However, it remains unclear how girls transition and colonize adult-like vaginal microbiota, and further studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis that any effect of birth mode on the vaginal microbiota persists through infancy and puberty to adulthood.",

Babies born by C-section have an increased risk of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes and obesity at age 3 years, outcomes that may be related to the gut microbiota.[2,6] Most longitudinal studies investigating the effect of birth mode and neonatal exposures have followed infants for 3 years or less. For example, Chu et al. described a cohort study of 81 mother and infant dyads in which multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina, were sampled for 6 weeks.[20] The authors observed minor variations in the neonates\u2019 microbiota community structure associated with C-section delivery in most body sites immediately after birth. However, while the infants\u2019 microbiota matured substantially at each body site, the authors reported no discernable differences in bacterial community structure within gut, nares, and oral cavity between infants delivered vaginally or C-section at 6 weeks of age. In a recent pilot study, Dominguez-Bello et al. reported that C-section infants who were seeded with vaginal secretions from their mother had gut, oral, and skin bacterial communities enriched in vaginal bacteria after 30 days, similar to infants born vaginally.[63] These studies did not collect infant vaginal samples to determine how the vaginal microbiota undergoes reorganization in early life, which underscored the need for longitudinal studies assessing the seeding of bacteria in an infant girl\u2019s vaginal microenvironment.",

However, BMI was shown to be associated with C-section delivery and CST in this study sample.

As currently presented, there are a number of issues with the article, particularly in the study design and subsequent interpretation of data, that prevent the paper being acceptable for publication. While the hypothesis of the study is interesting- that birth mode may influence likelihood of development of BV-like vaginal microbiota later in life- the study design is insufficient to enable the primary research question to be addressed in any meaningful way. The authors themselves acknowledge a lack of power which prevents associations (positive or negative) to be determined. However, there are other major concerns, some of which I have outlined below.",

For example, when in the menstrual cycle were base line samples for both cohorts collected? Were women asked if they had been recently pregnant? The latter is particularly pertinent given that women born by C-section were more likely to report giving birth within one year prior to enrolment in the parent study. Work from David Relman\u2019s group and others have shown that pregnancy has a lasting impact on vaginal composition and is associated with a strong shift towards a \u201cmolecular BV\u201d like composition for more than a year in some women. Thus, it is possible that the trend increase in molecular-BV type vaginal communities associated with delivery by C-section is due to a higher proportion of these women giving birth recently.",

The study's primary analysis combined the cohorts to achieve greater statistical power, but each cohort was also examined separately. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found a non-statistically significant trend toward Molecular-BV with Cesarean section delivery, a trend that appeared to be driven largely by the HCL cohort.

For example, when in the menstrual cycle were base line samples for both cohorts collected? Were women asked if they had been recently pregnant? The latter is particularly pertinent given that women born by C-section were more likely to report giving birth within one year prior to enrolment in the parent study. Work from David Relman\u2019s group and others have shown that pregnancy has a lasting impact on vaginal composition and is associated with a strong shift towards a \u201cmolecular BV\u201d like composition for more than a year in some women. Thus, it is possible that the trend increase in Molecular-BV type vaginal communities associated with delivery by C-section is due to a higher proportion of these women giving birth recently.",
