Compared to HD patients the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (P\u2009=\u20090.0233) was increased in PD patients. At the family level, Enterobacteriaceae was significantly increased in PD patients (P\u2009=\u20090.0020) compared to controls; whereas, Bifidobacteria showed a significant decrease in PD and transplant patients (P\u2009=\u20090.0020) compared to control. Alpha diversity was decreased in PD patients and kidney transplant using both phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic diversity measures (P\u2009=\u20090.0031 and 0.0003, respectively), while beta diversity showed significant separation (R statistic\u2009=\u20090.2656, P\u2009=\u20090.010) between PD patients and controls. ESRD patients had increased serum levels of p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate (P\u2009<\u20090.0001 and P\u2009<\u20090.0001, respectively).

There is evidence that uremia in ESRD disrupts the intestinal barrier structure, specifically the tight junctions, and impairs intestinal motility [4\u20137]. These changes may facilitate the translocation of endotoxins and bacterial metabolites into the systemic circulation leading to systemic micro-inflammation [8, 9] and increased cardiovascular disease [10\u201313]. Blood markers such as D-lactate and endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which are metabolic products or components of intestinal bacteria, have been used as indicators of intestinal permeability [14]. Evaluation of intestinal wall integrity is a challenge in patients with reduced renal residual function, because it depends on renal excretion of the orally ingested molecules.",

The dietary restriction of potassium may inadvertently cause a reduction in the insoluble fiber intake of these patients [15]. This may ultimately lead to a reduction of normal gut flora which ferment fiber to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which act as a key energy source for colorectal tissues and symbiotic microbes [16]. Further, studies in adults demonstrate that uremia results in a shift in the intestinal microbiota, favoring bacteria capable of surviving in the new biochemical environment [17]. The metabolites produced by this altered colonic flora result in the accumulation of uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate\u00a0[18]. Eighteen bacterial families with 4-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase (4-Hpd) and tryptophanase are responsible for the formation of p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate, respectively [15, 19]. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that uremia may also increase ammonia production leading to increased luminal pH and resulting in mucosal damage and irritation [15]. These uremic toxins, which are normally excreted by the kidney via tubular secretion, are poorly cleared by dialysis [20\u201322]. Several investigators have reported an association between elevated levels of p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other adverse effects in adults with ESRD [23, 24].",

Mobile phase A was 0.2\u00a0% trifluoroacetic acid in Milli-Q water and mobile phase B was 0.2\u00a0% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The analytical method consisted of a run with gradient elution starting at 8\u00a0% phase B for 5\u00a0min, followed by a linear increase to 18\u00a0% in 15\u00a0min, a linear change to 100\u00a0% in 5\u00a0min, a hold for 3\u00a0min and a final linear change back to 8\u00a0% phase B in 2\u00a0min, a return to the initial condition for 10\u00a0min before next injection. Indoxyl sulfate eluted at 13.8\u00a0min, p-cresyl sulfate at 20.4\u00a0min and internal standard at 23.7\u00a0min. Column temperature was 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and autosampler tray temperature was 6\u00a0\u00b0C.

Recent studies have revealed the fundamental role of the intestinal microbiota in the maintenance of normal human physiology and homeostasis. This complex ecosystem within the gut is highly susceptible to disturbances that can alter the composition of the intestinal microbiota. We demonstrate that children and adolescents with ESRD and kidney transplant exhibit an altered intestinal microbiota. PD patients, as well as those with a kidney transplant, exhibited significantly decreased bacterial diversity (alpha diversity) compared to control. In addition, the composition of bacterial communities (beta diversity) within our PD patients was significantly different when compared to the healthy control group. Serum levels of bacterially derived uremic toxins, p-cresyl and indoxyl sulfate, were significantly increased in ESRD patients.",

In chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and inflammatory bowel disease, patients develop dysbiosis, defined as an abnormal ratio of beneficiary and aggressive bacterial species [31]. We found that patients with ESRD on PD had a decreased relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes (Fig.\u00a02a), while HD patients exhibited an increase to the phylum Bacteroidetes (Fig.\u00a02b) when compared to healthy control patients.

                    "text": "In addition to uremia, several possible mechanisms may account for the observed changes to the intestinal microbiota. Proteobacteria, also known as the iron oxidizing bacteria, are typically present in small amounts in the healthy adult intestinal microbiota [33]. However, our results demonstrate that Proteobacteria were increased in patients on PD (Fig.\u00a02c) when compared to HD patients. This may be due to the oral iron supplementation received by PD patients. Although both ESRD groups receive iron supplementation, the route of delivery differs for the two dialysis modalities. Whereas HD patients receive iron supplementation directly into the bloodstream, PD patients ingest iron supplements. The interaction of orally ingested iron with gut microbes able to metabolize this mineral may account for the increased Proteobacteria levels. Further, Enterobacteriaceae, a family belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria, exhibited a significant increase in abundance among PD patients compared to control patients (Fig.\u00a05a). The Enterobacteriaceae are known to ferment glucose and account for up to 12\u00a0% of all peritonitis episodes in patients with ESRD treated with PD [34]. We speculate that the observed increase in Enterobacteriaceae in PD patients may be due to intestinal absorption of glucose from the dialysate. This increase in Enterobacteriaceae may contribute to peritonitis infections observed in PD patients. Future studies are needed to better evaluate these findings.",

Conversely, Wu et al. demonstrated that increased Actinobacteria was associated with a healthy gut microbiome in children [35]. Bifidobacterium, a family belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria, also exhibited a decreased abundance in PD and kidney transplant patients (Fig.\u00a05c). These organisms might be responsible for a variety of beneficial health effects, including the regulation of intestinal microbial homeostasis and the inhibition of harmful bacteria that colonize or infect the gut mucosa [36]. Bifidobacterium improve the gut mucosal barrier and lower levels of lipopolysaccharide in the intestine [37]. Alterations in the integrity of the intestinal mucosa facilitate the translocation of bacterially derived toxins.",

This suggests an association between loss of bacterial diversity and disease severity. There was a significant decrease in the number of species (alpha diversity) in our patients on PD and with a kidney transplant, when compared to patients on HD and controls using both phylogenetic (Fig.\u00a03a) and non-phylogenetic diversity measures (Fig.\u00a03b). In future studies, we will address the question of whether the observed alpha diversity in children with ESRD affects the severity or rate of complications. Results of the beta diversity analysis, illustrated by PCoA plot (Fig.\u00a04), showed a significant difference in UniFrac distances between ESRD on PD and control microbial communities. Our results represent an initial insight into the intestinal microbiome patterns in ESRD, which would need to be confirmed in larger cohorts.",

Previous studies found that the high protein binding affinity of both bacterially derived uremic toxins markedly limits their removal by dialysis, even with the use of high-flux membranes [43]. Serum levels of p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate seem to correlate with loss of residual renal function [44]. Recent animal studies, demonstrated that p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate are excreted by renal tubular secretion via organic anion transporters [45]. Similar to adult studies, we found significantly increased levels of p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate in our pediatric patients with ESRD. Kidney transplantation results in normalization of serum indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, despite decreased bacterial diversity. These findings suggest that renal clearance via tubular secretion is of paramount importance for maintaining normal serum levels of both toxins. Accumulation of these uremic toxins is considered one of the possible causes of chronic inflammation in patients with ESRD.",

Patients with ESRD have a high prevalence of micro-inflammation [46\u201349]. In recent years, several studies have tried to elucidate the etiology for this inflammatory state. The relative roles of residual renal function, dialysis modality, bacterial translocation, intestinal microbiota and the accumulation of endotoxins such as p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate in causing the inflammatory milieu of CKD remains unclear. In our study, we assessed inflammation by measuring serum CRP, but did not observe a statistical difference between our groups of patients. There was a trend toward higher serum CRP levels in the patients with ESRD; however, the lack of statistical significance may have been due to the high variation and small sample sizes. Furthermore, we discovered that several of our control patients were overweight or obese, which is a confounding factor for inflammatory markers. Visser et al. demonstrated that higher BMI was associated with increased CRP levels [50].",

This \u201cleaky gut\u201d may allow the passage of endotoxins and bacterial metabolites into the systemic circulation contributing to systemic microinflammation [8, 9]. For this study, serum D-lactate was used as an indirect marker of intestinal permeability. There were no significant differences observed between the groups. Although a previous study reports elevated plasma D-lactate levels in ESRD patients, this observation was only seen in conjunction with the presence of bacterial DNA in blood samples [9]. Our study of serum D-lactate level does not include simultaneous analysis of bacterial DNA in blood samples. This suggests that D-lactate alone may not independently indicate the level of intestinal permeability in ESRD patients.",
