Currently, healthcare providers cannot offer comprehensive vaginal microbiome screening, but are limited to the detection of individual pathogens, such as high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), the predominant cause of cervical cancer. There is no single test on the market that combines HPV, STI, and microbiome screening. Here, we describe a novel inclusive vaginal health assay that combines self-sampling with sequencing-based HPV detection and genotyping, vaginal microbiome analysis, and STI-associated pathogen detection. The assay includes genotyping and detection of 14 hrHPV types, 5 low-risk HPV types (lrHPV), as well as the relative abundance of 31 bacterial taxa of clinical importance, including Lactobacillus, Sneathia, Gardnerella, and 3 pathogens involved in STI, with high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. For each of these taxa, reference ranges were determined in a group of 50 self-reported healthy women. The HPV sequencing portion of the test was evaluated against the digene High-Risk HPV HC2 DNA test. For hrHPV genotyping, agreement was 95.3% with a kappa of 0.804 (601 samples); after removal of samples in which the digene hrHPV probe showed cross-reactivity with lrHPV types, the sensitivity and specificity of the hrHPV genotyping assay were 94.5% and 96.6%, respectively, with a kappa of 0.841. For lrHPV genotyping, agreement was 93.9% with a kappa of 0.788 (148 samples), while sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 92.9%, respectively. This novel assay could be used to complement conventional cervical cancer screening, because its self-sampling format can expand access among women who would otherwise not participate, and because of its additional information about the composition of the vaginal microbiome and the presence of pathogens.",

In most healthy women, the vaginal microbiome is characterized by a low bacterial diversity and a dominance of lactobacilli, with low abundance of other bacterial genera [1,2]. Several vaginal microbial community types have been described, most of which are dominated by a single Lactobacillus species. Lactic acid produced by lactobacilli lowers the vaginal pH, which is believed to create an environment unfavorable for the growth of pathogenic bacteria [3]. Low numbers of vaginal lactobacilli have been associated with many health conditions, such as bacterial vaginosis [1,4\u20136], aerobic vaginitis [7], cervicitis [8], and STI [9\u201312]. The composition of a woman\u2019s vaginal microbiome thus plays an important role in women\u2019s health and reproductive success. Yet, the analysis of this microbial community is not part of regular health care for women. In the US, as in many other countries, most healthcare providers instead focus on the detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), the predominant cause for cervical cancer.",

Although HPV infection is the most common STI worldwide, not all HPV infections will lead to cancer. Firstly, certain HPV types have higher oncogenic risks than others. Of the over 170 different HPV genotypes known to date, twelve types have been classified as Group 1 human carcinogens; these include types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59 [17,18]. Together with other closely related HPV types, such as 66 and 68, which have been listed as probably or possibly carcinogenic, these are collectively called hrHPV types. hrHPV types 16 and 18 can be found in over 70% of cervical cancers [19] and the presence of these types is associated with the highest chance of developing cancer within 10 years [20]. However, other hrHPV genotypes have also been shown to cause cervical cancer, and especially among women of non-European descent [21]. In addition, many hrHPV infections are temporary and will be cleared within months of acquisition, without proceeding to pre-cancerous lesions [22]. Other HPV types, collectively called low-risk HPV (lrHPV), are not implicated in cervical cancer, but instead cause genital warts [23].",

In the United States, most healthcare providers follow the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines [27] or the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines for women [28] to come in for a Pap smear, often with HPV testing, every three to five years, depending on age and risk factors.

The HC2 test detects 13 hrHPV types, but does not report which specific type is present. Other HPV detection assays involve the amplification of viral DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The most widely used primer pairs for HPV PCR detection are the GP5+/6+ primers [33] and the degenerate MY09/11 primers [34] or the PGMY09/11 primer pool [35], which are all based on conserved regions in the viral L1 open reading frame.

We validated the performance of marker gene amplification and sequencing to detect the presence and relative abundance of 31 clinically important bacterial targets with high precision and accuracy. In addition to detecting Lactobacillus, Sneathia, and Gardnerella spp., this test detects STI-associated pathogens including Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which combined infect over 150 million people each year and cause genital tract infections and cervicitis [10\u201312]. The performance of a novel amplification and sequencing-based strategy for HPV detection and type-specific identification was compared to that of the most widely used test for HPV detection in cervicovaginal specimens, the digene HC2 test. This assay was not developed to be employed in a clinical setting, but intended to complement, rather than replace, current healthcare guidelines for in-clinic cervical cancer screening.",

The most relevant associations between health conditions and the vaginal microbiota were narrowed down by choosing associations with high statistical significance that were found in humans subjects, not in laboratory animals or bioreactors, but performed on case/control, cohorts or randomized studied population. These include bacterial vaginosis [1,4\u20136], aerobic vaginitis [7], pelvic inflammatory disease [44], and sexually transmitted infections [10\u201312]. A complete list of these associations and references are provided in S1 Table. For each bacterial taxon intended to be included in this assay, using a process similar to that described in Almonacid et al. [45], we determined in silico performance metrics for identification of each taxa (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value). Briefly, sequences assigned to each taxon in the SILVA database (Version 123) [46] were considered to be real positives for that taxon. Then, assuming amplification with up to two mismatches with the primers used, we identified for each taxa the sequences that would produce an amplicon, and evaluated whether that amplicon is unique to the taxon of interest (ti) or also shared by sequences from different taxa (dt). The number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) was computed for different tolerance ratios for the quotient dt/ti, and subsequently in silico performance metrics were assessed. Of the 72 bacterial targets initially selected, the 31 targets selected for the assay had all four in silico performance metrics above 90% (S2 Fig; S2 Table).",

HPV reference genomes were downloaded in August 2017 from the PaVE database, which is a repository of curated and annotated HPV genomes [47,48]. Only revised and recognized sequences (180 HPV genomes) were used for an in silico PCR amplification using a set of 15 forward and 6 reverse primers (described below) targeting the L1 gene and allowing up to 4 mismatches between primers and target sequences. Under these conditions, the L1 genes from 118 HPV genomes could be amplified in silico. Of these, 19 HPV genomes, including 14 hrHPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68) and 5 lrHPV types (6, 11, 42, 43, 44) were selected based on their association with health conditions according to literature (S1 Table). In order to evaluate the performance metrics for identification of the HPV targets, sequences of the L1 segment of HPV genomes from the NCBI database were used. The search was filtered to sequences with length in the range 1,500\u201310,000 bp and with correct assignment of the type of the HPV (4177 sequences). These sequences were amplified in silico using the primers described below. Following these steps, we generated 161,398 amplicons. These sequences were mapped using VSEARCH [49] at 95% of identity against an HPV amplicon reference database consisting of the amplicons produced by the reference genomes in PaVE for the 19 HPV types included in our assay. The performance metrics were calculated as described above for the 16S rRNA gene targets. Briefly, the correct assignment of an in silico NCBI amplicon against the reference was counted as a true positive and an incorrect assignment was considered as a false negative. Also, we considered as a false negative any genome from NCBI that our primers could not amplify. According to this, the 19 HPV types obtained values for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) above 90% (S3 Table).",

The LOB was set as the average number of reads in these blank wells (18.57 reads) plus 1.65 standard deviations (29.70 reads), thus at 48.27 reads. To calculate the LOD of the bacterial target, pools of bacterial sDNAs were mixed in different ratios. To create these mixes, each bacterial sDNA was randomly assigned to one of two pools, A and B, that each contained sDNAs in equimolar amount. Each pool was serially diluted in PCR grade water. Pool A dilutions were mixed 1:1 with undiluted Pool B and vice versa. All pool A/B combinations were used in triplicate for DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing as described below. For each target, the LOD was defined as the lowest concentration of sDNA where at least two of the three replicates contained at least 2 reads for that target in a sample with 10,000 reads or more. Using this LOD, we calculated a lower threshold for detection for each taxa at its LOD as the LOB (48.27) plus the standard deviation of the taxa at LOD * 1.65. This threshold is used to correctly assign a taxa as identified in a sample at or above its LOD.",

This also means that the spiked-in internal control and the target HPV have different amplification efficiencies. To avoid this bias, the internal control (which has the primer sites for HPV16) is normalized for the amplification factor (number of primer combinations that generate an amplicon) of each HPV type. The number of HPV-assigned reads was divided by the total number of normalized reads assigned to the spike, and a sample was considered HPV-positive if that ratio was above 0.1, which corresponds to approximately 500 target molecules.",

The vaginal health test described here detects all these types plus hrHPV type 66. The digene HC2 assay is intended to be used directly on cervical samples collected in the digene STM transport tube. In order to validate the use of the digene kit on extracted vaginal DNA, we first compared the performance of the digene HC2 assay on a set of 87 self-sampled, paired vaginal samples, i.e. a digene brush resuspended in an STM transport tube, as well as DNA extracted from a vaginal swab resuspended in lysis and stabilization buffer according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Negative and positive controls and calibrators included in the kit were processed within each 96-well assay, and used for assay validation and cutoff, as per instructions. A specimen was considered positive if its chemiluminescence measurement (Relative Light Units, RLU) was higher than or equal to that of the assay\u2019s Positive Calibrator cutoff (RLU ratio of 1 or more), as specified in the digene HC2 assay instructions.",

For each bacterial target, the LOD was determined by combining different dilutions of pools of sDNAs, followed by DNA extraction, amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using broad-range primers, and sequencing (Fig 2A). The LOB was set as the average number of reads in 77 blank wells (18.57 reads) plus 1.65 standard deviations (29.70 reads). Using this value, we calculated the threshold of identification for each taxon as the LOB + 1.65 standard deviations (48.27) plus the standard deviation of the taxon at LOD * 1.65.

Unexpectedly, three samples that were positive by sequencing for hrHPV 66, which is not covered by the digene hrHPV probe, were still positive in the digene assay. Ten digene-positive samples did not yield any validated hrHPV reads after amplification and sequencing by our assay. Of these ten false negatives, six samples were found to contain single or mixed non-high risk HPV strains by genotyping, including HPV 30, 61, 40, 42, 53, and 67. In addition, eighteen samples were negative in the digene HC2 hrHPV assay but yielded sufficient hrHPV reads (of types 16, 31, 35, 51, 52, 56, 59, and 68b) to be identified as positives by our genotyping assay.

After removal of the six samples where cross-reactivity of the digene hrHPV probe with lrHPV sequences was suspected, the sensitivity and specificity of the hrHPV genotyping assay were 94.5% and 96.6%, respectively, with a kappa of 0.841 \u00b1 0.065.",

Although the sensitivity of probe hybridization-based hrHPV detection, such as the digene HC2 assay, in self-obtained vaginal swabs has been found to be slightly lower than that in clinician-obtained cervical specimens, hrHPV detection based on PCR was shown to be equally sensitive in self-sampled specimens [31]. While the vaginal health assay described in this study is not intended to replace regular cervical cancer screening programs, offering women the opportunity to self-collect vaginal specimens poses fewer barriers for women to be screened, and thus could lead to increased participation rates [59,60]. Therefore, allowing self-collection of vaginal samples for hrHPV screening in parallel to regular screening programs, as already implemented in numerous countries, and recommending women to seek further physician examination in case of a positive result may have a positive impact on rates of detection of cervical cancer, and potentially save lives [58].",

Several other HPV genotyping assays based on PCR and sequencing have been reported [30, 61\u201365]. These studies detected HPV types not found by traditional methods [62], as well as infections with multiple types [63\u201365] with high sensitivity. As recommended by the VALGENT study framework [66], we compared the performance of the HPV component of the test to that of the widely used digene HC2 HPV assay. Because the novel test reported here is performed on extracted DNA, we first validated the use of the digene assay on extracted DNA. The digene performance on the extracted DNA was slightly less sensitive than that directly performed on the digene STM tubes. The digene HC2 assay has been found to give discordant results in about 8% of paired tests [67,68], where, for example, a positive sample will test negative at retesting, most often in samples with a low RLU ratio in the positive test. A cutoff ratio of 2 or 3 instead of 1 has been proposed to serve as a better indicator for reproducible positive results [67\u201370]. In our study, all specimens with RLU ratios of 2 or higher in the direct digene HC2 test on STM tubes were also correctly identified as positive when the test was performed on extracted DNA, suggesting that the digene assay can be applied to extracted DNA as well.",

The hrHPV genotyping assay showed good correlation with the digene assay, with a sensitivity and specificity of 87.3% and 96.6%, respectively, and a Cohen\u2019s kappa of 0.804. Three samples containing hrHPV type 66 were found to be positive in both tests, even though they are supposedly not covered by the digene assay. Among a set of ten samples that were reported positive by the hrHPV digene assay but that did not contain hrHPV sequences as determined by our assay, six samples were found to contain single or mixed lrHPV types, including HPV 30, 61, 40, 42, 53, and 67. Cross-reactivity of the digene HC2 hrHPV probe mix with lrHPV sequences has been demonstrated by several others [69,71\u201374]. Thus, even though these samples had to be classified as false-negative because the digene HC2 HPV assay was taken as the gold standard, it is likely they were actually false-positives in the digene test. Removing these six samples from the comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of the hrHPV genotyping assay were 94.5% and 96.6%, respectively, with a kappa of 0.841 \u00b1 0.065. The lrHPV genotyping assay had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92.9%, with a Cohen\u2019s kappa of 0.788. In addition, the two tests were in good general agreement about the relative amount of HPV molecules detected. The specific genotyping of HPV by sequencing therefore can detect the presence of lrHPV that are known to give false-positive results in conventional clinical hrHPV tests. In addition, HPV genotyping provides clinicians and patients with more detailed information about which strain(s) are present in the vagina, allowing for more precise tracking of infection and clearance than most conventional assays [30].",

The vaginal health assay described here detects the relative abundance of bacteria positively associated with bacterial vaginosis, such as Sneathia or Gardnerella species, as well as those negatively associated with that condition such as Lactobacillus species. In addition, it detects the presence of three common STI-associated pathogens, i.e., C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and M. genitalium. Of these, M. genitalium has been recently recognized as an important pathogen implicated in pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility [12,78]. Although some early diagnostic tests have been described [79,80], very few clinicians test for its presence. Furthermore, the vaginal microbiota composition has been reported to be associated with the progression of HPV infection, from early states to cervical cancer [37,40]. Vaginal microbiome analysis therefore not only can be used to detect STI-associated pathogens and bacteria involved in bacterial vaginosis, but also to assess a woman\u2019s microbiome similarity to the microbiome of a group of individuals with progressed HPV infection. This brings about the opportunity to leverage microbiome information to understand HPV infection progression and women's susceptibility to cancer development. Future versions of this assay could also include additional microorganisms associated with pathogenic outcomes such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealithicum.",

We envision that this test has the potential to provide clinicians and patients with a more comprehensive understanding of the vaginal microbiome, and to encourage women to take an active role in related conversations with their doctors. We also hope that by improving accessibility through self-sampling, we may encourage more women to engage with current screening and treatment guidelines for vaginal pathogens and cervical cancer.",

The target performance are plotted as follows: specificity = TN / (TN + FP); sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN); positive predictive value (PPV) = TP / (TP + FP); and negative predictive value (NPV) = TN / (TN + FN). Based on a cutoff of 90% (red vertical line), 31/72 preliminary targets passed for each of the parameters, resulting in the accurate in silico detection of 16 bacterial species (light purple), and 15 bacterial genera (dark purple).",
