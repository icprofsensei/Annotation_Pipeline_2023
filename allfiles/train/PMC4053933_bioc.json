A small number of contigs share similarity with known integrative and conjugative elements, providing the first examples of CRISPR defenses against this class of element. We provide detailed analyses of a few large mobile genetic elements of various types, and a relative abundance analysis of mobile genetic elements and putative hosts, exploring the dynamic activities of mobile genetic elements in human microbiomes. A joint analysis of mobile genetic elements and CRISPRs shows that protospacer-adjacent motifs drive their interaction network; however, some CRISPR-Cas systems target mobile genetic elements lacking motifs.",

Horizontal transfer of MGEs is a key driving force in bacterial evolution, allowing bacteria to rapidly develop new traits. Many human pathogens acquire strain-specific properties and functions through foreign DNAs delivered by bacteriophages and plasmids - important factors in the spread of antibiotic resistance [1-4]. Another class of MGEs is integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), bacterial MGEs that primarily reside in the host cell's chromosome, yet have the ability to transfer between cells by conjugation. But unlike plasmids, ICEs cannot be maintained in an extrachromosomal state because they cannot replicate autonomously, although this is still under investigation [5]. There are also genomic islands, a more general term for any cluster of genes in bacterial genomes acquired from horizontal transfers; an island can be a 'pathogenicity island' or a 'metabolic island' - among others - according to the functions of its genes [6,7].",

Bacterial innate immunity is achieved by adsorption-blocking, methylation-restriction systems, and production of extracellular matrix, among other mechanisms [8], whereas adaptive immunity systems acquire invasive DNAs and use them for interference against further invasion of matching foreign DNA molecules. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins systems are an RNA-guided adaptive immunity system that provides sequence-directed defense against MGEs [8-14]. CRISPR-Cas systems are found in most archaeal and some bacterial genomes [9,15] (see a list of the genomes at the CRISPRdb website [16]). Recently, a bacterial type II CRISPR-Cas system (which uses cas9) has been engineered to achieve guided genome engineering in human cells [17,18], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [19] and Zebrafish embryos [20], and to achieve selective repression of gene expression in Escherichia coli (by using a catalytically dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity) [21].",

To affect interference, these arrays are transcribed as precursor RNAs, and subsequently truncated to short CRISPR RNAs by Cas proteins encoded next to the CRISPR array, and used to guide subsequent attacks at the protospacers on matching invaders [22,23]. A consequence of the constant arms race between bacteria and invading DNA sequences (via CRISPR-Cas systems) is the rapid turnover of the spacers in CRISPR arrays. For example, an analysis of the streptococcal CRISPRs from human saliva, in which CRISPR spacers and repeats were amplified from salivary DNA - using the conserved streptococcal CRISPR repeat sequence for priming - revealed substantial spacer sequence diversity within and between subjects over time [24].",

Considering that viruses are the most abundant organisms on earth, our understanding of viral diversity, functions and interactions is still very limited, and understanding the interactions between bacterial hosts and viruses is an essential step toward understanding bacterial ecology. As a practical application, the warfare between bacteriophage and host via CRISPR defense systems in dairy fermentation processes has been extensively studied (for example, Streptococcus thermophiles, which utilizes CRISPRs to defend against its active invaders, S. thermophiles bacteriophages [10,23]).",

Palmer and Gilmore identified matches between CRISPR spacers found in 16 Enterococcus faecalis draft genome sequences and sequences from mobile elements, including pheromone-responsive plasmids and phage, and found a highly significant inverse correlation between the presence of a CRISPR locus and acquired antibiotic resistance in E. faecalis, suggesting that antibiotic use inadvertently selects for enterococcal strains with compromised genome defense and an increased ability to acquire drug-resistance-encoding plasmids [4].",

Most metagenomic studies [29-31] focus on only one side of the story: either the bacteria or the MGEs. Sequencing of viral-like particles enriched from fecal samples obtained from healthy adult female monozygotic twins (co-twins) and their mothers revealed high inter-personal diversity even among co-twins and their mothers, whereas temporal intra-personal variation in viromes is very low [32]. Similarly, pyrosequencing of virus-enriched metagenomes isolated from bovine rumen fluid has identified up to 28,000 different viral genotypes, revealing a high viral diversity in the rumen microbiome [30]. Combined analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems and viruses can be more revealing. For example, Pride et al. [33] compared their collection of streptococcal CRISPR sequences (derived by a targeted sequencing approach [24]) with virome reads in the saliva of four human volunters over 17 months, and observed co-existence of spacers and viruses, suggesting that streptococcal CRISPR-Cas systems are under constant pressure from salivary viruses.",

This study has allowed us to identify novel MGEs that are involved in CRISPR-Cas systems and characterize their properties. Our discovery of MGEs is leveraged on our previous systematic annotation of CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays by targeted assembly, which first pools reads that contain repeats and then assembles the pooled reads into CRISPR arrays with repeat-spacer units [37]. We analyzed all the non-redundant candidate MGEs targeted by multiple spacers. Analysis of these MGEs demonstrates that the CRISPR-Cas defense systems target not only phage, but also other types of MGEs, including plasmids, genomic islands and ICEs. Notably, we report the first CRISPR-Cas systems targeting ICEs; a previous study [3] showed that a CRISPR system inhibits prophage acquisition in Streptococcus pyogenes, but in spite of the presence of 12 ICEs distributed in 13 sequenced S. pyogenes strains, no spacers were found that were acquired from these ICEs. A joint analysis of the CRISPR arrays and MGEs allows us to study the interaction patterns between the bacterial CRISPR systems and invaders. We observed that protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) drive the resistance network between MGEs and CRISPR systems, with exceptions - some CRISPR systems target MGEs lacking the classical PAM sequences or any other conserved motif.",

We note that these numbers are conservative estimates, as we applied stringent criteria in defining putative MGEs (for example, we required that a candidate MGE contig contain at least three protospacers, since some CRISPR-Cas systems contain self-targeting spacers [39]; by contrast, Stern et al. only required a contig to contain one protospacer [34]), and generous criteria in eliminating redundancy (see Methods for details). We also prepared a smaller collection of MGEs (referred to as MGE_sel) with 959 large MGE segments (of at least 5 kbp), each segment containing at least 40 protospacers.

In total there are 253 contigs longer than 100 kbp; by contrast, a majority of phages have genomes smaller than 100 kbp and average 40 kbp (see Figure S2 in Additional file 1). The actual MGEs may in some cases be shorter, as contigs can contain parts of the flanking bacterial genomes, but there are still four MGE segments with dense protospacers (see Methods) covering more than 100 kbp, including: SRS050669_LANL_scaffold_47865 containing 250 protospacers between 855 and 159,934 bp; SRS022530_LANL_scaffold_21325 with 194 protospacers between 2,493 and 123,573 bp; SRS062761_LANL_scaffold_30103 with 256 protospacers between 216 and 118,723 bp; and SRS051791_LANL_scaffold_3222 with 61 protospacers between 3,062 and 116,815 bp (Figure S1 in Additional file 1 shows the histogram of the segment sizes). As the HMP datasets contain longer reads than the MetaHit datasets, we were able to identify longer MGEs than the MGEs discovered in [34]. For example, three phages identified from MetaHit contigs (scaffold53395_2_MH0022, scaffold54386_1_MH0053 and scaffold4504_1_O2.UC-4) [34] match a single MGE contig we identified in a stool sample (SRS014459_WUGC_scaffold_93237 of 34,292 bp) with >99.5% sequence identity. These three MetaHit contigs have significantly non-overlapping regions (and they match to 67 to 11,764, 2,678 to 24,468, and 16,706 to 33,639 bp, respectively, in the HMP contig), and therefore were treated as three different phages in [34]. This comparison indicates that we will be able to refine our discovery of novel phages (and other MGEs) as better metagenome assemblies become available - for example, due to the use of longer reads.",

Since the MGE_sel set includes very few MGEs prevalent in stool samples, we examined a set of 155 MGE segments selected from stool samples, each containing at least 10 (instead of 40) protospacers and found that the general observation holds - some MGEs are prevalent while others are sparsely distributed (see Figure \u200bFigure1B).1B). Figure \u200bFigure11 also shows that MGEs are largely body site-specific: MGEs are prevalent either in oral sites, or in stool samples, but not in both. Although different oral sub-sites tend to share MGEs (for example, the prevalence profiles of MGEs across buccal mucosa and supragingival plaque samples are highly correlated, with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.61; P <2.2e-16), we observed MGEs with oral sub-site preference. Examples include MGE contig SRS064423_LANL_scaffold_55363, which is widely distributed in tongue dorsum (108 samples) and supragingival plaque samples (67), but only in 7 buccal mucosa samples; SRS016002_WUGC_scaffold_521 found in most tongue dorsum datasets (118), but only in a few buccal mucosa (3) and supragingival plaque (3) samples; and SRS016575_Baylor_scaffold_2114 found mostly in supragingival plaque samples (113).",

Consistent with previous results, the most abundant known functions are related with replication, recombination and repair; and the second most abundant functions are related with transcription (see the functional distribution in Figure S3 in Additional file 1). We also summarized the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of the genes (downloaded from the DACC website) [42], and analyzed the GO terms enriched or depleted in these MGE contigs, using binomial tests with a Bonferroni multiple testing correction. Not surprisingly, GO:0006260 (DNA replication), GO:0000746 (conjugation), GO:0042742 (defense response to bacterium) and GO:0005198 (structural molecule activity, associated with viral structural proteins) are among the 76 GO terms that appear significantly enriched among the annotations associated with MGEs. Example GO terms that are significantly depleted include GO:0042626 (ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of substances), GO:0016491 (oxidoreductase activity) and GO:0046872 (metal ion binding). Additional file 2 lists significantly enriched (73) or depleted (76) GO terms. We also checked specific functions, including bacterial restriction-modification systems. Among the 10,664 proteins, 141 proteins show similarity to proteins that are annotated as associated with bacterial restriction-modification systems (types I, II, and III) (see Additional file 3 for a list of these proteins).

In total nine protospacers were identified in this contig, spanning almost the entire length (373,639 bp between 6,172 and 379,810). Similarity searches against reference genomes show that this contig is similar to a region in the Haemophilus parainfluenzae T3T1 genome (NC_015964.1) with a sequence identity of 92.7%. No phage- or plasmid-specific genes are found in the contig through similarity searches against the nr database by BLAST. However, searches against the ACLAME database show that this contig contains many plasmid-related genes, suggesting this MGE is an integrated plasmid associated with the H. parainfluenzae species. This is an extremely long MGE with 371 protein-coding genes (within the region bounded by the protospacers in the contig), considering that the longest known bacterial phage genome is 316,674 bp and most plasmid genomes are shorter than 50 kbp (see Figure S2 in Additional file 1 for the length distributions of phages and plasmid genomes).",

Similarity searches show that this contig contains a gene (located between 208,333 and 208,851 bp) encoding T4 lysozyme, indicating that it is a T4-like phage; but it does not share overall similarity with known T4-like phage genomes and known T4-like phages have smaller genomes (for example, Enterobacterial phage T4 has a genome of 168,903bp). There is a Ser-tRNA gene at the end of the contig between 275,367 and 275,280 bp, suggesting that this contig represents a prophage, inserted into its host's genome at a tRNA gene (a typical prophage insertion site). This contig contains a large number of protein-coding genes: 241 genes (based on FragGeneScan [43] prediction) for the entire contig, or 240 genes in the region with protospacers. These genes encode proteins of various functions. For example, a cluster of three genes (gene locations are 73,86 to 74,986 bp, 74,999 to 75,904 bp, and 76,005 to 76,973 bp) encodes proteins with activities involving Fe-S, including Fe-S oxidoreductase (COG0641 and COG0535).",

This contig is 101,291 bp. The MGE region in this contig is similar to the H. parainfluenzae T3T2 genome, whereas the two flanking ends are more similar (with sequence identity of 97%) to another H. parainfluenzae strain (H. parainfluenzae ATCC 33392), which apparently does not contain a similar MGE region, so that the two flanks are immediately adjacent in strain 33392. Similar to the genome of H. parainfluenzae T3T2, this contig is a mosaic genomic island, featuring two elements: one is a prophage (the prophage regions predicted by Prophage Finder and PHAST (see Methods) are shown in Figure \u200bFigure2),2), and the other is similar to ICEhin1056, an ICE found in H. influenzae. However, the two elements are assembled in the genomic island in a different order - there is a crossover of the similarities between the genomic islands in the contig and in the reference H. parainfluenzae T3T2 (see Figure \u200bFigure2).2). There are 201 protospacers spanning the two elements, indicating that they form a continuous MGE element (that is, a genomic island) in this contig. This example also illustrates that analysis based on protospacers can be employed to improve the annotation of genomic islands in complete genomes. Our analysis suggests that the actual genomic island in the genome of H. parainfluenzae T3T2 is larger than predictions by various programs, including IslandViewer [44], IslandPick [45], SIGI-HMM [46] and IslandPath-DIMOB [47]. We used IslandViewer server [48] for all the predictions of genomic island.",

The comparison of TnGBS1 and TnGBS2 (another ICE found in S. agalactiae NEM316) shows that they encode only five homologous proteins, including the putative transposases, and three putative surface-exposed LPxTG proteins similar to surface exclusion proteins [49]. The contig we found in SRS024447 (a supragingival plaque sample) shares 70% overall sequence similarity with the TnGBS1 found in strain NEM316, with a putative transposase gene (SRS024447.55152, located between 419 and 1,756 bp, sharing 66% sequence identity at the protein level with Gbs0410), and two genes (SRS024447.55167 located between 15,889 and 18,108 bp, and SRS024447.55168 located between 18,179 and 18,847 bp) that encode putative LPxTG proteins.",

Combing the differential distributions of the protospacers along this contig and the PHAST [50] prediction of prophages, we predict that there are three MGEs of different invasion histories in this region of the bacterial genome (Figure \u200b(Figure3A).3A). Two MGEs are likely phages: one is similar to phage Entero SfV (based on PHAST prediction, and has the most protospacers (99 in total) as compared to the other two MGE regions); the other phage, which has only one protospacer, is similar to phage Entero phiP27. Another region (termed MGE_UNK, highlighted in the red box in Figure \u200bFigure3A)3A) with six protospacers is likely to be a third MGE captured in this contig. Similarity searches show that this contig is similar to H. parainfluenzae T3T1, with a sequence identity of 93% covering almost the entire contig - excluding the MGE region similar to phage Entero SfV - suggesting that the MGE region annotated as phage Entero SfV is a more recent capture into this genome, close to a pre-existing MGE. This is further confirmed by abundance analysis of the three MGEs in human microbiomes: Figure \u200bFigure3B3B shows that the MGE of phage Entero SfV only co-occurs with the host bacterial genome (whose abundance was estimated using a large region between 91,271 and 204,149 bp in the contig that lacks any protospacers) in a few samples, indicating that in these samples, the MGE is integrated into the bacterial host. By contrast, the distribution of MGE_UNK is similar to the distribution of the bacterial host in all samples, indicating that this region has become part of the bacterial genome without active deletions.",

Our analyses show that, while most CRISPR types target multiple MGEs (unsurprising), there are also many cases where the same MGE is independently targeted by distinct CRISPR types. Figure \u200bFigure55 shows that the same CRISPR type utilizes similar PAMs when attacking various MGEs, whereas different CRISPRs attacking the same MGE acquire quite different spacers. For example, protospacers from SRS045715_LANL_scaffold_60513 are incorporated into arrays of three CRISPR types, utilizing two distinct PAMs (TGA for Fuso_sp7-1_L30, and T/AGG for FnuclL30 and FperiL30; see Figure \u200bFigure55).",

The MGE SRS022530_LANL_scaffold_21325 (a contig assembled from a tongue dorsum microbiome dataset) contains 251 protospacers, of which most (244) match spacers found in arrays of this particular CRISPR. For example, a protospacer located between 71,924 and 71,963 bp in the contig is identical to a spacer found in a large CRISPR array with 78 repeat-spacer units, which was assembled from another tongue dorsum microbiome dataset (SRS016319) by the targeted assembly approach [37]. But we could not detect any conserved short motif by aligning the adjacent regions of the 244 protospacers. Further, we were unable to detect any significant sequence motifs in either upstream or downstream adjacent regions using MEME (see Methods), a de novo motif detection tool that works independent of alignment. Another example is MGE SRS011243_Baylor_scaffold_6145.

Many computational approaches have been developed to detect MGEs, using nucleotide composition differences between the MGEs and the host genomes [55] or comparative genomics approaches [56]. A limitation of the composition-based approaches is that nucleotide composition has large variation and it is not always sufficient for detecting alien genes (as shown in the various predictions of the genomic island in the H. parainfluenzae T3T1 genome; see Figure \u200bFigure2),2), while comparative genomics approaches rely on the availability of genomes. Discovery of MGEs via CRISPR-Cas systems provides an unbiased catalog of MGEs, independent of known homology and sequence composition biases - as evidenced by the extremely diverse collection we provide in this work. The traces of CRISPR-Cas defenses (the spacers) provide complementary information to sequence information (homology and composition), and we expect that a new breed of approaches will combine all this information to improve the annotation of alien regions and therefore of bacterial genomes.",

The first is that majority of the identified MGEs are not identified as phage, plasmids or ICEs, and so their mechanism of mobility is unknown. Second, MGEs carry genes that encode diverse functions, and a majority still have unknown functions. The third challenging problem is to discover possible mechanisms for those CRISPR-Cas systems that seem to not rely on the recognition of PAMs for spacer acquisition. A fourth problem is to identify the bacterial hosts of the MGEs - this task is difficult due to the fast mutation rates of MGEs and the high turnover rate of the spacers in CRISPR arrays. Attempts have been made - including our approach that uses contigs containing regions with protospacers (that is, integrated MGEs) and regions of flanking bacterial genomes (so both players were caught in the same contig), and a method that relies on spacer matching [34]; however, only a small proportion of the MGEs (or viruses) have had their putative bacterial hosts identified.",

Considering that this strategy may miss the motifs when the boundaries of the protospacers are not exactly defined, we also applied MEME to de novo detect the motifs in the adjacent regions. We cannot exclude completely the possibility that a PAM was not detected because mutations have occurred in many of the adjacent regions of protospacers, but given the large number of protospacers we could compare, we feel this is unlikely.

Analysis of these MGEs demonstrates that the CRISPR defense systems target not only phage but also other types of MGEs, including plasmids, ICEs and genomic islands. A joint analysis of the CRISPR arrays and MGEs allows us to study the interaction patterns between the bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems and invaders. PAMs largely determine the resistance network: the same CRISPR type favors similar PAMs when attacking various MGEs, whereas different CRISPRs attacking the same MGE acquire quite different spacers. However, we observed that some CRISPR types target MGEs lacking classical PAM sequences or any other conserved motif, suggesting that the CRISPR resistance network might be more complex than it appears. We believe that this collection of MGEs will be a valuable resource to studies of the impacts of MGEs on microbial communities [58], and the arms race between bacteria and invasive DNAs (of various kinds).",

For the COG families, we downloaded all protein sequences from the eggNOG v2.0 database [66] and retrieved the sequences with COG annotation [67]. MUSCLE [68] was used to generate a multiple alignment for each COG family, and the HMM builder from the HMMER3 package [69] was then applied to build a HMM for each COG. We built the HMMs of ACLAME families using a similar approach. For similarity searches against protein sequences (the nr database), we used RAPSearch2 [70] with an E-value cutoff of 0.001, and descriptions of the sequences are extracted to infer the functions of the query proteins. We used a keywords-based approach, and considered keywords 'phage', 'holin', 'tail', 'head' and 'capsid' for phage-related functions and 'plasmid', 'partition' and 'conjugative transfer' for plasmid-related functions. HMMER searches (by hmmscan from the HMMER3 package) were used to annotate the predicted proteins against protein families (PFAM, ACLAME and COG), with an E-value cutoff of 0.01.",
