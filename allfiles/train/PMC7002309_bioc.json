We aimed to determine the relationship between oral and gut microbiome diversity and chronic systemic inflammation in ART-treated PLWH with prevalent severe periodontitis, an inflammatory condition commonly associated with HIV infection. We assessed bacterial and fungal communities at oral and gastrointestinal sites in a cohort (n\u2009=\u200952) of primarily postmenopausal women on ART using 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and measured cellular and soluble markers of inflammation and immune dysfunction. Linear mixed-effect regression and differential abundance analyses were used to associate clinical characteristics and immunological markers with bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Bacterial \u03b1-diversity in plaque, saliva, and gut was associated with different immunological markers, while mycobial diversity was not associated with soluble or cellular biomarkers of immune stimulation or T cell dysfunction. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-positive (LPS+) bacteria previously linked to inflammatory outcomes were enriched at oral sites in patients with severe periodontitis. Fungal \u03b1-diversity was reduced in plaque from teeth with higher clinical attachment loss, a marker of periodontitis, and in saliva and plaque from patients with a history of AIDS. Our results show that both bacterial and fungal oral microbiome communities likely play a role in chronic systemic immune activation in PLWH. Thus, interventions targeting both inflammation and the microbiome, particularly in the oral cavity, may be necessary to reduce chronic immune dysregulation in patients with HIV.",

However, despite evidence of a chronic inflammatory phenotype in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the role of oral microbiota in systemic immune activation and the relationship between oral and gut bacterial and fungal diversity have not been explored. Our study suggests a crucial role for oral bacterial and fungal communities in long-term systemic immune activation in patients on ART, expanding the current paradigm focused on gut bacteria. Our results indicate that interventions targeting both inflammation and microbial diversity are needed to mitigate oral inflammation-related comorbidities, particularly in HIV-positive patients. More broadly, these findings can bolster general models of microbiome-mediated chronic systemic immune activation and aid the development of precise microbiota-targeted interventions to reverse chronic inflammation.",

Due to the link between dysbiosis and microbial translocation (3, 8, 9), a potential causal relationship between immune dysfunction and dysbiotic gut microbiota among PLWH has been proposed (10, 11). Given the increased incidence of gingival inflammation and periodontitis in PLWH (12) and potential deleterious effects of HIV proteins on oral mucosal epithelial tight junctions (13) and keratinocytes (14), HIV infection likely also increases oral microbial translocation. Others have reported associations between oral microbiota and systemic inflammation (15, 16), though the relationship between oral microbiota and immune dysregulation has not been extensively studied in the context of HIV.",

Long after infection with HIV, reactivation of latent viral cells in gingival and intestinal mucosa can induce immune cell activation and trigger release of proinflammatory cytokines (17). Antiretroviral agents themselves can increase oral microbial translocation due to inhibition of epithelial cell repair (18) and proliferation (19). Furthermore, immune reconstitution through ART may result in long-term negative impacts on oral T cells and higher expression of inflammatory cytokines in both saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) (20,\u201325). Targeted study of the interplay between microbial community structure and chronic immune system activation, though, has mainly focused on untreated chronic HIV infection (8, 11, 26, 27), and only recently on PLWH on ART (28). Moreover, the oral mycobiome is emerging as a potentially important factor in periodontitis (29, 30).",

Therefore, we included clinic visit as an independent variable in subsequent bacterial linear mixed-effect models associating saliva and stool microbial diversity with clinical characteristics of the cohort. Fungal Shannon \u03b1-diversity in saliva did not differ by visit (P = 0.15), though saliva Chao fungal diversity was significantly lower upon follow-up (P = 0.01) (Table\u00a0S2). Age and race (black versus other/unknown) did not have a significant impact on bacterial \u03b1-diversity, though plaque samples from black patients tended to have higher Shannon diversity (P = 0.08) (Table\u00a0S3). Fungal plaque Shannon diversity, on the other hand, was significantly lower in patients who were black compared to all others (P = 0.05) (Table\u00a0S4). Males had higher fungal diversity in saliva (P = 0.07; Table\u00a0S4), though bacterial \u03b1-diversity did not differ significantly by sex at any site (Table\u00a0S3). Menopausal status did not significantly affect bacterial (Table\u00a0S3) or fungal (Table\u00a0S4) diversity, although this comparison was likely not adequately powered (five premenopausal women; Tables S1 and S2). Morbidly obese patients had significantly lower saliva Shannon diversity compared to patients with normal body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.02; Table\u00a0S3).",

In contrast, the use of an ART regimen including an INSTI and NRTI compared to a NRTI+NNRTI regimen, was associated with significantly higher gut diversity (P = 0.03). More generally, patients taking INSTIs had higher gut bacterial diversity than those not on INSTIs (P = 0.06). Current CD4 levels were above 200 cells/\u03bcl in all patients despite different lengths of ART; however, patients with a CD4 nadir below 100 cells/\u03bcl tended to have decreased gut bacterial \u03b1-diversity compared to those who never had CD4 levels below 200 cells/\u03bcl (P = 0.08) (Table\u00a0S3). Current and nadir CD4 values were not significantly associated with bacterial \u03b1-diversity at oral sites. Mycobial \u03b1-diversity did not significantly differ by ART regimen or by CD4 nadir levels (Table\u00a0S4).

Clinical attachment loss (CAL) is one of the standard measurements of periodontal disease severity, and it is included in the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions of periodontal disease classifications. CAL, typically reported in millimeters, is indicative of the loss of gingival support at the measured site (tooth) and is calculated as the gingival pocket probing depth plus the distance of gingival recession or minus the distance of gingival overgrowth around the tooth. CAL values of 4 and 6\u2009mm at two or more sites are defined as moderate and severe periodontitis, respectively. The maximum CAL/patient had a median value of 6\u2009mm (IQR, 5 to 7\u2009mm), and the mean CAL/patient was 4\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009mm (\u00b1 standard deviation). Moreover, we found a large proportion of teeth per individual with CAL \u2265 4\u2009mm (median, 71%; IQR, 40 to 99%) and a high degree of tooth loss (median, 10; IQR, 6 to 17).",

Furthermore, bacterial \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity in saliva differed significantly with increasing periodontal disease severity. We also observed significantly lower fungal \u03b1-diversity in subgingival plaque from teeth with severe loss of tissue attachment (CAL \u2265 4\u2009mm). Additionally, several bacterial and fungal taxa were significantly enriched in patients with severe periodontitis. Of note, most of these taxa correspond to Gram-negative organisms known to harbor LPS, which has been implicated in immune system activation (34). Furthermore, the high prevalence of severe periodontitis allowed for differential abundance comparisons between severe and no periodontal disease, unlike prior reports which largely compared healthy patients to those with any level of periodontitis (35). Thus, our analysis revealed the enrichment in patients with severe periodontitis of organisms not consistently associated with disease in previous reports (e.g., R. mucilaginosa, P. melaninogenica) (35, 36).",

More importantly, we found that oral microbial diversity correlated with multiple cellular immune markers. Although the current literature largely assumes that gut dysbiosis is most critical in the development of an inflammatory phenotype, our results imply that oral microbiota play an equally, if not more, important role in chronic immune activation. This highlights the importance of studying microbial communities in various sites along the digestive tract for a more comprehensive understanding of dysbiotic states and their impact on immune system activation. A prior study found elevated immune markers in patients with HIV versus uninfected controls, yet no significant correlation between the oral microbiome and immune response (37). However, the patients with HIV were primarily older homosexual men rather than postmenopausal women. Also, patients with fewer than 20 teeth were excluded, resulting in a lower burden of severe periodontitis than in our study.",

Thus, the selection for \u201cinflammophilic\u201d taxa in the hyperinflammatory environment of early HIV (38) may result in allogeneic succession of the digestive tract microbiome toward dysbiosis, and ultimately increase microbial translocation. Our results suggest that digestive tract diversity is associated with varied outcomes long after initiation of ART, possibly enabling an ongoing bidirectional feedback loop of persistent microbiome signatures, microbial translocation, and immune system activation. Gut mucosal barrier dysfunction and persistent immune activation had been shown previously in patients with HIV (26, 28, 39). However, here we demonstrate that oral taxa are also correlated with systemic immune response. We found that decreased diversity of plaque and saliva microbiota was associated with history and treatment of HIV, periodontal disease severity, and immunological markers. Future studies incorporating uninfected controls are necessary to further inform this notion.",

This was a single center study that mainly included postmenopausal women of Hispanic ethnicity, which limits the generalizability of our findings. Our sample size was small, and we may have lacked power for some comparisons, especially with respect to sex and menopausal status. Also, due to loss in follow-up, paired biospecimens were not available for all participants, limiting sample size for longitudinal analyses. Nevertheless, our study provides important data on the potential roles of oral bacterial and fungal microbiomes, immune dysfunction, and periodontal disease in patients on ART up to decades after initiation of treatment. Moreover, we expand the current literature regarding chronic inflammation and microbial dysbiosis in patients with HIV to suggest a crucial role for persistent oral microbial markers in long-term systemic immune activation. The establishment of the bidirectional feedback loop described above prior to clinical presentation of inflammatory diseases, such as periodontitis, suggests that characterization of preclinical microbial dysbiosis may improve the chances of early prevention. Furthermore, our results point to the need for interventions targeting both inflammation and dysbiosis in order to mitigate the high morbidity and mortality of PLWH, in particular for oral inflammation-related comorbidities. More broadly, these results are applicable to general models of microbiome-mediated chronic systemic immune activation and the development of precise microbiota-targeted interventions and therapeutics to reverse chronic inflammation.",

The effects of patient clinical history variables, serum cytokine levels, and inflammatory cellular markers (fixed effects) on richness and evenness (Shannon and Chao \u03b1-diversity, outcome) of saliva, plaque, and stool microbial communities were assessed by linear mixed-effect analysis using lme4 and lmerTest, with intercepts for study subjects included as random effects. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method to adjust P values from associations of soluble and cellular markers with microbiome diversity to account for multiple testing. Bacterial and fungal Shannon and Chao \u03b1-diversity values were log transformed (ln) to achieve a normal-like distribution, as assessed using QQ-plot visualizations. Principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) using phyloseq and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using vegan (59) were used to test differences in microbial community composition (\u03b2-diversity) across groups based on pairwise weighted UniFrac distances. DESeq2 (60) was used to identify differentially abundant bacterial taxa after multiple-comparison P value adjustment.",
