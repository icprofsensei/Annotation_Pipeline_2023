                    "text": "Periodontitis has a polymicrobial etiology within the framework of a complex microbial ecosystem. With advances in sequencing technologies, comprehensive studies to elucidate bacterial community differences have recently become possible. We used 454 sequencing of 16S rRNA genes to compare subgingival bacterial communities from 29 periodontally healthy controls and 29 subjects with chronic periodontitis. Amplicons from both the V1-2 and V4 regions of the 16S gene were sequenced, yielding 1\u2009393\u2009579 sequences. They were identified by BLAST against a curated oral 16S database, and mapped to 16 phyla, 106 genera, and 596 species. 81% of sequences could be mapped to cultivated species. Differences between health- and periodontitis-associated bacterial communities were observed at all phylogenetic levels, and UniFrac and principal coordinates analysis showed distinct community profiles in health and disease. Community diversity was higher in disease, and 123 species were identified that were significantly more abundant in disease, and 53 in health. Spirochaetes, Synergistetes and Bacteroidetes were more abundant in disease, whereas the Proteobacteria were found at higher levels in healthy controls. Within the phylum Firmicutes, the class Bacilli was health-associated, whereas the Clostridia, Negativicutes and Erysipelotrichia were associated with disease. These results implicate a number of taxa that will be targets for future research. Some, such as Filifactor alocis and many Spirochetes were represented by a large fraction of sequences as compared with previously identified targets. Elucidation of these differences in community composition provides a basis for further understanding the pathogenesis of periodontitis.",

It has been associated with a number of systemic diseases and conditions (Scannapieco et al., 2010), such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and interactions may contribute to these systemic diseases. Chronic periodontitis has a complex etiology dependent on the bacterial community residing in the gingival sulcus. Bacteria may be directly pathogenic or may stimulate damaging host inflammatory responses. The core oral microbiome appears to consist of <1000 species-level taxa (Dewhirst et al., 2010; Griffen et al., 2011), although any number of species may appear transiently in a site so open to the environment.",

                    "text": "Periodontitis is thought to have a polymicrobial etiology, but comprehensive studies to elucidate differences between health and disease for the complex communities that make up the oral microbiome have only recently become possible. Early studies based on cultivation were extremely difficult to perform and yielded confusing and contradictory results. Community members had variable growth requirements and rates, many taxa did not grow well in culture, and nearly all were difficult to identify definitively. Targeted approaches such as DNA hybridization and PCR-based assays provided more power to track variation in levels of individual species, but did not provide a comprehensive view of communities. Using whole-genomic hybridization, Socransky et al. (1998) delineated a set of three species showing strong associations with periodontal disease and with each other: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia. Subsequently, this list of potential pathogens was expanded using species-specific 16S primers for PCR amplification (Kumar et al., 2003), but these studies did not provide a comprehensive view of bacterial communities. 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing has resulted in a major advance. Earlier studies using cloning and Sanger sequencing (Kumar et al., 2005, 2006) suffered from the shallowness of the sequencing effort; it simply wasn't economically possible to obtain enough sequence information to plumb the complexity of the system. The advent of 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes has allowed the collection of thousands of sequences per sample (Keijser et al., 2008; Zaura et al., 2009), and provides the power to comprehensively study bacterial community composition at the level of species. We used this technique to compare samples from patients with periodontitis and healthy controls, to further our understanding of bacterial ecology in this disease. Bacterial community differences between health and disease were demonstrated at all taxonomic levels, implicating large numbers of additional species that will be targets for future research. Major shifts at the level of phylum and class in community composition were shown, and these will provide a basis for further understanding host\u2013microbe interactions in periodontitis and health.",

Measures of diversity, both the number of species and the combination of richness and evenness reflected in the Shannon index, were higher in periodontitis than in health (Figure 6). Health-associated species were not generally lost, but accounted for a smaller fraction of the total community. Considered from the bacterial point of view, this more diverse community represents a more stable and healthy ecosystem. This diversity may result from subverting host defenses that would limit community composition to non-pathogenic commensals. In contrast, in dental caries bacterial community composition becomes less diverse during disease progression (Gross et al., 2010), as species are lost in a dietary substrate-driven lowering of pH from lactate production that has been termed an \u2018ecological catastrophe' (Marsh, 2003) for both commensals and the host.",

However, this appears to be an over simplification, and it has been suggested that staining artifacts may account for the earlier assessment (Wade, 2011). At least one Gram positive, Filifactor alocis, is potentially important in disease, but all communities are mixed with respect to Gram-stain reaction. The small increase in proportion of Gram negatives in disease as compared with health is predominantly accounted for by decreases in the proportions of two health-associated species of streptococci.",

The number of species ranged between 100 and 300 in a single individual, and a total of 692 species were detected overall. Some recent sequencing efforts have estimated much higher numbers of species and a higher fraction of uncharacterized species (Keijser et al., 2008; Pushalkar et al., 2011). There are several potential explanations for the differences observed. The previous studies sampled different locations in the mouth and examined different regions of the 16S gene. Also the methods of data analysis that we used, although potentially not identifying very rare species, may avoid considering rare transient species or artifacts generated by PCR or sequencing. We used stringent filters for the sequence data and then searched against a highly curated locally hosted database of 16S sequences that was constructed to minimize ambiguity. There were somewhat more organisms present representing uncultivated groups in the disease-group samples. This difference was relatively small in magnitude and less than inter-sample variability, but statistically supported.",

Such clear-cut differences between periodontitis and health at the level of phylum and genus are a new finding, and suggest that fundamental shifts in the functional profile of the community are occurring. Our data confirms the association of specific species with disease, including P. gingivalis, T. denticola and T. forsythia (Socransky et al., 1998). However, we also observed a large number of additional species that show significant associations with disease (Figure 2). Additionally, although we find that P. gingivalis and T. denticola are two of the top three disease-associated species, Filifactor alocis appears to be at least as prevalent and strongly disease-associated. Meanwhile, T. forsythia only ranks as the sixteenth most abundant disease-associated organism. The role of P. gingivalis in periodontitis has been heavily studied, but the Spirochetes, Filifactor alocis and a number of uncultivated species clearly deserve more attention. Some of the disease-associated species are present in samples from healthy individuals, and increase in disease (Figure 2). Perhaps the more interesting species are those that are only present in disease, since they seem more likely to account for pathogenesis. The major health-associated species are suppressed but not lost in disease, suggesting that a simple probiotic approach of introducing healthy species may not be effective without addressing the presence of pathogens.",

However, as seen in Figures 2 and \u200band3,3, the preponderance of disease-associated organisms is also found in the shallow pockets of subjects with disease. This suggests that the community shifts that are observed are not solely due to the presence of deeper pockets with lower oxygen concentrations. Potentially, the shallow pockets in persons with disease may represent an intermediate stage in disease development. If so, the presence of the pathogenic bacteria even without disease symptoms could be prognostic for future disease. Further studies will be needed to test these possibilities.",

This approach was made possible by the fact that we classified sequences by BLAST matching to full-length sequences in our CORE database (Griffen et al., 2011). Although there was fairly high correlation between results with the two regions, there were some key differences between the results, such as the paucity of sequences from phylum Bacteroidetes in the V4 data. This was not due to primer mismatch, as the V4 primers that we used matched the Bacteroidetes sequences in our database well (exact match to 90% of Bacteroidetes vs 88% of all others). Potentially, the base sequence between the primers may be less amplifiable in Bacteroidetes. Overall, our results suggest that sequencing of multiple regions of the 16S gene may be important in sampling the full diversity of bacterial populations.",
