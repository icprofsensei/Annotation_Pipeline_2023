Current management methods include limited intake of sodium, adequate diuretics plus albumin, large-volume paracentesis, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Liver transplantation (LT) is the only effective strategy to cure cirrhosis and its complications. However, most patients cannot receive LT because of its high cost, the shortage of the donated liver, and many other factors. The role of the gut-liver axis in the occurrence and development of complications of cirrhosis has aroused great attention. Microbiota, dysbiosis, and bacterial translocation (BT) have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis. Bacteria and their products are introduced into blood via the intestines and then increase the blood levels of endotoxin and inflammatory factors, which, in turn, accelerate liver fibrosis and stimulate the production of vasodilator substances. These events cause reduced systemic vascular resistance and an activated sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), eventually leading to hyperdynamic circulation, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of refractory ascites[2-6].",

Furthermore, rifaximin is hardly absorbed by the intestines because of its pyridine ring added to rifamycin; thus, high concentrations are present in the intestines, making it difficult to induce drug-resistant strains[8,9]. Previous studies have shown that rifaximin treatment can reduce the concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and endotoxin in blood, thus improving systemic haemodynamics and decreasing the hepatic venous pressure gradient in patients with cirrhosis[10-12]. Rifaximin has been demonstrated to exert positive effects in the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and to prevent the development of esophagogastric and gastric variceal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)[10,13]. Hence, our study evaluated the clinical efficacy of rifaximin and its effects on intestinal flora characteristics and the systemic inflammatory state in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites.",

Based on the assumption that bacterial overgrowth and translocation cause the systemic inflammatory state, which aggravates the dysfunction of stellate cells and hyperdynamic circulation in patients with cirrhosis, this study suggests that rifaximin can be used to interfere with the process above and improve the haemodynamics by targeting the gut microbiota.",

                    "text": "Our study showed that treatment with rifaximin mitigated ascites and improved the survival in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. However, 2-wk treatment with rifaximin revealed no significant effect on liver and kidney function. This study also analysed the changes in the concentrations of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and other inflammatory factors, as well as LBP, in the plasma of cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. No significant change was noted in the inflammatory factors other than IP-10 after treatment with rifaximin, although the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and LBP showed a declining trend, which is consistent with the results of a previous randomized controlled trial[20]. Previous studies have shown that rifaximin inhibits activation of the NF-\u03baB signalling transduction pathway and downregulates the expression of cytokines and chemokines[21,22]. Studies have also shown that rifaximin can reduce the concentrations of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and endotoxin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, thereby exercising the effects of reducing portal pressure and improving haemodynamics[11,12,23]. However, these studies and their follow-up did not set up a controlled trial. Although a case-control study showed that long-term treatment with rifaximin reduced the incidence of esophagogastric and gastric variceal bleeding, SBP, and HRS in patients with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis and improved their survival rate[13], rifaximin treatment in patients had already been confirmed to be effective before enrolment; thus, there may exist a selection bias. A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial revealed that 4 wk of treatment with rifaximin did not affect the hepatic venous pressure gradient, systemic haemodynamics, GFR, or levels of vasoactive hormones and had no impact on the inflammatory state and only minor effects on BT and intestinal bacterial composition in stable, decompensated cirrhosis[20,24]. Considering the mechanism of action of rifaximin, it may exert effects on patients with poor liver function and severely disordered haemodynamics; hence, a randomized controlled trial performed on a subgroup analysis of patients with Child-Pugh C liver function and elevated LBP at baseline still showed no significant difference[20,24]. Our study performed subgroup analysis in patients with lower eGFR than normal at baseline, and the results suggest a trend of decline in the levels of Scr after treatment with rifaximin but a trend of elevation in patients in the control group, suggesting that rifaximin can show advantages in patients with severely disordered haemodynamics and a high inflammatory state. Regrettably, this study did not assess the effect of long-term treatment with rifaximin on these indicators and did not collect haemodynamic-related data. Thus, further research is needed to assess the effect of long-term treatment with rifaximin on the prognosis of cirrhotic patients with severely disordered haemodynamics and a high inflammatory state.",

                    "text": "Studies on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have found that rifaximin can inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Enterobacterium, and other non-Enterobacterium-Gram-negative enterobacteria in vitro[25] and increase the abundance of Lactobacilli and reduce the number of Bacillus filiformis[26]. Thus, rifaximin is considered to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria without affecting the normal composition of gut microbiota. In recent years, rifaximin has been increasingly studied in the prevention and treatment of cirrhosis complications such as SBP and HRS, but the effect of rifaximin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis remains controversial. Studies have shown that rifaximin has minor effects on bacterial composition, inflammation, and BT in stable, decompensated cirrhosis[20,24]. Other studies have shown no significant microbial change besides a modest decrease in Veillonellaceae and Streptococcus, and an increase in Eubacteriaceae was observed after rifaximin treatment in patients with HE[27-29]. Considering that rifaximin reduces endotoxaemia but has no significant effect on intestinal flora, it is preferred that rifaximin is more likely to exert pharmacological effects through the following pathways: (1) Altering bacterial function and virulence; (2) Improving intestinal barrier function; and (3) Inducing resistance to some flora[28,30]. Studies have confirmed that rifaximin inhibits the adhesion and translocation of bacteria, reduces the virulence of bacteria, and regulates the metabolism of gut microbiota[27,31-33]. Using metagenomic sequencing, this study evaluated the changes in the intestinal flora in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites after treatment with rifaximin and rifaximin plus intravenous antibiotics. Previously, it was generally believed that the diversity of gut microbiota was decreased in disease conditions, particularly in patients with intestinal diseases, and increased after the disease was relieved[34]. Our study suggested a decline in the richness of gut microbiota in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites after treatment with rifaximin, probably related to the premise of treatment with antibiotics in this study. In this study, patients with refractory ascites and severely disordered haemodynamics were selected as the research subjects, and the changes in the gut microbiota after treatment with rifaximin are not consistent with the results of previous studies with rifaximin in the complications of cirrhosis such as HE and ascites.",

The abundance of Lactobacilli in faecal samples increased one month after treatment with rifaximin in patients with different gastrointestinal diseases such as IBS, inflammatory bowel disease and diverticulosis, but the composition of the gut microbiota did not show any significant change[37]. Another study suggested that the abundance of Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii is increased at the end of rifaximin treatment in non-constipation IBS, and the composition of the gut microbiota did not change significantly[38]. Bifidobacterium has an intestinal and systemic anti-inflammatory effect[39]; butyrate production by Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii was involved in the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, exercising an immunomodulatory effect[40,41]; Lactobacillus has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-oxidative, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral properties[30,42]. Our results suggest that the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is increased after treatment with rifaximin and rifaximin plus intravenous antibiotics in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites, while the abundance of Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii had a slight decrease.",

Microbiota dysbiosis and bacterial translocation have been shown to be involved in the progression of cirrhosis. Bacteria and their products are introduced into blood via the intestines and then increase the blood levels of endotoxin and inflammatory factors, which in turn accelerate liver fibration and stimulate the production of vasodilator substances. These events cause reduced systemic vascular resistance and an activated sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, eventually leading to hyperdynamic circulation, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of refractory ascites. Therefore,improving the gut microenvironment may benefit cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites.

In addition, the gut microbiota was determined by metagenomics sequencing (Illumina HiSeq) to analyse the changes in the characteristics of the gut microbiota before and after rifaximin treatment. The patients were followed for 6 mo. This study evaluated the effects of rifaximin in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites with regard to clinical efficacy, laboratory indicators, inflammatory factors, and intestinal microbiota. The concentrations of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumour necrosis factor alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interferon-inducible protein 10, and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were determined with Luminex (Magnetic Luminex Assay; R&D Systems Europe, Ltd., Abingdon OX14 3NB, United Kingdom), which was highly reliable.

We concluded that rifaximin mitigates ascites and improves survival of cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites, and a possible mechanism is that rifaximin regulates the structure and functions of intestinal bacteria, thus improving the systemic inflammatory state. These provide new ideas for clinical dealing with cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites-targeting the gut microbiota.",
