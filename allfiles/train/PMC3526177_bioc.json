We therefore compared cutaneous bacterial communities of Amerindians in the Venezuelan Amazon with subjects in the United States. Forearm skin specimens were studied from healthy Amerindians in Platanillal village in Amazonas State, and from healthy persons in New York and Colorado. All skin sampling used similar swab/buffer techniques. Multiplexed V2-targeted 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing yielded high quality sequences from 112 samples. The results show 20 phyla, with three (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria) predominating. US residents and Venezuelan Amerindians had significantly different forearm skin bacterial community compositions, with United States dominated by Propionibacterium. Among the Amerindians, there was a deep split based on bacterial community membership, with 30 and 42 samples, respectively, falling into each of the two groups, not associated with age, gender, or body mass index. One Amerindian group had diversity similar to the United States, but was dominated by Staphylococcus rather than Propionibacterium. The other Amerindian group was significantly more diverse and even than the US or the other Amerindian group, and featured a broad range of Proteobacteria. The results provide evidence that ethnicity, lifestyle and/or geography are associated with the structure of human cutaneous bacterial communities.",

Investigators now are using molecular, DNA-based methodologies to assess the microbial populations present in and on human skin (Fredricks, 2001; Paulino et al., 2006, 2008; Gao et al., 2007, 2008, 2010; Fierer et al., 2008, 2010; Grice et al., 2008, 2009; Costello et al., 2009; Grice and Segre, 2011). However, these studies were all performed in humans who live in developed countries, as does the large-scale National Institute of Health (NIH)-initiated Human Microbiome Project (Peterson et al., 2009), that shares this focus on humans living lifestyles associated with postmodern socioeconomic development. The microbiota in normal persons in developed countries has likely been substantially altered by changes associated with socioeconomic development, including frequent showering, and use of soap, cosmetics and antibiotics (Blaser and Falkow, 2009). To better understand potentially alternative human cutaneous microbiota that could more closely resemble that with which we coevolved (Blaser, 2006), it would be useful to assess individuals whose exposures to modern-type lifestyles have been more limited.",

We sought to describe the composition and uniformity of the sampled Amerindian cutaneous microbiome in a community of Amerindian subjects, to identify correlates with particular clustering patterns, and to determine whether Amerindian and US populations could be distinguished. For these studies, we sampled a single cutaneous site, the volar mid-forearm, as this site is easily identified and sampled, permits examining laterality of populations, is washed less than hands, and is subject to an extensive sequence database that is currently growing (Paulino et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2007, 2008, 2010; Paulino et al., 2008; Costello et al., 2009; Staudinger et al., 2011).",

At the time of sampling in October 2008, there was no electricity or running water and streets were not paved in Platanillal. The Guahibo were traditionally nomadic hunter-gatherers (Steward and Faron, 1959; Salzano and Callegari-Jacques, 1988). Since the 1970s, most have been settled in government-built houses in small villages led by a political captain. Present-day Guahibos retain their Amerind language (Greenberg, 1987), high levels of endogamy and a relatively sedentary lifestyle (Steward and Faron, 1959; Salzano and Callegari-Jacques, 1988). Their traditional diet is based on maize, cassava and fish, with an occasional wild game. Sixty-eight of the subjects of this study were born in Platanillal and four were born in nearby settlements (San Pablito, Acqua bianco). Sixty-nine subjects were of Guahibo (Jivi) ethnicity and three others were related (Jivi/mestizo, Piapoco/Jivi and Econeiwa). The subjects ranged in age from 2 months to 80 years (median 9 years). In total, we examined specimens from the right forearms of 72 subjects, who volunteered to participate in the study. Informed consent was obtained from subjects or their guardians according to human experimentation guidelines of the Helsinski Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983. In brief, written informed consent was obtained from all adult participants, or from their parents, in the case of young children. The experimental protocol was agreed upon by the village chief (captain) and the local medical doctor, had the support of the community, and was approved by the Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research and the Institutional Review Board of the University of Puerto Rico\u2013Rio Piedras.",

In brief, the forward primer (5\u2032-GCC TTG CCA GCC CGC TCA GTC AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3\u2032) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B sequence, the broad-range bacterial primer 27\u2009F, and a two-base linker sequence (\u2018TC').

Sequences were removed from the analysis if they were <200 or >350\u2009nt in length, had a mean quality score <25, contained ambiguous characters, contained a homopolymer run exceeding 12\u2009nt, did not contain the primer sequence or contained an uncorrectable barcode. Remaining sequences were assigned to samples by examining the 12-nt barcode. The complete data set was error-corrected and chimera-checked using OTUpipe (http://drive5.com/otupipe) (Caporaso et al., 2010), which provided essentially the same results as Denoiser (Reeder and Knight, 2010) in terms of alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomic composition (data not shown). After this filtering process, data from residents of Platanillal, New York and Colorado were pooled, and similar sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using UCLUST (Edgar, 2010), with a minimum sequence identity threshold of 97%. In total, 1148 OTUs were obtained. A representative sequence was chosen from each OTU by selecting the first sequence (the UCLUST cluster seed). Taxonomy was assigned to each representative sequence using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier (Wang et al., 2007), with a minimum support threshold of 80% and the RDP taxonomic nomenclature. Representative sequences were aligned against the Greengenes core set using PyNAST software (Caporaso et al., 2010), using a minimum alignment length of 150 and a minimum identity of 75%. From the total of 1148 OTUs, 1143 (99.5%) representative sequences aligned successfully and five that failed to align were dropped. The PH Lane mask was used to remove hypervariable regions after alignment. A phylogenetic tree was inferred using FastTree (Price et al., 2009), with Kimura's 2-parameter model. For alpha diversity measurements, rarefaction analysis was performed for: (i), the estimated number of OTUs in each sample using the Chao1 algorithm; (ii) the evenness of the populations, using the Shannon measure of evenness and (iii), the amount of phylogenetic branch length observed in each sample (phylogenetic distance (PD)). For beta diversity measurements, UniFrac distances were calculated between all pairs of samples. UniFrac distances are based on the fraction of branch length shared between two communities in a phylogenetic tree. Unweighted UniFrac accounts for membership only; weighted UniFrac accounts for membership and relative abundance (Lozupone and Knight, 2005; Lozupone et al., 2010). UniFrac-based jackknifed hierarchical clustering was performed using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) in QIIME. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was also performed on the UniFrac distance matrices, and visualized using the KiNG graphics program (http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/king.php).",

In an initial analysis, we examined 66 samples in which sampling yielded sufficient depth (>400 sequences per samples) to permit a well-supported dendrogram. By this analysis, there was a clear separation between the US (NYC and Colorado) and Amerindian specimens (Figure 1a). Within the Amerindian specimens, there was a deep branching distinguishing two clusters: Cluster A (n=17 samples) and Cluster B (n=17 samples). Clustering at lower coverage revealed a similar pattern, permitting assignment of all 72 Amerindian samples to either Cluster A (n=30) or B (n=42). Differences in DNA concentrations in the extracted samples do not account for the clustering into groups A or B (data not shown).",

The US specimens were dominated by Actinobacteria, irrespective of whether the subjects were from Colorado or from New York. That the taxa were similar between the two US groups indicates that differences in the extent of the forearm that was sampled and the difference in DNA extraction methods had little effect on the overall assessment of microbiome composition. In both Amerindian clusters, Actinobacteria comprised a substantially smaller fraction than in the US subjects. In contrast to the US samples, the Amerindian specimens were either dominated by Firmicutes (Cluster A), or showed no dominant phylum (Cluster B). There was higher representation of Bacteroidetes (9.51%), in Cluster B than in Cluster A (3.44%), or the US specimens (3.78%) (P<0.001 for each vs Cluster B). Thus, there are substantial compositional differences in the USA and Amerindian (Venezuela (VZ)) forearm microbiome.",

The US subjects from NY and CO had significantly higher average proportions of Propionibacterium (17% and 28%, respectively) compared with the VZ subjects (3% ANOVA corrected for multiple comparisons P<0.001). This result was mainly driven by a single OTU (at the 0.97 level), whose representative sequence was confirmed by BLAST to be 100% identical to Propionibacterium acnes.",

                    "text": "The UniFrac-based PCoA also revealed that the forearm skin bacterial assemblages from the Amerindians fell into two distinct clusters (along PC2) with roughly equal numbers of subjects in each group; this pattern was especially evident in the weighted UniFrac analysis, suggesting differentiation based on the relative abundances of particular taxa between the two groups, and consistent with the UPGMA analysis (Figure 1). On average, samples from Amerindian Cluster A had significantly higher proportions of the genus Staphylococcus compared with samples from Amerindian Cluster B and from the US subjects (50% in A, 6.9% in B, 5.5% in NY, 4.4% in CO; ANOVA with correction for multiple comparison P<0.001). This result was driven primarily by two OTUs, whose representative sequences were confirmed by BLAST to be 100% identical to S. epidermidis (35%) and S. hominis (12%). Indeed, every subject in Amerindian Cluster A had a relative abundance of the genus Staphylococcus >30% this is consistent with the Firmicutes dominance observed in Figure 1b. Conversely, samples from the Amerindian Cluster B were far less dominated by a single genus such as Propionibacterium or Staphylococcus, and were instead characterized by a broad diversity of Proteobacteria, with the most abundant being OTUs classified as Pseudomonas (4.7%), Xanthomonadaceae (3.4%) and Methylophilus (2.7%). As such, overall diversity and evenness also were significantly higher in Cluster B than in the Staphylococcus-dominated Cluster A. The clustering was robust by location at sampling levels of 400 sequences per sample to 100 sequences per sample (Supplemental Figure 1). However, there was no effect on the clustering seen that could be attributed to subject gender (Supplemental Figure 2A), age (Supplemental Figure 2B) or body mass index (Supplemental Figure 2C).",

Not surprisingly, the greatest (P<0.001) pairwise distances were between Cluster A and the US sample, and between Cluster B and the US sample; these two metrics were essentially equivalent (Figure 3b). By PERMANOVA, in all pairwise comparisons, inter-cluster distances were significantly larger than intra-cluster distances. We also separated the US subjects into those from Colorado and New York. The distances between Colorado and New York were significantly lower than those for either group with either of the Venezuelan groups A and B (Supplemental Figure 3).",

We examined whether the clustering that was observed primarily reflected clustering of the common (>1%), intermediate (0.1\u20131.0%) and/or rare (<0.1%) taxa. We used weighted (Figures 4a\u2013c) and unweighted (Figures 4d\u2013f) UniFrac analyses with PCoA representations to address this question. Because the numbers of sequences diminish with this stratification, we examined specimens with >100 sequences for each group. In each bin, whether weighted or not, the phylogenetic clustering observed in the total sample is present. Thus, the differences in US and Amerindian assemblages, including the A and B Clusters, are essentially uniform, involving taxa that are common, intermediate and rare. This consistency highlights the robustness of the differences observed between the US and Amerindian populations, and also indicates that the primary differences are not due to the different DNA extraction procedure used in the Colorado samples and the others. Procrustes analyses compared the original beta-diversity results vs the common, medium and rare abundance OTUs (Supplemental Figure 4). Monte Carlo P values were significant (P<0.001) for all comparisons using 1000 replicates. The split between USA and Amerindian holds at all levels, but the separation between Amerindian Clusters A and B only is notable using the common OTUs.",

This is consistent with the taxon distribution (shown in Figure 1b). In fact, the trends and differences observed when 400 sequences were evaluated from each sample also were present when as few as 100 sequences were studied. The Shannon measure of evenness shows the highest values for Cluster B (Figure 5b); again studying 100 sequences is sufficient to observe these trends. Alpha diversity, as measured by the amount of branch length in a phylogenetic tree (PD) (Figure 5c) was higher on average among samples from Cluster B, whereas Cluster A samples resembled the US samples.

In contrast, the microbiota from the Amerindians was substantially different from the United States, and was divided into two major clusters that were essentially not represented in the US samples. The alpha diversity indices indicate relative similarities in species richness (and evenness) among persons differing substantially in both ethnicity and life style (United States and Cluster A); however, for a second group of Amerindian samples (Cluster B), there was much higher richness and evenness. Thus, Cluster B differed from both the United States and Cluster A, and the differences were apparent even at low sampling depth (100 sequences or sample; Figure 5).",

Thus, at this single point of sampling, the patterns are robust. This also is shown by the UniFrac analysis of the pairwise distances, in which the inter-group distances always are greater than the intra-group distances.

To understand the composition and function of the human microbiome before the development of processes associated with postmodern life, we should seek and sample indigenous people before they become more subject to modernization, which is rapidly advancing around the world.
