The source of infection in many of these patients remains unclear. To address this clinical problem, the microbiome profile and host inflammatory response in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from the surgical intensive care unit were examined relative to clinical pathology diagnoses. The hypothesis was tested that clinical diagnosis of respiratory tract flora were similar to culture positive lavage samples in both microbiome and inflammatory profile. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected in the surgical intensive care unit as standard of care for intubated individuals with a clinical pulmonary infection score of >6 or who were expected to be intubated for >48 hours. Cytokine analysis was conducted with the Bioplex Pro Human Th17 cytokine panel. The microbiome of the samples was sequenced for the 16S rRNA region using the Ion Torrent. Microbiome diversity analysis showed the culture-positive samples had the lowest levels of diversity and culture negative with the highest based upon the Shannon-Wiener index (culture positive: 0.77 \u00b1 0.36, respiratory tract flora: 2.06 \u00b1 0.73, culture negative: 3.97 \u00b1 0.65). Culture-negative samples were not dominated by a single bacterial genera. Lavages classified as respiratory tract flora were more similar to the culture-positive in the microbiome profile. A comparison of cytokine expression between groups showed increased levels of cytokines (IFN-g, IL-17F, IL-1B, IL-31, TNF-a) in culture-positive and respiratory tract flora groups. Culture-positive samples exhibited a more robust immune response and reduced diversity of bacterial genera. Lower cytokine levels in culture-negative samples, despite a greater number of bacterial species, suggest a resident nonpathogenic bacterial community may be indicative of a normal pulmonary environment. Respiratory tract flora samples were most similar to the culture-positive samples and may warrant classification as culture-positive when considering clinical treatment.",

                    "text": "It is now well understood that the pulmonary tract is inhabited by bacteria under both normal and disease conditions, even though the bacteria may not be detected using traditional culture methods. The recent advent of microbiome profiling has revealed perturbations and dysbiosis of the pulmonary tract [1, 2], especially in regard to disease states such as asthma [3, 4] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [5, 6]. Such dysbiosis can ultimately lead to the development of pneumonia in certain populations [7]. Of special interest are mechanically ventilated surgical patients, who can be particularly susceptible to the development of pneumonia. However, a diagnosis of pneumonia in this population is historically problematic, since many of the clinical parameters used for diagnosis are already elevated due to the injuries and other sources of noninfection-related inflammation [8\u201312]. Most diagnostic criteria for a pneumonia diagnosis include the presence of a bacteria in a culture at a sufficient concentration to suggest infection [13, 14]. However, in many instances, patients will demonstrate clinical signs of pneumonia yet will be culture-negative or have cultures described as \u201crespiratory tract flora.\u201d An analysis of endotracheal aspirates of mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated increased dysbiosis and a reduction of the bacterial microbiome diversity over the time period of intubation. Additionally, the endotracheal microbiome of patients that developed of ventilator acquired pneumonia had increased dysbiosis relative to individuals that did not develop pneumonia when assayed during the first several days of intubation [15]. Molecular methods to quantify the bacterial load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [16] and exhaled breath [17] through amplification of the 16S rRNA gene via quantitative real-time PCR have successfully identified patients with microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia versus patients with lower bacterial burden. This allowed for a more rapid quantification of bacterial burden relative to the traditional semi-quantitative culture methods [16].",

Inclusion criteria included all adult patients in the SICU who received a BAL and had sufficient lavage fluid to be utilized for research purposes above what was required for clinical diagnosis. Patients were excluded if they were positive for HIV, positive for tuberculosis, under the age of 18, or failed to survive 48 hours past admission. BAL samples were collected using an unprotected BAL catheter in accordance with standard operating procedures developed by the large-scale collaborative project, \u201cInflammation and the Host Response to Injury\u201d [22]. This BAL procedure is often clinically referred to as a \u201cmini-BAL.\u201d As part of the standard of care, BALs are performed on patients who remain ventilated for over 36 hours (screening) or those with a Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) of \u22656 [23]. Samples for quantitative culture were obtained with a non-bronchoscopic telescoping BAL catheter (BAL-CATH, Kimberly-Clark, Draper UT). After insertion of the catheter five 20cc aliquots of non-bacteriostatic normal saline were instilled and retrieved. The five collections were pooled and a volume of 10\u201315 ml of the pooled samples were submitted to the pathology laboratory for quantitative culture identification. As part of a de-escalation antibiotic management clinical protocol, administration of antibiotics is stopped if the BAL culture results are negative (< 10^4CFU/ml) or described as RTF. Subsequently, based upon this protocol, C- BAL patients are clinically classified as having SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) and not pneumonia. Written consent to treat was obtained for the clinical BAL procedure by the practicing physician and documented in the patient\u2019s medical record. Under waived consent excess discarded BAL fluid from the standard of care BAL procedure were utilized for research. Associated clinical data for BAL specimens were additionally collected under waiver of consent. Collection of medical data and utilization of the samples for research with waived consent were approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW IRB #062011\u2013135) and University of North Texas Health Science Center.",

PCR was performed using the AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase high-fidelity system (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), consisting of 2.5 \u03bcl 10x AccuPrime PCR Buffer II, 1 \u03bcl each of 10 \u03bcM forward and reverse primer, 1 \u03bcl of 50 mM MgSO4, 0.1 \u03bcl AccuPrime Taq Polymerase High Fidelity, with molecular grade water and template DNA making up a 25 \u03bcl reaction mix. The PCR conditions were pre-denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, annealing at 52\u00b0C for 15 seconds, extension at 68\u00b0C for 20 seconds, and a final cycle of 5 minutes extension at 68\u00b0C. PCR amplification was performed in triplicate for each sample and visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Triplicated products were pooled and purified using Agencourt AMpure XP Reagent (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA) following the Ion Torrent protocol. Amplicon size and quantity were assessed using an Agilent DNA 7500 and read on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Purified PCR amplicon were combine together with equimolar concentrations.",

The not aligned sequences as well as redundant sequences were excluded from the dataset using a unique.seqs and precluster command. Chimeras were identified and removed using UCHIME [27]. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined based on a 97% sequence similarity. Microbial community diversity estimators (Shannon diversity, ACE, and Chao1) were calculated at OTU level. The Greengenes database was used to perform a taxonomic classification of sequences with a minimum 80% confidence level [28]. UniFrac and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were conducted to compare the microbial communities among the BAL samples [29]. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) tests were performed to assess microbial community variances among and within different groups and the similarity among different groups.",

Of the 15 cytokines analyzed, 5 different cytokines (IFN-g, IL-17F, IL-1B, IL-31, TNF-a) expressed significantly different levels between the C+, C-, and RTF groups. The lower limit of detection for these 5 cytokines ranged from 0.27 to 2.98 pg/ml. Cytokine levels of IL-10, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-25, IL-33, IL-4, IL-6 and sCD40L were detected at very low levels in all of the samples, and were not significantly different between groups (Lower limit of detection range for the non-significant cytokines was between 1.01 to 18.0 pg/ml). Values of the cytokines that were significantly different between groups are shown in Table 3. Cytokine levels in the RTF BAL samples produced cytokine levels more similar to the C+ samples than the C- samples except for IL-1B. Levels of IL-1B were intermediary between C+ and C- samples. Two RTF samples (BALs 224 and 229) continually displayed higher cytokine levels than other samples in the RTF group and several of the C+ samples. A cytokine profile comparison of the 5 significantly different cytokines (IFN-g, IL-17F, IL-1B, IL-31, TNF-a) using t-SNE is represented in Fig 4.

Existing clinical tools like the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score have demonstrated insufficient sensitivity and specificity for pneumonia diagnosis [33].

Additionally, patients who meet clinical criteria for a ventilator-associated event or potentially ventilator-associated pneumonia sometimes remain C- or do not culture a specific pathogen (i.e., RTF). This can become problematic as clinicians are unable to target pathogens that may be the source of a ventilator-associated event or pneumonia.",

The majority of C- samples that were sequenced in this study were not dominated by a single bacterial genus. Only one BAL (BAL260) had a genus with a relative abundance above 30% of the sample. In the unweighted PCoA plot, BAL260 clustered with the C+ and RTF samples. In contrast, the C+ samples were all dominated by a single bacterial genus, as might be expected given their C+ status. All C+ samples had a single genus with a relative abundance above 60% of the sample, with a concomitant decrease in overall bacterial diversity. The profile of RTF samples similarly showed decreased diversity compared to C- samples. The relative abundance of bacteria in the RTF samples was often dominated by two to three bacterial genera. These genera are often considered clinically significant and commensal oral flora has been associated with the development of VAP, especially in immunocompromised individuals [34]. However, given the mix of genera that comprise the RTF, and their lower levels of CFUs, patients with RTF are often not treated with antibiotics to resolve the bacterial growth. An additional caveat to relying on the relative abundance in a sample is that one cannot determine if the abundance of a taxa is caused by overgrowth of the dominant genera. Although precautions are undertaken during sequencing to determine adequate sampling based upon number of sequences generated per sample, a taxa with low frequency could potentially appear at less than the 1% abundance threshold if the dominant genera is in a stage of overgrowth.",

In a study of endotracheal aspirates over the course of ventilation demonstrated that bacterial diversity of aspirates at the familial taxonomic level decreased over the period of mechanical ventilation. Additionally, patients who developed VAP had a larger decrease of bacterial diversity relative to those who did not progress to VAP while under mechanical support. There was not a statistical difference in the change of microbial composition over intubation between patients who developed VAP and patients with colonized airways [15]. Although this appears to counter the diversity differences noted in this paper, Zakharkina et al. presented changes in the diversity of a patient over a period of mechanical ventilation as opposed to the temporal diversity sampling presented herein. Additionally, Zakharkina analyzed the diversity of samples at the familial taxonomic level, whereas the diversity of samples from this cohort are described at the genus level. As one ascends to a higher level of the taxonomic hierarchy, the diversity identified at lower levels (i.e. genus) is condensed into a broader taxonomic category (i.e. family, or phyla). Comparing samples at a higher taxonomic level may underestimate the differences between samples relative to comparing diversity at the genus or species taxonomic level. In the graphical presentation of the relative abundance data, Zakharkina et al subsumed the data into 8 groups. These groups comprised 7 bacterial families and the 8th group was a collection of all other bacterial families. In an examination of the data presented here the mean number of families was 19 in the culture positive, 30 for the RTF group, and 99 in the culture negative group. Reducing the majority of taxa into the \u201cother\u201d grouping may further explain the differences in the diversity observed between Zakharkina et al and the data presented here. Additionally, Zakharkina and colleagues examined the microbiome of tracheal aspirates, and previous publications have suggested that there are varying levels of concordance between endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for diagnosing VAP [35\u201338].",

It has been proposed to utilize different cytokines and cytokine profiles to aid in the diagnosis of pneumonia [18, 39, 40]. Among the BAL samples we analyzed, the C+ group exhibited the highest levels of proinflammatory cytokines. This is not surprising as the C+ samples all had significant levels of bacteria detected by traditional culture methods (>105 CFUs). Additionally, the RTF group exhibited elevated cytokines similar to what was seen in the C+ group. The C- group exhibited very low levels of cytokines across all of the cytokines examined in this study. Additionally the RTF and C+ groups were more similar to each other in regards to microbiome profile and cytokine production than they were to the C- group. Using t-SNE to compare cytokine profiles of each sample, the majority of C+ and RTF samples were grouped together. One C- sample, BAL260, grouped with the C+ and RTF samples. BAL260 also was noted to have a microbiome profile that was similar to the C+ and RTF groups. The t-SNE analysis calculates a pair-wise probability matrix based upon the level of similarity between individual samples. These differences in the inflammatory profiles between the C+ and RTF group and the C- group could be attributable to the overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms that facilitate an increased immune response. These low levels of cytokines could potentially be used to stratify patients who do not require antibiotic treatment (low cytokine, C-) versus patients in which pneumonia could not be excluded (C+ and RTF with high cytokine levels).",

Although BAL 204B exhibited an extremely high number of 16S copies, its level of cytokine production correspondingly was not the highest of the BALs analyzed. BALs 224 and 229 that displayed high cytokine levels did not contain unusually high 16S copy numbers. While the average copy number in C- samples was significantly lower than the averages of the other two groups, some of the C- samples had numbers equivalent to samples in the other groups. Additionally, there was no significant difference between 16S copy numbers in the C+ and RTF groups (Fig 5). Importantly, these C- samples with higher numbers of 16S copies did not produce equivalent cytokine levels to C+ or RTF samples. Given that the majority of cytokines were not correlated with 16S copy numbers, there are likely other factors driving the immune response besides bacterial abundance. Conway Morris et al utilized a 16S rRNA quantitative real time PCR assay for early detection of patients with microbiologically confirmed VAP. Although the assays utilized are different from the methods utilized here, they found that microbiologically confirmed VAP had a higher bacterial burden compared to culture negative samples [16]. These findings are in line with the data presented here where the CP and RTF groups had significantly higher 16S rRNA levels compared to culture negative samples.",

These data suggest that the relative abundance of bacteria present in the lungs (as determined by BAL) may be linked to cytokine production. Total microbial diversity was also similar between C+ and RTF samples, both of which were lower than C- samples. Taken together, culture samples reported as RTF had more in common with C+ samples than with C-, suggesting that they may represent a higher risk for pneumonia (as currently defined clinically) in this patient cohort. Along these lines previous examinations of commensal oral flora (by traditional culture methods) have been associated with the development of VAP in the ICU [34]. This may warrant considering whether patients with bacteria designated as RTF should be clinically treated similar to patients who are C+.",
