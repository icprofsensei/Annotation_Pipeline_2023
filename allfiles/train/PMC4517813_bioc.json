Meconium samples from 10/15 (66%) infants had evidence of bacteria based on FISH analysis. Of these, PCR was positive in only 1. Positive FISH counts ranged from 2.2 - 41.8 x 104 cells/g with a mean of 15.4 x 104 cells/g. (The limit of detection for automated counting is 106 cells/g). Cell counts were too low to allow formal diversity analysis. Amplification by PCR was not possible despite positive spiked samples demonstrating the feasibility of reaction. One baby was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae. The others contained 2-5 genera, with Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae and Bacteroides-Prevotella the most prevalent. There was no association between bacterial counts and rupture of membrane duration, time to passage of meconium or time to lab.",

                    "text": "The simple question of whether or not the gut is sterile at birth is a fundamental one in understanding human microbial colonisation, particularly as the gut harbours the most diverse bacterial community of the human body [4]. Data gathered from across different species have repeatedly demonstrated microbial transfer from mother to infant, supporting the critical nature of this physiological process [5]. Extending positive microbial findings however from the placenta [2], amniotic sac [6], umbilical blood [3] or breastmilk [7] to the gut of the fetus requires targeted study to address the paradigm of gut sterility at birth. The first question that needs to be robustly answered in the ongoing study of bacterial colonisation therefore is the sterility, or otherwise, of the gut at birth. With this in mind, a short, targeted study in healthy, term, vaginally-delivered, breastfed infants was undertaken to look for evidence of bacteria in first-pass meconium samples using two distinct molecular techniques. We elected to focus on fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) rather than the more prevalent amplicon sequencing methodology for two main reasons: firstly, amplicon sequencing is a qualitative and not quantitative method, so the absolute abundance of bacteria is not known; and secondly, in amplicon sequencing bacteria are identified based on DNA, not viable cells. Additionally, any DNA-based analysis of samples containing low levels of bacteria has to be carefully assessed for the possibility of contamination during processing confounding the results [8]. These are the reasons we specifically chose to utilise FISH for our work- it is quantitative and it allows visualisation of cells, inferring the presence of viable organisms in the sample studied.",

We deliberately put in place tight inclusion/exclusion criteria and were firm in rejecting samples that did not meet these. Despite this, we have demonstrated evidence of bacteria, albeit with very limited cell counts and diversity, in first-pass meconium samples. In attempting to look for a temporal relationship to colonisation, we defined the \u201cmeconium colonisation interval\u201d (MCI) as the period between externalisation of the amniotic sac contents (by rupture of membranes) and processing of the meconium sample in the laboratory. Assuming sterility of the amniotic sac and fetus, the start of this period would coincide with the commencement of fetal microbial colonisation. We demonstrated no correlation between MCI and bacterial cell counts in this study, albeit with limited subject numbers and consequently limited power to demonstrate such an association. Around one third of first-pass meconium samples in our cohort appeared sterile on triplicate microscopy analysis by FISH, and four of these five samples had an MCI time <500 minutes. No meconium sample was obtained in this study with an MCI time <200 minutes (3 hours 20 minutes), a considerable gap during which microbial changes may well occur. Addressing the MCI in the question of gut sterility at birth is a challenge for studies in this field and we would suggest that recording these times and analysing microbial data using MCI may help in future studies exploring early colonisation. This is a particular difficulty when addressing premature neonatal colonisation as delayed passage of meconium is commonplace with prematurity and often takes a number of days [14]. Microbial diversity has been reported in meconium samples from premature infants, though with scant consideration given to the timing of such samples with regards other early-life colonisation events [15\u201318].",

The genre-defining culture-based paper on this subject from Jim\u00e9nez and colleagues looked at early-passed meconium (within 2 hours of birth) and processed half of these immediately and half within 4 days [1]. No data was given on rupture of membranes interval. There was a clear distinction between the two groups with more culture-recovery in those with delayed processing. Between 1 and 5 species were isolated per sample with a predominance of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. No sample was entirely sterile. Makino and colleagues recently demonstrated a dearth of Bifidobacteria colonisation in first-pass meconium, but did not extend the analysis beyond this single genus [19]. Hu and colleagues performed a comprehensive 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing study on first-pass meconium samples from 23 newborns, including 10 from mothers with gestational or type II diabetes and 13 with no maternal diabetes [20]. The extremes of range for times of meconium passage was given (2\u201348 hours), but no data on rupture of membranes interval or time to lab processing. All samples had DNA evidence of bacteria, with a large Proteobacteria abundance in the infants without diabetic mothers. Ardissone et al recently published a further amplicon sequencing study on meconium samples from both term and preterm infants, and could find no DNA evidence of bacteria in 8/17 (47%) of meconium from infants >33 weeks gestation, with a greater proportion of preterm infants positive (74% vs 53%) [15]. Positive samples were extremely limited in diversity, much as in our study, with dominance by a single genus common. Specific data on MCI derivative periods was not provided, but it would be interesting to see whether delayed passage of meconium contributed to the increased positivity seen in premature infants.",

Further targeted work on the earliest aspects of microbial colonisation is required to fully address the sterility question, and we propose use of the MCI and its constituent timings as a potentially important aspect of data gathering for such studies. The seminal study to date on early neonatal colonisation demonstrated a lack of differentiation across neonatal body sites and inferred that this was a feature of early colonisation [21]. The impact of pioneer organisms may well influence downstream colonisation [22], and future attempts to influence the neonatal microbiota for the benefit of long-term health hinge on our understanding of early colonisation.",
