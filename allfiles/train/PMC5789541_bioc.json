Covering 18 clinically relevant body sites from five major body regions in a cohort of 300 healthy adult donors, analysis of HMP data revealed a high degree of microbial community specialization as well as considerable variation in overall microbiome composition between individuals. Providing a baseline of healthy microbial variation, HMP data have served as a versatile reference in numerous studies [2\u20135]. Examples of how metagenomic data from the HMP have been used include characterizing mobile gene content in the microbiome [6], identifying the prevalence of specific enzymes in human microbiome samples [7, 8], dissecting factors that shape skin microbial communities [9], contrasting ancient and modern oral microbiomes [10], and studying the gut antibiotic resistome [11].",

While interpersonal variation in the microbiome can be considerable, the microbiome of specific individuals can conversely be remarkably stable [12\u201314], suggesting host genetic background as one factor maintaining the composition of microbial communities across the body. Genetic factors influencing microbiome composition have been previously analyzed in mouse models, where external factors such as diet can be tightly controlled. In these studies, host genotype explained a significant proportion of variation in the gut microbiome of intercrossed mouse lines [15\u201317]. The quantitative trait loci (QTLs) emerging from these studies included genes involved in immune function, for example, Irak3 [15] and Irak4 [17].",

In addition to genetics, microbiome composition is strongly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, overall health status, and medication use [18, 19]. With the exception of research on special populations like the Hutterites [20], these factors are difficult to constrain in a human study. Nevertheless, some evidence does exist for genetic effects on human microbiome composition. For example, the gut microbiomes of monozygotic twins are significantly more similar than those of dizygotic twins [21, 22]. Recent work has suggested that microbiome heritability is lower than many other traits, however, and not distributed equally among taxa (e.g., with a higher heritability among Firmicutes than Bacteroidetes [22, 23]).",

Negative selection was also evident from the allele frequency distribution, as the severity of an allele\u2019s impact was strongly related to its frequency in the population. For example, high-impact variants were greatly enriched in variants that were observed only once in our dataset (Fig.\u00a02b, AC1). The distribution of coding mutations among genes was also not uniform, with a small number of genes capturing a large number of variants. Thirty genes showed more than five potential high-impact loss-of-function variants, and six genes had more than ten variants. The small number of genes with high-impact coding mutations suggested that this cohort was too small for burden testing to draw correlations between mutation frequency within a gene and microbial features.

The former approach gives a high-level overview of taxonomic composition, whereas the latter allows species-level identification and profiling of functional potential of the microbiome. We therefore used WMS data in subsequent analyses. The distribution of samples with WMS was not equivalent between body sites, with most samples drawn from six locations representing four of the major areas described above: gut (stool), oral (buccal mucosa, supragingival plaque, tongue dorsum), nares (anterior nares), and vaginal (posterior fornix); no WMS data were available from the skin samples.

Interestingly, almost all of the associated pathways were related to respiration and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, indicative of an oxygen gradient and differences in aerobic respiration by oral organisms of the tongue dorsum between donors. The enrichment of the TCA cycle in the oral microbiome and fermentation in the gut microbiome reflect the dominant metabolic features of the corresponding microbiomes and show how these can be affected by host genetics and environmental factors correlated with genetic ancestry.",

As could be expected from the PCA, the samples within ethnic groups were on average slightly more similar than samples from different ethnic groups, but microbiome similarity between related donors was more pronounced. With the exception of the gut, in all tested body sites, microbiome community composition between relatives were more similar than between random donor pairs; in anterior nares and buccal mucosa, the effect was also statistically significant by t test between unrelated and related similarity scores.

The ability to produce lactase in adulthood or lactose intolerance (hypolactasia) is controlled by the presence of a homozygous G allele in rs4988235 SNV close to LCT [49].

In buccal mucosa samples, ERAP1 was associated with Actinomyces graevenitzii (p\u2009=\u20093.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20138), a normal member of the oral microflora that can, under some circumstances, act as an opportunistic pathogen and cause pulmonary abscesses [58].

Interestingly, Lachnospiraceae was the most differentially regulated microbial family in the terminal ileum of patients with ankylosing spondylitis [59], a disease associated with polymorphisms in ERAP1 [60].

For example, based on the NOD2-Enterobacteriaceae association found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, it was calculated that detecting the same association in a genome-wide significant manner would require 3700 patients [24]. In this regard, two recent papers [23, 26] emphasize how good validation cohorts can help to filter results from otherwise underpowered studies.",

By validating two previous genotype-microbe associations (FUT2 and LCT), we showed that the HMP genetic data provide power to validate targeted hypotheses and contribute evidence to meta-analyses. Given that the HMP features broad biogeographic microbial sampling across the body, and the human sequencing data are of high quality and consistent with data from projects such as GoNL and 1000 Genomes, these data are well suited for such purposes. The comprehensive nature of whole-genome sequencing makes the data versatile, allowing the combination of HMP data with genome analysis technologies from genotyping arrays for common variants to exome sequencing for coding variation or other targeted approaches.",

We detected significant correlations between high-level genetic features and both microbial species and community functional profiles. Using these data, we verified that variants near the LCT and FUT2 genes associated significantly with the abundance of B. longum in stool. In a broader, untargeted genome-wide setting, we did not identify significant associations with single variants, mainly due to stringent multiple testing criteria imposed by the numbers of microbial features and body sites in combination with a relatively modest sample size. The top associations, however, provide an initial picture of body-wide host-microbial interaction potential. In addition, the dataset as a whole, when paired with the comprehensive microbiome sequencing already performed on this cohort, constitutes an invaluable resource for further studies.",
