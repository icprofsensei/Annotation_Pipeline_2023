The alpha (1,2)-fucosyltransferase 2 encoded by FUT2 is involved in the formation of the H antigen and the SNP, rs601338 is associated with ABO histo-blood group antigen secretion in the intestinal mucosa. Previous studies have provided non replicated results for the association of this polymorphism with the composition and inferred function of intestinal microbiota. We aimed to assess this relationship in a large cohort of 1,190 healthy individuals. Genotyping was performed using the HumanCoreEXOME chip, microbial composition was addressed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in this cohort. Although we have sufficient power to detect significant associations of FUT2 genotype/ inferred phenotype with the microbiota, our data demonstrate that FUT2 genotype and secretor status is not associated with microbial alpha diversity, microbial composition or inferred microbial function after correction for multiple testing. Thus, FUT2 genotype and inferred phenotype are not associated with human fecal microbial composition and imputed function.",

The FUT2 associated SNP rs601338 is associated with the secretor/non secretor status. The minor allele (A) confers a non-secretor phenotype and is associated with Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility with odds ratio of 1.11 (1.071\u20131.143 95% CI, p < 10\u221215).13-15 Host-microbe interactions can involve FUT2 through modification of components of the mucus layer,16-19 and thus FUT2 is an ideal candidate to test for association with the gut microbiota variability. Indeed several studies have already investigated the role of FUT2 in the composition of the microbiota but large biological (mucosal versus stool sample or bile duct) and technical differences (DNA extraction and profiling method of the microbiota) exist between studies resulting in potentially different results.8,10,11,20 Indeed the FUT2 expression in tissue is the highest in salivary gland, then esophagus-mucosa, then terminal ileum, and then transverse colon21 and it was shown that the effects of the FUT2 genotype/secretor status on bacterial phyla decrease in distal region of the gastrointestinal tract.22 In addition detecting an association of FUT2 with microbial composition might also depend on other factor such as the stress applied to the host and/or diet of the host.19,23\n",

Of the 127 genera, we found that Blautia, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, Dorea, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Streptococcus and Oscillospira genera were found in all subjects. The remaining 118 genera were irregularly observed as present or not present across subjects. For example two individuals harbour 8,468 and 4,881 reads assigned to a single OTU (28.2% and 16.2% of their microbiota) assigned to Succinivibrio genus, an OTU usually found in less than 5% of the general population. This confirms that our cohort have the existence of a core microbiome24 coexisting with highly variable bacterial taxa of the human gut microbiome.4\n",

A rarefaction at 30,000 reads, followed by filtering OTUs based on a presence in at least 60% of the samples decreased the number of reads to a mean of 23,952. For some individuals such filtering leads to an inaccurate estimation of the microbial composition (Supplementary Figure\u00a01). By way of example, for five individuals, a single OTU assigned to Prevotella copri represents up to 40% of their microbiota. Filtering applied such that OTU's present in less than 60% of samples are removed would result in a finding that this bacteria represents <1% of the individual's entire fecal microbiota. In order to determine whether sensitivity to this filtering would alter the association between FUT2 and microbiota, we repeated the association analysis to include OTUs with an observed presence in at least 5% of the samples. This strategy reduces the total number of OTUs from 12,863 to 4,353 without altering the overall microbial composition (Procrustes of OTU table with no filtering against OTU table filtered based on 5% of OTUs prevalence, M2 = 0.0, p-value <10\u22126) and removed most singleton and/or spurious OTUs.25\n",

However these authors only included OTUs observed in at least 60% of the cohort reducing the number of OTUs from 4074 to 419. Here, a q-value threshold of 0.25 for a part of their analysis was used rather than the conventional p-value threshold of 0.05, thus increasing type I error.8 For comparison, we applied the same strategy, but we could still not replicate previous results.8 Finally a small cohort of 35 individuals comprising 8 non-secretor individuals found no difference in alpha diversity and beta diversity but differences in Prevotellaceae, Paraprevotellaceae were observed.32 Finally, a more recent large cohort study also found that secretor statuses are not associated with stool microbiota composition in 1,500 twins.26 Our results are thus in accordance with this larger cohort study and suggest that studies with small sample size should be replicated in well powered studies.",

In our dataset none of these pathways associations were replicated. The discordance between our report and that of Tong et\u00a0al could be due to numerous technical differences: DNA extraction (PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit versus QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit), sequencing technology (HiSeq versus MiSeq). We used the same primers to sequence the 16S gene; however, HiSeq allows the generation of a higher numbers of reads per run compared to MiSeq.30 Due to lower number of sequences generated by MiSeq we chose a rarefaction of 30,000 sequences per sample while Tong et\u00a0al. used a rarefaction of 300,000 sequences per sample. This difference in rarefaction depth might affect the presence/absence of particular OTUs with more rare OTUs and related inferred functions detected. As PICRUSt software uses OTU composition to infer bacterial function, it might be sensitive to OTUs richness and prevalence resulting in different conclusion.33 A report by Langille et\u00a0al. has demonstrated that only 105 16S sequences are required to accurately impute bacterial function.34 Thus we believe that our conclusions are robust even with a lower number of sequences per sample.",

Tong et\u00a0al. used mucosal lavage collected from the cecum and sigmoid colon.8 Rash et\u00a0al. used colonic sigmoid biopsies,9 while in our study faecal samples were used. The microbial composition is known to differ across luminal and fecal samples.35 Also, there is a decreasing gradient of fucose and ABH blood group expression from ileum to rectum.36,37 Thus the alpha (1,2) fucosylated components are likely decreased in stool as compared to sigmoid or cecal samples. In addition, age is an important factor that is associated with differences in microbial composition.38 The mean age of the GEM cohort (19.8 \u00b1 7.7) was lower than previous studies8,10,11 and thus the microbiota composition and/or inferred function in our population might be different from these studies. Nevertheless, the overall microbial composition in our cohort was consistent with that described in microbiome studies2,6 (Supplementary Figure\u00a02). Finally technical differences might explain some discrepancy such as DNA extraction, microbial identification method, primers, and regions of 16Sr RNA.39,40 Indeed, DNA extraction was different across all these study and include the FastDNAH SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals),10,11 prep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen),9 and PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories)8 while the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used in this study. These DNA extractions are known to result in differences in microbiome profiling even if the same sample was used for each extraction.39 In addition, Waclkin et\u00a0al. use DGGE, pyrosequencing and HITChip methods, while Rausch et\u00a0al. used pyrosequencing and Tong et\u00a0al. used Illumina HiSeq 2000 while Miseq was used in the GEM project.41 All these methods make it difficult to directly compare the biological output of each study. To summarise, stool sampling, DNA extraction and the age of the cohort are the three most important factors which differ between this and previous studies which could explain the absence of a FUT2 association with microbial composition and inferred function observed in this study.",

In addition no clustering based on FUT2 genotype could be observed and the alpha diversity was similar across FUT2 genotype and secreting status. However dietary habits, variation in stool sampling, and DNA extraction might explain discrepancy with other studies. In conclusion we found that FUT2 was not associated with human microbiota.

Such approaches also decrease the number of comparison made. For such reason, we decided to apply less stringent criteria to filter OTUs that are observed in at least 5% of the samples and a minimum read count of 30 across all samples, leaving 4,353 OTUs (R software v2.14.1; http://CRAN.R-project.org).
