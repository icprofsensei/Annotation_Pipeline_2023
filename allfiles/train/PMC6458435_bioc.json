However, collection of stool can be difficult from some subjects under certain experimental conditions. Sampling of fecal material using sterile swabs can streamline sample collection, handling, and processing. In this study, we validate the use of swabs of fecal matter to approximate measurements of microbiota in stool using 16S rRNA gene Illumina amplicon sequencing and evaluate the effects of shipping time at ambient temperatures on accuracy. The results indicate that swab samples reliably replicate the stool microbiota bacterial composition, alpha diversity, and beta diversity when swabs are processed quickly (\u22642\u2009days) but that sample quality quickly degrades after this period and is accompanied by increased abundances of Enterobacteriaceae. Fresh swabs appear to be a viable alternative to stool sampling when standard collection methods are challenging, but extended exposure to ambient temperatures prior to processing threatens sample integrity.",

In a study by Sinha et al., the microbial compositions of stool swabs moderately correlated with those of stool (5); however, this study assessed the similarity of swab microbiota to stool at only three different storage times (frozen immediately or frozen after 1\u2009day or after 4\u2009days at room temperature). With a similar approach, Bassis and coworkers showed that the microbiota composition determined after collecting and immediately processing rectal swabs also approximated the stool microbiota composition (6). Rectal swabs are collected by insertion of a sterile swab into the rectum; fecal swabs are collected by applying a sterile swab to freshly passed stool or toilet paper. Collection of fecal swabs represents a simpler and less disruptive approach than either stool collection or rectal swabbing, permitting its use with sensitive patients. Swab collection also simplifies sample handling and processing during collection, archiving, and DNA extraction. This facilitates sampling under busy clinical settings or by individual subjects at home.",

Swabs experiencing longer transport times (6 to 8\u2009days) were not significantly different from their stool pairs, though this appears to be due to the small sample sizes and very high variances observed with these transport times.

While the phylum Proteobacteria (represented mostly by the family Enterobacteriaceae) was overrepresented in swab samples compared to their matching stool samples (slope\u2009>\u20091), most other phyla exhibited slight overrepresentation in stool (slope\u2009<\u20091) (Fig.\u00a05).

This most likely indicates the cellular growth of Enterobacteriaceae while other populations remain largely static and are supplanted at an approximately even rate. This could also indicate death and DNA degradation of these other populations, but that scenario seems much less likely, given the short time frame of this experiment; however, we cannot discern changes to absolute abundance based on our compositional (relative abundance) sequence data.",

Stool samples and swabs could not be reliably distinguished by supervised learning classification, indicating the close resemblance between these collection methods. Long transport times were associated with the overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae (probably due to growth under aerobic conditions), decreasing the accuracy of the microbiota profiles. Prospectively, this finding could be used to further enhance the use of swabs for fecal microbiota profiling. Except in scenarios where high levels of Enterobacteriaceae are a normal constituent of the intestinal microbiota, such as following gastric bypass surgery (13, 14), Enterobacteriaceae could be used as a marker for validating swab integrity, e.g., to reject outliers that may have experienced inadequate shipping or storage. For example, in our study, 2 out of 11 swab samples received within 2\u2009days of collection still exhibited outlying relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae (Fig.\u00a04), indicating that transport time alone cannot ensure sample integrity. Modeling of the compositional changes over time could support the development of algorithms to correct for biases arising from collection and storage issues, e.g., to adjust Enterobacteriaceae relative abundance based on storage/transport time and temperature.",

However, that study did not examine the relationship between swab shipping time and Gammaproteobacteria abundance or other microbiome characteristics, as was measured in our current study, though their meta-analysis did include published studies examining the impact of room temperature storage on stool microbiota. Amir et al. (15) recommended filtering specific gammaproteobacterial sequence variants to rectify microbiome measurements from swabs stored at room temperature. However, this approach is highly specific to their study methodology; e.g., those blooming sequence variants may not generalize to different read lengths, to sequencing technologies, or to studies not included in their meta-analysis. Hence, further studies are needed to devise general strategies for mitigating room temperature storage-related blooms.",

Swabs are also considerably easier to handle and process than stool samples, streamlining collection and DNA extraction protocols. Although we found that stool and fresh swab samples could not be reliably distinguished by supervised learning classification, we do not recommend mixing stool and swab collection methods within the same study, in order to avoid introduction of experimental variation and potential sampling biases.

After defecation, fecal matter was collected from toilet paper using a sterile swab (Fisher Scientific BD culture swab item number B4320135), taking care not to contact the paper or overload the swab. Samples were shipped at room temperature and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C immediately upon arrival at the laboratory. Swab samples were primarily shipped within Arizona at different times of year, so temperatures (and, hence, shipping effects) may be slightly higher than those in other regions. The time between shipping and receipt was logged as the number of days in transit, which was used to perform the statistical analyses described below. DNA extraction and sequencing were performed as previously described, following the Earth Microbiome Project standard protocol for 16S V4 rRNA gene sequencing with 515f-806r primers (16). A total of 105 stool samples and 321 swab samples were collected and analyzed in the current study, including 82 pairs of stool and swab samples that were collected from the same source stool (Table\u00a01). Swab transport times in the original study varied from 0 to 68\u2009days; however, only days 1 to 8 contained a sufficient sample size (minimum, n\u2009=\u20093 stool-swab pairs), and these samples were used in the current study for assessing the impact of transport time on swab composition accuracy compared to that for paired stools.",

Spearman correlation coefficients were computed between transport time and median alpha diversity metrics, UniFrac distance, and Enterobacteriaceae relative abundance. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to test whether the relative abundances of the family Enterobacteriaceae were significantly different between stool samples and swab samples exposed to different transport times. Supervised learning classification was performed in q2-sample-classifier (23), using random forests classifiers (11) grown with 500 trees, trained on a random subset of the data (80%) and validated on the remaining samples.",
