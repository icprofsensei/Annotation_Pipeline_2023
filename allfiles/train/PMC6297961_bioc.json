BE is a premalignant condition that dramatically increases the risk of developing EAC [4].

Early studies on the esophageal microbiome showed that the dominant taxon within the healthy esophagus was Streptococcus [9] and that the EAC cascade is characterized by a shift towards a dominance of Gram-negative bacterial species [10]. While later studies have not been able to replicate these findings [11], others have shown enrichment of specific Gram-negative bacterial species such as Campylobacter and Fusobacterium in the EAC cascade [12, 13].",

The taxonomic community types were functionally different across both KEGG and MetaCyc (Fig.\u00a03a; Additional\u00a0file\u00a01.11), with ANOSIM showing test statistics >\u20090.4 and P\u2009=\u20090.001. Pairwise differences between clusters were confirmed with PERMANOVA (Fig.\u00a03b; Additional\u00a0file\u00a01.11C). This was also the case for the metagenomics predicted by PICRUSt from the 16S amplicon sequencing (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01.12). To determine the pathways that were enriched within each community type, LEfSe analyses were performed. A range of pathways were found to be significantly increased in each of the three community types (Fig.\u00a03c, d; Additional\u00a0file\u00a01.13 and 14). Cluster 1 was found to be enriched for glycolysis as well as pathways involved in the metabolism of short chain fatty acids, while cluster 2 was enriched for the pentose phosphate pathway as well as fructose and mannose metabolism (Fig.\u00a03c; Additional\u00a0file\u00a01.13). Of particular interest, cluster 3 was enriched for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.",

Microbial taxa associated with age were examined using DistLM (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03.1). Notably, age was positively correlated with the relative abundance of Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus parasanguinis but not Streptococcus mitis/oralis/pneumoniae. In contrast, it was inversely correlated with P. melaninogenica but not P. pallens, suggesting that age may contribute to but not fully explain the different esophageal microbial community types. Similar to the taxonomic composition, a significant effect of age (KEGG: pseudo-F\u2009=\u20093.7; P\u2009=\u20090.004, df\u2009=\u200997; MetaCyc: pseudo-F\u2009=\u20093.6; P\u2009=\u20090.007, df\u2009=\u200997) on microbiome function was found.

Three host SNPs [NOTCH2 rs327202, STEAP2-AS1 rs56968594, and NREP (P311) rs57227445] were validated in the allele and genotype analyses using PERMANOVA (Fig.\u00a06b; Additional\u00a0file\u00a04.5). SNPs in LINC01822 (rs4611672; P\u2009=\u20090.078) and MUC19 (rs2933353; P\u2009=\u20090.16) did not reach significance in the validation studies (Fig.\u00a06b; Additional\u00a0file\u00a04.5).",

Here, the esophageal microbiome was comprehensively assessed using 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well as shotgun metagenomics in esophageal brushings of a cohort of prospectively recruited subjects. The esophageal microbiome was found to cluster into community types termed \u201cesotypes.\u201d The defining characteristic of the esotypes was the dominant organisms, with one type being dominated by S. mitis/oralis/pneumoniae, the other P. melaninogenica, P. pallens, and Veillonella, and the third Prevotella, H. parainfluenzae, and R. mucilaginosa. However, another differentiating factor was microbial richness and evenness, with the esotype enriched for Streptococcus having lower levels than the other two esotypes. A co-exclusion relationship between the two dominant taxa Streptococcus and Prevotella was consistently observed in the esophageal microbiome, which appears to drive the formation of the community types. There is precedent in the literature for the clustering of the microbiome into community types with the lower gut microbiome now accepted to cluster into enterotypes [14, 15] and the vaginal microbiome clustering into several vaginotypes [16]. There is also a similar antagonistic relationship reported between two of the dominant taxa within the gut microbiome Bacteroides and Prevotella [17]. Further evidence to support our conclusions comes from the finding that samples from different locations in the lower esophagus of the same individual consistently clustered into the same esotype regardless of inflammation or disease.",

While effects of age on the abundances of Streptococcus spp. and Prevotella spp. were identified, age did not appear to influence S. mitis/oralis/pneumoniae abundance, one of the more abundant Streptococcus taxa. This suggested that age may contribute to the development of esotypes but not fully explain their presence in the cohort. The influence of age on the esophageal microbiome is to be expected given that it influences the composition of the oral and gut microbiota [19\u201321]. PPI usage was found to have a mild effect on the esophageal microbiome. PPIs are known to significantly impact the lower gut microbiota [22], likely due to decreasing acid levels in the stomach. The effect of PPI on the esophageal microbiota may also be related to acid levels given that the effect was stronger in GERD patients as compared to subjects with a normal esophagus. Of interest, PPI usage appeared to increase the levels of bacterial antibiotic production pathways which may also contribute to shaping the composition of the microbiome post-PPI therapy.",

However, an enrichment of a wide range of Gram-negative bacterial taxa commonly associated with the oral cavity was found in GERD, GM, and BE when compared to subjects with a normal esophagus. These included Leptotrichia, Fusobacterium, Rothia, Campylobacter, and Capnocytophaga. This would suggest that disease may be associated with an enrichment of a diverse set of organisms with common properties rather than specific organisms and is supported by the finding that each esotype responded differently during GERD. The enrichment of networks of oral bacteria taxa have been shown in gastric cancer [23] and colorectal cancer [24] and have been linked to inflammation in the gut [25]. Further, lactic acid production pathways (homolactic and heterolactic fermentation) were increased in the EAC cascade. Dysregulated lactate metabolism is one of the hallmarks of carcinogenesis [26]; thus, the microbial contribution towards lactate availability and how that impacts host cells should be explored further, given that a similar increase in lactate-producing bacteria has been reported in gastric adenocarcinoma [23].",

An additional two SNPs, LINC01822 rs4611672 and MUC19 rs2933353, were found to have borderline relationships. The association with SNPs in NREP and NOTCH2 would suggest that the transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) [27, 28] and Notch signaling pathways are linked to the esophageal microbiome, which is of interest given that both are involved in the EAC cascade [3]. It is currently unclear what role STEAP2-AS1 plays in the host, but STEAP2 is a metalloreductase involved in iron and copper uptake and reduction, and has been linked to fatty acid metabolism as well as the response to inflammation [29]. While the association with MUC19 rs2933353 was not significant, given that MUC19 is a salivary mucin that plays a role in pathogen clearance in the oral cavity [30] and SNPs in this gene are associated with Crohn\u2019s disease [31], further validation of this association in a larger cohort would be required.",

These subjects may be prescribed PPIs due to some mild reflux symptoms; however, no reflux esophagitis is detected through histology. Patients found with glandular mucosa but without any presence of intestinal metaplasia were classified within the GM group. Subjects who had been prescribed antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the 2-month period prior to recruitment were excluded. A set of two samples were collected at endoscopy, an oesophageal brushing for assessment of the microbiome and an oesophageal biopsy from the same location as the brushing for histological analysis to be conducted by the pathology services at Prince of Wales Hospital. The brushing to assess the microbiome was collected first, and extreme care was taken to ensure the non-reusable brush was not contaminated by saliva. In patients where possible Barrett\u2019s esophagus was suspected after visual examination, an additional set of samples were collected from a region adjacent to the metaplastic region. Information pertaining to gender, age, and medication use was obtained from the medical records of each subject at the time of endoscopy. Researchers were blinded to the results of the histological analysis until sequencing was completed. Ethics approval was obtained from the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 13/375 and HREC 16/020).

PICRUSt [35] was employed to predict metagenomics from 16S rRNA gene relative abundance data following classification with the GreenGenes database [36]. Extraction controls in the form of kit buffers and PCR reagents are routinely sequenced in our lab (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S6A) and show no overlap with our samples. An empty brushing sample extracted and sequenced among our 16S amplicon sequencing samples (sample: H76EX in ENA submission) showed high levels of Ralstonia and Bradyrhizobium and a very minimal amount of carry-over from other samples sequenced on the same run (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S6B).",

Paired-end raw reads were trimmed with the BWA trimming mode at a threshold of Q13 (P\u2009=\u20090.05) using the read trimmer module DynamicTrim. Filtered reads that were less than 50\u2009bp in length were then discarded using LengthSort. MetaPhlAn2 [38] was employed to generate taxonomic profiles from the shotgun reads, while HUMAnN2 (HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network) [39] was used to determine the metabolic contributions within the samples. The HUMAnN2 pipeline involved mapping of the metagenomic reads against Uniref orthologous gene family, MetCyc UniPathway, and KEGG.
