However, much of what is known about the behavior of oral species to date derives from pure culture approaches and the studies combining several cultivated species, which likely does not fully reflect their function in complex microbial communities. It has been shown in studies with a limited number of cultivated species that early oral biofilm development occurs in a successional manner and that continuous low pH can lead to an enrichment of aciduric species. Observations that in vitro grown plaque biofilm microcosms can maintain similar pH profiles in response to carbohydrate addition as plaque in vivo suggests a complex microbial community can be established in the laboratory. In light of this, our primary goal was to develop a robust in vitro biofilm-model system from a pooled saliva inoculum in order to study the stability, reproducibility, and development of the oral microbiome, and its dynamic response to environmental changes from the community to the molecular level.",

From the first discovery that dental plaque pH will decrease after sucrose consumption and then return to baseline values [3,4], the oral microbial community has been a highly studied system not only because of its health-related significance but also for demonstrating interactions between species and functional analysis of multi-species communities in general [5-7]. Difficulties in studying this complex and structurally heterogeneous environment are multifaceted, and include problems related to the species variability of human subjects, continuous access to samples over time, small sample sizes and complicated ethical issues. This has led to the development of both synthetic consortia biofilm model systems and in vitro microcosm plaque from the human natural oral flora by using growth systems, including chemostats [8], the constant-depth film fermentor (CDFF) [9], saliva-conditioned flow cells [10,11] and artificial mouths [12]. Results from these studies show that the multispecies biofilms, containing a hand full of bacterial species, are functionally reproducible with heterogeneous structures and pH behaviors consistent with those of natural plaque [13,14]. As investigators started to understand that the microbial diversity within the oral microbiome is highly important in both health and disease they began to explore multiple species interactions by using mixed-species models consisting of up to 10 defined species. This led to the synthesis of the 'ecological plaque hypothesis,\u2019 which proposes that selection of cariogenic bacteria is directly coupled to alterations in the environment that shifts the balance of the community [15]. According to this hypothesis, if the pH remains below the critical pH (value of 5.5) for demineralization for extended time periods after a carbohydrate pulse, a shift in the bacterial populations to more cariogenic organisms that are acid-producing (acidogenic) and acid-tolerant (aciduric) occurs [16,17]. Another important aspect of this hypothesis is that any species with relevant traits can contribute to the disease process [15,18]. This was also supported by multiple findings that bacterial species, other than well-known pathogens (for example, Streptococcus mutans) are present in caries-active sites [19,20]. Also, a recent study shows that one can detect several low-pH active species present in a healthy plaque, which may be responsible for the onset of caries disease [21].",

The major goal of the HMP was to characterize bacterial communities that are associated with several different body sites as well as generate a catalog of reference genomes from species derived from human hosts [26]. The HOMD specifically contains information on the prokaryotic species present in the human oral cavity and has the capacity to link sequence data with phenotypic, phylogenetic, clinical and bibliographic information. The curated version of HOMD, published by Dewhirst and colleagues in 2010 contains approximately 619 validated taxa with 1,178 total taxa identified, of which 24% are named, 8% are cultivated but unnamed and 68% represented uncultivated phylotypes [27]. Human oral taxa are defined as sharing 98.5% similarity in 16S rRNA (henceforth abbreviated as 16S) gene sequences [27]. A major hurdle to understanding the oral microbiome is the unknown contribution of the very large uncultivated fraction of the existing bacterial diversity. In fact, the greatest number of the 'most wanted taxa\u2019 (that is, those that have been seen by 16S sequencing but remain uncultivated) targeted for whole genome sequencing in the human body reside in the oral cavity [28,29]. The identity of these oral phylotypes can only be linked to possible functions by using techniques such as nucleic acid-based stable isotope probing (SIP) [21] or single-cell genomics based sequencing approaches [30,31]. Moreover, due to the high taxonomic variability of the oral microbiome between study subjects it is extremely difficult to track species and strains temporally and spatially [23]. Also, small sample sizes that are dictated by availability of volunteers and costs, limit the statistical power needed to detect small, but important differences among communities. Hence, to gain a deeper ecological understanding of the processes that are involved in the gradual succession of healthy oral microbiomes to disease-associated microbiomes, it is important to continue the development of oral microbial model systems where experiments can be conducted in a controlled environment. The advantages with such systems are many as they provide novel opportunities to study microbial community ecology with systems biology perspectives by using global omics experimental tools (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics). A model system also allows for generating biological replicates and contributes to the analyses of large samples that are needed to obtain reliable spatial and temporal dynamics data of bacterial populations within a community.",

We used a recently developed growth medium (SHI medium) that previously was shown to support growth of a highly diverse microbiome and that also had a high coverage of species found in the original inoculum saliva samples obtained from healthy adults [32]. To evaluate the reproducibility of this in vitro model system and to address its overall metabolic potential we applied both conventional community fingerprinting, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and next-generation sequencing. The broader taxonomic reproducibility of biofilms growing in two different research laboratories was tested by comparing 16S gene profiles from DGGE. To obtain a broader understanding of the whole biofilm community diversity, deep sequencing of 16S genes via 454-pyrosequencing and whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform was performed. To our knowledge, the model we have developed represents the highest oral bacterial diversity that has been reported for an in vitro system thus far. This model can be used to gain a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms that underlie the evolution of healthy oral microbiomes into disease-associated microbiomes where cariogenic groups such as mutans streptococci and Lactobaccilli become more abundant [7,19,33,34]. This model will also aid in the understanding of oral microbial communities by facilitating discovery and functional characterization of known, as well as uncultivated bacteria, within a mixed-species system that is approaching the diversity of in vivo conditions. Importantly, it will allow systematic investigation of species, specific genes/domains, gene products and metabolic pathways that define the synergistic and competitive contributions to health and disease in the complex oral microbiome.",

[32]) within a sterile 24-well plate, 200 \u03bcl of saliva supernatant was added to each well. This pre-coating of wells allows attached pellicle growth. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C with the lid open for 1 hr to dry the saliva coating.

Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C under anaerobic conditions for 16 hrs to allow biofilm formation. The biofilms were carefully washed twice with a buffered chemically defined medium (CDM), which is fully described in [21]. After the washing steps, biofilms were starved (that is, incubated without carbon source) in fresh CDM medium (pH 7) for 2 hrs in 37\u00b0C and incubated under anaerobic conditions (Table\u00a01). After starvation the biofilms were harvested for DNA extraction and 16S gene analyses by using 454-pyrosequencing as explained below.

Biofilms representing the batch-2 samples were a part of a stable isotope probing (SIP) time-series study (unpublished) in which a series of samples were subjected to 13C-labelled glucose amendments in the CDM buffer as described in McLean et al. 2012 [21]. However, the batch-2 samples described in this study were not fed labeled 13C-glucose, as they served as controls and were collected immediately (time point zero hours of incubation). The DNA from the SIP-treated biofilm replicate samples (batch-2 samples) was separated by centrifugation against a cesium chloride (CsCl) density-gradient [21]. The sample processing of these particular samples was conducted as follows: (1) entire DNA was extracted from each sample and loaded into the gradient solution; (2) gradient formation was achieved by centrifugation at 265,000 \u00d7 g for 66 hrs in a Beckman VTi65 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA); (3) fractions were collected (400 \u03bcl) and the DNA was isolated using a YM-100 Microcon column (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA); (4) columns were washed four times with TE buffer and purified DNA was eluted into 50-\u03bcl volumes. Biofilm samples representing batch 1 and batch 3 were not subjected to ultracentrifugation. After genomic DNA extraction and quantification, all samples were prepared for 16S amplification and titanium-based 454-pyrosequencing at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) Joint Technology Center (JTC). Genomic DNA sample concentrations were normalized to 2 to 6 ng/\u03bcl. The V3 to V5 region of 16S genes was amplified according to the previously developed protocol available at http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7402/extref/nature11209-s1.pdf[23]. Using each sample's individual barcodes, the 454 sequence data were deconvolved into the respective samples. After trimming the bar codes, low-quality and short sequences (<100 bp) were removed by using the JCVI 16S pipeline. Subsequently, the remaining filtered reads were aligned against the SILVA database of 16S to verify that the reads were indeed 16S. The Chimera Slayer tool was used to filter out potentially chimeric reads [32].",

In previous studies of biodiverse model biofilm systems a major approach has been to construct synthetic plaque-like consortia represented by a handful of plaque species [18,48-50]. Other methods represent inoculating and growing bacteria from natural saliva in plaque microcosms such as the artificial mouth [12,51-54]. The latter studies of natural saliva focus solely on physiological responses and do not consider taxonomic diversity at 16S gene level. Studies that derive from less diverse synthetic plaque communities show intriguing examples of how certain oral bacteria form advantageous partnerships that are necessary for growth of other species and that these partnerships sometimes are also observed in vivo[55-57]. Each model system has strengths, limitations and difficulties. However, they all represent better study models than the uncontrollable environment of the mouth. A major challenge when using any oral model system is to maintain a representative diversity of the indigenous oral microbiome. This was specifically addressed in a previous study by Tian and colleagues [32], who developed a growth medium (SHI medium) that supported a remarkably high number of oral taxa in vitro from a small number of human saliva samples which were inoculated and grown as biofilms. Here we employed this medium with the goal to select for the highest possible diversity representative of the oral cavity, high reproducibility and stability at the species level in this in vitro biofilm model.",

This enabled us to study numerous replicate samples simultaneously by using multiple analyses approaches such as 454-pyrosequencing of 16S genes, measurement of pH and sugar levels during growth and future comparative studies on the saliva pool, such as metabolomics and metatranscriptomics. Another important aspect of the pooling of saliva samples was that it allowed us to domesticate previously uncultivable community members, such as those belonging to the candidate phylum TM7 and the genus Porphyromonas[58]. Several of these community members would most likely have been missed if we had studied saliva from one single person due to the high taxonomic variability between humans [33]. However, a limitation of using a pool of saliva samples deriving from several individuals as inoculum in the in vitro model system is that the native community integrity is lost as the samples are mixed together. Most likely, each person who participated in this study harbored a unique saliva microbiome, which may not be accurately reflected from a community diversity perspective here. Clearly, in future studies it is important to address how a single person\u2019s microbiome evolves taxonomically and metabolically over time in our in vitro model and to what extent species within a native community accomplish certain functions only in their native setting as compared to when they are mixed with other community members from other individuals.",

The responses to two carbon source concentrations added to the SHI medium (0.1% and 0.5% sucrose) and a control with no sucrose were tested by sequencing 16S genes from the resulting biofilms grown in vitro. We found that 0.5% sucrose was able to maintain the saliva-derived diversity in biofilms most similar to the saliva inoculum in terms of the genera observed (see Additional file 2: Figure S1). In contrast, the no-sucrose biofilm was less diverse and was dominated by a single Streptococcus species, S. mitis. The 0.1% sucrose-amended sample was similar to the one grown in the presence of 0.5% sucrose but had a higher proportion of subgingival community members, such as Porphyromonas. This confirmed that 0.5% sucrose was the better choice for our model and that the taxonomic diversity responds rapidly to environmental changes.",

This particular response has been acknowledged for decades as the classic Stephan curve where oral acidogenic bacteria rapidly metabolize fermentable carbohydrates producing acidic byproducts and then the pH returns to baseline [3,4]. When we initiated biofilm incubation with 0.5% glucose in fresh CDM the pH started to drop instantly (see Additional file 3: Figure S2). pH was neutral in the beginning of the incubation and decreased to 4.5 after 4 hours. At 6 hours it had reached its lowest level (4.2) and then it started to recover. Glucose concentrations followed the same falling pattern and after 5 hours were below the detection limit (20 mg/dl) showing a rapid turnover of this substrate by bacteria in the biofilms (see Additional file 3: Figure S2). Rapid glucose utilization and conversion to lactate and acetate was also shown in this CDM for S. mutans and fresh plaque samples derived from children using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques [21,59]. These results confirm that our in vitro model system shows a similar physiological response to a glucose challenge as previously described for dental plaque and in vitro-tested salivary sediments [60,61]. Overall, the response of this model biofilm is consistent with dental plaque containing species capable of lowering and also raising the pH.",

Although the saliva inoculum was shared, completely independent media reagents and growth procedures were carried out in the respective labs. The resulting replicate gel images were aligned and 16S band patterns were compared for samples that had been incubated with or without 0.5% sucrose, showing that despite the variations between labs, the resulting community composition was highly reproducible. The majority of the DGGE bands showed similar fluorescence intensity across replicates and only one major band was missing in the replicate samples deriving from the JCVI laboratory (see Additional file 4: Figure S3).",

Included were two biofilm samples (batch 2, well 1 and 2) that had been subjected to 66 hours of DNA centrifugation, which served as a control in a parallel SIP experiment (unpublished). The biofilm samples batches 1, 2, and 3 were all grown and processed on different days to assess the reproducibility of batches at different time points; replicate growth wells from batches 2 and 3 were compared to address the variation between biofilm growth wells. Similarities in OTU diversity between replicates from all biofilm batches and from saliva inoculum samples were estimated using CA (Figure\u00a01). In CA, the saliva samples were similar and clustered together but separately from the biofilm samples. The biofilm libraries that derived from batch 2 clustered separately from biofilm samples representing batches 1 and 3 that formed a separate cluster. The difference between batch 2 and the other biofilm samples was most likely due to the fact that the batch 2 samples were centrifuged over an extensive period of time in a CsCl gradient, which according to many SIP studies will separate high GC DNA from low GC and thus likely resulted in a skewed 16S profile. Regardless of this difference however, these centrifuged samples were highly similar to each other, and the community profiles for replicate biofilm samples were highly reproducible, which supports their potential to serve as replicate samples for experiments in which a particular treatment is compared.",

                    "text": "In order to assess the bacterial phylogenetic diversity in saliva and biofilm samples at a higher resolution, reference sequences from the HOMD were used to taxonomically classify 16S genes from this study (Figure\u00a02; Additional file 5: Table S2). Matching HOT designations and their log-transformed abundance values were aligned on the outside of an in-house constructed HOMD-phylogenetic tree (see Methods) at their corresponding branch tips. Within the HOMD-classified 16S genes that were obtained from this study more strain diversity (that is, sequences showing >98.5% sequence similarity) was observed but is not included here. In total, 6 phyla and 41 genera of bacteria were identified in the different samples (singletons included) (Figure\u00a02). These corresponded to 264 HOT designations of which 131 also could be detected in one or several biofilm samples. Several of the dominant genera (for example, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Prevotella) were equally abundant in samples grown at different time points and in samples grown in different incubation wells, showing that the biofilms grown in vitro are highly reproducible (Figure\u00a03). This was also shown by the low standard deviations of HOT abundance values between replicate libraries, which ranged between 0.1% and 8% across replicate samples. Of particular note, 51 uncultivated HOT designations belonging to the Streptococcus, Granulicatella, Haemophilus, Lactobacillus, Parvimonas, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Solobacterium, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, Porphyromonas and TM7 G-2 genera could be identified in the biofilm growth wells (Figure\u00a03B). Identification of the most abundant genera in saliva and biofilm samples was done by removing genera that encompassed HOT-designations that contributed with two hundred or fewer 16S genes counts, corresponding to <0.3% of total 16S gene abundance (Table\u00a02). Two genera (Streptococcus and Veillonella) were detected in biofilms when using the latter criteria while nine were identified when including the rare community members (those that were represented with \u2264200 16S gene counts). These results show that most of the diversity in the in vitro biofilms could be attributed to the Streptococcus and Veillonella genera, which is in line with previous findings of healthy oral microbiomes [33].",

The most dominant HOT designations belonged to S. vestibularis, S. salivarus, S. mitis, S. parasanguinis and a variety of understudied Streptococcus sp. strains (Figure\u00a03). S. vestibularis HOT-021 contributed approximately 40% to the total 16S abundance in all replicate biofilm samples, whereas S. salivarus (HOT-755) and the uncultivated phylotype Streptococcus sp (HOT-C65) both contributed 10% each. S. vestibualris is a normal inhabitant of the oral cavity and has rarely been associated with human disease except in a few cases of infectious endocarditis, early neonatal sepsis and bacteremia in cancer patients [64]. Also, S. vestibularis was previously shown to produce only low levels of caries in rats when compared to other Streptococcus species (for example, S. salivarus) [65]. The impacts on oral human health of S. salivarus span a broad range from being strongly cariogenic [66,67] to caries-protective by hydrolyzing urea to ammonia [68-70]. S. parasanguinis strains HOT-721 and HOT-711 were also abundant in the in vitro biofilms but contributed only half of the 16S sequence read-abundance when compared to S. salivarus and Streptococcus sp. HOT-C65. The ecological role of S. parasanguinis in oral health is also poorly understood but due to its capacity to ferment multiple carbohydrates to lactate and other organic acids it is considered to be a moderately acid-tolerant organism and a cariogenic species [71,72]. Previous studies show that it has been significantly associated with both caries in young children and healthy oral flora [73,74]. Our in vitro biofilm model supports growth of several S. parasanguinis strains in concert and can be used to test these relationships further.",

They are commonly observed in advanced caries and are isolated on low pH agar [75-77]. In the in vitro biofilms two Lactobacillus species (L. fermentum HOT-608 and Lactobacillus sp. HOT-A89) could be identified at a low abundance (average 0.8%), which is relatively close to the abundance of L. fermentum (0.2%) observed in the clone libraries used to generate the HOMD. This represents an opportunity to challenge the model and track the increase in these cariogenic species, simulating a transition from a healthy community to a more disease-like state.",

It has also been suggested that the presence of Veillonella could possibly be used as a predictor of future caries in caries-free children and that it has a close and complex relationship to the pathogen S. mutans, which also was detected in this study [20,80].",

Therefore, we applied an OTU-based approach to complement the above classification approach. These results show that OTU richness was lower in biofilm samples compared to saliva samples, ranging from 65 OTUs in the batch-2 well-1 sample to 156 OTUs in the batch-3 and batch-2 samples (Table\u00a03). In line with these results, the Shannon entropy (H) index was also slightly higher in the saliva-derived samples (4.39 to 4.72) compared to the biofilm samples where H varied from 4.11 to 4.23. Although it is clear that the biofilms at this selected time point do not fully capture every species found in a saliva sample, the in vitro biofilms in this study contain the highest 16S diversity identified so far within an in vitro oral model system.",

This was shown in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and enzyme classification comparison-analyses where major pathways (for example, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, metabolism of cofactors, vitamins, terpenoids, polyketides, lipids, amino acids, energy, nucleotides and translation) were more similar for the oral sites compared to anterior nares (external position of nostrils), mid vagina and posterior fornix (area behind lower portion of uterus) body sites. Comparing the enzyme classification of the body sites at lower levels further supports the overall functional similarities with supragingival plaque (Figure\u00a04; Additional file 6: Figure S4 and Additional file 7: Figure S5). These findings are in line with the HMP study of healthy Western subjects which revealed that there is large variation in carriage of taxa (community structure) but stable metabolic pathways exist across individuals for many body sites including supragingival plaque [23]. Here the 16S datasets and our WGS data show that our in vitro biofilm model has a different but stable taxonomic diversity, which harbors a highly similar metabolic potential representative of the human oral cavity. Taken together, both the results of this study and the HMP study suggests that some variation in the relative proportions of taxa in a model system such as this may be tolerated, as the functional capabilities (carbohydrate utilization and pH buffering) of the community may remain similarly stable and allow us to gain some fundamental understanding as to what is happening in vivo.",

Initially, at 3 hrs of growth, S. parasanguinis represented the most dominant community member, contributing approximately 25% to the total read abundance. S. cristatus and S. salivarus were also dominant members at this stage, each contributing approximately 15% to the total read abundance. As pH decreased, the abundance of S. parasanguinis and S. cristatus decreased until reaching 16 hrs. At 48 hrs Lactobacillus fermentum had increased significantly in relative abundance whereas Klebsiella pneumonia had decreased from circa 20 to 10% between 16 and 48 hrs of biofilm development. pH, which was measured over a time period of 48 hrs, reached its lowest levels of pH 4.4 at 16 hrs when the abundance of the acidogenic and cariogenic species Lactobacillus fermentum started to increase (Figure\u00a05). It is likely that inhibition of metabolism, due to low pH and possibly carbohydrate limitation, starts to impact growth of some community members between 12 and 16 hrs and this leads to a shift in the community structure. Moreover, the number of bacterial species that was identified using the MetaPhlan tool was the highest after 48 hrs of growth, showing that this species diversity was still increasing over time (Figure\u00a05). Growth development and bacterial activity are important aspects that need to be addressed in future studies by sampling with higher temporal resolution in the early stages of growth and coupling this to measurements of live biomass and possibly transcription changes.",

With this information, we can possibly modulate the community to resemble an early or later stage of development. Likewise, it would be interesting to test how the biofilm develops and differs if a saliva pool of diseased subjects is used. Its usefulness in human health research could span a wide range, as saliva pools with different origin could be collected and inoculated based on the tested hypotheses (for example, inoculum can represent saliva from diseased human subjects or healthy subjects with highly different microbiomes). Overall, these results reflect that this model system maintains a high number of species that can be used to study both the healthy (pH balancing) and acid-tolerant species associated with disease.",

In the human oral cavity the proportions of uncultured species are lower (approximately 60%) than in other environments [87-89]; however, the missing species are a significant impediment to the study of human health. The use of an in vitro model system with a highly complex bacterial diversity that also supports growth of uncultivated oral species is highly desirable, as it can be manipulated and studied in a controlled environment. To our knowledge, the model we developed here is the first validated system at the species and gene level that fulfills these criteria and that can be readily used to target changes in taxa, regulation of metabolic pathways and signaling molecules, using next-generation sequencing and omics methodologies. For the 131 HOT designations that were identified in the in vitro biofilms 48 fully sequenced genomes are available through HOMD, showing that we now have the ability to perform in-depth genome analyses at the community level. Longitudinal studies of an in vitro model system such as this will generate deeper fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms regulating bacterial taxonomic diversity and community functions in both health and disease. Specifically, such a model system will help facilitate experimental approaches that seek answers to questions concerning caries-related diseases and how oral pathogens can be eradicated. We hope that it will be used in future research as a tool to understand and combat the development of oral disease.",
