We recently developed a metagenomic read cloud sequencing and assembly approach that generates improved draft genomes for individual organisms compared to conventional short-read sequencing and assembly methods.

While diversity is restored at the final time point, this occurs without recovery of the original species and strain-level composition. Draft genomes for individual organisms within each sample were generated using both read cloud and conventional assembly. Read clouds were found to improve the completeness and contiguity of genome assemblies compared to conventional assembly. Moreover, read clouds enabled the placement of antibiotic resistance genes present in multiple copies both within a single draft genome and across multiple organisms. The occurrence of resistance genes associates with the timing of antibiotics administered to the patient, and comparative genomic analysis of the various intestinal E. coli strains across time points as well as the bloodstream isolate showed that the subject\u2019s E. coli bloodstream infection likely originated from the intestine. The E. coli genome from the initial pre-transplant stool sample harbors 46 known antimicrobial resistance genes, while all other species from the pre-transplant sample each contain at most 5 genes, consistent with a model of heavy antibiotic exposure resulting in selective outgrowth of the highly antibiotic-resistant E. coli.",

In silico reconstruction of complete and contiguous genomes for individual organisms within a sequenced population remains a major challenge in the field of metagenomics. This is a challenging problem when using conventional shotgun short-read sequencing and assembly methods because short reads alone may not be able to determine the correct positions of DNA sequences that are both longer than the sequenced DNA fragment length (usually 50\u2013300 base pairs) and present in multiple copies at different locations in the metagenome. The presence of such repeated regions (e.g. insertion sequences or the bacterial 16S rRNA gene) often result in fragmented assemblies where multiple instances of the repeated sequence are collapsed into a single contig instead of correctly placed in between unique flanking regions in multiple genomic locations.",

This method has also been termed \u201clinked-read sequencing.\u201d The main difference between read cloud and conventional short-read sequencing is that read cloud sequencing augments the library preparation stage to ultimately generate \u201cread clouds,\u201d which are short-read sequences annotated with long-range information in the form of molecular barcodes. This is achieved by physically partitioning long DNA fragments into nanoliter-scale droplets and subsequently tagging all sequencing reads originating from a long fragment with a droplet-specific molecular barcode. Read cloud sequencing offers a favorable combination of long-range information, high base call accuracy, high throughput, and low input DNA mass requirements [1]. The 10x Genomics Chromium platform is a commercially available read cloud library preparation system that automates the pipetting steps necessary to generate the molecular barcodes. Recently, we developed an approach to adapt read cloud sequencing for metagenomic applications. The resultant barcoded data is deconvolved and genome draft assembly is achieved using a combination of existing standard genome assemblers as well as a custom assembly tool called Athena [2]. We have recently applied the approach to sequence ocean sediment samples and the healthy human microbiome, for which it was able to generate contiguous draft genomes for individual organisms from bacterial mixtures [2].",

During HCT, patients initially undergo intensive treatment with chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy; this \u2018conditioning regimen\u2019 serves to prepare patients to receive a hematopoietic stem cell graft. Multipotent hematopoietic stem cells derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood are then infused into the patient to reconstitute all blood cell lines. The procedure can be curative but comes with high risk for complications, including infection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), an inflammatory disease where donor immune cells attack the recipient\u2019s healthy tissue. Intestinal microbial dysbiosis preceding and following HCT has been found to be associated with an increased risk for developing bloodstream infections [3]. Previous studies also show that decreased intestinal diversity is associated with development of GVHD and higher overall mortality in HCT [4]. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and other drugs administered during the course of HCT can greatly change the composition of the gut microbiota. In some cases, such microbial dysbiosis leads to domination of the intestine by a few or even a single genus or species, increasing the likelihood of complications like bloodstream infections in these immunocompromised patients [3]. Intestinal domination may happen because certain bacterial strains carry an advantage, such as antibiotic resistance, that enables them to flourish after other antibiotic-sensitive commensal microbes are eliminated. While intestinal domination is relatively common in this patient population, the process by which it occurs is not well-understood.",

We assigned a taxonomic designation to an entire bin if greater than 60% of contigs in the bin shared the same Kraken2 identification. For each resulting bin, which represents an organism draft genome, we used QUAST to assess the size and contiguity of the assembly [19]. We used CheckM to calculate metrics of genome completeness (existence of expected core genes) and contamination (duplication of core genes expected to exist in single copy) for each draft genome [20].

We also included the full genome for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli strain S88 (NCBI accession CU928161.2) in the analysis as a comparison. For each pair of assembled draft genomes of the various E. coli strains, we calculated the percent nucleotide identity, number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and total number of aligned bases. Additionally, we generated syntenic dotplots for each pairwise comparison using the mummerplot script with layout option (\u2212l), which reorders and orients the contigs to the main diagonal of the plot for optimal viewing [23].",

Interestingly, Enterococcus faecium is >\u200999.9% similar between samples B, C and D, but much different at time point E (~\u200996% similarity, E compared to other time points). This suggests the same dominant strain of Enterococcus faecium is retained though the E. coli domination event, but a different strain is acquired or dominant by time point E. Similar results were achieved with short-read and Athena assemblies, when data were available. Taken together, these results suggest that dominant original strains are not retained in the microbiome through the clinical time course. However, this analysis cannot rule out lowly abundant strains that did not contribute to the genome assembly, which could be present either before or after the E. coli domination event.",

An assembly\u2019s N50 is a metric of contiguity defined as the length of the shortest sequence such that 50% of the entire assembled genome is included in contigs of greater or equal length (higher N50 indicates greater contiguity). The draft genome for sample C was the most contiguous and complete E. coli assembly, containing 5.16\u2009Mb of sequence in 23 contigs with an N50 of 1.32\u2009Mb.

Herein, we use the term resistance gene to refer to any gene present within the CARD database, which comprises genes known to confer antibiotic resistance and regulators of such genes. In the entire metagenome assembled for sample A, we detected several resistance genes present in multiple copies: tetO (7 copies), cfxA3 (5 copies), mefA (3 copies), tetQ (3 copies), tet(40) (2 copies), and ermF (2 copies). We found that copies of identical resistance genes occurred both within the genome of the same organism and among different organisms. For instance, tetO was present on 3 contigs that all belonged to the Lachnospiraceae bin, and it was also present in single copy in draft genomes classified as Blautia sp., Clostridium, Eubacterium rectale, and Ruminococcus gnavus. Inspection of the genomic regions of the 3 Lachnospiraceae contigs containing tetO revealed that the regions with the resistance gene share some homology but are not completely identical. Note that no resistance gene duplication was observed for sample C. For sample D, a set of 13 resistance genes (acrB, acrD, baeR, cpxA, CRP, emrB, emrR, marA, mdtB, mdtC, msbA, patA, and sul1) was detected in the draft genomes of both E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Although both organisms share this same set of genes, we did not find evidence for horizontal gene transfer because the genes themselves are not identical (different numbers of mismatch from the reference), and the contigs on which the genes are present have homology in the region of the resistance genes but are not completely identical as determined by alignment dotplots of the contig pairs. For sample E, the dfrF gene appeared in 5 distinct copies in 4 different organism bins. Positive selection for the dfrF gene may have potentially occurred given that trimethoprim was administered to the patient prior to time point E.",

Compared to read cloud assembly, a greater proportion of resistance genes detected in the conventional data are unique (in single copy) within their assembly as genes present in multiple copies are collapsed into a single sequence in the absence of barcode information. The specific resistance genes detected within each read cloud and conventional sample as well as alignment metrics are listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a03. These results show that the ability to resolve numerous copies of the same resistance gene present in one or multiple distinct organisms within the proper genomic context is a notable technological advantage of the read cloud sequencing over conventional methods.",

Assuming that the assembled E. coli genome for a given time point represents the most abundant strain of E. coli in the sample, significant genomic differences across time could indicate acquisition of a new strain, selection and subsequent outgrowth of a previously low-abundance strain, or possible remodeling of the genome. We also hypothesized that the particular strain of E. coli producing the bloodstream infection could be traced back to the gut microbiome based on our previous findings in [5]. To assess E. coli strain similarities, we aligned pairs of E. coli draft genomes from the various stool time points and the bloodstream isolate against each other (see Methods). Table\u00a02 lists the average percent nucleotide identity, total number of SNPs, and total bases aligned for each pair of genomes. We also included NCBI E. coli S88 reference genome in the analysis to serve as a comparison to a strain that is also a known extraintestinal pathogen but unrelated to our patient.\n",

The number of SNPs ranged from 371 to 3811 (compared to 56,513 SNPs with the S88 reference) and percent nucleotide identity ranged from 99.91 to 99.98% (compared to 98.61% identity with the S88 reference). Somewhat interestingly, the bloodstream isolate (day +\u200960) genome most closely matched the draft genome from sample C (day +\u200927) with 182 SNPs and 99.99% nucleotide identity, even though the patient\u2019s clinical manifestation of bloodstream infection occurred after time point D (day +\u200933) with 3742 SNPs and 99.91% identity. The low number of SNPs and high percent identity between the stool sample E. coli strains and the bloodstream isolate reveal that the same E. coli strain existing in the patient\u2019s intestine prior to HCT likely persisted in spite of antibiotics, expanded to dominate the gut, and also eventually caused the patient\u2019s bloodstream infection. Our group initially analyzed the short-read libraries of these samples via an orthogonal bioinformatic approach as described in [5], which also suggested that the intestine was the source of the bloodstream strain for this patient.",

Each main axis represents the entire length of one genome being compared, and a colored dot is plotted at regions where the genomic sequences match between the two genomes (areas of synteny). For example, comparing two completely identical genomes would produce a dotplot with a perfectly contiguous diagonal stretching from the bottom-left to top-right corners. Figure\u00a04 shows the synteny dotplots comparing E. coli strains from sample A to sample D and comparing the bloodstream isolate to sample C. Visual inspection of the plots showed no evidence for any large genomic island incorporations. The lack of major discontinuities or inversions provide additional evidence that the strains are genetically equivalent from a genome structure perspective across the various time points and between the gut and the bloodstream.\n",

Functional annotations of these genes revealed that the majority of genes code for proteins related to drug efflux pumps, and others encode known resistance mechanisms to aminoglycosides, bacitracin, and polymyxin.

The organisms containing the second-highest number of resistance genes (each with 5 genes) were classified at the genus level as Lachnospiraceae and Eubacterium.

Our results corroborate these findings as microbiome diversity is restored at time point E without the recovery of the original species and strain-level composition. We find that the assembled genomes for organisms present at time point E compared to other time points are actually quite different (<\u200999.5 similarity for strains of the same species). Several potential mechanisms could explain this finding: for example, a new strain (either externally acquired or a previously rare strain) may become dominant due to selective fitness advantage; alternatively, drug exposure occurring over the clinical time course may drive widescale mutagenesis of the dominant strain within these organisms.",

The patient was then administered multiple antibiotics, and the microbiome concurrently developed markedly decreased diversity until becoming dominated by E. coli. Previous studies have established Bacteroides to be an abundant and prevalent genus in the healthy human gut microbiome; conversely, healthy populations rarely exhibit gut domination by Proteobacteria like E. coli [30]. By characterizing the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the gut metagenome, we discovered that the E. coli strain present at time point A, before transplant and before any antibiotic administration, already contained a vast arsenal of antibiotic resistance genes. Increased fitness due to a greater number of resistance mechanisms may have afforded this particular E. coli strain a selective advantage, enabling it to survive as other organisms were eliminated by the antibiotics.",

Preceding the E. coli domination observed starting at time point C (day +\u200927), the patient had received the following antibiotics in chronological order: ciprofloxacin (day \u2212\u20092 to +\u200912), cefepime (day +\u20092 to 3), vancomycin (day +\u20092 to 9), meropenem (day +\u20093 to 17), daptomycin (day +\u20099 to 11), levofloxacin (day +\u200917 to 32), and metronidazole (day +\u200921 to 33). The strain\u2019s observed resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (members of the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics) can potentially be explained by multidrug efflux complexes AcrAB-TolC, AcrEF-TolC, EmrAB-TolC, and MdtEF-TolC as well as multidrug resistance proteins MdtH and MdtM, which are all annotated in CARD as potentially conferring fluoroquinolone resistance. The observed resistance to Piperacillin/tazobactam (a penicillin) and cefepime (a cephalosporin) may be attributed to CTX-M-27. The patient\u2019s bloodstream infection was due to a highly resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli bacteria, and most of the ESBL E. coli infections in the U.S. are accounted for by CTX-M-type enzymes [31]. Our analysis did not identify resistance genes that can explain the ability for this particular strain of E.coli to survive despite the use of meropenem; however, a decrease in uptake of antibiotics due to a deficiency of porin expression or biofilm formation may possibly be involved [32]. E. coli possesses native resistance to daptomycin and vancomycin, which both target Gram-positive organisms.",

We demonstrate that the intestinal microbiome of patients can act as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes, which may govern which organisms are most predisposed to endure and dominate the gut under the extreme selective pressure applied by antibiotics. Although broad-spectrum antibiotics remain a vital part of our medical armamentarium, the issue of increasing antibiotic resistance strongly argues for their conscientious use. Antibiotics can both select for antibiotic resistance and contribute to the loss of commensal organisms and resulting expansion of a few organisms or even a single organism to the point of gut domination. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether our findings generalize to other HCT patients as well. It is conceivable that the antibiotic resistance gene potential of organisms present prior to transplantation can be used to predict or explain eventual gut domination events or bloodstream infections. Additionally, it is important to note that the resistance genes detected in this study are limited to known antibiotic resistance mechanisms present within the CARD database, and commensals likely have mechanisms of resistance that remain unknown.",

We explore a clinical application of our recently developed metagenomic read cloud sequencing and assembly approach to study gut microbiome dynamics under the intense selective pressures caused by heavy antibiotic administration in the context of HCT. Because intestinal domination has been linked to poor outcomes in this patient population, we applied read cloud sequencing to longitudinal stool samples of an HCT patient who developed E. coli gut domination and a subsequent bloodstream infection. Read cloud sequencing and the Athena assembler provided a higher-resolution characterization of microbiome dynamics surrounding the period of domination than conventional short-read sequencing alone, as it generated draft genomes for constituent organisms in the patient\u2019s microbiome with greater completeness and contiguity. Moreover, the improved assembly using read cloud sequencing enhanced our ability to assemble multiple copies of conserved and repeated sequences (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes) within their proper genomic context.",

We find that although microbial diversity recovers in our subject post-HCT, for most organisms the original dominant strains are not retained throughout the clinical time course. By performing comparative genomic analysis on the E. coli strains between the gut microbiome across time and the bloodstream, we found that a single highly resistant strain of E. coli originally residing within the patient\u2019s baseline microbiome prior to HCT and antibiotic treatment persisted to eventually dominate the subject\u2019s microbiome and also instigate the bloodstream infection. By detecting known antibiotic resistance genes within the assembled genomes, we discovered that the E. coli strain present before transplant was armed with a large collection of resistance genes whereas other organisms initially present in the same intestinal community lacked such extensive resistance potential. These findings are aligned with a model in which the eventual gut domination by E. coli can be attributed to its increased fitness compared to other organisms, leading to its outgrowth under extreme selective pressures. A more comprehensive understanding of microbiome dynamics occurring in HCT could potentially lead to the development of personalized antibiotic regimens based on the gene content of microbial strains within an individual\u2019s microbiome or microbiome-related treatments to improve patient outcomes by preserving or enhancing microbiota diversity during the course of HCT.",
