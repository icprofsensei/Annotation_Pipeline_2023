Microbial diversity was estimated by grouping sequences into operational taxonomic units and calculating the Shannon diversity index.

Intestinal domination, defined as occupation of at least 30% of the microbiota by a single predominating bacterial taxon, occurred frequently. Commonly encountered dominating organisms included Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and various Proteobacteria. Enterococcal domination was increased 3-fold by metronidazole administration, whereas domination by Proteobacteria was reduced 10-fold by fluoroquinolone administration. As a predictor of outcomes, enterococcal domination increased the risk of Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia 9-fold, and proteobacterial domination increased the risk of gram-negative rod bacteremia 5-fold.",

                    "text": "The complex microbial populations colonizing the human intestine provide resistance to infection. The intestinal microbiota also serves as a sanctuary for highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria [9]. Prior studies using in vitro culture methods have characterized microbial populations inhabiting the intestine [10]; more recently, massively parallel pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) encoding genes has provided new insights into the composition and complexity of the intestinal microbiota by identifying bacterial taxons that are not readily cultivated in vitro [11\u201314]. These approaches have demonstrated the compositional changes and resilience of the intestinal microbiota of healthy individuals after antibiotic treatment [12]. Studies with mice demonstrated dramatic changes in the microbiota of the ileum and cecum following antibiotic treatment, and dramatic expansion of antibiotic-resistant microbes such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) [15]. Intestinal expansion of VRE following antibiotic treatment is also seen in humans, with episodes of VRE domination in patients undergoing allo-HSCT preceding the development of VRE bacteremia in 2 patients [15].",

Fever and antibiotic administration were analyzed as time-varying variables, in order to avoid time-dependent bias. Next, we again examined intestinal domination, this time as predictor of clinical outcomes. Domination was analyzed as a time-varying predictor of bloodstream infection with either VRE or aerobic gram-negative bacilli. In order to avoid problems with monotone likelihood for parameter estimate calculations, we employed a penalized maximum likelihood for all Cox hazard calculations [25].

Of these patients, most (92%) had detectable expression of the vanA gene, suggesting the presence of VRE. Streptococcus was the next most frequent dominating genus, observed in 35 (37.2%) patients. Domination by phylum Proteobacteria, which includes Enterobacteriaceae and other aerobic gram-negative bacteria, was observed in 12 (12.8%) patients. Domination by these bacteria occurred at various times relative to transplant (Figure\u00a02B). The composition of all 94 patients is provided (Supplementary Figure\u00a03).",

In this study, two-thirds of patients developed either enterococcal or streptococcal domination during the course of transplant. Interestingly, viridians-group streptococci and VRE were historically the most frequently encountered bloodstream infections in allo-HSCT patients during the pre-engraftment period [4\u20138]. Prior to 2002, viridans streptococci were an important cause of bacteremia at our center, with significant morbidity [4, 6]. Prophylactic vancomycin administration during transplant has virtually eliminated viridans-group Streptococcus bacteremia in our center [7]. Because streptococcal domination remained common in this study, vancomycin prophylaxis may have served to prevent bloodstream invasion but not intestinal domination.",

Prior studies of allo-HSCT patients have demonstrated associations between VRE colonization and the development of VRE bacteremia [7, 8, 33], leading many centers to routinely test for VRE colonization by means of rectal swab cultures prior to transplant. Compared with routine surveillance culture findings, enterococcal domination was detected in a greater percentage of subjects (40% vs 21%, respectively), and we identified more patients with VRE bacteremia (8 of 9 instead of 6). It is possible that bacteremia occurred with greater frequency than was documented, because blood cultures were largely obtained in the setting of fever or other evidence of septicemia. Indeed, a study involving surveillance blood cultures of steroid-treated allo-HSCT patients revealed bacteremia in more than one-third of patients [34].",

Because vanA was present in most cases of enterococcal domination, and because most cases of enterococcal bloodstream infections were vancomycin resistant, we presume antibiotic resistance contributes to microbial shifts within the microbiota; however, indirect effects of antibiotic treatment resulting from interdependencies of bacterial taxa in the gut are likely important as well [37]. The Shannon diversity index was also lower in recipients of metronidazole, presumably reflecting our observed association with enterococcal domination. However, beta-lactam recipients also lost diversity but were not associated with enterococcal domination. Although this disparity may reflect the ability of beta-lactams to inhibit enterococcal growth in the intestine, an alternative explanation is that beta-lactams were administered later during the course of transplant, as empiric therapy for fever in the setting of neutropenia, and thus were largely unevaluated in the Cox model as a preceding risk factor for domination.",

Other studies show fluoroquinolones having effects of varying duration in healthy humans [12, 37]. In those subjects, there were no clinically apparent consequences resulting from these microbial disturbances.

Thus, our microbiologic data could be viewed as interval-censored since we do know the state of the microbiota between successive specimens. At times we observed rapid transitions, and thus there may have been transient microbial states which were not captured. For example, episodes of domination, perhaps preceding some episodes of bloodstream infection, may have occurred but went undetected. To obviate this, we used a cutoff definition of 30% for intestinal domination, even though in many instances the relative abundance was much higher. We chose this cutoff primarily on the basis of resultant grouping of microbial states in our hierarchical cluster analysis, but this cutoff likely enhanced the identification of domination states, given the frequency of collection. The number of 16S sequences obtained per specimen was lower than that of some other studies [37]. Thus, the depth of coverage may have been insufficient to determine whether certain infrequent bacterial taxons were present. Since we focused on dominating (ie, highly abundant) microbes, we expect that our results would be unaffected by deeper sequencing. Furthermore, Good's coverage was \u226598% in >96% of specimens in this study.",
