The developing gut microbiota of neonates differs widely between individuals [2] and both internal host properties and external factors influence the establishment of the microbiota [4]. At birth, the infant microbial population resembles the maternal vagina or skin microbiota depending on mode of delivery, i.e. by spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) or Caesarean section (CS), respectively [5]. Birth mode has a significant effect on the nascent neonatal gut microbiota after these initial founder populations have been replaced [6\u20139]. At 1\u00a0week of age, the microbiota of the SVD infant gut is characterised by high levels of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, while Clostridium is more abundant in CS neonates [10]. Numerous other factors have been shown to exert an influence on this development, including antibiotic exposure [11] and breastfeeding [12, 13]. Development of the microbiota occurs as bacteria are replaced in a dynamic, non-random pattern [14, 15]. The use of infant milk formula (IMF) impacts on metabolism [16] and development of the neonatal immune system [17]. This introduction of IMF or solid food perturbs bacterial colonisation [18, 19] and may reduce the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding [17].",

CS delivery, maternal and neonatal exposure to antibiotics and the sterile environment of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may all alter the natural pattern of acquisition of microbiota. A few published studies with high subject numbers examining the PT gut microbiota mainly focus on the initial hospitalised period [15, 20]. A knowledge gap surrounding PT gut microbiota development was recently highlighted [21], and to our knowledge, the current study is the largest, well-phenotyped analysis of the longitudinal microbiota development of PT infants after leaving the hospital environment. It has previously been suggested that post-conceptional age, rather than post-birth age, is the main determinant of the bacterial community profile in preterm infants [15]; the aforementioned factors were found to influence the pace, but not the sequence, of microbial acquisition.",

Untargeted LC-MS assays were performed with a hybrid linear ion trap Fourier Transform (LTQ FT) Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany), in positive and negative ionisation modes. The XCMS Online portal (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/) was used for data processing (alignment, peak picking, zero peak re-integrations, features grouping and assessment of quality control samples); please see Additional file 2: Supplementary materials for details. Data obtained from this processing consisted of a list of m/z features and its relative intensities, which vary between sample groups. Such matrix file, with information about sample codes, m/z feature and its intensity, was used for statistical analysis. In positive ionisation mode, 2380 statistically significant features were found. In negative ionisation mode, there were 3832 statistically significant features. To annotate compounds, a selection strategy was used based on the most abundant and the most statistically significant features. The procedure for annotation of compounds was adapted from standard metabolomic initiatives (see Additional file 2: Supplementary materials for details). Levels of identification were as follows: level I corresponds to compounds identified by matching masses and retention times with authentic standards in the laboratory, or by matching with high-resolution LC-MS and LCMSn spectra of standards reported in the literature; and level II corresponds to compounds identified by matching with high- and low-resolution LC-MS and LC-MSn spectra from databases and literature.

MIDs were extracted and sequences were assigned to their corresponding individual samples by QIIME\u2019s split_libraries_fastq.py, permitting two ambiguous bases per MID (Ns), and using QIIME\u2019s default quality settings. The USEARCH sequence analysis tool [28] was used for further quality filtering. Sequences were filtered by length, retaining sequences with lengths of 350\u2013370\u00a0bp. This range was used to select the most abundant sequences for the base of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) with reads of all lengths then aligned to the OTU sequences. Single unique reads were removed, and the remaining reads were clustered into OTUs. Chimaeras were removed with UCHIME, using the GOLD reference database. The original input sequences were mapped onto the OTUs with 97% similarity. All reads were taxonomically classified by the classify.seqs command within the mothur suite of tools (v1.31.2), using the RDP reference database (training set 14) [29]. OTUs were classified from these when >50% of the reads agreed on a classification at each phylogenetic level. The returned read numbers varied greatly from 129 to 815,400 reads (average\u2009=\u200969,410 reads per sample). To adjust for the influence of the number of sequences in a sample on diversity and other statistical tests, any sample with less than 10,000 sequence reads was eliminated from the study. This resulted in the loss of eight samples from the data set. Fifteen samples had been sequenced in duplicate, so the samples with the lower read numbers of duplicated pairs were removed, as we believed that these may not be the best representations of those samples due to the lower read counts. The OTU table containing the remaining 715 samples was rarefied to 10,000 reads, to remove any bias from variation in sample read numbers. The remaining samples were from variable modes of delivery and time points (data not shown).",

At 1\u00a0week of age, the microbiota composition of the FT-CS group was significantly different from that of both PT-CS and FT-SVD groups (p values <0.001). PT-CS and FT-SVD were also distinct from one another (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The low number of PT-SVD infants (n\u2009=\u20094) did not permit significant testing at this time point, but it is worth noting that this microbiota cluster is situated between the PT-CS and FT-SVD groups. At 4\u00a0weeks of age, FT-CS microbiota was significantly different to all other groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The PT infant microbiota mainly separated across the x-axis.

There was little separation observed between FT birth modes (FT-CS and FT-SVD); however, the PT-CS samples separated distinctly from the FT samples. The co-inertia analysis showed that there were greater differences between the group microbiota profiles than between the group metabolomic profiles. These differences are evident where the FT metabolomic baricentres are overlaid while there is a separation between the microbiota baricentres. The PT-SVD metabolomic and microbiota baricentres were relatively distant from one another, but this separation may be due to the low number of samples in each of these groups. The compounds associated with the PT-FT split are from multiple different sources and were represented by a diverse selection of metabolites (Additional file 3: Figure S1, Additional file 1: Table S5).

This trend is visible through week 8, when another cluster of genera begins to emerge (branch 3). By week 24, the genera that were most abundant at week 1 have markedly reduced in proportion (branch 1). Genera on branch 2 have low relative abundances, whereas genera on branch 3 are found to be quite highly abundant. Within this third branch we find genera that are core to enterotypes, such as Prevotella, Blautia and Ruminococcus. Once Bifidobacterium emerged (at week 1 for some samples, and by week 4 for others), their abundances appear to remain relatively stable, at least to 24\u00a0weeks of age.\n",

This was to ensure all infants were the same post-conceptional age when sampled, as this was previously postulated to have the greatest effect on the establishment of the microbiota [15]. Infants were assigned to groups depending on how many weeks premature they were at birth (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 12\u00a0weeks). We found that at 1\u00a0week of age, when all PT infants are the same post-birth age, no significant difference or trends were apparent.

A clear distinction is apparent between the different infant groups at 1\u00a0week of age. The FT-SVD infants have a relatively consistent microbiota composition from 1 to 24\u00a0weeks of age. The dominant phylum throughout this period is the Actinobacteria (mainly comprised of the genus Bifidobacterium). FT-CS infants initially had a higher relative proportion of Firmicutes at 1\u00a0week of age compared to FT-SVD (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and less Actinobacteria (p\u2009<\u20090.001). At 4\u00a0weeks of age, Actinobacteria (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and Bacteroidetes (p\u2009<\u20090.001) were more abundant in FT-SVD infants, again with Firmicutes less abundant (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Within the FT-CS group, Actinobacteria significantly increased in relative abundance from 1 to 4\u00a0weeks of age (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Bacteroidetes increased significantly in proportion from week 4 to week 8 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and again from week 8 to week 24 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Thus, the FT-CS microbiota progressed over time to one which is similar to the FT-SVD infants with no differences at phylum level at either 8\u00a0weeks or 24\u00a0weeks of age.\n",

Bacteroides and Clostridia were also important contributors to the gut microbiota composition. Despite the apparently large difference in the average proportion of Bifidobacterium at week 1 between FT-CS and FT-SVD (19 vs 48%), this difference is not statistically significant, due to the high inter-individual variation between infants at this early age. There was no statistically significant difference in the relative proportion of Bifidobacterium between these two birth modes at any time point. Bacteroides was found to be significantly more abundant in FT-SVD infants compared to FT-CS at both 1 and 4\u00a0weeks of age (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not at later time points. Parabacteroides were also significantly more abundant at 4\u00a0weeks of age in FT-SVD than FT-CS (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We also observed that PT-CS had a higher relative proportion of Bacteroides at 4\u00a0weeks of age compared to FT-CS. Clostridium sensu stricto is significantly more abundant in FT-CS when compared to FT-SVD at week 1 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). At this time point, it is also more abundant in PT-CS than PT-SVD (p\u2009<\u20090.01) but, as for Bacteroides, no differences were observed at the later time points.",

From week 8 to week 24, only Blautia (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and Subdoligranulum (p\u2009<\u20090.01; representing a very low proportion of the overall microbiota composition) were found to significantly change in abundance. Contrastingly, there were 12 and 16 genera that showed significantly altered relative proportions between week 1 and week 4 for FT-CS (Additional file 1: Table S14) and PT-CS (Additional file 1: Table S15) respectively, indicating a high level of microbiota change in the early life of these infants. Sampling of subsequent time points does not demonstrate this level of compositional change indicating a stabilisation of the infant gut microbiota. The statistical analysis of PT-SVD gut microbiota development was hindered by low subject numbers, but notwithstanding this limitation, we observed a number of significant changes between week 8 and week 24, with relatively few changes at earlier time points (Additional file 1: Table S17).",

The alpha diversity of the infant gut microbiota was shown to be influenced by age and birth mode (Fig.\u00a07). As measured by the Shannon index, \u03b1-diversity increases as the infant ages. However, the microbiota diversity in each group did not increase equally over the first 24\u00a0weeks of life (Fig.\u00a07, Additional file 5: Figure S3). We observed that the groups have a different diversity relative to each other at week 24 when compared to week 1. At 1\u00a0week of age, the FT-SVD microbiota displays the highest diversity of all groups, while PT-SVD is lowest. Diversity of all four groups increases from week 1 to week 4. FT-SVD increases in diversity between 1 and 4\u00a0weeks of age (p\u2009<\u20090.001); then diversity reduces slightly between week 4 and week 8 (p\u2009<\u20090.001); before increasing again between week 8 and 24 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). PT-CS diversity increased from weeks 1 to 4 (p\u2009<\u20090.001); 4 to 8 (p\u2009<\u20090.001); and showed a trend toward an increase from week 8 to 24 (p\u2009<\u20090.1). FT-CS increased from weeks 1 to 4 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and weeks 8 to 24 (p\u2009<\u20090.01) but not between weeks 4 and 8. The overall increase in bacterial diversity is comparable in both FT groups. PT-SVD infants microbial diversity increased between week 1 and 4 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and then appears to stabilise, with no further significant increase at 24\u00a0weeks. By week 24, there are no significant differences in alpha diversity between any groups, but a trend can be observed for higher diversity in FT-CS over PT-SVD, suggesting that infants of different birth modes and term have reached an equivalent diversity state at this age.\n",

Here, we present the data obtained in the first 24\u00a0weeks of life. Our results consolidate and corroborate recent findings surrounding the importance of birth mode on the initial development of the microbiota [6, 33\u201335], with robust data ensured by the large number of subjects. The infants were sampled at four time points across the first 24\u00a0weeks of life to enable longitudinal analysis of the development of the nascent gut microbiota and were breastfed for a minimum of 4\u00a0weeks to ensure there was a standard initial feeding regime. We found a significant effect of PT-CS birth on infant microbiota compared to FT infants, most likely due to a number of challenges unique to PT infants, including feeding type, antibiotic exposure (maternal and infant), increased duration of hospital stay, gut immaturity and immune immaturity. Low numbers of PT-SVD infants were recruited as very few infants fitting to our definition of PT (<35\u00a0weeks gestation or <1500\u00a0g) were born via SVD delivery mode in the hospital where the study was based. Although it would be interesting to observe if PT infants not subjected to the environmental and antibiotic exposures detailed above still had an atypical microbiota profile in early life, such a prospective study would be very difficult to perform because these medical interventions are clinically necessary for PT infant health. The current study accurately represents the results of typical conditions encountered by PT infants in developed countries. It should be noted that by week 24, there are no differences in alpha diversity between any of the groups. This may indicate that the microbiota has recovered from the stresses associated with birth mode to a large extent by 6\u00a0months of age. Alternatively, the view could be expressed that this is a crucial developmental window for the establishment of lifelong host health.",

This strongly suggests that the microbiota of the infants is modulating the metabolites produced. The specific metabolites driving the separation between FT and PT infants were diverse in nature, with the PT-CS gut in particular having a large amount of altered metabolites. These results are in good agreement with the study of Hyde et al. [36] who studied birth mode in piglets, wherein CS piglets were found to have lower concentration of succinic acid, and higher concentration of glutamic acid than SVD piglets. They also collate with Dessi et al. [37], which examined urine of infants by nuclear magnetic resonance. In this study, the most important discriminating compounds were associated with tyrosine, proline and arginine metabolism, as well as with biosynthesis of tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine and the urea cycle. At the systems level, regulation of tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine pathways plays a role in gut-brain signalling. A microbial influence on the profile of metabolites within these pathways is suspected to contribute to diverse psychiatric and behavioural disorders including autism, schizophrenia and depression [38\u201340].",

Strandvik et al. [41] found tetrahydroxylated atypical bile acids were predominant in PT newborns. Bile acids are main by-product of cholesterol metabolism in the liver, and play a major role in maintaining bile flow. Many enzymes are involved in the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids; thus, improper functioning of one of them can result in formation of atypical bile acids, and probable liver dysfunction [42]. It is not known for how long a time after birth this difference persists, thus the significance and physiologic effects require further investigation.",

Carnitine is associated with red meat and has been controversially suggested as being linked to increased risk for cardiovascular disease [45]; levels of carnitine were found to be elevated in the PT gut. However, vitamin D and vitamin E were also more abundant in the PT metabolome, demonstrating that not all metabolites observed as elevated in the PT urine are traditionally viewed as unfavourable metabolites. This alteration of the gut environment as a neonate is clearly a potential mode for progression of the conditions which are associated with PT birth. More work is needed to establish if the microbiota is a causative agent of this altered metabolomic profile, and if modulation of the infant gut microbiota would restore the metabolomic profile of a PT infant to that of a FT infant.",

The infants were divided into three separate clusters based on differential abundance of certain taxa. A large number of genera were absent at early time points and then present at a relatively high level by 24\u00a0weeks of age, forming a distinct cluster. This cluster contained genera that are core in adult enterotypes, such as Prevotella, Blautia and Ruminococcus. This observation of the emergence of enterotype-like groupings of infants provides a strong foundation to suggest that a lifelong microbiota signature may be imprinted upon infants as early as at six months of age. Alpha diversity, as measured by the Shannon Diversity Index, increased (or remained at the same level) with age across all groups except from week 4 to week 8 in FT-SVD infants. We were unable to attribute this anomaly to any particular factor, and it remains an interesting outlier in the dataset.",

The observed differences in microbiota composition were most pronounced at this early age. The diversity of the PT gut microbiota at this time is low, which may be due to maternal and neonatal antibiotic treatment. At genus level, Bacteroides were found to be significantly less abundant at both 1 and 4\u00a0weeks of age in FT-CS infants compared to FT-SVD infants (both p\u2009<\u20090.001); Parabacteroides are also significantly reduced in the FT-CS infants compared to FT-SVD at 4\u00a0weeks of age (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This indicates that Bacteroidetes may play a major role alongside Bifidobacterium in the early infant gut microbiota, especially as certain species of Bacteroides can metabolise human milk oligosaccharides [46].\n",

At 8\u00a0weeks of age, the FT-CS microbiota continued to become more similar to that of FT-SVD infants, while PT infant community microbiota profile remained more distinct. We noted that twins had a significantly more similar microbiota composition than two unrelated infants, which was anticipated. At this age, twins have recently shared the same womb, birth mode (typically CS), and large portion of their genetic makeup, in addition to breastfeeding and environment. Therefore, the microbiota of these individuals would be expected to be more similar and it would be interesting to observe how long this similarity lasts as the infants\u2019 age. In a recent study by our group, investigating the gut microbiota composition in dichorionic triplets, we observed that host genetics initially appeared to play a significant role in the composition of the individual gut microbiota, but by 12\u00a0months environmental factors were the major determinant [47].",

The differences in the gut microbiota during this critical developmental period of an infant\u2019s life may have a long lasting effect on the immune system or intestinal barrier function [48\u201351]. It is also known that the microbiota has an influence on the metabolic capabilities of an individual [52, 53]. This would place CS, particularly for PT infants, firmly into a high risk category for a number of developmentally associated disorders and diseases. Early-life perturbations of the developing infant gut microbiota have also recently been shown to impact on the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis and may potentially lead to adverse mental health outcomes later in life [54].",

Infants born by CS lack the natural inoculum of bacteria obtained during passage through the birth canal received by SVD infants. Instead, they are exposed to environmental bacteria initially rather than vaginal bacteria. These results show that FT-CS infants may benefit from breastfeeding by obtaining some of the bacteria that they are initially lacking because of birth mode. SVD infants, contrastingly, have a \u201cnatural\u201d microbiota profile that is not as obviously further developed by exposure to breast milk, at least in terms of alterations at genus level. Bifidobacterium levels have previously been shown to be promoted by breast feeding [12, 55] but though present at a high level in the infants in our cohort, it was not one of the genera which increased in abundance in breast fed infants (Additional file 1: Table S8). It is very likely that the high proportion of breast feeding in the first month of life of the infants in this cohort has lessened or masked to some extent the impact of sustained breastfeeding, particularly in terms of maintaining the initial bacterial profile established in FT-SVD infants.",

However this was not observed. We found that the infants\u2019 microbiota composition were more similar at week 1, when they were all the same age after birth, and were different at their due dates, when they would have different \u201cpost-birth\u201d ages at this point. This shows that age since birth is more important than post-conceptional age, but that neither exerts a large influence on shaping the composition of the PT neonatal microbiota.",

This suggests they are occupying a small, specific niche or carrying out a specific function as part of the functioning ecosystem of the developing gut. We also observed Bifidobacterium involved in a number of negative correlations with other genera, which is unsurprising as it becomes a more dominant component of the FT-CS, PT-CS and PT-SVD gut microbiota over time. This shows the competitive advantage that Bifidobacterium has in the environment of the infant gut as it displaces other bacteria.",

Culture-dependent techniques remain valuable for their ability to isolate bacterial species for further analysis. We focussed on populations of two bacterial groups, Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp., as these are known natural inhabitants of the healthy infant intestinal microbiota, and there is substantial evidence demonstrating the role of these bacteria as potential probiotics [56\u201358]. Indeed, a bank of over 7000 putative Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains derived from infant faecal samples from INFANTMET is currently being screened for probiotic potential. Substantial inter-individual variation was observed for Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus counts which supports findings from other studies of infant intestinal microbiota [59, 60].",

However, the evidence from this study and the current literature certainly suggests that factors which disturb the establishment of the neonatal microbiota should be avoided or minimised as much as possible. Future studies may focus upon best methods for restoration of the natural composition of the neonatal gut following perturbation by any of the aforementioned factors. While probiotics are one avenue with some potential, the effects will likely be strain specific. Combination studies, in conjunction with dosage testing, will need to be tightly regulated in any prospective intervention.",

There was very little development of the FT-SVD microbiota composition throughout the first 24\u00a0week of life, with FT-SVD infants retaining a relative stable microbiota composition over this period, while FT-CS infants develop a similar composition to FT-SVD after 8\u00a0weeks of age.
