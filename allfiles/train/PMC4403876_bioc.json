Several lines of evidence suggest that microbial colonization in the airways might have a role in the chronic inflammatory process. Both Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae have been isolated from patients with acute asthma exacerbations.1,2 This suggests that macrolides and similar compounds might be used to treat such exacerbations, and a clinical trial with ketolides showed promising results.3 A report using a large database of patients in the state of Tennessee concluded that invasive pneumococcal pneumonia is at least twice as likely to occur in asthmatic patients as in control subjects.4 Bisgaard et al5 reported that neonates whose upper airways were colonized at 1month of agewith Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis or with a combination of these organisms are at increased risk for recurrent wheeze and asthma later in life. Most of these studies detected microbial agents either by using targeted PCR approaches or by culturing specific organisms, reflecting only a small fraction of existing taxa. Characterizing the entire microbial diversity in the airways will provide insight into the role of the microbiome in asthma pathogenesis.",

Using PCR and Sanger sequencing, Hilty et al11 showed that the airways of asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects have approximately 120 distinct bacterial groups and that Proteobacteria are present more frequently in asthmatic patients, whereas Bacteroidetes are more frequent in bronchial samples from nonasthmatic subjects. A more recent study with a PhyloChip approach demonstrated a higher bacterial load in asthmatic patients compared with that seen in control subjects, with Proteobacteria again present in higher abundance in asthmatic patients.12 However, all the asthmatic patients sampled in both of these studies were treated with inhaled corticosteroids, and effects of corticosteroids on the microbiome could not be ascertained.",

Briefly, after filtering for low-quality reads and eliminating reads that did not match barcode sequences, each read from an individual sample was compared with all the remaining reads from that sample to identify unique reads. Unique reads from each sample were clustered into a group of similar sequences, each representative of a 16s rRNA sequence from a bacterial species/genus, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs). All the analyses were performed with the 454 sequencing pipeline of the Ribosomal Database Project, Release 10 (Ribosomal Database Project, East Lansing, Mich).17 Sequences were assigned to bacterial taxa by comparing them with 16s rRNA sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project by using the RDP Classifier.18 Only sequences that could be assigned to a bacterial group with a confidence estimate of 50% or greater were used for further analysis. OTUs for each sample were derived by clustering sequences from individual samples at a genetic distance of 0.03, and the species richness estimate Chao19 was obtained for each sample by using Mothur.20 The proportion of bacterial genera in each sample was used to calculate the Shannon diversity index, a mathematic measure commonly used to characterize the species diversity in a community. The Shannon Index accounts for both the diversity and evenness of the bacterial species present in samples from asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects.21 Hierarchical clustering was performed with pvclust22 in the R statistics package (www.r-project.org), and support for each branch was obtained by performing bootstrap analysis with 10,000 replicates (pvclust and bootstrapping are described in the Methods section in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).",

Relevant differences were found in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes between samples from asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects. Proteobacteria were present in higher proportions in asthmatic patients (37% vs 15%, P < .001), especially Gammaproteobacteria (P < .05, Mann-Whitney U test). In contrast, Firmicutes (47% vs 63%, P = .17) and Actinobacteria (10% vs 14%, P = .36) were found more frequently in samples from nonasthmatic subjects, although these differences were not statistically significant. Firmicutes are gram-positive bacteria that predominantly form endospores and have some notable pathogenic bacteria, such as Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species, whereas, Bacteroidetes are a group of gram-negative non\u2013spore-forming bacteria widely present in the environment.",

This further suggests the compositional similarity of samples associated with disease state. Two nonasthmatic samples were not included in either cluster. We repeated the analysis but by limiting inclusion to atopic subjects among both asthmatic and nonasthmatic participants (see Fig E2 in this article\u2019s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Results were very similar to those depicted in Fig 2.",

On the basis of these assignments, the sequences represented in 5 phyla were distributed into 107 bacterial families. Fifteen of the 107 bacterial families differed in their relative abundance in samples from asthmatic patients versus nonasthmatic subjects (Fig 3). Enterobacteriaceae and Neisseriaceae were more common in samples from asthmatic patients than from nonasthmatic subjects, although these differences were not statistically different. Moraxellaceae and Pasteurellaceae, to which Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae belong, respectively, were also present in higher abundance in samples from asthmatic patients. Prevotellaceae, a bacterial family belonging to Bacteroidetes, were also more frequent in the asthmatic samples. However, this observation could be partially attributed to a 10-fold increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes in a sample from a single asthmatic patient (no. A7).",

The fact that we were able to precisely identify the bacterial genera in only half of the sequences suggests that many bacteria found in sputum are novel (or uncommon) and have yet to be characterized. Additional sequencing efforts are warranted to completely characterize the microbes in sputum to understand their role in asthma.",

These results agree with previous microbiome studies using bronchial samples, which have also demonstrated an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria in samples from asthmatic patients.11,12 The higher abundance of Moraxellaceae and Pasteurellaceae in asthmatic samples (to which Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenza belong, respectively) supports the role of these bacteria in the development of asthma.5 However, the abundance of Firmicutes in samples from nonasthmatic subjects contrasts with the results of Hilty et al,11 who showed an abundance of Bacteroidetes in samples from nonasthmatic subjects. Bacteroidetes accounted for 10% to 20% of the total bacteria found in their study. However, in our study, with the exception of a single sample from an asthmatic patient, Bacteroidetes accounted for a mere 1% to 2% of the total bacterial composition. Because the human microbiome has been shown to vary between subjects and populations,8 this difference in the composition of Bacteroidetes could be attributable to differences in the populations from which samples were obtained. Although samples in our study were collected from a mixed population in the United States, the samples in the Hilty et al11 study were from an Irish population.",

Corticosteroids are known to have extensive immunosuppressive effects,23 and therefore the possibility that the observed differences could be attributable to the therapy the patients were receiving rather than their disease state could not be excluded in those studies. In contrast, patients and control subjects in our study were participants in a longitudinal observational study of asthma, which is based on an unselected population of newborns enrolled in the early 1980s.13 The history of asthma (or lack thereof) could thus be confirmed from existing data, and most subjects had mild disease for which they were not taking inhaled corticosteroids, even if they had been prescribed. In addition, results did not change markedly when we limited the analysis to atopic subjects, suggesting that differences in allergic sensitization between cases and control subjects cannot explain our findings.",

However, we anticipate that this effect is likely to be common across participants with and without asthma. This conclusion is supported by the finding that bacterial composition of induced sputum obtained in this study is quite distinct compared with that of saliva (roughly equal proportions of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria24), the oropharynx (dominated by Firmicutes), and the nostrils (which have roughly equal proportion of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes25). Moreover, although efforts to avoid contamination were made in the 2 previous studies of airway microbiota using invasive techniques,11,12 it is still possible that the airway microbial communities identified in those studies might have inadvertently originated, at least in part, in the nasal/oral/pharyngeal cavities. Interestingly, it was recently reported that the healthy lung does not harbor a distinct microbiome but instead contains low levels of bacterial sequences largely indistinguishable from upper respiratory tract flora.26 It is thus possible that the consistent changes in microbial communities of sputum and lower respiratory tract samples observed in asthmatic patients and in previous studies might reflect changes occurring in the whole respiratory tract and not in any specific compartment.",
