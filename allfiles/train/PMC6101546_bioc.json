Comparison of differentially abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) revealed 1 OTU associated with case status in both calibration (n = 51) and validation (n = 80) subsamples that matched the canonical KPC-Kp strain ST258. Permutation analysis using the presence or absence of OTUs and hierarchical logistic regression identified 2 OTUs (belonging to genus Desulfovibrio and family Ruminococcaceae) associated with KPC-Kp colonization. Among clinical variables, the presence of a decubitus ulcer alone was independently and consistently associated with case status. Combining the presence of the OTUs Desulfovibrio and Ruminococcaceae with decubitus ulcer increased the likelihood of KPC-Kp colonization to >38% in a unit-weighted predictive model.",

Although a healthy, indigenous gut microbiota likely provides resistance to colonization by enteric MDROs such as CPE, exposure to antibiotics and other clinical factors can disrupt gut microbial community homeostasis and reduce \u201ccolonization resistance,\u201d thus increasing CPE colonization risk [6]. Development of \u201cmicrobiome disruption indices,\u201d that is, measurements of microbiota characteristics that inversely associate with colonization resistance, has been proposed as an infection prevention strategy to improve identification of patients at risk for MDRO colonization, infection, or transmission [7]. A first step toward development of a microbiome disruption index for predicting CPE colonization is to determine whether the composition of the microbiota differs in CPE-colonized and -noncolonized patients. To this end, we compared the fecal microbiota and clinical care exposures of patients with and without colonization by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp), the most common CPE in the United States, and sought features that distinguished the 2 groups.",

Samples with <1000 sequences after processing were not included. For all microbiota analyses, sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequence similarity by the average neighbor method. Shannon diversity was calculated based on OTU composition. A distance metric that takes relative abundances of both shared and nonshared OTUs into account, \u03b8YC, was calculated between samples [16], and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [17] was used to test for significant differences between the communities of KPC-Kp(+) and KPC-Kp(-) patients. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was used to visualize the \u03b8YC distances between samples. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) was used to determine if specific OTUs were differentially abundant in KPC-Kp(+) and KPC-Kp(-) specimens [18]. We also investigated the taxonomic composition by classifying sequences within mothur using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) training set (v. 10) [19]. Samples were grouped into community types using partitioning around medoids (PAM), calculated from the Jensen-Shannon divergence of the taxonomic composition, as used previously to group fecal microbiota profiles into enterotypes [20]. To investigate the sequences included in each OTU, bin.seqs was used. The unique OTU003 sequence was further analyzed using RDP\u2019s online Sequence Match against 16S rRNA gene sequences for isolates (type and nontype), size \u22651200 nucleotides, and good quality (on December 20, 2017) [9] and compared with specific genomes by BLAST in PATRIC [21].

First, permutation analysis was used to reduce the initial set of 300 candidate OTU predictors to a number that was more manageable for constructing a robust, linear predictive model. Each OTU was recoded from a continuous quantity (relative abundance) to a dummy-coded variable based on presence or absence in a patient\u2019s specimen. The entire patient sample was randomly assigned to 2 groups, and the random assignment was permuted 100 times. For each permutation of the random assignments, risk ratios for each OTU were calculated for both groups. An OTU was considered validated if the risk ratio in the 2 groups both exceeded an absolute value of 2.0 and predicted KPC-Kp colonization status in the same direction. The use of this permutation approach is equivalent to a k-fold cross-validation.",

Next, we tried community clustering using the PAM algorithm based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (Figure 3B) [20, 22]. Likely due to high microbiota variability between subjects (Supplementary Figure 2), clustering was relatively weak, with a maximum silhouette score of 0.28 for 3 clusters, each defined by different dominant genera (Figure 3B, \u200b,C).C). PAM cluster 1 was a high-diversity cluster with several Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes OTUs, PAM cluster 2 was defined by mainly Bacteroidetes OTUs, and PAM cluster 3 was characterized by high abundances of OTU001 (Enterococcus), OTU002 (Escherichia), and OTU003 (Enterobacteriaceae). Examination of the binned OTU sequences revealed that OTU003 contained a single unique sequence, matching various Enterobacteriaceae family members, including 16S rRNA gene sequences from the canonical KPC-Kp strain ST258 (Supplementary Methods). Significant overrepresentation of specimens from KPC-Kp(+) patients was not observed in any of the clusters (chi-square test).",

A risk ratio of 2.0 was selected because, assuming a sample size of 30 in both the calibration and validation subsamples and a base likelihood of 18% OTU relative abundance (the median OTU relative abundance for the 302 OTUs considered in the entire patient sample), there was a statistically significant likelihood of achieving a risk ratio of 2.0 (P = .014.) Identification of candidate OTUs was not ambiguous: all discarded OTUs had 0 cross-validations. Of the 30 candidate OTUs that were retained, the number of cross-validations varied from 15 to 87 out of 100 permutations, and all cross-validated agreements were in the same direction. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was used to further reduce the number of OTUs from 30 to 2: (OTU109 [Desulfovibrio] and OTU179 [Ruminococcaceae]). The elimination process was based on Wald statistics in the logistic regression analysis. If there was a tie in the Wald statistics, the bivariate risk ratio was used as a tie-breaker.",

The overall bacterial community structure of fecal specimens from KPC-Kp(+) patients was dissimilar to that of fecal specimens from KPC-Kp(-) patients (Figure 3A), but overall diversity did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Decreased microbiota diversity has been observed in patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, which is a rationale for treating this infection with microbiota transplantation [35, 36]. In the current study, the absence of association between KPC-Kp status and microbiota diversity may be explained in part by antibiotic exposure in >50% of both cases and controls at the time of specimen collection, which in and of itself is associated with decreased microbiota diversity [37\u201339]. Although we did not have access to patients\u2019 antibiotic exposure histories before LTACH admission, it is likely that many patients would have received multiple prior antibiotic courses [23], which would also have been expected to reduce the diversity of their microbiota.",

Analysis by LEfSe was used to detect significant differential abundance of microbial community members between different groups, followed by linear discriminant analysis to evaluate the effect size of those features. We refined our use of LEfSe by performing this analysis on samples from calibration and validation subsets of patients. Whereas multiple OTUs were identified as differentially abundant in KPC-Kp(+) patients compared with KPC-Kp(-) patients, only 1 OTU (OTU003) was identified as significant in both calibration and validation subsamples. This OTU003 is predicted to be the OTU that contains the common KPC-Kp strain ST258. Although this may seem to be a trivial result, it is important to recall that LEfSe analysis takes into account relative abundance of a given OTU when determining significance. In fact, our alternate approach for examining OTUs that was based on presence or absence of all OTUs did not identify OTU003 as being significantly associated with KPC-Kp colonization. Closer examination of these data suggests that virtually all patient specimens included sequences classified as OTU003. Therefore, it appears that KPC-Kp-colonized patients are distinguished from noncolonized patients by having KPC-Kp as a relatively abundant member of the community.",

Assessing the generalizability of microbiota analyses across different subsets of specimens can limit spurious associations identified with these complex, heterogeneous data sets where collinearity is likely to be a problem. Although we did not investigate the biological significance of the association between OTU109 (Desulfovibrio) or OTU179 (Ruminococcaceae) and KPC-Kp colonization, the consistency of the association across all patient subsets suggests that these OTUs might be candidates for investigation in longitudinal analyses as microbiome indices of KPC-Kp acquisition risk. The association between a clinical factor\u2014presence of a decubitus ulcer\u2014and KPC-Kp colonization is likely an indicator of poor functional status associated with KPC-Kp carriage. As in our previous work with C. difficile [22], models that included both clinical and microbiome variables improved the prediction of KPC-Kp status compared with either model alone.",

Our study also has limitations. We used a cross-sectional design, which prevents us from knowing whether microbiome features that were observed to be associated with KPC-Kp positivity were present before colonization. Our ability to detect KPC-Kp is not limiting, and there is little clinical utility to using microbiota analysis for detection of KPC-Kp. However, although 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of full bacterial communities may not be a feasible clinical diagnostic tool, such analyses are the first step toward identifying potential biomarkers for future validation and development. Additionally, studying the fecal microbiota of KPC-Kp(-) patients longitudinally over time would provide an opportunity to investigate features of the microbiota associated with acquisition of KPC-Kp colonization. Such a longitudinal design could also be used to interrogate characteristics of the microbiota of KPC-Kp(+) patients that are associated with development of clinical infection. The potential value of this approach has been suggested by work that showed that the relative abundance of vancomycin-resistant enterococci or Enterobacteriaceae was associated with an increased risk of bacteremia [40].",
