NCNGU patients were compared to control subjects with regard to the presence of potentially infectious bacteria in the first void urine. Patients' pre- and post-antibiotic-treatment urine samples and two samples obtained 2 weeks apart from healthy volunteers, who did not receive antibiotic therapy, were analyzed with broad-spectrum PCR tests aiming at eubacterial small subunit rRNA genes. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the amplicons cloned from the mixtures of PCR products revealed that many different species of microorganisms were found to be colonizing the male urethra. We document here clear differences in the composition of the resident urethral flora between samples obtained from various individuals and between samples obtained at various points in time for a single individual. No major changes in population complexity were found upon antimicrobial treatment. In two of five patients a previously suggested pathogen (Mycoplasma genitalium or Haemophilus parainfluenzae) was accurately identified on the basis of DNA sequencing. No ubiquitous, azithromycin-sensitive organism was identified as a common pathogen in all patients, but up to 40% of all clones represented as-yet-unclassified bacterial species. Relatively often Pseudomonas spp. or Pseudomonas-like organisms were identified in the bacterial flora of patients. Interestingly, an as-yet-uncharacterized microbial species was identified as a negative predictor of NCNGU. This species was identified in all control subjects and was absent from all of the patient' samples (5 of 5 versus 0 of 5, P = 0.0079). This suggests that NCNGU might also be diagnosed by assessing the absence rather than the presence of certain bacterial species.",

                    "text": "Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes of urethritis in males (7, 14, 16). Nongonococcal urethritis is diagnosed in over two million cases per year in the United States. A significant fraction of the urethritis patients (up to 50%), however, are not infected by either one of these pathogens (7). In these cases, the clinical syndrome is referred to as nonchlamydial nongonococcal urethritis (NCNGU). NCNGU is a common condition, frequently diagnosed in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics around the world. In the pathogenesis of acute NCNGU, microorganisms other than C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae seem to play a role as well, since a significant fraction of the patients involved respond well to antibiotic treatment (1). Furthermore, data showing that condoms are protective against NCNGU support the hypothesis that NCNGU is an infectious disease (8, 25). Despite extensive microbiological studies, no single causative microbial species has been identified as the main cause of NCNGU. Although Mycoplasma genitalium seems to be an important candidate (4, 14, 17, 20, 28), with an incidence that may be as high as 36% (4), many clinically overt cases still remain microbiologically unexplained. Previous studies were limited to selective searches for one or more traditional pathogens that are putatively involved in inflammation of the lower genital tract in males. These pathogens included M. genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, or Trichomonas vaginalis, and searches were performed by culture, PCR, or a combination of both methods (14, 20, 28). Efforts to really identify novel pathogens have employed culture methods mainly (10, 26). The downside of this approach is that culture-dependent techniques may not adequately elucidate the microbial diversity in the genitourinary tract. Molecular techniques have suggested that the number of pathogenic microorganisms that have been cultured to date probably equals only a fraction of the total (23). Consequently, culture-based approaches have probably prohibited the discovery of novel uropathogens, an omission that underscores the need for additional molecular-microbiological searches.",

Eubacterial, domain-specific PCR primers are particularly useful for the identification of putative human pathogens. Amplified rDNA from bacteria can be sequenced, and these sequences can be used in computerized database searches to identify the bacterial species involved (31). This approach turned out to be particularly successful in microbial-etiological studies in chronic idiopathic prostatitis. Bacterial rRNA genes could be detected in 77% of all patients, and certain Vibrio species were identified as putative agents of infection (19). In addition, the same strategy helped to identify novel bacterial species, both in natural environments and clinical syndromes (3, 11, 15, 22, 29).",

Selected individuals provided informed consent (Erasmus MC Medical Ethical Committee, protocol 00-859). Major exclusion criteria were the use of antibiotics within the previous month and a history of urethritis within the previous 3 months. Personal interviews revealed that all five enrolled patients had clear symptoms of urethritis (penile irritation in combination with discharge and/or dysuria [see Table \u200bTable11 ]). Urethritis was confirmed microscopically, on the basis of >6 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) per \u03bcl in the sediment of 12 ml of first-pass urine (FPU). The numbers of PMNs were determined by using the standardized KOVA system (Hycor, Garden Grove, Calif.) in full accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Control subjects were five asymptomatic volunteers with no signs of urethritis (\u22646 PMNs/\u03bcl). After the urethral meatus of each patient was washed with a sterile gauze and tap water, \u223c30 ml of FPU was collected into sterile tubes. In addition, urethral swabs were obtained for confirmatory purposes. Infection by N. gonorrhoeae was excluded microscopically (classical Gram stain) and by culture performed on a GC-LECT agar (Becton Dickinson, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands). C. trachomatis infection was excluded by PCR analysis of FPU by using the Cobas Amplicor Detection Reagent Kit and the Cobas Amplicor machine (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to instructions of the manufacturer. A total of 12 ml of FPU was used for the microscopic and diagnostic evaluations described above, whereas 500 \u03bcl was used for the Amplicor tests. In preparation of the broad-spectrum ribosomal PCRs, 10 ml of FPU was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm. The sediment (ca. 75 to 300 \u03bcl) was kept at \u221280\u00b0C prior to processing. Patients with microscopically diagnosed urethritis and a negative Gram stain for N. gonorrhoeae were treated with a single oral dose of 1 g of azithromycin. Patients and control subjects were advised to abstain from any form of sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, and oral) and were asked to return for reexamination after 2 weeks. At the second visit they delivered ca. 30 ml of FPU, which was collected at home in the early morning, according to the collection procedure described above. Again, 12 ml of FPU was microbiologically evaluated for the presence of PMNs. A 10-ml portion was centrifuged, and the sediment was kept at \u221280\u00b0C prior to PCR processing. The healthy volunteers were not treated with azithromycin between the two samplings.",

In all, RFLP patterns were recorded for 472 clones derived from patient samples, and 488 were documented for the healthy controls. Ultimately, the RFLP database is comprised of 960 ribosomal fingerprints. AluI digestion of full-length inserts generally resulted in two to five conveniently resolved bands (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). Different RFLP types represent the different types of ssu rRNA genes that are present in microbes concentrated in the urine sediment. It has to be emphasized, since we only employed a single restriction enzyme, that clones with identical RFLP patterns do not necessarily represent identical bacterial species. The distribution of clones (both in RFLP type and abundance) in control subjects and in patients is plotted in Fig. \u200bFig.33 and \u200band4.4. Overall, 71 and 84 different RFLP types were obtained in control subjects and patients, respectively. We found 62 different RFLP types present in patient samples that were absent in control samples (CA-EJ). All clone libraries had a relative dominance of a few types (e.g., the \u201cwatertypes\u201d B and D in most samples or CV and DE in the sample obtained during the first visit of patient 2). It can be noted that some types were only present during one visit (e.g., in control 4, types Q and BF). Also, most of the types were not found in all of the persons (e.g., type E was only present in control 1 and 3 and all patients except number 2). Especially noteworthy is the fact that RFLP type H was encountered in 9 of 10 samples derived from control individuals. During NCNGU, this type was never detected. This difference was highly significant from the statistical viewpoint (9 of 10 versus 0 of 5; P = 0.0020). Even when calculated for the two groups of individuals, this significance was maintained (5 of 5 versus 0 of 5; P = 0.0079). For RFLP type AQ, a similar trend was observed; in this case statistical relevance was not reached.",

The index of variation, i.e., the ratio between the number of RFLP types and the overall number of clones studied, was between 0.32 and 0.36. These results indicate that the urethral flora shows extensive intra- and interpersonal variation. It is interesting that in the volunteers, 47 of 138 cumulatively identified types disappeared during the 2-week monitoring period. In the patients, who were treated with antibiotics, 50 of 127 identified types seemed to disappear. The difference in microbial dynamics between the two groups is not statistically significant (two-sided Fisher exact test, P = 0.37). This implies that the azithromycin treatment does not seem to drastically induce microbial species extinction in the urethra: in both controls and patients, similar elimination rates are encountered. On the other hand, species also appear during the monitoring period. Again, no statistically relevant difference is noted between the groups (52 of 138 versus 51 of 127; P = 0.71). In conclusion, azithromycin treatment does not seem to severely affect the composition and dynamics of the urethral flora. Interestingly, however, there still is a relatively large group of ssu rRNA PCR RFLP types that only occur in patients and not in controls (n = 62). A number of these disappear during the 2-week posttreatment period (n = 34). We assume that these represent antibiotic-susceptible pathogenic bacteria and, therefore, these clones will be addressed specifically below (see Fig. \u200bFig.55).",

Some of the RFLP types found more frequently (relative abundance of >10%) were sequenced to assess the nature of the constant factors in the bacterial urethral flora in more detail. Table \u200bTable33 surveys the resemblance of some of the more dominant clones with known bacterial species based on BLAST searches in GenBank. All sequencing analyses involved two independent clones per RFLP type. The fact that in eight of nine cases identical or highly similar sequences were obtained corroborates the reliability of the RFLP analysis. It should be noted that clones with different RFLP types (e.g., B and D, CV and DE, etc.) sometimes revealed a close relatedness to the same bacterial genus. In conclusion, Table \u200bTable33 highlights that many water-borne bacterial species, including Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, and Sphingomonas spp., were identified as possible members of the healthy male urethral flora, some of which are also identified as water contaminants. The latter observation raises the question of whether these species are tap water contaminants or genuine members of the male urethral flora.",

Type H, which, significantly, more often occurs in the flora of healthy men, gave rise to ribosomal sequence motifs that were most homologous to that of an uncultured bacterial species encoded GKS2-124. GKS2-124 belongs to the group of the \u03b1-proteobacteria and was initially isolated from a German freshwater lake (12). No obvious homology with known pathogenic bacterial species was observed, the sequence showed a somewhat more distant homology to water-thriving organisms such as Sphingomonas spp. A similar, though not statistically significant, trend was also observed for type AQ, occurring in four of five healthy controls and just one patient.",

Of the 32 different types of clones, 24 were successfully sequenced (Table \u200b(Table4).4). Interestingly, patient 2 represents the only individual for whom a well-known putative uropathogen was identified. Four of the different RFLP clones were very similar to the rRNA sequence of M. genitalium, thereby providing evidence for the fact that this person was cured from an M. genitalium infection. This fact again illustrates that the experimental approach employed was solid and that the outcome is relevant. However, the diversity observed among the RFLP patterns is somewhat enigmatic since M. genitalium only harbors a single copy of the 16S rRNA gene. Whether this variation is due to mixed infections or PCR and cloning induced errors is subject of current investigation. Patient 3 appeared to be infected by Haemophilus parainfluenzae (clone DF/DL), a bacterial species that has been mentioned before, but less convincingly as M. genitalium, in relation to NCNGU (27). For the other patients, various previously identified bacterial species, but also some species that currently lack a detailed description, matched entries in the GenBank database.",

                    "text": "To strengthen the pathogen identification efforts, 18 minor clones from the controls were also sequenced (Table \u200b(Table4).4). Interestingly, 10 of 24 clones from the patients and 7 of 18 clones derived from the healthy controls were matched to microbial species that have never been cultured in vitro or have not yet been precisely classified as a species. Since the homology scores of the clone sequences with, for instance, the uncultured bacterial clone DJAT-434, occurring in four of five patients versus one of five control subjects, are variable, it is quite possible that we detected here novel bacterial species (Table \u200b(Table4).4). Figure \u200bFigure66 illustrates the gross interrelatedness of the individual bacterial species that were identified in Tables \u200bTables33 and \u200band4.4. Besides two heterogeneous groups of various bacterial species (Actinomyces, Veillonella, Corynebacterium, and Ralstonia spp., etc.), three major clusters can be discerned. Cluster A represents the streptococci, whereas cluster B derives from multiple clones analyzed for the patient suffering from an M. genitalium infection. Cluster C is the most interesting one since it is built from four subclusters, one of which (C3) gathers the various Haemophilus spp. The larger clusters C1 and C2 primarily contain Pseudomonas spp. Interestingly, the DJAT-434 homologues are clustered in the C2 group (except for the DJAT-434 homologue sequence derived from RFLP type DH from patient 4), a group consisting mainly of Pseudomonas-like organisms. Apparently, the DJAT-434 homologues closely resemble Pseudomonas spp. This leads to the conclusion that as-yet-unidentified Pseudomonas species may play a significant role, either as inducers of NCNGU or as opportunists occupying the environmental niche created during the disease process.",

Although no precise definition is available, NCNGU etiology is probably multifactorial (2, 14). In order to gain more insight in the pathogenesis of NCNGU in males, novel diagnostic approaches are mandatory (7). We focused here on acute cases of urethritis, i.e., those not caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to approach the long-standing enigma of the etiology of acute NCNGU in men, employing broad-spectrum molecular-biological techniques, such as ssu rDNA PCR and subsequent RFLP and sequencing techniques. A downside of this approach is that eukaryotic pathogens, such as T. vaginalis, are not detected. These organisms are certainly important in a subset of NCNGU cases (7, 18). Second, the data could be influenced by the fact that some microorganisms are present in larger numbers or contain more ribosomal operons per genome than others, thereby facilitating their detection. Consequently, the spectrum of bacteria identified may not completely mimic the urethral flora in situ. Third, definite proof for the association of the bacteria identified with the urethral epithelium is not available, i.e., the bacteria could also originate from the bladder or other anatomical locations.",

Recent data by Bjornelius et al. (4) revealed that M. genitalium could be detected in more than 36% of all patients. It was also shown that in 30% of all cases of chronic nongonococcal urethritis, U. urealyticum could be detected (14), although the general literature is inconclusive with respect to the importance of this bacterial species (14, 24, 27). We did not find evidence for the presence of infectious U. urealyticum among our acute NCNGU patients. In addition, various species of Haemophilus have been implicated in NCNGU (27). Interestingly, patient 3 of the present study seemed to be harboring various species of this particular genus as well. Haemophilus spp. were not encountered among the healthy controls. Finally, the presence of various species of oral streptococci (Streptococcus gordoni, an unidentified oral bacterium AP60-15, and Streptococcus salivarius in patients 2, 3, and 5, respectively) may corroborate an earlier suggestion concerning the involvement of oral sex in the pathogenesis of NCNGU (13).",

On the other hand, many other species have been previously indicated as possibly involved in the establishment of NCNGU. Whether these candidates, including, for instance, U. urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis (9, 19), should be excluded from future studies cannot be decided on the basis of the present study, since the number of patients was kept low because of the experimental complexity of our in vitro work. We did not identify obvious and novel, putatively pathogenic bacterial species that are 100% associated with acute NCNGU. Although the RFLP analyses identified numerous types that were confined to pretreatment patient samples, DNA sequencing revealed that not a single bacterial species was exclusively present in all five disease-related, pretreatment samples and absent in all control samples. However, several uncharacterized bacterial species were identified more often (for instance, the DJAT 434 clone was detected in four of five patients versus one of five control subjects). In addition, Fig. \u200bFig.66 highlights the fact that, among the patients, Pseudomonas-like bacterial species were identified relatively frequently. The prevalence in NCNGU and the pathogenic potential of these bacterial species need to be defined more precisely. This requires the development of diagnostic tests for these elusive microorganisms that allow larger groups of patients to be screened. The reverse situation was documented once: RFLP type H occurred in all of the controls and in none of the patients. This difference, even with the limited number of individuals included in the current study, is statistically significant. The bacterial species most homologous to the RFLP type H DNA sequence appeared to have been detected in fresh lake water (12). Whether this bacterial species acts as a putative probiotic or whether it is simply outcompeted by the pathogens involved remains to be elucidated, just as diagnostic tests for this species need to be developed in order to more accurately determine its prevalence in healthy and diseased male urethras.",

Second, azithromycin treatment seems to have little effect on the variability, complexity, and dynamics of the resident flora: many species not only disappear or appear during antibiotic treatment but also in the healthy, untreated situation. It is reassuring to see that in two of five patients, previously suggested pathogens were encountered that disappeared upon antibiotic treatment. The detection of a diversity of uncharacterized Pseudomonas-like bacterial species suggests that there is much more to explore in the bacterial flora of the male urethra, whereas the detection of bacterial species that disappear upon disease development may have important future implications to the therapy of NCNGU.",
