All sequences with any Ns, reads mapping to phiX, and reads with a\nmaximum expected error of > 2 following truncation were also removed.\nError estimation was calculated on all samples (pooled) following dereplication.\nFollowing chimera removal (consensus method), taxonomy was assigned\nindependently to the RDP v.14 16S rRNA gene sequence database [35]. Additional species level assignment to the RDP\nspecies training sets was accomplished using the addSpecies\nfunction of dada2. Blastn against the NCBI 16S reference database was used to\nfurther define the taxonomy of selected ASV. ASV were aligned using the R MSA\npackage [36] and arranged into a maximum\nlikelihood phylogeny (GTR model with optimization of the proportion of\ninvariable sites and the gamma rate parameter) using the phangorn package [37].

When comparing\nparticipants with high baseline CD4 or low baseline VL we demonstrate a relative\ndecrease in richness after 24 weeks of ART, similar to prior reports [22]. In participants with low CD4, we\ndemonstrate an increase in bacterial alpha diversity associated with the elimination\nof viremia. Taken together, these data suggest that alpha diversity is associated\nwith both low CD4 counts and low HIV load, with immune reconstitution and viral\nsuppression correlated with decreases in bacterial diversity. The variability of\nthese individual responses may reflect changes induced by (1) immune reconstitution,\n(2) a direct influence of the ART used (EFV/FTC/TDF) or (3) a shift in the\nmicrobiome reflective of the individual prior to HIV infection. It is difficult to\ndifferentiate between these possibilities without an uninfected control group,\npre-infection samples, samples from participants treated with other ART regimens, or\na well-matched untreated control group. We identified two differentially abundant\nASV between baseline and week 24 samples. One sequence was more frequently detected\nin baseline samples, and is most closely related to an enteric bacterium of mice,\nM. intestinale. The low percent identity (91%) demonstrates\nthat this ASV is distinct from M. intestinale but likely belongs to\na member of the Porphyromonadaceae.\nPorphyromonadaceae have been associated with the human oral\ncavity, and are important periodontal pathogens [8]. Without specific taxonomic assignment it is unclear why this\nbacteria is specifically associated with oral microbiomes of PLWH prior to ART,\nhowever, it is a specific bacterial marker as it is almost entirely absent following\n24 weeks of ART. Our finding is similar to prior findings that among participants\nwith untreated HIV, there is an overgrowth of Porphyromonas [12][13].\nThe second ASV was associated with the salivary bacterial microbiome in samples\ncollected after 24 weeks of ART. This sequence has 100% identity to T.\nlecithinolyticum, a Spirochaete also implicated causing periodontal\ndisease [42].

This may be due to a variety of factors, including\nantibiotic administration, immune compromise, oral pathology or differences in oral\ncare. The expression of these bacterial communities may also lead to further immune\nactivation, as microbial translocation from the oral cavity may contribute to\nmicrobial translocation and systemic immune activation, similar to what has been\npostulated in the lower GI tract. Future studies should address how the microbiome\nshifts during the complex time period after ART initiation.
