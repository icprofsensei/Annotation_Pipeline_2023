However, because the lungs are constantly exposed to bacteria both from the environment and from the upper airway, the lungs may not be free of microbes. Understanding the microbial composition of the lung in healthy individuals is necessary to understand changes that may occur with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or in immunosuppressed individuals such as those with HIV infection. Culture-independent techniques investigating various respiratory samples have produced conflicting conclusions about the composition of the lower respiratory tract microbiome (6\u201310). Controversy persists over the existence of distinct organisms in the lung and whether bacteria in the lungs represent microaspiration of oral microbiota or whether upper respiratory contamination of lower respiratory tract samples is caused by passing a bronchoscope through the oral cavity to obtain lung samples. In addition, because of the methodological challenges of these types of studies and the intensity of data analyses, small sample sizes and single-center designs are common, limiting generalization of results. Differences in study populations, geographical location, sample collection techniques, types of respiratory samples examined, and differences in DNA sequencing methodologies all compound the difficulty in comparing existing studies of the lung microbiome.",

As mentioned above, microbes from the mouth are regularly introduced into the lower respiratory tract. Therefore, defining the respiratory microbiome is a two-step process. First, it is necessary to test whether dispersal from the mouth, rather than active environmental selection in the lungs, can sufficiently explain the composition of the microbial community in the lungs. Second, we need to pick out bacterial groups whose distribution in the lungs cannot be explained by dispersal from the mouth, because these are the most plausible members of a lung microbiome. The neutral theory of community ecology is a novel analytic method to assess the respiratory microbiome by performing these two steps. This theory assumes that all species in a community are functionally equivalent (i.e., the observed distribution of species is not a result of active environmental selection) (11), and that dispersal from a source community and randomness in birth and death of microbes are sufficient to explain the observed community structure. Therefore, the neutral theory can be used as the null hypothesis to test whether dispersal from the mouth (source community) can satisfactorily describe the observed microbial distribution in the lung and to pinpoint bacterial groups that significantly deviate from \u201cneutrality,\u201d suggesting that these microbes might have some advantage in the lung.",

We constructed 95% binomial confidence intervals for the neutral model based on the Wilson method (19) with the Hmisc package in R (18). OTUs that fell between the confidence intervals were considered to be present as a result of dispersal from the mouth. OTUs that fell outside the upper bound of the confidence interval on the left were found at disproportionately higher frequencies in the lung than predicted by the neutral model based on their abundance in the mouth. OTUs that fell outside the lower bound of the confidence interval on the right were found less frequently in the lungs than predicted by the neutral model. Among the OTUs that were more frequent in the lung than predicted by the neutral model, those that had a mean relative abundance greater than or equal to 0.5% in the lung were considered the strongest candidates for environmental selection in the lung. Furthermore, a Wilcoxon t test was performed on the mean relative abundance of these OTUs between the lung and mouth to determine the statistical significance, using the MASS package in R (18).",

Beta-diversity (a measure of the number of different sequences among samples) was measured using \u0398YC because it provides a balanced representation of abundant and rare populations and is less sensitive to problems of undersampling compared with other metrics (22). Statistical comparisons based on \u0398YC were performed using nonparametric analysis of variance (23). OTU-by-OTU statistical comparisons were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, and we corrected for multiple comparisons using step-down Bonferroni correction (24).

                    "text": "In our implementation of the neutral model, the mouth was tested as a source for bacterial OTUs found in the lungs. If the composition of the microbial community in the lung was derived through dispersal from the mouth rather than environmental selection in the lung, the mean relative abundance of each OTU in the mouth would dictate the frequency with which that OTU is detected in the lungs. Therefore, a plot of the relative abundance of OTUs in the mouth versus the detection frequency of OTUs in the lung would result in a continuous monotonically increasing curve converging on 1. Accordingly, we found that the neutral model with the mouth as a source explained much of the microbial community observed in the lungs (Figures 1 and \u200band2;2; Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the model prediction and empirical observation was \u2265 0.84). This finding suggests that dispersal from the mouth is largely responsible for the composition of the microbial community in the lung at the depth of sequence reads analyzed. However, it is noteworthy that we were also able to identify OTUs that were disproportionately represented in the lung as compared with the values predicted by the neutral model (Figures 1 and \u200band2).2). For example, based on the V1\u20133 region in nonsmokers comparing oral wash and BAL, OTUs #30 (classified as Ralstonia sp.) and #72 (classified as Bosea sp.) were disproportionately represented in the lung (Figure 1). Based on data from the V3\u20135 region in nonsmokers\u2019 oral wash and BAL, OTUs #130 (classified as a Haemophilus sp.), #229 (classified as Enterobacteriaceae sp.), and #239 (classified as a Methylobacterium sp.) were also disproportionately represented (Figure 2). OTU #229 (Enterobacteriaceae sp.) was also identified as being disproportionately represented in the lungs of smokers compared with the mouths of smokers (Figure 2).",

Previous studies have found that overall, the lung microbiome resembles that of the mouth, but these studies have had limited numbers of subjects (6, 7). The finding that the majority of the organisms in the lung have also been detected in the mouth and upper airways is not surprising, as these sites are anatomically contiguous. The constant transport of microbes between these locations suggests the possibility that the lung microbiome could be in a continual state of flux, with new species being introduced or removed in a stochastic manner. Bronchoscopic contamination or carryover from the upper airway may also occur and influence detection of microbes in BAL samples, but studies of lung tissue have confirmed the independent presence of bacterial populations (7, 9).",

Under the null hypothesis of the neutral model, the distribution of microbes in the lung should mirror that seen in the \u201csource\u201d community (i.e., the mouth). Indeed, the presence of many microbes in the lungs was consistent with the neutral model of dispersal from the mouth; however, we also found some OTUs (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae sp., Haemophilus sp., both common causes of pneumonia) that exhibited significant deviations from the model, implying that these organisms were adapted toward proliferation in the lung environment. An important caveat is that we tested only for the mouth as the source community. Further evidence regarding a lung-specific microbiome needs to be confirmed by considering all possible sources, including the nose, throat, and gastrointestinal tract, and other methods of testing.",

Organisms found to be more abundant in the lung in the current study included Haemophilus and Enterobacteriaceae. We also detected Tropheryma whipplei in about one-quarter of participants in BAL, but not in OW. This organism was previously reported in BAL from a single healthy individual (6). Our larger sample size, however, likely improved our ability to detect rare bacteria in the lung. These data provide evidence of a lung population that cannot be explained solely by origin in the mouth.",

Previous work has shown that the oropharynx of smokers has a more diverse population than that of nonsmokers (14). In addition, other groups have reported enrichment of certain organisms in smokers as well as depletion of organisms, particularly of normal community members (14, 25, 26). We did not find differences in diversity of populations in the oropharynx of smokers compared with nonsmokers, nor did we find enrichment of particular species. We did find decreased relative abundance of Neisseria, Porphyromonas, and Gemella species in smokers. Gemella and Neisseria are members of the normal oral microbiota, and other studies have reported decreased abundance of Neisseria in smokers (6, 14). Porphyromonas, a bacteria linked to periodontal disease, is generally increased in smokers who show a decreased inflammatory response to this organism; however, we found that it was depleted in oral washes of smokers (14). Previous studies have generally directly sampled the subgingival region, possibly explaining differences from our results. Overall, these data confirm previous work suggesting that smoking disrupts the normal community structure in the mouth.",

In a study examining BAL in three never-smokers and seven healthy smokers, Erb-Downward and colleagues found that there were no significant differences between these groups (7). In our larger cohort, we also found no significant differences in BAL composition when examined as a whole in the two groups; however, when we specifically examined particular Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, we found that these microbes had decreased relative abundance in BAL from smokers. These findings suggest that smoking has a more profound effect on the microbial composition of the upper respiratory tract, but may also impact the community of the lower respiratory tract in more subtle ways.",

The differences seen with different primers indicate that caution must be used in comparing results between studies using different 16S regions for amplification.",

Although this study is the largest to date of the lower respiratory tract, we still may have lacked power to measure significant differences in community structures, and we were unable to adjust for factors such as sex or race. Several borderline analyses might have become significant with more participants. Power calculations have not been standardized for microbiota analyses, as statistics used differ from those in traditional epidemiologic or clinical investigations. Systematic assessment of the mouth was not performed; therefore, we could not determine the impact on periodontal disease or tooth condition on the lung microbiome. Although bronchoscopy protocols were standardized as much as possible, sample collection and processing methods may still have differed between sites, and analyses of replicate extractions or use of different models might have yielded different results (27). We did not detect clustering by study site, demonstrating that respiratory tract samples from multiple investigators can be pooled for central analysis if attention is paid to performing bronchoscopies in a similar fashion. Although we took multiple steps to minimize contamination during the procedure and from the environment and bronchoscope, the possibility of contamination still exists. Importantly, the similarity of our findings to Charlson and colleagues using a two-bronchoscope method (6) suggests that use of a single bronchoscope with appropriate precautions is a feasible approach for lower airway sampling if stringent analytic methods to control for upper airway contamination of lower airway samples are used. There may also be factors such as environmental exposures that influence the microbiome that we were not able to capture. Finally, the culture-independent techniques used for detecting the microbiome do not allow for determination of bacterial viability. However, the use of the neutral model allows us to identify organisms that appear to be enriched for growth in the lung. Although this is an indirect conclusion, we would infer that these bacteria are reproducing in the lung. In addition, even dead bacteria may be clinically important, as they can still provoke an immune response.",

By applying the novel analytic technique of the neutral community model, we found that lung bacterial populations are similar to those in the oropharynx, but the lung also contains distinctive populations of organisms. Whether these organisms are viable and resident in the lung is difficult to determine, but the current findings suggest that a distinctive lung microbiome exists in some healthy individuals that does not arise solely from contamination or dispersal from the mouth. The role of these organisms and the nature of the immune response to them will be important areas of future research, including study of populations with altered immunity such as HIV-infected individuals.",
