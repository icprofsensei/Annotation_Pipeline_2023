This finding has been observed now in three different SSc cohorts (UCLA (colonic lavage specimens, faecal specimens), OUH (faecal specimens), Swedish cohort (faecal specimens)).10\n32 We do not attribute this expansion to probiotic use. First, due to the exceptionally larger scale of the intestinal microbiome, ingestion of lactobacillus-bearing probiotics does not measurably alter faecal microbial composition.33 Second, very few patients in the present cohorts were taking probiotics on a regular basis, and none were taking probiotics within 3\u2005weeks of the stool collection. Deemed a beneficial commensal genus by several host inflammatory and physiological end points in animal models, its abundance is typically reduced in chronic inflammatory human diseases..34 We further note that members of this genus and their products alter the broader intestinal microbial ecosystem gene expression and function, which may be an intermediary of their action on systemic host phenotypes.33\n35 Since many patients with SSc consume commercial probiotic supplements that commonly include Lactobacillus species, the utility of Lactobacillus as a biomarker or potential intervention in patients deficient for this genus warrants further study.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that GIT microbiota plays a central role in regulating immune responses in pulmonary disease, such as asthma.36 It is possible that patients with SSc-ILD have distinct microbiota features compared with patients with SSc without ILD. Indeed, a recent analysis by Andr\u00e9aasen et al32 found that among patients with SSc from a single-centre cohort, the extent of GIT dysbiosis was more severe in patients with ILD compared with patients without ILD. Furthermore, although there was a similar ratio of patients with diffuse versus limited cutaneous disease in each SSc cohort, there may have been subtle differences in the peak severity of cutaneous sclerosis between the two cohorts.",

Many of the genus-level gains and losses appreciated in the faecal specimens examined in the present study were also observed in our prior study using colonic-mucosal specimens from the same patients with SSc (but different control patients).10 Using two independent SSc cohorts, this study also uncovered relationships between specific genera and severity of SSc-GIT symptoms, which merit further investigation. While larger studies are needed to validate and expand on these findings, the present study is the first to characterise the lower GIT microbiota in two geographically and ethnically distinct SSc cohorts.",
