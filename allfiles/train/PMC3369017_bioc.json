Devices were compared for ease of use and reproducibility [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)] between duplicate aliquots on diversity and taxonomic assignment. Associations were tested by linear regression. Both collection devices were easy to use. Both alpha diversity (Shannon index) and beta diversity (UniFrac) were higher between than within duplicates (P\u226410\u22128) and did not differ significantly by device (P\u22650.62). Reproducibility was good (ICC \u22650.77) for alpha diversity and taxonomic assignment to the most abundant phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (71.5% and 25.0% of sequences, respectively), but reproducibility was low (ICC\u22640.48) for less abundant taxa.

Through its complexity and mass, the microbiota could affect human health by way of multiple mechanisms. These include blocking pathogens, detoxifying potential carcinogens, digesting food to produce energy, synthesizing nutrients, conditioning and maintaining mucosal and systemic immunity, and facilitating homeostasis [2\u20134]. How the microbiota exerts these effects is poorly understood, as most of the organisms cannot be grown in culture. Animal models and culture-independent genomic methods have started to provide insight, particularly with respect to broad functional activities of the intestinal microbiota [5\u20137].",

Using 96 barcoded 338R primers, the V1\u2013V2 regions of 16S rRNA genes were amplified in 96 well microtiter plates as follows: 5.0 \u03bcL 10\u00d7 PCR buffer II (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 3.0 \u03bcL MgCl2 (25 mM; Applied Biosystems), 2.5 \u03bcL Triton X-100 (1%), 2.0 \u03bcL deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (10 mM), 1.0 \u03bcL each of primer 27F and 338R (20 pmol/\u03bcL each), 0.5 \u03bcL AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (5U/\u03bcL; Applied Biosystems), and 50 ng of template DNA in a total reaction volume of 50 \u03bcL. Reactions were run in a PTC-100 thermal controller (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA) using the following cycling parameters: 5 min of denaturation at 95\u00b0C, followed by 20 cycles of 30 sec at 95\u00b0C (denaturing), 30 sec at 56\u00b0C (annealing) and 90 sec at 72\u00b0C (elongation), with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 minutes. Non-template controls (NTC) were used as negative controls for each set of barcoded primers. The presence of amplicons was confirmed by gel electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and staining with SYBRGreen (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Equimolar amounts (~100 ng) of the PCR amplicons were mixed in a single tube, and amplification primers and reaction buffer were removed by processing the mixture with the Agencourt AMPure XP Kit (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). The purified amplicon mixtures were sequenced by 454 FLX Titanium pyrosequencing (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN) with 454 Life Sciences\u00ae primer A by the Genomics Resource Center at the Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine using protocols recommended by the manufacturer.",

Briefly, after trimming the primer and barcode sequences, raw sequence reads were filtered using the QIIME pipeline (http://qiime.sourceforge.net) [15] with the following criteria to optimize the quality and integrity of the data: 1) minimum and maximum read length of 300 bp and 500 bp; 2) no ambiguous base calls; 3) no homopolymeric runs longer than 8 bp; 4) average quality value >q25 within a sliding window of 50 bp; 5) 60% match to a previously determined 16S rRNA gene sequence; and 6) chimera-free using the UCHIME software (http://www.drive5.com/uchime/) [16]. Sequence reads with the same barcode were binned by sample. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined using QIIME as sequences with at least 97% similarity, and sequences were classified at the genus level using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) na\u00efve Bayesian classifier [17].",

Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between each device's duplicate samples were calculated for each microbial parameter, separately for each device. Relative abundance of each OTU, alpha diversity, and beta diversity were computed using QIIME [15]. Alpha diversity was estimated by the Shannon index (SI), which adjusts the number of taxa (OTUs) detected for their relative abundance (proportions). SI is calculated as minus the sum over OTUs of the proportion of a given OTU times the logarithm of that proportion in each sample. Beta diversity, which is a measure of separation of the phylogenetic structure of the OTUs in one sample, compared to all other samples, was estimated by unweighted Unifrac distances (http://qiime.sourceforge.net)]. The pseudo F-statistic was calculated using PERMANOVA to assess the reproducibility of beta diversity given the unweighted UniFrac distance matrix for each device [18]. Differences in ICCs and pseudo F-statistics between the devices were tested by comparison against null distributions obtained by randomly permuting the two device labels within individuals with 10,000 replicates (Supplementary Methods). The Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS, Marine Biology Laboratories, Woods Hole, MA) pipeline was used for presentation of beta diversity of RDP-classified taxa, with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index for genus [19]. Linear regression was carried out to test the association of each microbial parameter with age, sex, body mass index, and use of antibiotics or other prescription medications. Age and body mass index were mutually adjusted in the regression model. All P-values are two-sided. Analyses were conducted using the statistical software R (http://www.r-project.org/).",

This is especially important if specimens are to be self-collected. With our protocol, we found that either of two fecal collection devices, pre-loaded with a preservative (RNAlater) and used by volunteers at home, yielded high quality sequences of the universal 16S rRNA bacterial gene, as well as highly reproducible estimates of alpha diversity, beta diversity, and the major phyla of the fecal microbiome. Conversely, reproducibility was low for the minor phyla, probably due to heterogeneity within a stool and the small number of minor-phyla OTUs (mean n=6 per sample). We formally tested and thereby replicated previous observations of significantly higher fecal microbial diversity in samples between versus within individuals [20\u201322]. These findings suggest that our protocol could yield valid data for analytic epidemiologic research. However, fecal collection procedures may prove to be more challenging and potentially inconsistent in populations that are less educated and less motivated than our epidemiology colleagues.",

The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes may be reduced with obesity, a deficit that may resolve during a year of successful dieting [23]. More globally, Arumugam et al proposed that individuals have one of three relatively stable gut microbial communities (\u201centerotypes\u201d)[30], and a recent study suggested that these may reflect dietary differences in carbohydrates (with Prevotella predominating) versus protein and animal fat (with Bacteroides predominating) [31]. In a small feeding study, changes in fecal microbial taxa were seen within 24 hours of switching between high-fat/low-fiber and low-fat/high-fiber diets, even though enterotypes appeared to persist [31]. Our sample size, questionnaire data, and sequencing methods were insufficient to address these observations, but we did observe a trend of lower alpha diversity with higher body mass index, even with rather few overweight or obese participants. This supports a prior association of obesity with reduced alpha diversity [21].",

Because our primary objective was to assess reproducibility, we did not exclude participants who had used antibiotics or other prescription medications. We note that the effect can be profound, as the three participants who reported antibiotic use within one month of enrollment had a highly significant shift in relative abundance from Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. Earlier antibiotic use (not presented) had no apparent effect. Perhaps of more interest, we found that use of a non-antibiotic prescription medication was associated with significantly reduced alpha diversity. This has not been noted previously [30]. Indeed, one study found no association between non-antibiotic prescriptions and composition (relative abundance) of the fecal microbiome [22]. Although we lacked data on the specific non-antibiotic medications, our observation is fully compatible with the accumulating evidence that commonly used proton-pump inhibitors and H2 blockers increase the risk of clinically significant colonic infection with Clostridium difficile [32]. Despite the effects of antibiotics and diet, major metabolic and other functions of the colonic microbiota appear to be uniform among individuals [22;33].",

In addition, we did not study a representative sample of adults, but rather volunteers who were highly motivated, highly educated and generally in good health. Although our volunteers included several from Asia, Latin America, and Europe, as well as the United States, we did not collect race and ethnicity data, as these were deemed irrelevant to assessment of the two fecal collection devices and the reproducibility of the 16S rRNA sequences. The associations that we found with medications, age and body mass index must be viewed with caution, because they may have arisen by chance due to multiple comparisons. Independent replication of our findings is needed. Finally, we observed low reproducibility for rare taxa, probably attributable to sampling various parts of heterogeneous stool. The implications are that statistical power to detect cancer associations with rare taxa will be low unless studies are much larger or collect homogenized feces or many more samples.",
