Prior works that have examined the gut microbiome as a novel biomarker for advanced fibrosis have only examined patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, our goal was to examine the gut microbiome across varying etiologies of liver disease to create a predictive model for liver fibrosis based upon a microbial signature. Stool samples were obtained from patients with chronic liver disease (n\u2009=\u200950) undergoing FibroScan (ultrasound elastography) at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. Healthy control patients (n\u2009=\u200925) were also recruited as a reference population. Fecal samples underwent 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Using differentially abundant microbes, a random forest classifier model was created to distinguish advanced fibrosis from mild/moderate fibrosis. The findings were then validated in a separate cohort of chronic liver disease patients (n\u2009=\u200937). Etiologies for liver disease included non-alcoholic liver disease (58.0%), hepatitis C (26.0%), hepatitis B (10.0%), and alcohol (6.0%). Microbiome composition was distinct in liver patients with advanced fibrosis compared to those with minimal fibrosis and healthy controls (p\u2009=\u20090.003). In multivariate negative binomial modeling, 26 bacterial taxa were differentially abundant in patients with advanced fibrosis as compared to those with minimal/moderate fibrosis (q-value\u2009<\u20090.05). A random forests classifier based on these taxa had an AUROC of 0.90 to predict advanced fibrosis. Prevotella copri, which was enriched in patients with advanced fibrosis, was the most strongly predictive microbe in the classifier. The classifier had an AUROC of 0.82 for advanced fibrosis in the validation cohort and Prevotella copri remained the strongest predictive microbe for advanced fibrosis. There is a distinct microbial signature for patients with advanced fibrosis independent of liver disease etiology and other comorbidities. These results suggest that microbial profiles can be used as a non-invasive marker for advanced fibrosis and support the hypothesis that microbes and their metabolites contribute to hepatic fibrosis.",

The development of advanced fibrosis is a major predictor of liver-related morbidity and mortality11\u201313. Early identification of advanced fibrosis using non-invasive testing is a growing area of research in the field of hepatology12,14,15. The characterization of gut microbial biomarkers for advanced fibrosis has been a novel area of ongoing research. For example, Qin and colleagues in 2014 reported that an intestinal microbial signature was present in individuals with cirrhosis in a Chinese cohort as compared to healthy controls16. This study included different causes of cirrhosis including hepatitis C, hepatitis B, NAFLD, and alcoholic liver disease. Loomba et al. in two separate studies was able to identify and validate a distinct microbial signature that was related to advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD17,18. However they did not explore other etiologies of chronic liver disease, so it is unclear at this time if this signature holds true for other causes of liver disease in western society. Given the association of the microbiome with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, the aim of this study was to determine if specific fecal microbial profiles can be used as non-invasive biomarkers for advanced fibrosis in patients with varying etiologies of chronic liver disease.",

Patients with HCV disease as compared to controls differed significantly across 25 different OTUs (a taxonomic unit roughly corresponding to species). An undefined species belonging to the family Rikenellaceae, two undefined species in the genus Bacteroides, and an undefined species in the genus Dialister made up the OTUs with the largest relative abundance (Fig.\u00a03A). NAFLD patients had 34 separate OTUs that were differentially abundant from healthy controls (Fig.\u00a03B). The species with the highest relative abundance included Prevotella copri, an undefined species in the family Ruminococcaceae and an undefined species in the family Rikenellaceae. All 3 of these species were underrepresented in patients with NAFLD. Comparing NAFLD to HCV patients, there were 10 OTUs that were differentially abundant between the two groups. Prevotella copri, an undefined species belonging to the genus Bacteroides, and an undefined species of the order Clostridiales made three most abundant OTUs. Prevotella copri was higher in patients with NAFLD adjusting for fibrosis stage, while the other two OTUs were higher in patients with HCV (Fig.\u00a03C).",

The two most highly abundant differential OTUs were Prevotella copri and an undefined species belonging to the genus Bacteroides, both of which were elevated in patients with advanced fibrosis (Fig.\u00a04A). Examining differences between fibrosis stage within patients with HCV and with NAFLD, there were 12 OTUs and 23 OTUs that were differentially abundant, respectively. While Prevotella copri did have a higher relative abundance in HCV patients with advanced fibrosis, it did not reach statistical significance. Instead, two undefined species in the family Ruminococcaceae and Akkermansia muciniphila were the three differential OTUs with the highest abundance; all three were elevated in patients with HCV with advanced fibrosis (Fig.\u00a04B). In NAFLD patients, Prevotella copri was the predominant species and it was elevated in patients with advanced fibrosis (Fig.\u00a04C).",

The average weighted Nearest Sequenced Taxon Index (NTSI) per sample was 0.08. Low scores indicate availability of closely related reference genomes and thus a higher quality of predictions26. While there was no overall large difference of the predicted metagenome between samples by fibrosis stage as represented by the principal coordinates analysis in Fig.\u00a05A (p\u2009=\u20090.34), patients with advanced fibrosis did have a trend to have more bacterial genes present per sample (Fig.\u00a05B, p\u2009=\u20090.09). From 16S rRNA compositional data, DESeq2 analysis of PICRUSt predicted metagenes showed 168 metagenes that were statistically differentially expressed in patients with advanced fibrosis as compared to those with minimal or no fibrosis. Categorizing these metagenes into functional categories showed 9 pathways that are different between the two groups. The pathways that were most different between the two groups were those involved in mineral absorption, arachidonic acid metabolism, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, and linoleic acid metabolism (Fig.\u00a05C).",

Within our cohort the most abundant species that were significantly different between healthy controls and NAFLD patients while adjusting for the level of fibrosis were Prevotella copri, an undefined species in the family Ruminococcaceae, and an undefined species in the family Rikenellaceae. This is similar to other prior works showing a reduction of Ruminococcus and Prevotella in non-cirrhotic NAFLD patients18,30.

In our cohort of racially diverse patients with varying etiologies of chronic liver disease, we show that the idea of using stool analysis to identify patients with advanced fibrosis is not only feasible but potentially highly accurate. While several other non-invasive methods are currently available for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis including magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), transient elastography, and lab-based models, these modalities can have reduced accuracy in patients with diabetes or severe obesity33. Therefore, we propose that stool analysis can be a potentially accurate method when other modalities are limited. Combination of stool testing with other non-invasive tests including Fib-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scoring may also prove to be an important clinical tool to identify those patients who are more likely to progress to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.",

                    "text": "In our model, we show that Prevotella copri was the predominant species predictive of advanced fibrosis. This was also true in our validation cohort as well. While Prevotella copri is still present in normal healthy controls, it is significantly higher in patients with advanced fibrosis, a trend that is consistent across all etiologies of chronic liver disease. This is similar to Qin et al. who showed that Prevotella was enriched in patients with cirrhosis as compared to healthy controls16. Prevotella copri is of great interest as it has been extensively studied in other inflammatory diseases34. It encodes a unique superoxide reductase which may provide resistance to or even the use of host-derived reactive oxygen species produced during inflammation35. Mice colonized with P. copri have increased inflammation in a colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium36. In vitro models have shown that P. copri can stimulate IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17, all cytokines associated with pro-inflammatory Th17 responses37. This has led many to believe that P. copri is a potential driver of inflammation and can even induce such inflammatory diseases as rheumatoid arthritis34. In a recent publication, Prevotella copri was also seen as the main bacteria associated with advanced fibrosis in NAFLD pediatric patients38. Our analysis also shows a distinct bacterial metagenomic profile for patients with advanced fibrosis. In our analysis, we show that the pathways that were most different between patients with advanced fibrosis compared to those without were related to mineral absorption, arachidonic acid metabolism, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, and linoleic acid metabolism. In mouse models of liver steatosis, linoleic acid was shown to be protective against inflammation by affecting PPAR-\u03b1 and NF-\u03ba\u03b2 signaling39. The observed associations of P. copri and these functional pathways with advanced fibrosis provide preliminary evidence that the gut microbiome may contribute to the progression of liver fibrosis. Therefore, it can be both a useful non-invasive biomarker as well as a potential target for future interventions.",

                    "text": "We acknowledge that there were several limitations to this study. For example, we relied on FibroScan rather than liver histology to make the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. With the wide adoption of non-invasive testing for fibrosis, the use of liver biopsy is becoming less frequent. However, FibroScan is becoming a more widely accepted and accurate method for detecting the presence of hepatic fibrosis40. While other papers have mentioned that obesity might be a limitation of FibroScan, our facility and technicians had access to and were familiar with the XL probe, which has been proven to have improved diagnostics in obese patients40. Another limitation is that this is a single center VA study and so the generalizability of this study to other settings is still uncertain. While the multivariate analyses did not control for all factors that could affect the microbiome, including diet and medications, the corroboration of our findings in a separate validation cohort that accounted for diet strengthens the findings of our study. Furthermore, while we did attempt to represent a wide array of chronic liver disease, the majority of our patients had chronic HCV or NAFLD. A complete representation of all etiologies of chronic liver disease was unable to be accomplished due to the rarity of less common etiologies including autoimmune disease, Wilson\u2019s disease, hemochromatosis, PSC, PBC, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Therefore, future studies will be needed in order to confirm that these findings apply to other chronic liver disease etiologies. Because this study is cross-sectional, it is unable to establish causality between the gut microbiome and hepatic fibrosis. Planned future studies will include the use of fecal metabolomics to examine the differential pattern of microbial derived metabolites in patients with advanced fibrosis and the use of animal models with microbial transplant or single bacteria gavage to understand the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and hepatic fibrosis.",

Future studies should focus on the mechanism by which these microbial differences may contribute to the progression of fibrosis and if the models presented here are valid in other clinical subgroups.",
