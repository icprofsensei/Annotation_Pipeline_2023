Appropriate storage of sample material is essential to avoid the introduction of post-collection bias in microbial community composition. Rapid freezing to \u221280\u2009\u00b0C is commonly considered to be best-practice. However, this is not feasible in many studies, particularly those involving sample collection in participants\u2019 homes. We determined the extent to which a range of stabilisation and storage strategies maintained the composition of faecal microbial community structure relative to freezing to \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Refrigeration at 4\u2009\u00b0C, storage at ambient temperature, and the use of several common preservative buffers (RNAlater, OMNIgene.GUT, Tris-EDTA) were assessed relative to freezing. Following 72\u2009hours of storage, faecal microbial composition was assessed by 16\u2009S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Refrigeration was associated with no significant alteration in faecal microbiota diversity or composition. However, samples stored using other conditions showed substantial divergence compared to \u221280\u2009\u00b0C control samples. Aside from refrigeration, the use of OMNIgene.GUT resulted in the least alteration, while the greatest change was seen in samples stored in Tris-EDTA buffer. The commercially available OMNIgene.GUT kit may provide an important alternative where refrigeration and cold chain transportation is not available.",

In particular, amplicon sequencing targeted to the 16S ribosomal RNA gene provides a relatively inexpensive and rapid characterisation of microbial communities14. When applied to faecal material, this approach represents an effective and non-invasive means to assess the gut microbiology, and has been applied across a wide range of research contexts. The ability to detect fine-scale changes in microbiota composition makes 16S gene sequencing useful in assessing changes in longitudinal sample collections, or relatively minor differences between clinically-defined groups. However, the inherent sensitivity of the approach also makes amplicon sequencing particularly susceptible to biases introduced through inappropriate sample handling or storage. For example, faecal microbiota sequencing profiles have been shown to change significantly during ambient temperature storage after 48\u2009hours15,16. Where performing nucleic acid extraction on fresh samples immediately after collection is impractical, freezing and storage at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C is widely considered to be best practice when preserving microbial composition for sequence-based analysis17,18,19.",

Some effective approaches, such as the immersion of faecal material in ethanol20, may preclude many modes of sample transportation, including post and air-freight. Commercial reagents designed for other purposes, such as the RNA preservative, RNAlater, are commonly used as a general preservative, but have been shown to perform relatively poorly in maintaining microbiota composition20,21. Buffers containing EDTA can inhibit the growth of certain bacteria at concentrations used for sample preservation22,23, but their impact on sequencing-based microbiota profiling is not well characterised. In addition, OMNIgene.GUT DNA Stabilisation Kit (DNA Genotek), a commercially available approach to temporary preservation of samples at ambient temperature, has recently become available, but its effectiveness relative to other approaches has not been independently assessed. The current absence of data supporting an approach that is appropriate for home faecal sample collection, and non-specialist sample transportation, is therefore a problem for researchers when designing clinical studies with remote collection components.",

Within the sample cluster of collection 1 and 2, samples were separated along the y-axis based on the storage conditions, and a similar observation was noted in collection 3. Consistent with these findings, a PERMANOVA (Permutational multivariate analysis of variance) test on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices indicated that both the collection group (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and the storage conditions (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the samples.

Investigating this relationship has been greatly facilitated by next-generation sequencing4,11. However, the application of these gene-based approaches can only yield useful insight if the material analysed accurately represents the microbial community at the site sampled. By assessing the impact of a number of commonly used storage conditions on sequencing-based, faecal microbial profiles, we provide an empirical basis for future study design. We used storage at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C as a control based on previous studies that reported no significant variation between fresh samples and those stabilised in this way18,20.",

This variation makes discerning the impact of sample storage more difficult when material from multiple individuals is included. For this reason, repeat samples collected from a single subject were used. However, intra-individual variation in sample composition also occurs, and for this reason, we assessed variation between serial samples that were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. These samples were found to have significant variation in microbial diversity and evenness. PERMANOVA analysis suggested that these variations resulted from differences in sample composition at the different collection timepoints. However, since storage conditions were assessed based on portions of the same starting material, such variation would not be a source of bias.",

However, perhaps unsurprisingly, the composition of samples stored at room temperature changed substantially. These changes principally represented increases in the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium species, belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria, and decreases in the relative abundance of Anaerostipes, Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae species, belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. These findings are concordant with a report by Roesch and colleagues16 in which they identified a similar decline in Firmicutes bacteria in samples stored at room temperature for 72\u2009hours. The observed shifts in bacterial community structure were also reflected in measures of diversity compared to the \u221280\u2009\u00b0C controls, consistent with the overgrowth of a limited number of species. A number of other prior studies have reported no significant variation in the composition of faecal samples stored at room temperature15,21. However, it is noteworthy that these studies did not report substantial actinobacterial populations in their subject groups (<5% relative abundance), with greater relative abundances of Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes.",

The two taxa whose abundance changed significantly in samples stored in OMNIgene.GUT were the Sutterella and Faecalibacterium genera. This is concerning given the many reports of associations between these genera and a range of gastrointestinal diseases28,29,30,31. In samples stored in RNAlater and TE buffer, there was an increase in the Bacteroides population, and a decrease in Firmicutes (Blautia), and Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium). In addition, except for the OMNIgene.GUT group, the relative abundance of Anaerostipes differed significantly in all storage conditions compared to the \u221280\u2009\u00b0C controls, suggesting that this taxon is particularly sensitive to changes in storage conditions.",

The increase in abundance of the facultative anaerobe, Proteobacteria, may be due to exposure of the faecal material to aerobic conditions when suspended in the buffer. Furthermore, these changes (an increase abundance of Proteobacteria and a reduction of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria) resemble those associated with some types of diet-induced gut dysbiosis32,33,34, and as such, we suggest that the use of TE buffer for sample stabilisation should only be considered in combination with low temperature storage to prevent bacterial proliferation.",

Storage conditions have the potential to introduce substantial alterations to microbial community profiling based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Where ultra-low temperature storage is unavailable, changes to microbial composition can be minimized by storage and transportation of samples at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Changes in microbiota composition in unstabilised samples may explain incongruent findings from previous sequencing-based faecal studies. Significant intra-individual variation occurs in the composition of faecal samples from individual subjects, which is greater than the variation observed between the different storage methods. These findings underline the importance of high frequency, longitudinal faecal collection to understand the temporal dynamics of microbial communities.",

Briefly, barcoded forward and reverse sequencing reads were quality filtered and merged using Paired-End reAd mergeR (PEAR v0.9.6)37. Chimeras were detected and filtered from the paired-end reads using USEARCH (v6.1)38 against the 97% clustered representative sequences from the Greengenes database (v13.8)39. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assigned to the reads using an open reference approach with UCLUST algorithm (v1.2.22q) against the SILVA database release 111 (July 2012)40 that was clustered at 97% identity. During the OTU assignment, sequences were pre-clustered at 80% against the reference prior to de novo clustering. A minimum subsampling depth of 10,409 reads was selected based on the lowest read depth of samples. QIIME was used to generate an alpha rarefaction curve to confirm that the relationship between read depth and new taxon detection approached an asymptote in all samples at this depth. No samples were eliminated following subsampling.",
