The COPD clinical course, punctuated by exacerbations, is frequently treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Chronic treatment with macrolides reduces the frequency of exacerbations in patients; however, the salient mechanisms are undefined.1\n2 Although sputum culture shows altered bacterial compositions during exacerbations, the role of bacterial colonisation in COPD progression is uncertain.3 In a recent single-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial with moxifloxacin, doxycycline, azithromycin (AZM) or placebo, the bacterial load of sputum did not change significantly.4 However, description of the lower airway microbiome has been challenging because bacterial burden in the lung is approximately 1 million-fold lower than in the gut and 100-fold lower than the upper airway.5\n6 The presence of supraglottic microbes, such Veillonella or Prevotella, in the lower airway commonly occurs5\u201310 and detection of these bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is associated with increased inflammation,5\n11 supporting the hypothesis that microbiota changes are linked with pulmonary effects. In response to stress, bacterial cells produce anti-inflammatory metabolites, including indole-3-acetate, which may induce biofilms and reduce antibiotic susceptibility.12\n13 Bacterial stress responses during antibiotic treatment could therefore impact innate immunity, benefiting the local bacterial community.",

For BAL, the right middle lobe and/or lingula were preferred and 150\u2005mL of sterile saline was used for the lavage. Background samples were obtained by passing sterile saline through the suctioning channel of bronchoscope prior to bronchoscopy. From the BAL fluid, the total and differential cell counts were obtained after centrifugation. Subjects then were randomised to receive either placebo or AZM 250\u2005mg/daily for 8\u2005weeks. Based on previous data, we considered this treatment period sufficient to observe significant changes in inflammatory mediators.14 Both placebo and AZM were prepared in an opaque capsule by the NYU pharmacy and were given to each subject after the first bronchoscopy. The NYU pharmacy controlled the randomisation scheme to ensure that the study was double-blinded. Each subject completed a pill diary. After 8\u2005weeks of treatment with AZM or placebo, subjects underwent post-treatment research bronchoscopy in which BAL was performed in same lung segments as in the baseline bronchoscopy.

PERMANOVA (Adonis) testing was used to compare \u03b2-diversity of groups. \u03b2-Diversity refers to between-sample similarity based on bacterial composition. For \u03b2-diversity (between-sample taxonomic diversity), we used the ade4 package in R to construct Principal Coordinate Analysis based on weighted UniFrac distances.

For comparisons of \u03b1-diversity, \u03b2-diversity or taxonomy between the placebo and AZM groups at baseline, non-parametric (Mann-Whitney) tests were used. Paired statistics (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used for pre-treatment and post-treatment comparison of continuous parameters such as changes in \u03b1diversity post-treatment with AZM or placebo. To evaluate changes in \u03b2-diversity pre-treatment versus post-treatment, we performed Procrustes analysis of the principal coordinate matrices generated after \u03b2-diversity determination on each pair of BAL samples (before and after treatment) for every subject. False discovery rate was used to control for multiple testing. To evaluate differences between groups of 16S data or inferred metagenomes, we used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) in paired samples (before and after treatment).15 All data are publicly available in Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE74396 (see online supplementary material for more details).",

Since analytes in the epithelial lining fluid are diluted with sterile saline during BAL, a concentration step was performed via dialysis against Tris 10\u2005mM pH 7.5, EDTA 1\u2005mM and lyophilisation, using albumin as an internal control. For this, the initial volume of acellular BAL fluid was 5\u2005mL. After lyophilisation at \u221280\u00b0 C, sample was resuspended in 60\u2005\u03bcL of phosphate-buffered saline. This approach yielded measurable concentrations in 30/39 cytokines in a Luminex platform (Human Cytokine Panel I, Millipore) for all samples. The following cytokines levels were below the detectable limit of the assay (standard curve range=3.2\u201310\u2005000\u2005pg/mL) and are not included in the analyses: interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b2, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17. Values obtained in concentrated BAL fluid were extrapolated to represent concentration in BAL by dividing the obtained levels in picogram/millilitre by 83.3 (since 5\u2005mL of BAL fluid was lyophilised and resuspended in 60\u2005\u03bcL).

Since we observed changes in microbial metabolites during treatment with AZM, we tested the ex-vivo anti-inflammatory effects of two of those metabolites (glycolic acid and indole-3-acetate) in macrophages obtained from a similar cohort of smokers. To this end, we isolated alveolar macrophages from an additional eight subjects (two smokers and six ex-smokers) who were enrolled in an NIH-funded protocol (Lung Microbiome and Inflammation in Early COPD, NYU IRB# S14-01546, online supplementary table S1).

For comparison, the bacterial load present in the suctioning channel of bronchoscope prior to bronchoscopy tended to be lower (27.9(11.4\u201361.4)\u00d7103 16S rRNA copies/mL, p=ns). There were no significant differences in \u03b1-diversity (within-sample diversity) as estimated by the number of unique OTUs rarified by sequence depth (figure 2B). Evaluation of microbial similarity between background and supraglottic samples was performed using NMDS based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity to visualise clustering patterns among samples and its relationship with dominant taxa. Online supplementary figure S1 shows that background samples are clearly distinct from supraglottic samples and are used to define upper airway taxa and background taxa. We then analysed ecological similarity between acellular BAL samples using a similar NMDS approach. Consistent with the two distinct pneumotypes previously defined,5 the acellular BAL samples again showed two groups at baseline, in which the clusters were mainly driven by enrichment with upper airway taxa (defined as pneumotypeSPT for supraglottic predominant taxa) or background taxa (defined as pneumotypeBPT for background predominant taxa) (see figure 2C and online supplementary figure 2). Consistent with prior data, samples allocated to pneumotypeSPT had higher bacterial load than samples allocated to pneumotypeBPT (141.7(72.3\u2013309.5) vs 31.7 (18.4\u201330.9)\u00d7103 16S rRNA copies/mL, p=0.002).5 Importantly, the placebo and AZM groups had similar numbers of BAL samples enriched with upper airway (pneumotypeSPT) or background taxa (pneumotypeBPT). To evaluate the relative contribution of the background microbiota to the BAL samples, we used SourceTracker, where background microbiota was used as the source. This analysis showed that a similar proportion of background characteristic taxa was found in BAL samples of both groups (64(34\u201387) vs 55(44\u201373)% for the placebo and AZM groups, respectively), indicating that there were no differences in contamination with environmental microbiome (microbiome present in the bronchoscope prior to bronchoscopy).

However, mechanistic interpretation of the critical events has been limited by inability to comprehensively characterise the microbial community of the lung. Our observations of the impact of AZM on the lower airway microbiota, bacterial metabolites and lower airway cytokines are consistent with its known anti-inflammatory effects. During COPD exacerbations, neutrophils and TNF-\u03b1 increase, a process associated with loss of lung function. CXCL1, a central chemokine for neutrophil recruitment to the lung, is elevated in both COPD and overt infection28\n29 and IL-13 strongly induces CXCL1 in human airway cells.30 However, the lack of AZM effect in our ex-vivo experiments suggests that its anti-inflammatory effects are not mediated through direct interaction with alveolar macrophages. Exposure to antibiotics, including macrolides, are typical stimuli leading to induction of bacterial metabolic genes and metabolites,31 including short chain fatty acids (SCFA) including glycolate,32 found to be elevated in the BALs following AZM. Bacterial SCFA also inhibit cytokine production and inflammation after LPS stimulation of macrophages.16 The increase of indole-3-acetate, a bacterial metabolite, after AZM treatment is induced by oxidative stress.21\n33 Erythromycin induction of the tryptophan operon22\n23 is consistent with the increased levels of indole-3-acetate post-AZM. That indole-3-acetate and glycolic acid are induced by AZM and inhibit in-vitro production of proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages provides a plausible explanation for some of the anti-inflammatory effects of AZM in the lung.",

                    "text": "This investigation is limited by the small sample size and its focus on subjects with relatively mild disease. However, recruitment of this group may help identify early steps in pathogenesis. In our cohort, only few patients met GOLD criteria for COPD and, for the remaining subjects, it is impossible to know who will develop COPD. It will be, therefore, important to also examine the effects of AZM on the microbial environment of the lower airways in a cohort of patients with COPD with more advanced disease and frequent exacerbations, in whom more prolonged treatment with AZM has been shown to exert a beneficial clinical effect.1 A major challenge to study this population is the increased risk of invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy; non-invasive markers would be more desirable. A large proportion of BAL samples were dominated by background taxa, which tend to have low bacterial burden. In these samples, the true composition of the lower airway microbiome is more difficult to establish due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Studies that include subjects with higher bacterial burden (such in more advanced COPD) are needed to clarify the effects of macrolides on the composition of the microbial community of the lower airways. Of note, a recent placebo-controlled study did not show significant change in bacterial burden in sputum after macrolides,4 similar to the results of this study. Replication is also important because of the limited ability of a small study to control for the effects of multiple comparisons and the modest effect sizes in our assays. This is also important since it is possible that some subject's characteristics might have actually differed between groups but did not reach statistical significance due to the small sample size. Nevertheless, the paucity of changes in the placebo group, the observed changes in multiple platforms and the ex-vivo experimental validation increase confidence in the findings and interpretation. Moreover, our power to detect differences was increased by our longitudinal assessment, using each subject as their own control. In this study, we used acellular BAL fluid, a type of sample that has been used before to describe the lower airway microbiome.5\n10\n34\u201336 Other studies have used whole BAL; head-to-head comparison of acellular versus whole BAL showed that in some samples, taxa differed significantly with loss of some Pseudomonas and Escherichia OTUs in the acellular BAL sample.11 While whole BAL fluid may somewhat differ in taxonomic composition compared with acellular BAL samples, the reduction of \u03b1-diversity and changes in taxonomic composition before and after AZM, but not in the placebo group, occur in samples that were consistently processed similarly. Thus, the observed differences cannot be explained by differences in technical processing or composition of whole BAL versus acellular BAL sample. Although we provide evidence that some metabolites of possible bacterial origin induced by AZM are anti-inflammatory ex-vivo, we cannot distinguish the antibiotic and anti-inflammatory effects of AZM in these subjects. Neither can we assess the effects of AZM on other microbial communities such as the gut that might contribute to the host immune phenotype. A transcriptome approach would help distinguish microbial from mammalian metabolic effects on measured metabolites. However, technical challenges due to low bacterial concentration further limit the evaluation of microbial genes impacted by AZM in-vivo.",
