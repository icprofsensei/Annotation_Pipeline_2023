In the intestinal mucosa, 5\u2010ASA is acetylated to its inactive metabolite N\u2010acetyl\u20105\u2010ASA (Ac\u20105\u2010ASA), mainly by the enzyme N\u2010acetyl\u2010transferase 1 (NAT1), and to a small degree by N\u2010acetyl\u2010transferase 2 (NAT2).8, 9 Orally administered unbound 5\u2010ASA is absorbed and inactivated in the small intestinal mucosa and in the liver, thus only small amounts 5\u2010ASA will reach the colonic mucosa.3, 10 Therefore, several pharmaceutical delivery systems have been developed to transport orally administered 5\u2010ASA to the colon. In a time\u2010dependent formulation (Pentasa, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Saint\u2010Prex, Switzerland), 5\u2010ASA is coated with a semipermeable membrane of ethyl cellulose, providing a pH\u2010independent release of approximately 35% of its content in the small bowel, 25% in the colon, while the last 40% eliminates in the faeces.11 In a pH\u2010dependent delivery system (Asacol, Tillots Pharma AG, Rheinfelden, Switzerland), 5\u2010ASA is coated with Eudragit S which dissolves at a pH >7,12 normally occurring in the terminal ileum and caecum. The Multi Matrix System (Mezavant, Shire Pharmaceutical Contracts Ltd, in partnership with Cosmo SpA, Milan, Italy) consists of hydrophilic and lipophilic excipients, covered by a pH\u2010dependent coating dissolving at pH 7, causing slow diffusion of the drug into the gut lumen.3 For both Asacol and Mezavant absorption in the ileum is estimated to be around 20%.13, 14 Faecal elimination for Asacol and Pentasa has been found to be similar.12\n",

Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented as median (IQR, interquartile range) for skewly distributed variables, mean value (SD) for normal distributed variables, and as % (n) for categorical variables. Accordingly, Kruskal\u2010Wallis test, F\u2010test (ANOVA) and chi\u2010squared test were used for comparing 5\u2010ASA formulations groups with respect to these measures. A multilevel linear mixed model was applied to test for difference in mean mucosal concentrations of 5\u2010ASA and Ac\u20105\u2010ASA (log\u2010transformed data) by type of 5\u2010ASA formulation, adjusted for (no\u2010interaction model), or specific to (interaction model) sample locations in the left hemicolon and rectum (10, 25 and 40\u00a0cm from the anal verge), further described in Supporting Information. Kruskal\u2010Wallis test was used for comparing serum concentrations between the three 5\u2010ASA formulations. Regardless of 5\u2010ASA formulation (n\u00a0=\u00a042), mean mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentration (individual level defined by mean of five repeated measures, log\u2010transformed) and mean serum 5\u2010ASA concentration was compared according to NAT genotype (two phenotypes for NAT1 and three phenotypes for NAT2) and disease activity (deep remission or remission according to endoscopic or total Mayo score) using one\u2010way ANOVA. P\u2010values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. A power analysis was performed in which mean mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentration estimates were based on previous studies comparing Pentasa and Asacol4, 7, 15 by one\u2010way ANOVA and two pair\u2010wise comparisons. With mean 5\u2010ASA concentrations of 60 and 20\u00a0ng/mg, a SD of 30\u00a0ng/mg, \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.8, 11 patients in each group were needed.",

Totally 19 mucosal bacterial genera were associated with 5\u2010ASA concentration. The bacterial genus in the mucosa that was most significantly associated to 5\u2010ASA concentration was Faecalibacterium (4.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221216) (Figure \u200b(Figure4C),4C), followed by the genera Blautia (Figure \u200b(Figure4D),4D), Bacteroides, Coprococcus and Dorea. Of the genera associated with 5\u2010ASA concentration, 18 of 19 were positively associated (Figure S7). Cloacibacterium was the only genus negatively associated (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048) with mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentration in the mucosal biopsies (Figure \u200b(Figure4F).4F). On species level, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was positively correlated with mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentration (P\u00a0=\u00a01.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126) (Figure \u200b(Figure4E).4E). In faeces, two bacterial genera were associated with 5\u2010ASA mucosal concentration; Prevotella (P\u00a0=\u00a07.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125) and Sutterella (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), both genera were negatively associated with 5\u2010ASA concentrations (Table \u200b(Table55).",

There was no significant association between serum 5\u2010ASA concentration and NAT2 genotype (P\u00a0=\u00a00.708). Mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentration was not significantly associated with neither NAT1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.276) nor NAT2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.488) genotype.",

Concurring with previous findings, our patients had declining concentrations of 5\u2010ASA towards the rectum.16 A novel finding was that patients using Mezavant had higher overall mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentrations, compared to patients using Pentasa, while there was no significant difference between patients using Mezavant and Asacol. All patients used high doses of 5\u2010ASA, however the manufacturers' maximal recommended dose of Pentasa (4.0\u00a0g) is 17% lower than of Mezavant (4.8\u00a0g) and Asacol (4.8\u00a0g), but this could only explain a minor proportion of the observed differences. The large inter\u2010individual variation in concentration was consistent with previous reports,4, 5, 6, 7 whereas the intra\u2010individual variation between bowel segments was small. Factors such as colonic transit time, intraluminal pH and disease pattern may affect dissolution and uptake of 5\u2010ASA in the colon39 and could explain some of the inter\u2010individual variation in 5\u2010ASA concentration reported in the present and previous studies.4, 15, 16 The mucosal Ac\u20105\u2010ASA concentration reflects the amount of 5\u2010ASA metabolised by NAT1 in the colonic mucosa. There were no significant differences in Ac\u20105\u2010ASA mucosal concentrations between the three 5\u2010ASA formulations. Similarly, the serum concentrations of 5\u2010ASA or Ac\u20105\u2010ASA did not differ between the formulations.",

High mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentration was associated with high bacterial diversity, decreased mucosal abundances of Proteobacteria phylum and increased mucosal abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Reduced bacterial diversity is a hallmark of dysbiosis in UC, whereas increased bacterial diversity is perceived beneficial.20, 21, 25, 41 Proteobacteria are increased in patients with UC,25, 42, 43 and linked to increased disease activity and relapse frequency.24, 42 Overall, the bacterial genera positively associated with high 5\u2010ASA concentrations have previously been associated with beneficial effects in IBD: (a) the abundances of the butyrate producing Faecalibacterium and Roseburia have been inversely correlated to disease activity in UC.44 (b) Blautia, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Sutterella have all been reported to be inversely correlated with inflammation in patients with ileal\u2010pouch anal anastomosis.45 (c) Ruminococcaceae and Ruminococcus spp in donor faeces transplanted to UC patients is associated with induction of remission46 and (d) the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae family, to which most genera in Table \u200bTable44 belong, may protect against UC as they are increased in healthy twins discordant for UC.22 One genus, Cloacibacterium, was found to be negatively associated to mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentration, recently this genus has been reported to be more abundant in inflamed vs. non\u2010inflamed tissue of UC patients.23\n",

In the present study, patients had low disease activity, and in contrast to previous findings, the 5\u2010ASA concentration was not significantly associated with the combined parameters of disease activity. Such associations may not be evident within a relatively homogenous patient group with low disease activity. In fact, there was a trend towards higher mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentrations in patients with higher endoscopic scores and it is unlikely that the microbiome features associated with mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentration were confounded by the degree of inflammation. NAT1 and NAT2 genotypes have previously not been found to influence treatment efficacy,48 but studies correlating NAT genotypes to 5\u2010ASA mucosal concentrations have previously not been published. We found no correlation between NAT genotypes and mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentration, thus NAT1 genotype cannot explain the large inter\u2010individual variations in mucosal 5\u2010ASA concentrations in our study. Interestingly we found that patients with the NAT1 slow acetylator genotype had significantly higher serum 5\u2010ASA concentrations compared to patients with NAT1 rapid acetylator genotype, which could theoretically influence the risk of concentration dependent systemic adverse effects.",
