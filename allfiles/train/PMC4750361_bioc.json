Bacterial community profiling was carried out by purifying DNA, PCR amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic community analysis. We compared enrolled subjects to a cohort of healthy subjects who had lower respiratory tract sampling by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the diverse upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbiota found in healthy controls, critically ill subjects had lower initial diversity at both sites. Diversity further diminished over time on the ventilator. In several subjects, the bacterial community was dominated by a single taxon over multiple time points. The clinical diagnosis of LRTI ascertained by chart review correlated with low community diversity and dominance of a single taxon. Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where cultures were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma parvum and Enterococcus faecalis.",

No single antibiotic class or combination of antibiotic classes achieved significance by Wald testing. Comparison of GEE models including versus excluding antibiotics by model QIC favored excluding antibiotics [34]. This evidence suggests that the relationship between longer time on a ventilator and lower diversity cannot be attributed solely to greater antibiotic exposure with longer duration of intubation.

Subject 2, with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and ARDS, was suspected of developing VAP. 16S rRNA gene sequencing initially revealed mixed taxa consisting mainly of normal LRT constituents (such as Prevotella). Concomitant with the clinical suspicion for VAP, LRT sequences became dominated by Ureaplasma parvum, which increased in relative abundance to reach 95\u00a0% of all LRT sequence reads. In subject 15, with myelodysplastic syndrome and documented RSV infection, LRT 16S rRNA gene sequencing initially revealed mixed taxa, but by day 1 post intubation revealed near-complete dominance by Enterococcus faecalis. Neither Ureaplasma parvum nor Enterococcus faecalis are traditionally recognized as LRTI pathogens in adult critical care patients. Subject 2 was not treated with antibacterials active against Ureaplasma parvum, while subject 15 received daptomycin, which is effective against E. faecalis but poorly active in the lung.",

The clinical diagnosis of LRTI was associated with a trend toward further reduction in alpha diversity of the lower respiratory tract, relative even to those subjects with prolonged courses of intubation. Our results demonstrate features of lower respiratory tract bacterial community structure (i.e., diminished alpha diversity and a single, dominant taxon) that may prove useful in the diagnosis of LRTI in intubated subjects, a group in whom LRTI diagnosis is particularly challenging [36, 37]. The ability of comprehensive microbiome profiling to distinguish between a dominant taxon consistent with LRTI versus a taxon present only at low relative abundance distinguishes this approach from routine bacterial culture, which can confirm the presence or absence of a potential pathogen but provides less information about community structure. Our data also identify unexpected organisms in cases of suspected infection and suggest broadly how 16S rRNA gene sequencing may assist in patient management.",

When bacterial cultures revealed LRTI pathogens, 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed the dominance of the corresponding taxa. In several cases of suspected LRTI with negative clinical cultures, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed dominance of unexpected bacteria not typically identified by culture or considered LRTI pathogens. In one of these subjects (subject 2, who was neutropenic), the single dominant taxon was U. parvum, an organism not amenable to routine culture but which has been described as a pulmonary pathogen in neonates [38\u201340]. In the other subject (subject 15, with myelodysplastic syndrome and concurrent RSV-B infection), the single dominant taxon was E. faecalis, which is rarely reported as a pulmonary pathogen [41].",

(1) Intubated patients typically receive broad spectrum antibiotics, often before cultures are obtained. Antibiotics may turn cultures negative, but since sequence analysis does not depend on bacterial viability, this approach may still identify dominant organisms and allow better targeting of therapy. For example, the failure to detect E. faecalis by culture in subject 15 may have resulted from early administration of daptomycin, which could have been sufficient to affect culture results but not to eradicate infection. (2) Respiratory cultures typically exclude normal upper respiratory tract bacteria such as anaerobes, due to the challenges of distinguishing URT contamination from authentic LRTI. In contrast, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis captures all bacteria present, and relative abundance measures have the potential to reveal outgrowth and dominance by any taxon, including those that would be responsible for anaerobic or URT-derived aspiration pneumonia. Of the subjects sampled at multiple time points, three were suspected of aspiration at the time of enrollment. Two of these subjects showed subsequent emergence of dominant taxa representing normal URT bacteria (Prevotella and Lactobacillus in subjects 1 and 6, respectively), whereas the third had a dominant organism present in lower abundance and which is less often identified in the URT (Propionibacterium acnes in subject 13).",

(1) Subjects were enrolled after intubation, so the presented data provide no insight into the effect of the intubation itself upon the lower respiratory tract microbiome. (2) While all intubated subjects were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, the comparison between intubated subjects and healthy controls may be confounded by the use of different sequencing platforms. However, a sub-analysis comparing samples sequenced on both platforms (Additional file 2: Figure S2) suggests that only a small fraction of the difference between groups is attributable to sequencing platform (Procrustes m2\u2009=\u20090.13, p\u2009<\u20090.001). (3) Lower respiratory tract samples were obtained by deep endotracheal aspirate in intubated subjects, without concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage available for comparison. Though studies of healthy subjects have consistently shown that the bacterial community composition of the respiratory tract microbiome is similar throughout proximal and distal airway sites [30, 31], the concordance between endotracheal aspirates and direct alveolar sampling in intubated subjects remains a matter of debate, and differences may be exacerbated in the setting of LRTI, where regional heterogeneity of the respiratory tract bacterial community may be increased [45]. (4) Though we attempted to account for antibiotic exposure in our GEE model, it remains an important potential confounder or effect modifier in analysis of the relationship between respiratory tract bacterial community structure and LRTI. (5) The analysis is limited by the lack of a gold standard for LRTI diagnosis and the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of bacterial culture obtained from the lower respiratory tract [46]. (6) Although we suspect that the presence of a single, dominant OTU reflects outgrowth of a single bacterial lineage, proportional abundance may not correlate with absolute abundance; future studies will quantify absolute bacterial abundance by 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR as well. While molecular analysis offers valuable information not available through traditional respiratory tract culture, it would best serve as a complement to culture, as determination of antibiotic sensitivity currently still requires culture-based analysis, and in some cases species-level identification is not possible from 16S rRNA gene sequence alone.",

At present, optimum detection methods only identify pathogens in 67\u201381\u00a0% of LRTI cases [47, 48], and empiric treatment of LRTI has become the standard of care [49\u201351]. In an era of rising antimicrobial resistance, the rapid and accurate diagnosis of LRTI and identification of responsible pathogens is essential [52]. Our results suggest that characterization of the respiratory tract bacterial community by 16S rRNA gene sequencing may provide a useful tool in achieving these goals.",
