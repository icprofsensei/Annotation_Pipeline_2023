OTU analysis showed that 2663 OTU were obtained in WD group, and 3271 OTU were obtained in the control group, of which 941 were common OTU. Colony diversity analysis showed that the intestinal flora of WD group and control group belonged to 5 phyla, they were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Tenericutes, respectively. In WD group, the abundance of Bacteroidetes was significantly lower than that of the control group (67.19% vs 76.75%, P\u200a<\u200a.001), and the abundance of Firmicutes (26.18% vs 19.83%, P\u200a<\u200a.001), Proteobacteria (4.31% vs 3.09%, P\u200a<\u200a.05), Fusobacteria (1.88% vs 0.04%, P\u200a<\u200a.001) were significantly higher than that of control group.

The species accumulation curve is used to describe the increase of the species (OTU) with the increased sample size. In this study, the results of OTU analysis were shown in Figure \u200bFigure1.1. We found that the rank-abundance curve was smooth, indicting high evenness among samples.

In this study, we analyzed the high throughput sequencing results of 16S rRNA V4 variable region of the intestinal flora in the WD patients and the normal population. We found that there were significant differences in intestinal flora diversity and intestinal flora composition between WD patients and normal people. Microbial diversity is a new health marker, it is important to maintain the stability and performance of the ecosystem. The decrease of intestinal flora diversity is related to many diseases, such as active inflammatory bowel disease, cirrhosis, obesity, diabetes, child autism, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and so on.[6\u201313,16] The Shannon index, Chao 1 index, and Ace index of intestinal flora in WD patients were significantly lower than those in healthy people, which indicating that the diversity of intestinal flora in WD patients was significantly lower than that in the control group. Therefore, these results suggested that WD may be associated with the decrease in intestinal flora diversity.",

The diversity of intestinal flora in obese patients was significantly lower than that in normal population.[17] The decrease of intestinal flora diversity was also associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and inflammation.[18\u201320] The athletes have more intestinal microbes than the healthy people.[21] The structure of intestinal flora in identical twins is surprisingly similar, but there are significant differences between the fraternal twins. This indicates that the structure of intestinal flora is regulated by the host gene.[22] The results of this study also suggested that WD, an autosomal recessive hereditary disease, may also be associated with intestinal flora.",
