                    "text": "Dysbiosis of gut microbiota and metabolome is a frequently encountered condition in liver cirrhosis (LC) patients. The severity of liver dysfunction was found to be correlated with the degree of microbial dysbiosis. Several clinical studies have indicated liver function improvement after therapeutic splenectomy for LC-induced hypersplenism. We sought to determine whether such post-splenectomy outcome is pertinent to modulation of the abnormal gut microenvironment in LC patients. A cross-sectional study including 12 LC patients and 16 healthy volunteers was first conducted, then a before\u2013after study in the cohort of patients was carried out before and 6 months after splenectomy. Fecal samples were collected in hospital. Temporal bacterial (n = 40) and metabolomics (n = 30) profiling was performed using 16s rRNA gene sequencing and ultra performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer (UPLC/MS), respectively. Our results revealed that microbial composition in patients was clearly different from that in healthy controls (HCs), evidenced by considerable taxonomic variation. Along with improved liver function (Child\u2013Pugh score), the patients also displayed similar gut microbiota profile and predicted metagenome function to that of HCs after splenectomy. Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae, two LC-enriched families showing positive relation with Child\u2013Pugh score, exhibited significantly decreased abundance after splenectomy. At the genus level, 11 genera were differentially abundant between patients and HCs, but 9 genera of them restituted to normal levels by certain degree after splenectomy. PICRUSt analysis showed that the relative abundance of 17 KEGG pathways was partially restored after splenectomy. Four of them were amino acid-related pathways: lysine degradation, tryptophan degradation, amino acid metabolism, and protein digestion and absorption. These findings were supported by metabonomics results which showed that relative abundance of amino acid and corresponding catabolites changed toward normal. In addition to the variations in the relative abundances of bacteria and metabolites, the correlation between them also altered in patients after splenectomy. Dysbiosis in gut microbiome and related metabolism of LC patients was partially corrected after splenectomy. Whether the improved gut microenvironment could prevent LC-related complications and delay the progress of LC is a propitious objective for future study. Trial registration: ChiCTR-OOB-15007409.

Liver dysfunction has many effects on the gut, including impaired motility (Chang et al., 1998), reduced bile flow, and altered secretion of immunoglobulin A and anti-microbial molecules (Lu et al., 2011). All of these effects could lead to dysbiosis in the microbiota (Zeuzem, 2000). Disturbance of gut microbiota is common in LC patients with a feature of increased abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria concomitant with decreased level of beneficial bacteria (Chen et al., 2011; Qin et al., 2014; Schnabl and Brenner, 2014; Bajaj et al., 2015). Dysbiosis in microbiota can disrupt the metabolic balance in the gastrointestinal tract (Marcobal et al., 2013). Previous studies have reported that LC patients exhibit a distinct metabolic phenotype, such as disordered amino acid metabolism (Huang et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013, 2016). In turn, the dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to the progress of liver disease (De Minicis et al., 2014; Tilg et al., 2016). The intestinal microflora is the main source of portal LPS and represents an important prerequisite for the development of liver fibrosis in chronic liver injuries (Paik et al., 2003; Isayama et al., 2006; Seki et al., 2007). In addition, the gut microbiota that go through dysbiosis play an important role in the development of LC-related complications, including bacterial infections, the hyperdynamic circulatory state, and hepatic encephalopathy (Garcia-Tsao and Wiest, 2004; Riordan and Williams, 2010).",

However, the hypertrophied spleen in LC with portal hypertension could lead to hypersplenism and consequently pancytopenia which act as an excessive portal flow supplier. Surgical splenectomy has been applied to treat splenomegaly and hypersplenism since the 1950s. Splenectomy is often performed in LC patients as a palliative surgical treatment to attenuate thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia that induced by LC-related hypersplenism (Sugawara et al., 2000; Tomikawa et al., 2002; Kawanaka et al., 2014). The results of recent studies performed in different clinical settings have indicated that splenectomy contributed to improved liver function (Elsebae and Abu-Zekri, 2008; Imura et al., 2010; Ushitora et al., 2011; Nomura et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2015).",

These results obtained indicate that splenectomy treatment partially ameliorated the dysbiosis of gut environment.

Afterward, a perspective study was performed in the cohort of patients with initial samples before splenectomy (Pre-S) and follow-up samples obtained 6 months after splenectomy (Post-S). LC with portal hypertension was diagnosed by comprehensively reviewing the results of liver biopsies, imaging examinations and laboratory tests in addition to clinical symptoms, physical signs, medical history, progress notes, and associated complications (Procopet and Berzigotti, 2017). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in all patients to assess the severity of esophagogastric varices. The Child\u2013Pugh scoring system was used to assess the prognosis of cirrhosis (Pugh et al., 1973). Cases that progressed to hepatic carcinoma, uncontrolled ascites, encephalopathy, or Child\u2013Pugh class C preoperatively and patients suffering from other diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, were excluded. The control group consisted of healthy volunteer who visited the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University for routine physical examination. The liver imaging and liver biochemistry results as well as other physical, blood, urine, and stool test results of all the healthy volunteer were within the normal range. The control subjects and patients had well matched age, sex, and BMI scores. All participants had no history of antibiotic or probiotic use in the previous 3 months before fecal sample collection, they neither had any history of IBD, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and gastrointestinal surgery, such as colectomy or gastrectomy.",

Metabolites were identified by comparing observed accurate mass and MS/MS spectra to accurate mass data and spectra available in online databases including METLIN database, human metabolite database, and progenesis QI (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, United States). Metabolites compared between groups in the significant difference analysis using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A heatmap of the key metabolites identified in this process was constructed using pheatmap package in R.",

For the prospective study, a correlation network was calculated to extract edge with only correlation differences between Pre-S and Post-S groups (p < 0.05, Student\u2019s t-test) and where at least one of the original Spearman correlation was >0.6 (Morgenthal et al., 2006). The correlations and corresponding attributes within the network model were visualized by Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003). We then compared the network topology to identify sub-networks on specific bacteria which may be significantly related with recovery of normal liver functions (Assenov et al., 2008).",

From December 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016, 44 patients who need therapeutic splenectomy were assessed for enrolment. Twenty-five patients were excluded based on the inclusion\u2013exclusion criteria preoperatively. At the time point of 6 months after splenectomy, one patient had progressed to hepatocellular carcinoma and six patients had taken antibiotics within 3 months before fecal sample collection was excluded. Finally, fecal samples were analyzed for 16 HCs (the HC group) and 12 patients both before (Pre-S group) and after (Post-S group) splenectomy. Etiology underlying the LC was hepatitis B virus infections (n = 7), hepatitis C virus infections (n = 1), alcoholic LC (n = 2), and autoimmune LC (n = 2), respectively. Six months after splenectomy, all patients had reverted back to their normal diet and living habits, BMI index of patients was not changed significantly compared with preoperative data (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.88, Table \u200bTable11). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were summarized in Table \u200bTable11. As expected, LC patients exhibited marked impairments in liver function and blood counts compared to HC subjects, and such deleterious alterations were ameliorated after splenectomy. Child\u2013Pugh scores decreased from 6.2 \u00b1 0.9 to 5.1 \u00b1 0.3 (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.01), with 4 out of 12 patients who were preoperatively classified as Child\u2013Pugh class B being postoperatively improved to class A.

Sample size was equalized to 58,471 for each sample using random subtraction (Supplementary Table S3). First, sequencing depths were examined by plotting the rarefaction curve for richness (sobs index) and the numbers of shared OTUs (Supplementary Figure S1). Most of the samples reached plateaus, suggesting that sequencing depth was adequate. \u03b1-Diversity was assessed according to observed OTU numbers, and the data revealed that gut microbiota richness was higher in the Pre-S group than in the HC group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05; Figure \u200bFigure1A1A), The OTU number was lower in Post-S group compared with Pre-S group but the difference was not statistically significant yet (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.15; Figure \u200bFigure1A1A). However, the result of Shannon diversity index that measures both richness and evenness was the highest in the Post-S group (Supplementary Figure S2). PCoA based on Weighted UniFrac distances revealed that the bacterial composition of Pre-S group was clearly segregated from that of HC group. After splenectomy, the bacterial composition of Post-S group experienced obvious changes and become more similar with HC group (Figure \u200bFigure1B1B). Such finding was supported by the comparison of taxonomic distribution of all three groups at levels of phylum, family, and genus (Supplementary Figure S3). Notably, we found that OTU number can explain the differences along the first principal coordinate (Figure \u200bFigure1C1C).",

Among the nine HC enriched genera, Bacteroides, Lachnoclostridium, Parabacteroides, Paraprevotella, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-010, Sellimonas, and Odoribacter displayed significantly increased abundance after splenectomy (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05). Of the two genera that were enriched in Pre-S group, Intestinibacter and Blautia were significantly decreased after splenectomy (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05; Figure \u200bFigure2B2B). HC enriched Blautia, Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-010, and LC enriched Sellimonas, four genera were all affiliated to Lachnospiraceae family, this may explain why we didn\u2019t see any difference in abundance of Lachnospiraceae family between HC and Pre-S group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, pfdr > 0.05, Supplementary Figure S5).",

Three identified amino acids were originally lower in Pre-S groups but two of them, L-aspartic acid and 2-aminoheptanedioic acid, had significantly increased in the Post-S group compared with Pre-S group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The content of one catabolite of phenylalanine, 2-phenylaceta (amine), was increased in Pre-S group but decreased significantly in Post-S group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05), while another two amino acid catabolites, indole and 5-hydroxyindole, also were higher in Pre-S group but decreased in Post-S group although without significance (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p > 0.05). These results were consistent with KEGG pathway analysis of amino acid metabolism as described above, which showed that the abundance of the amino acid metabolism-related pathways was originally higher in Pre-S group but decreased after splenectomy. Another group of metabolites were bile acids that were lower in Pre-S groups (i.e., deoxycholic acid, allo-deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and allo-lithocholic acid). After splenectomy, all of them increased although without statistical significance (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p > 0.05). D-Urobilin, a catabolite of bile pigment that is normally present at a high concentration in Pre-S group, was found decreased in Post-S group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.769). It might have resulted due to serum TBIL level which was obviously higher in Pre-S group but decreased in Post-S group although without significance (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.09, Table \u200bTable11). We had identified two SCFAs compounds, 4-[5]-ladderane-butanoic acid and butyric acid which were presented at low concentrations in Pre-S group, but significantly increased in Post-S group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05, Figure \u200bFigure4C4C).",

The average number of neighbors was 71.955 in HC group, 82.742 in Pre-S group, and after splenectomy it was decreased to 76.433 in Post-S group (Supplementary Table S2). These parameters showed that Pre-S group had more complex metabolic network compared to HC group, the metabolic network became less complex in Post-S group after splenectomy and closed to HC, indicating that splenectomy has a major effect on the metabolic network, reducing a number of the metabolic interactions, while keeping the nodes themselves intact. Next, we constructed a correlation difference network which provided a global view of correlations that was significantly altered between Pre-S and Post-S group (Student\u2019s t-test, p < 0.05, Supplementary Figure S10). This network contains only 1890 features and 4140 correlations, which is substantially smaller than the original network with only 83% of the original features.

TGF-\u03b2, released from enlarged spleen, has been shown to exert inhibition of liver regeneration. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 exaggerates liver fibrosis and apoptosis (Ueda et al., 2003). Hence, inhibition splenectomy facilitated inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 production which led to alleviation of chemically induced LC (Akahoshi et al., 2002). Splenectomy up-regulates TNF-\u03b1 then reduces dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver damage (Murata et al., 2001). Recent studies have shown that recovery of thrombocytopenia may positively be followed by liver function improvement for the reason that platelet-derived serotonin is important in liver regeneration (Lesurtel et al., 2006). The hepatic accumulation of Ly-6Clo macrophages/monocytes might have played significant roles in the tissue remodeling process in cirrhotic livers after splenectomy (Yada et al., 2015).",

                    "text": "Studies that have been done before pointed that the severity of liver function impairment was correlated with the degree of microbial dysbiosis. Liver dysfunction can cause reduced bile flow and reduced bile acids in gut (Lu et al., 2011). Bile acids are important not only for facilitating dietary fats and vitamins absorption, but are also ligands for the nuclear receptor PAMPs (FXR) and the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5. BAs do have direct bacteriostatic effects, and so intestinal bacterial overgrowth could also be a result of decreased total fecal bile acids in LC patients (Kakiyama et al., 2013). Conjugated bile acids bind to FXR in intestinal epithelial cells, which increases production of the antimicrobial proteins and prevents bacterial overgrowth and promotes epithelial cell integrity (Inagaki et al., 2006). The FXR agonist obeticholic acid has been shown to reduce markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients (Mudaliar et al., 2013). Together with TBA, the ratio between secondary and primary fecal bile acids is also decreased in LC (Kakiyama et al., 2013). In this study, LC patients showed reduction in families belonging to the order Clostridiales, including Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae although without statistical significance after FDR adjust. These groups are capable of performing 7\u03b1-dihydroxylation (Kakiyama et al., 2013), metabolizing primary bile acids into secondary bile (Ridlon et al., 2006). The relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae increased significantly after splenectomy. We had identified four kind of bile acids, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, allo-lithocholic acid, and allo-deoxycholic acid, all of them were secondary bile acids and found increased after splenectomy. These obtained results supported the notion that the outcome of improved liver function after splenectomy might have contributed to gut microbiota improvement.",

                    "text": "The intestinal microflora is the main source of portal LPS and represents an important prerequisite for the development of liver fibrosis in chronic liver injuries (Paik et al., 2003; Isayama et al., 2006; Seki et al., 2007). Several mechanisms contribute to the intestinal translocation of PAMPs in patients with cirrhosis. These include a leaky intestinal barrier and immune deficiency, and some of these mechanisms are known to be closely related to the composition of the intestinal microbiome (Winer and Ploss, 2016). Interestingly, bacteria from Enterobacteriaceae family (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Enterobacter) are all regarded as PAMPs-producing bacteria and were increased in the microbiota of LC patient in both ours and previously conducted studies and found to be decreased after splenectomy in our study (Chen et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; Bajaj et al., 2012a,b). It is also well recognized that dysbiosised gut flora plays an important role in LC-related complications, including bacterial infections, the hyperdynamic circulatory state, and hepatic encephalopathy (Garcia-Tsao and Wiest, 2004; Riordan and Williams, 2010; De Minicis et al., 2014; Tilg et al., 2016). The enrichment of these potentially pathogenic phylotypes is in accordance with previous research obtained from bacteriological culture of fecal samples, in which patients who had cirrhosis with minimal hepatic encephalopathy had significant fecal overgrowth of E. coli and Staphylococcus sp. (Liu et al., 2004). As concluded by many clinical studies, E. coli and Streptococcus are the main causes of bacterial infection in patients with cirrhosis (Riordan and Williams, 2006). Probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics aimed at manipulating gut microflora have shown the ability to reduce rates of bacterial infection and hepatic encephalopathy in LC patients (Novella et al., 1997; Grange et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2004). These results indicated that the mitigated gut microbiota dysbiosis after splenectomy may help alleviated liver impairment and LC-related complications.",

These results were supported by metabolome study showing that fecal samples of the patients contained higher abundance of amines and indoles but lower abundance of amino acids than those in HCs, similar to the findings of a previous study that suggested cirrhotic patients were enriched in amino acid transport and metabolic products (Wei et al., 2013, 2016). However, our study showed that the metabolic disturbance of amino acids had improved after splenectomy in affected patient. L-Leucine, which was increased after splenectomy in the patients, is a branched-chain essential amino acid, BCAA. A series of studies indicate that in advanced cirrhosis, oral supplementation with BCAA may improve cognitive function especially in patients with chronic HE (Marchesini et al., 1990). In addition, BCAA may have specific effects on liver function; two large randomized trials have generated evidence that oral BCAA slowed the progression of advanced cirrhosis and prolonged event-free survival (Marchesini et al., 2003; Muto et al., 2005). Intestinal bacteria metabolize tryptophan into indole which was found decreased after splenectomy in LC patient, is then further metabolized into oxindole, a sedative compound putatively involved in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (Riggio et al., 2010). These results support that the recovery of \u201camino acid metabolism\u201d pathway brings about decreased indole, increased L-lysine in the gut of LC patients after splenectomy which might contribute largely to prevent hepatic encephalopathy and slow the progress of liver impairment.",

These group of genera were known to benefit from participating in carbohydrate fermentation into SCFAs and gases (CO2 and H2) in the human intestine (Duncan et al., 2007). The suppression of these fermentation-related bacteria could cause a decline in SCFAs production. These results were consistent with a metabolomics study which showed that low abundance of 4-[5]-ladderane-butanoic acid and butyric acid in LC patients was increased after splenectomy. SCFAs are significant energy sources for gut enterocytes, influencing the gastrointestinal barrier function to reduce pathogenic bacterial colonization (Brahe et al., 2013). A decrease in SCFAs would result in increased colonic PH, increased ammonia production, and absorption in the gut (Vince et al., 1990), with hyperammonemia being a very important pathogenetical factor in hepatic encephalopathy.",

In this study, there was no significant difference in the abundance of Lachnospiraceae family between Pre-S and HC group. Subnetwork focus on genera that belonged to Lachnospiraceae family showed that HC group possessed more complicated network compared with Pre-S group and the gap became small after splenectomy in Post-S group. These results manifested that bacterial metabolic function can change rather than overall population in Lachnospiraceae family. The serum indexes for liver impairment: AST, ALT, TBIL, PT, and PT.A were found keep positive correlated with gut metabolites but the correlation coefficient was significantly changed in patients after splenectomy. These correlation differences are key in discovering the relationship between liver function improvement and gut microenvironment variation in patients before and after splenectomy.",

First, before\u2013after study results could have been influenced by effects such as environmental and unpredictable factors which is a common issue in this kind of study. In this study the BMI and diet, two main factors which had been showed to relate microbiota (Cotillard et al., 2013), were kept consistent before and after splenectomy. Second, a previous study was done on LC and gut microbiota, which enrolled patients with various etiologies. The study showed that microbiota difference existed between patients with different etiologies (Chen et al., 2011; Bajaj et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2014). Due to the limited sample size, sub-classification analysis based on different etiology cannot be conducted in this study, so we cannot exclude that the underlying etiology is a relevant cofounding factor in this study. Further taking the study into account, the etiology needs to be conducted to address this issue. Last, our pathway analysis was based on the inferred meta-genome of the 16s rRNA gene sequence, and while inferring a metagenome (i.e., in PICRUSt) is a common approach in studies that use 16s rRNA gene, but short-gun sequencing of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics could potentially reveal more accurate information related to the composition of the microbial community and its functions.",

The mechanisms underlying these effects are not clear at this stage; as summarized in Figure \u200bFigure66, we suggested that the liver function and the gut microenvironment are likely to affect each other, and the normal microenvironment of gut depended on normal liver function. Splenectomy results in decreased relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae as well as catabolite of amino acid, such as indole. Also, an increase of BCAA namely, L-leucine in LC patients. Whether and how these changes, after splenectomy, help avoid LC-related complications and delay the progress of LC represent a target for future study.",
