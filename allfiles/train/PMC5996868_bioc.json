Given the complexity of the mega-variate bacterial community residing in the gastrointestinal tract, studying associations between individual bacterial genera and bile acid processing remains a challenge. Here, we present a novel in vitro approach to determine the bacterial genera associated with the metabolism of different primary bile acids and their potential to contribute to inter-individual variation in this processing. Anaerobic, pH-controlled batch cultures were inoculated with human fecal microbiota and treated with individual conjugated primary bile acids (500 \u03bcg/ml) to serve as the sole substrate for 24 h. Samples were collected throughout the experiment (0, 5, 10, and 24 h) and the bacterial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the bile acid signatures were characterized using a targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) approach. Data fusion techniques were used to identify statistical bacterial-metabolic linkages. An increase in gut bacteria associated bile acids was observed over 24 h with variation in the rate of bile acid metabolism across the volunteers (n = 7). Correlation analysis identified a significant association between the Gemmiger genus and the deconjugation of glycine conjugated bile acids while the deconjugation of taurocholic acid was associated with bacteria from the Eubacterium and Ruminococcus genera. A positive correlation between Dorea and deoxycholic acid production suggest a potential role for this genus in cholic acid dehydroxylation. A slower deconjugation of taurocholic acid was observed in individuals with a greater abundance of Parasutterella and Akkermansia. This work demonstrates the utility of integrating compositional (metataxonomics) and functional (metabonomics) systems biology approaches, coupled to in vitro model systems, to study the biochemical capabilities of bacteria within complex ecosystems. Characterizing the dynamic interactions between the gut microbiota and the bile acid pool enables a greater understanding of how variation in the gut microbiota influences host bile acid signatures, their associated functions and their implications for health.",

                    "text": "Bile acids are a classical example of trans-genomic metabolites arising from the combinatorial metabolism of the host genome and the gut microbiome. Primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and subsequently conjugated with taurine or glycine residues, creating amphipathic molecules that are stored in the gallbladder. Upon ingestion of a meal bile acids are secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum. Here, they act as detergents emulsifying fats and reducing the luminal pH to allow pancreatic enzymes to digest carbohydrates and proteins. The majority of bile acids (95\u201399%) are reabsorbed in the jejunum in their conjugated form and re-enter the enterohepatic circulation (Roberts et al., 2002). The remaining 1\u20135% enters the ileum and colon (~200\u2013800 mg daily in humans) where they are modified by the gut microbiota. Enzymes encoded in the gut microbiome, such as bile salt hydrolases (BSH) and various dehydroxylases, structurally modify these bile acids, increasing the diversity of the overall pool. Firstly, BSHs cleave the amide bond between the amino acid residue (glycine or taurine) and their bile acid moiety. There are various different BSH enzymes expressed across the microbiota (Jones et al., 2008) and the full impact of BSH diversity has yet to be fully explored. One study observed an overall reduction in bacterial BSH enzyme diversity was associated with an increase in weight gain (Joyce et al., 2014). Once deconjugated the steroid nucleus of the bile acid can undergo further biotransformation. Dehydroxylases (7\u03b1 or 12\u03b1) remove hydroxyl groups from the bile acid forming the secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid (DCA) from CA and lithocholic acid (LCA) from CDCA. Gut bacterial enzymes can also modify bile acids through various other reactions including epimerization, oxidation, and esterification. Modified bile acids are either excreted in the feces or reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation for re-processing in the liver. In the liver, bile acids are re-conjugated with taurine or glycine or are sulfated before secretion into the bile. These combined activities between the microbiota and the host result in a diverse circulating bile acid pool.",

Bile acid moieties, arising from gut bacterial processing such as the secondary and unconjugated primary bile acids, are functional agonists for nuclear receptors found in the liver, heart, intestine, kidneys, and adipose tissue (Forman et al., 1995; Parks et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2007; Bj\u00f6rkholm et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2014). The nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is activated by CDCA and to a lesser extent than CA, LCA, and DCA, while the plasma membrane bound receptor TGR5 has a high affinity for LCA and its conjugates (Li and Chiang, 2014). These receptors regulate the synthesis, uptake, transportation, and detoxification of bile acids (Chiang, 2009; Fiorucci et al., 2009) as well as the regulation of glucose, cholesterol and triacylglyceride concentrations in plasma and energy metabolism in muscles (Watanabe et al., 2006; Porez et al., 2012). Secondary bile acids can also regulate the expression of xenobiotic enzymes and transporters in the liver, intestine, and kidney via pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) (Xie et al., 2001; Bj\u00f6rkholm et al., 2009). Variation in the bile acid pool may therefore also contribute to individual differences in drug efficacy and responses. We have previously demonstrated the importance of the microbiota in shaping the composition and signaling potential of the bile acid pool (Swann et al., 2011). As bile acids have detergent properties they can also impact on gut bacterial community structure by disrupting bacterial cell membranes, inducing DNA damage and modifying protein structure (Kandell and Bernstein, 1991; Bernstein et al., 1999; Begley et al., 2005; Devkota et al., 2012). The detergent properties of the secondary bile acid DCA are 10 fold greater than its precursor, CA (Kurdi et al., 2006) suggesting that this bacterial modification enhances the antimicrobial activity of the compound. Chemical exchange between gut bacteria and the host through bile acid processing can therefore impact on host health and modulate the community structure of the intestinal microbiome. Characterizing the dynamic interactions between the gut microbiota and the bile acid pool, at the genus level, enables a greater understanding of how variation in the gut microbiota influences host bile acid signatures, their associated functions and their implications for health. In this study, the bacterial processing of conjugated primary bile acids by the human fecal microbiota has been modeled in vitro. Bacterial profiles were determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and the bacterial metabolism of bile acids was studied over time using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) approach.",

Bile acids were metabolized by the fecal microbiota and their metabolism was dependent upon the bile acid dosed. This bacterial processing was immediate and even in the baseline samples (0 h), collected shortly after the addition of the bile acid, the concentration of the dosed bile acid was notably reduced. This was most evident in the glycine-conjugated bile acids. For GCA, the amount measured in the baseline sample collected immediately after the addition of the bile acid (500 \u03bcg/ml) was 194.9 \u00b1 32.6 \u03bcg/ml. At this sampling point, CA was present at 231.7 \u00b1 29.2 \u03bcg/ml. By the 10 h sampling point, GCA was reduced to 36.5 \u00b1 27.5 \u03bcg/ml (p = 0.0012). For GCDCA, the baseline concentration was reduced to 332.3 \u00b1 26 \u03bcg/ml and further reduced to 8 \u00b1 4.8 \u03bcg/ml over the first 10 h (p = 0.0001). In contrast, the taurine-conjugated bile acids were not metabolized to same extent in the baseline samples (TCA, 409.7 \u00b1 30.2 \u03bcg/ml; TCDCA, 525.4 \u00b1 82.3 \u03bcg/ml).

At 24 h, GCDCA was strongly positively correlated with Ruminococcus 2 (r = 0.97) while UDCA was positively correlated with Dorea (r = 0.9). In the models supplemented with TCDCA a positive correlation between Eubacterium (r = 0.8) and TCDCA was seen at 10 h. This was in addition to a negative correlation between CDCA and Akkermansia (r = \u22120.8) and strong correlations between UDCA and Holdemanella (r = 1) and Veillonella (r = 1).",

A markedly reduced rate of TCA deconjugation was seen in Donor 4 compared to the other donors over the first 10 h (Figure \u200b(Figure4).4). In this donor the concentration of TCA remained at 402.1 \u03bcg/ml at 10 h while being significantly reduced at this time point in the remaining donors (mean 13.3 \u00b1 19.2 \u03bcg/ml). Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to assess the variance of the bacterial profiles of the donors throughout the study (Figure S4). At 10 h the bacterial profile of Donor 4 was notably different from the other donors with high proportions of the bacteria from the genera; Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, Clostridium XIVa Parasutterella and Akkermansia. By 24 h, once TCA metabolism had begun, the bacterial profile of Donor 4 was similar in composition to the other six donors.",

The UPLC-MS results confirm that in an anaerobic fecal batch culture environment, bile acids undergo the same metabolic processes as those occurring in vivo (Frankel, 1936; Midtvedt, 1974; Hirano et al., 1981; Fadden et al., 1997). These observations were similar across the majority of donors indicating a consistency in the metabolic performance of the individual donor microbiomes. A potential limitation of this model system is the unknown variation in bacterial succession across the donors in the fermentation vessels. Such variation could affect the reproducibility of the results over extended time periods. However, over the timeframe studied here (0\u201324 h), which is relevant to intestinal transit times, this variation was not apparent. Combining this model system with an integrated bacterial and bile acid profiling approach has enabled specific bacterial-bile acid associations to be resolved for further investigation. In some cases, these observations can be supported by the genomic content of the bacteria.",

Greater abundance of fecal DCA in certain donors may result from the increased bacterial dehydroxylation of CA or reduced absorption of this bile acid from the gut of these individuals. Alternatively, this could reflect differences in dietary patterns across the donors with previous studies showing that diets high in animal fat modify the gut microbiota and increase DCA excretion (Yatsunenko et al., 2012; David et al., 2014). High fecal excretion of DCA has been previously linked to obesity and an increased risk of colorectal cancer and hepatic cirrhosis (Bernstein et al., 2005; Kakiyama et al., 2013).",

These belonged to the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia phyla. A positive association was found between the Gemmiger genus and CA concentration 10 h after GCA supplementation. In this case, Gemmiger abundance increased following the cleavage of glycine from GCA. Consistently, the Rumminococcaceae family, within which Gemmiger resides, has been shown to possess a bile salt hydroxylase that acts on both glycine and taurine conjugated bile acids (Jones et al., 2008). No associations were observed between the Gemmiger genus and the deconjugation of tauro-conjugated bile acids however, a number of BSH enzymes have specificity toward a single bile acid moiety (Jones et al., 2008). Interestingly, the abundance of the Gemmiger genus was negatively correlated with DCA abundance at 24 h. DCA is cytotoxic to certain bacterial species and can be used as an antimicrobial agent. Evidence of these antimicrobial properties are seen with the reduction of Clostridium difficile infections when DCA is present in sufficient concentrations (Greathouse et al., 2015). From these observations we speculate that bacteria from the genus Gemmiger may be susceptible to DCA toxicity and/or that it's abundance is dependent upon the availability of glycine-conjugated bile acids as a substrate. Furthermore, this observation may indicate that this species does not possess 7-\u03b1 dehydroxylase, the enzyme required to dehydroxylate the C-7 hydroxyl group of CA to produce DCA. Further experiments are necessary to clarify these hypotheses.",

The abundance of bacteria from the Eubacterium genus was negatively correlated with TCA at 10 h (TCA-supplemented vessels) and positively correlated with DCA at 24 h (GCA-supplemented vessels). This link suggests that Eubacterium abundance increases as TCA is deconjugated to CA and CA is dehydroxylated to DCA. Consistently, members of this genus have been shown to act as dehydroxylators (G\u00e9rard, 2013) and possess functional BSH genes (Udayappan et al., 2016). Similarly, the role of the Ruminococcus 2 genus in the deconjugation of TCA is inferred from the positive association to CA and is consistent with the presence of BSH genes in the genome (G\u00e9rard, 2013). The positive associations between the Holdemanella and Veillonella genera and UDCA at 10 h suggest these two genera may have a role in the epimerization of CDCA, although this observation is unique to the substrate TCDCA and genomic data does not exist to support a causal relationship being defined.",

                    "text": "Inter-individual variation was observed in the rate of TCA metabolism. Specifically, the deconjugation of TCA was markedly retarded over the first 10 h for Donor 4 while the remaining donors had near-complete deconjugation over this period. The delay in taurine cleavage coincides with a lower abundance of members from the Gemmiger, Ruminococcus 2, Eubacterium, and Faecalibacteria genera in this donor and an increased abundance of bacteria from the Parabacteroides genus. Interestingly, P. distasonis has been associated with gut dysbiosis (Dziarski et al., 2016; Jacobs et al., 2016). Correlation analysis studying the baseline bacterial signatures with changes in the bile acid profiles over the first 5 h revealed a positive association between Eubacterium and Bacteroides abundance and the rate of TCA disappearance. It is possible that the lower abundance of Gemmiger, Ruminococcus 2, Eubacterium, and Faecalibacteria reduces the BSH enzyme diversity in Donor 4, which may contribute to the retardation of TCA deconjugation in this donor. Variation in the rate of bile acid deconjugation has downstream consequences for secondary bile acid formation and the potential to alter gut bacterial and host metabolism (Theisen et al., 2000; Jones et al., 2008; Bernstein et al., 2009; Swann et al., 2011; Joyce et al., 2014). Reduced efficiency in bile acid deconjugation could lower the rate at which CA and thus DCA is formed in the proximal colon. Colorectal transit time in a healthy individual is highly variable ranging from 14 to 80 h depending on age and gender (Graff et al., 2001; Haase et al., 2016). A delay of deconjugation by 10 h could therefore result in the greater excretion of primary bile acids, or fewer secondary bile acids formed. Bile acids are potent detergents and have a key role facilitating the absorption of dietary lipids, nutrients and lipid-soluble vitamins. Deconjugation reduces the efficiency of bile acids for the emulsification of dietary lipids and micelle formation while CA has greater lipid-emulsification properties than the dihydroxy bile acids, CDCA, and DCA. Such modulations could impact on the efficiency of the enterohepatic circulation for digesting and absorbing lipids. The downstream effect on host metabolic signaling also needs to be considered with the receptors FXR, PXR, CAR, and TGR5 all binding to unconjugated or secondary bile acids to initiate signaling cascades that influence drug and energy metabolism. Given that these signaling pathways regulate CYP450 enzymes, alterations in the bile acid signatures have potential to modulate the metabolism and clearance of drugs (Kliewer and Willson, 2002; Chatterjee et al., 2005). Furthermore, a feedback loop exists between secondary bile acid formation and gut bacterial proliferation. For example, lower concentrations of DCA have been linked to an increase in C. difficile infections (Greathouse et al., 2015). The ability of the gut microbiota to deconjugate and subsequently dehydroxylate bile acids into DCA may protect against C. difficile proliferation. This may be a key property in defining the effectiveness of fecal bacterial transplants (FMT) in the treatment of C. difficile infections and could explain the poor efficacy of certain donors in this treatment. Hence, this rapid in vitro approach may help to assess the efficacy of fecal bacterial transplants prior to use.",

The use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and not full resolution metagenomics is a limitation of the current approach. While the composition of the bacterial communities has been investigated the functional potential encoded in the genomes of the modeled communities remains unknown. This prevents metabolic outcomes from being confidently attributed to specific bacteria. Based on the obtained results, future experiments combining metagenomic and metabonomic approaches in this model system offer great promise for studying metabolic functions in complex communities and identifying the specific contributions of individual bacteria.",

After obtaining verbal informed consent, a standard questionnaire to collect information regarding the health status, drugs use, clinical anamnesis, and lifestyle was administrated before the donor was ask to provide a fecal sample. The University of Reading ethics committee exempted this study from review because no donors were involved in any intervention and waived the need for written consent due to the fact the samples received were not collected by means of intervention. Fecal slurries were prepared by homogenizing freshly voided human feces (10%, w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7.4) using a stomacher (model 6041; Seward Scientific, U.K.) at 460 beats/min for 120 s. Each fermentation vessel was inoculated with 6 ml of fecal slurry to 53 ml of basal medium to a final concentration of 10% v/v. All vessels set up in parallel were inoculated with the same fecal sample. Fermentation vessels were maintained under anaerobic conditions, at 37\u00b0C, by constant sparging with O2-free N2. The pH was maintained at pH 6.7 (\u00b10.1) by means of an automated pH controller (Fermac 260; Electrolab, Tewkesbury, U.K.), which added 1 mol/L sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid as appropriate.

The supernatant from each sample was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Bile acid standards were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Gillingham, U.K) (TUDCA, TLCA, GDCA, GUDCA, TDCA, UDCA, GCA, LCA, TCDCA, TCA, GCDCA, and DCA) and Steraloids Inc (London U.K) (CDCA, CA, HDCA, and HCA). Bile acid stock solutions (1 mg/ml) were prepared in water: methanol [80:20 (v/v)] solution and used immediately. Water, acetonitrile and methanol were Fluka LC-MS CHROMASOLV, all obtained from Sigma Aldrich (Gillingham, U.K). Calibration curves were created from bile acid stocks by creating nine standards for each of the 16 bile acid moieties as follows; 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 10, 1, 100, 10, and 1 ng/ml. A pooled fecal water sample (QC) was prepared by combining 10 \u03bcl of each fecal water sample from the batch culture experiments and was injected 10 times at the start of the run to condition the column and every 10 samples. The purpose of the QC sample was to assess instrument stability and to ensure consistency of peaks throughout the sample batch. Hundred microliter of each fecal water sample was transferred into a 350 \u03bcl volume 96 well plate. Samples were analyzed using an Acquity UPLC system connected to a Q-TOF premier mass spectrometer (Waters MS technologies, Ltd, Manchester, UK). The column was a CSH C18 1.7 \u03bcM (Waters) UPLC (2.1 \u00d7 100 mm), the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The run time per sample was 12 min, 8 \u03bcl of each sample was injected with mobile phase starting conditions of 15% acetonitrile and 85% water. Acetonitrile concentration was increased linearly over the run whilst water decreased, until a final solvent composition of 85% acetonitrile and 15% water was reached. Samples were analyzed in negative electrospray mode over a scan range of 50\u20131,000 m/z. Bile acids ionize strongly in negative mode, producing a prominent [M-H]- ion and characteristic fragmentation data. MS conditions were as follows: Capillary voltage 2.4 kV, sample cone 30 V, desolvation temperature 400\u00b0C, source temperature 120\u00b0C, scan duration 0.2 s, cycle time 0.22 s, and interscan delay 0.02 s.",

Using Schloss' SOP for MiSeq we assessed the quality of the data and, pre-processed, assembled paired-end reads, removed chimeras, and aligned to obtain a total number of sequences in each sample. To analyze the bacterial communities of batch culture samples, Mothur clustered the data according to operational taxonomic units (OTUs), at a 97% cut-off. Singletons and any OTUs which were not found more than 10 times in any sample were collated into OTU_singletons and OTU_rare phylotypes, respectively, to maintain normalization and to minimize artifacts. The shared OTU data from Mothur (taxonomic data) was analyzed using a combination of statistical programs R-script, stamp (Parks and Beiko, 2010). The two methods used in this study to compare the similarity between each sample were Jaccard's index of similarity and the Bray\u2013Curtis distance measure (measure of dissimilarity) (Lozupone and Knight, 2005; Wang et al., 2013). Weighted Unifrac distance matrices were analyzed in R using non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and the shared OTU file was used to determine the number of times that an OTU was observed in multiple samples and for multivariate analysis in R. OTU taxonomies (from phylum to genus) were determined using the classifier command in Mothur to generate the RDP taxonomy (Wang et al., 2007). A closed reference approach was used to obtain genus level taxonomic classifications. The OTUs identified were compared to the RDP database of 12,681 bacterial and 531 archael 16S rRNA gene sequences with associated taxonomy. Once this information has been obtained the genome sequence of the genera were studied for genes identified as either a bile salt hydrolase or choloylglycine hydrolase. Alpha and beta indices were calculated from these datasets with Mothur and R using the Vegan package.",

The samples were dried onto the slides at 46\u00b0C for 15 min and afterwards dehydrated in an alcohol series (50, 80, and 96%, 3 min each). The ethanol was allowed to evaporate from the slides before the probes were applied to the samples.

Hybridizations were performed for 4 h in an ISO20 oven (Grant Boekel). For the washing step, slides were placed in 50 mL of wash buffer containing 20 \u03bcL of 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; 50 ng \u03bcL\u22121; Sigma) for 15 min.

Slides were stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C (for a maximum of 3 days) until cells were counted under a Nikon E400 Eclipse microscope. DAPI slides were visualized with the aid of a DM 400 filter and probe slides with the aid of a DM 575 filter. Numbers of specific bacteria and DAPI-stained entities (used to count total bacteria) were determined using the following equation: 0.8 \u00d7 ACC \u00d7 6732.42 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 DF, where DF is the dilution factor and ACC is the average cell count of 15 fields of view.
