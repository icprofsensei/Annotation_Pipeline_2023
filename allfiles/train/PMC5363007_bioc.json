Even housekeeping pathways contain a mix of variable and invariable genes, though most highly conserved genes are significantly invariable. Variable genes tend to be associated with Proteobacteria, as opposed to taxa used to define enterotypes or the dominant phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.",

Shotgun metagenomics is revolutionizing our ability to identify protein-coding genes from these microbes and associate gene levels with disease [6], drug efficacy [7] or side-effects [8], and other host traits. For instance, human gut microbiota associated with a traditional high-fiber agrarian diet encoded gene families involved in cellulose and xylan hydrolysis, which were absent in age-matched controls eating a typical Western diet [9]. The functional capabilities of the human gut microbiome go beyond statistical associations. A number of microbial genes have now been causally linked to host physiology. Examples include the colitis-inducing cytolethal distending toxins of Helicobacter hepaticus [10] and the enzymes of commensal bacteria that protect against these toxins by producing anti-inflammatory polysaccharide A [11].",

We refer to these metagenomic gene families with very low variance in abundance across hosts as \u201cinvariable.\u201d Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, biological pathway abundance tends to be less variable across metagenomes than it is between isolate genomes [12], suggesting strong selection for microbes that encode functions necessary for adaptation to the gut environment. Second, the relative abundances of pathways are strikingly invariable compared to the relative abundances of bacterial phyla in the same metagenomes [12, 13]. Thus, it appears that humans harbor phylogenetically distinct gut communities that all do more or less the same things, except in the context of disease or other extreme host phenotypes.",

                    "text": "Functional redundancy deserves a closer look, however, because physiologically meaningful differences in gene abundances between healthy human microbiomes could easily have been missed. One primary factor may be that prior work did not look at quantitative abundances of individual genes but instead mainly summarized function at the level of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) categories (e.g., \u201ccarbohydrate metabolism and transport\u201d) and KEGG modules (e.g., \u201ccitrate cycle\u201d) [12\u201314]. This strategy lacks the power to detect one component of a pathway or protein complex that varies in abundance across hosts if other components are less variable. This masking of variable genes (i.e., genes with high variance) is likely because the presence and abundance of most COG categories and KEGG modules will be dominated by core components (i.e., housekeeping genes) that are widely distributed across the tree of life and abundant in metagenomes. The only previous analyses of individual genes asked whether they were universally detected across all individuals sampled [12, 14]. However, universally detected genes may still vary substantially in abundance, and conversely, lower-abundance invariable genes may not be universally detected merely due to sampling. This approach is also sensitive to read depth [12] and sample size [14]. Based on these observations, we were motivated to quantitatively investigate functional redundancy at the level of individual sets of orthologs (or \u201cgene families\u201d).",

Like modern approaches for RNAseq analysis [22, 23] and proteomics analysis [24], we use the negative binomial distribution to directly model the sequencing count data and account for the mean-variance relationship. However, instead of using this distribution to more accurately detect genes with differences in abundance between groups, we use it to discover genes whose variances are unexpected given their mean values. This modeling choice is important because abundant genes will be variable just by chance due to the correlation between mean and variance in any sequencing experiment. Conversely, phylogenetically restricted genes will have relatively low variance due to being less abundant. Furthermore, gene abundances can be sparse (i.e., zero in many samples). For all of these reasons, simply ranking genes based on their variances would yield many false positives and false negatives.",

The Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes ratio has also been measured as a potential biomarker of interest in its own right [29\u201331]. In contrast, we show that the less abundant phylum Proteobacteria, and not Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes, is a major source of genes with the greatest variability in abundance across hosts. Thus, while Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes may contribute most to taxonomic variation between hosts, the abundance of Proteobacteria may capture more of the functional variation. This has implications for the interpretation of taxonomic data from human gut microbiota and, because of the link between Proteobacteria and dysbiosis [32], also suggests a potential relationship between inflammation and gene-level differences in gut microbial functions.",

Figure \u200bFigure11 shows that this mean-variance relationship cannot be adequately captured by a Poisson distribution (blue dashed line), in which the mean and variance are equal; however, a better fit can be obtained by using the negative binomial distribution (red dashed line), a count-based distribution that allows for overdispersion, i.e., variance that exceeds the mean. Indeed, simply based on this negative binomial best-fit, ribosomal proteins are likely less variable than expected since they fall well below the trend line in all three datasets (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1).1). The negative binomial is commonly used in other sequencing applications, such as RNAseq [21], which has similar overdispersion.",

The differences in the residual variation of these gene families can be visualized using a heatmap of the residual \u03b5\ng,s values (Additional file 6: Figure S7 and Additional file 7: Figure S8). The large number of genes that were less variable than expected given their means supports the hypothesis of some functional redundancy in the gut microbiome, potentially due to selection for core functions that make microbes more successful in the gut environment. Notably, the HMP cohort tended to have overall lower variance in their metagenomes than the GC and T2D cohorts; this may be because the exclusion criteria for HMP, which explicitly studied only healthy individuals, were particularly stringent [41]. Nevertheless, our discovery of thousands of significantly variable genes across a range of abundance levels demonstrates that the gut microbiome is less invariable than prior work suggested.",

As expected, we observed an overall signal of stability at this broad level of gene groupings. Many of the pathways previously identified as invariable (e.g., aminoacyl-tRNA metabolism, central carbon metabolism) indeed have more invariable than variable genes. However, individual genes show a much more complex picture. Even the most invariable pathways also include significantly variable genes (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3).3). For example, the highly conserved KEGG module set \u201caminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, prokaryotes\u201d included one variable gene at an empirical FDR of 5%, sepRS. sepRS is an O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase, which is an alternative route to biosynthesis of cysteinyl-tRNA in methanogenic archaea [42]. Methanogen abundance has previously been noted to be variable between individual human guts: while DNA extraction for archaea may be less reliable than for bacteria, even optimized methods showed large standard deviations across individuals [43]. Another gene in this category was variable at a weaker level of significance (10% empirical FDR): poxA, a variant lysyl-tRNA synthetase. Recent experimental work has shown that this protein has a diverged, novel functionality, lysinylating the elongation factor EF-P [44, 45].\n\n",

This discrepancy is probably due to our accounting for the mean-variance relationship in shotgun data. The Sec and Tat systems are abundant and phylogenetically diverse [50] and will therefore have greater variance than low-abundance genes just by chance. Our test adjusts for this feature of sequencing experiments and shows that these genes are in fact less variable than expected given their mean abundance.",

The lone exception catalyzes the the final lipid A acylation step, adding a sixth acyl chain; this gene family was significantly variable (FDR \u2264 5%). Furthermore, we observe several variable gene families annotated as performing covalent modifications of LPS, including hydroxyl- (lpxO), palmitoyl- (pagP), and palmitoleoylation (lpxP), as well as deacylation and dephosphorylation. These modifications can lead to differential TLR4 activation [53, 54]. We also observe that gene families involved in O-antigen synthesis and ligation to lipid A tended to be variable (5 out of 6). These results suggest that healthy individuals may differ in the amount of hexa- vs. pentaacylated LPS, and in the amounts of other LPS chemical modifications, and thus in their baseline level of TLR4-dependent inflammation. Importantly, since the majority of gene families annotated to LPS biosynthesis were invariable, this result would have been missed by considering the pathway as a unit.\n\n",

Part of this difference is likely due to our stratifying by phylogenetic distribution, a step previous studies did not perform.",

Specifically, we used a permutation test based on partial Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 correlation. This test is rank-based and thus distribution-agnostic, handles ties (unlike Spearman\u2019s \u03c1), and accounts for study-to-study variation by using partial correlation (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). The resulting p values were corrected for multiple testing using the q value method and thresholded at an FDR of q\u22640.05. Based on these results, we then determined whether phyla were enriched for variable or invariable genes by Fisher\u2019s exact test (Bonferroni-corrected p\u22640.05). This analysis revealed that the predicted abundance of Proteobacteria was strongly enriched for correlations with variable gene families (Bonferroni-corrected p\u226410\u22128): Fig. \u200bFig.77\n\u200bb).b). The abundance of the archaeal phylum Euryarchaeota was also enriched for correlations with variable gene families, to a lesser extent (Bonferroni-corrected p\u226410\u22124).\n\n",

Euryarchaeota comprised an even smaller fraction of the microbiome (median=0%) and was only detected in 33% of metagenomes (though this could potentially be explained by unreliable extraction efficiency for archaea, as mentioned above [43]). However, seven samples from the GC and T2D cohorts had \u226515% Proteobacteria, with four having \u226520% and one having 41%. Overgrowth of Proteobacteria has been associated with metabolic syndrome [32] and inflammatory bowel disease [61]. Also, Proteobacteria can be selected (over Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) by intestinal inflammation as tested by TLR5-knockout mice [62], and some Proteobacteria can induce colitis in this background [63], potentially leading to a feedback loop. Thus, the variable gene families we discovered could be biomarkers for dysbiosis and inflammation in otherwise healthy hosts.",

Most recently, abundances of the taxa Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroides, and Prevotella were found to explain the most taxonomic variation across individuals [28]. These enterotypes appeared to be linked to long-term diet, with Prevotella highest in individuals with the most carbohydrate intake and Bacteroides correlating with protein and animal fat. However, while these clades contributed most to taxonomic variation, in our study, all were actually depleted for associations with variable genes. In contrast, the Proteobacterial family Enterobacteriaceae (Additional file 13: Figure S12B), and to a lesser extent, Gammaproteobacteria in general (Additional file 13: Figure S12C) were much more likely to be associated with variable gene families. Similar results were also obtained using the centered log-ratio (clr) transform to correct potential compositionality artifacts (see Additional file 14: Figure S16). This suggests that compared to previously identified enterotype marker taxa, levels of Proteobacteria, and potentially Euryarchaeota, better explain person-to-person variation in gut microbial gene function. These less abundant phyla were missed in enterotype studies, likely because enterotypes were identified by methods that will tend to weight higher-abundance taxa more, and enterotypes were identified from taxonomic, not functional data.",

To answer this question, we conducted the same analysis with bacterial and archaeal taxa at the family level. However, when considering the 30 families with significant enrichments for (in)variable or non-significant gene families, there was no significant association between the degree of enrichment for variable genes and either prevalence (r=\u22120.07, p=0.72) or abundance (r=\u22120.1, p=0.58) (Additional file 13: Figure S12D-E). In fact, Enterobacteriaceae, a Proteobacterial family, was significantly enriched for correlations with variable genes despite a prevalence of 86%, in the top 25% of all families detected. Thus, prevalence and abundance do not explain the variability of Proteobacterial genes.",

There are 1111 Proteobacterial genomes compared to 575 for Firmicutes, 276 for Actinobacteria, 104 for Euryarchaeota, and only 97 for Bacteroidetes. Accordingly, Proteobacteria had the most gene families (1417) not annotated in any other phylum (\u201cprivate\u201d gene families), compared to 538 for Firmicutes, 342 for Euryarchaeota, 215 for Actinobacteria, and 21 for Bacteroidetes. Considering only these private gene families, Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota were enriched for variable genes, as before, whereas variable genes were depleted in the other three phyla (Additional file 15: Figure S13A). This suggests that the level of annotation does not predict the amount of variable genes. In a further test, we repeated the entire statistical test on a subset of genes, sampling one part phylum-specific genes drawn equally from Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Euryarchaeota, and one part genes annotated to all four phyla (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). Again, Proteobacteria- and Euryarchaeota-specific genes were significantly variable more often than those from either Actinobacteria or Firmicutes (Additional file 15: Figure S13B). We therefore concluded that phylum abundance and annotation bias do not explain the enrichment of variable genes in Proteobacteria.",

Also, some gene families may confer adaptive advantages in the gut only within certain taxa. To detect gene families that are variable or invariable within a phylum, we repeated the test, but using only reads whose best RAPSearch2 [64] alignments were to sequences from whole genomes of each of the four most abundant bacterial phyla (Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria). Most (77%) gene families showed phylum-specific effects. Invariable gene families tended to agree, but the reverse was true for variable gene families: 19.4% of gene families that were invariable in one phylum were invariable in all, compared to just 0.34% (eight genes) in the variable set (Fig. \u200b(Fig.88\n\u200ba,a, \u200b,b).b). This trend was robust to the FDR cutoff (Additional file 16: Figure S14A\u2013B). Gene families invariable in all four phyla were enriched for basal cellular machinery, as expected (Additional file 17: C\u2013D).\n\n",

This supports the hypothesis that Proteobacterial abundance is a dominant factor influencing functional variability in the human gut microbiome.

Conversely, both two-component signaling and the PTS system had many more invariable gene families in Firmicutes than in Bacteroidetes (Additional file 16: Figure S14C). However, phylum-specific variable gene families tended not to overlap (median overlap, 0%, compared to 46% for invariable gene families).

For instance, Proteobacterial-specific variable gene families were enriched (Fisher\u2019s test enrichment q=0.13) for the biosynthesis of siderophore group nonribosomal peptides, which may reflect the importance of iron scavenging for the establishment of both pathogens (e.g., Yersinia) and commensals (e.g., Escherichia coli) [66]. Another phylum-specific variable function appeared to be the type IV secretion system (T4SS) within Firmicutes (q=0.021). Homologs of this specialized secretion system are involved in a wide array of biochemical interactions, including the conjugative transfer of plasmids (e.g., antibiotic-resistance cassettes) between bacteria [67]. We conclude that our approach enables the identification of substantial variation within all four major bacterial phyla in the gut, much of which is not apparent when data are analyzed at broader functional resolution or without stratifying by phylum.",

CCoDA differs from earlier approaches to quantifying variability in microbiome function in several key ways. First, we focus explicitly on the variability of gene family abundance, not differences in mean abundance between predefined groups, as has been done to reveal pathways whose abundance differs between body sites [69] or disease states [6].",

This parametric bootstrap null is more computationally intensive than previous approaches. However, the use of such a null allows us much better control over the false discovery rate than previous approaches that dichotomized gene families based on binary presence/absence [12]. Dichotomizing in this way may be acceptable for small datasets. However, based on the data used here, dichotomizing would classify 12% of significantly invariable (FDR \u22640.05) gene families and, more problematically, 85% of non-significant gene families (q \u22650.25) as part of the \u201cvariable\u201d metagenome.

While estimating this mean-variance relationship accurately requires a significant sample size (the best results in simulations were obtained with n\u226540 per study), CCoDA can identify individual gene families as well as pathways that break this overall trend. Because we account for the mean-variance relationship, we identify different variable pathways than the previous studies that relied on the sample variance only [13]. Additionally, our major findings are robust when we apply the centered log-ratio transform (see Additional file 14: Figure S16). Importantly, unlike previous work, CCoDA tends to call pathways that are well-conserved across prokaryotes invariable (for example, the Sec general secretory system; see Fig. \u200bFig.6).6). This suggests that this method better captures biological intuition about meaningful variation. Fourth, the null distribution is estimated from the shotgun data and does not require comparisons to sequenced genomes [12]. Finally, unlike previous approaches, CCoDA can be used for meta-analysis, integrating data from multiple different populations.",

This finding is consistent with the previous results [12] and indeed is not surprising given the broad conservation of these processes across the tree of life. In contrast, we identified invariable gene families that have narrower phylogenetic distributions. These included, for example, proteins involved in two-component signaling, starch metabolism (including glucosides), and glycosaminoglycan metabolism. Previous experimental work has underscored the importance of some of these pathways in gut symbionts: for instance, multiple gut-associated Bacteroides species use the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate as a sole carbon source [56], and the metabolism of resistant starch in general is thought to be a critical function of the omnivorous mammalian microbiome [55]. These results suggest that our method identifies protein-coding gene families that contribute to fitness of symbionts within the gut. Finally, we found a number of invariable gene families whose function is not yet annotated. These gene families may represent functions that are either essential or provide advantages for life in the gut and may therefore be particularly interesting targets for experimental follow-up (e.g., assessing whether strains in which these gene families have been knocked out in fact have slower growth rates, either in vitro or in the gut).",

In contrast, we frame our method as a frequentist hypothesis test as opposed to a Bayesian hierarchical model. Our method also accounts for study-to-study variation. Also, unlike previous approaches in this domain, CCoDA does not require biological noise to be explicitly decomposed from technical noise. Thus, our method does not require the use of experimentally spiked-in controls, which are not present in most experiments involving sequencing of the gut microbiome.

Integrating the results of these analyses could also further help to validate or interpret the functional variability we observe in this dataset. For example, mass spectrometry methods that can resolve differently modified LPS molecules could reveal whether the variation we observe at the metagenomic level is also seen across LPS molecules with different immunogenic properties. Of course, we would also expect that key functions provided by the microbiome would be highly regulated at the level of transcript or protein abundance.

Simulations reveal CCoDA has high accuracy and power across a range of realistic scenarios. Applying this test to shotgun metagenomes from healthy human gut microbiota, we uncovered thousands of variable gene families whose abundances were more variable than expected. In general, more conserved genes tended to be less variable, but significantly variable genes also included some with relatively broad phylogenetic distributions. Finally, while the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes varied substantially between healthy individuals, consistent with previous studies of the human gut microbiome, we found that these phyla were actually depleted for associations with variable genes. The same was true for genera and families used to define \u201centerotypes.\u201d Instead, a less abundant phylum, Proteobacteria, contributed most to functional variation in this population. These results argue that gene function in the healthy human gut microbiome may be more variable than previously assumed and that the major axes of taxonomic variation in microbiota do not necessarily capture the most variation in function.",

We calculated appropriate cutoffs based on datasets with 43% true positives and a variable to invariable gene family ratio ranging from 0.1 to 10, taking the median cutoff value across these ratios (Additional file 10).

Empirically, this measure is very similar to the number of protein sequences (Additional file 22: Figure S11) but is not as sensitive to high or variable rates of within-species duplication: for example, families such as transposons, which exhibit high rates of duplication as well as copy number variation between species, have a larger number of sequences than even very well-conserved proteins such as RNA polymerase, but have similar or even lower tree densities, indicating that they are not truly more broadly conserved.",

The background set was taken to be the intersection of the set of gene families observed in the data with the set of gene families that had pathway- or module-level annotations. p values were converted to q values as above. Finally, enrichments were enumerated by selecting all modules or pathways below q\u22640.25 that had positive odds ratios (i.e., enriched instead of depleted).",

The distributions had the expected trend (e.g., significantly variable gene families tended to have higher residual variance) but also overlapped, indicating the importance of the calculated null distribution. The inset shows the proportion of zero values for the non-significant (black) and significantly invariable (blue) gene families with V\nG falling in the lowest range (vertical dashed lines), indicating that the test differentiates between gene families that only appear invariable because they have few observations and gene families that are consistently abundant yet invariable.

Invariable gene families are not shown on the right because they overwhelmingly have small numbers of zeros. Gene families with very low mean abundances or large numbers of zeros tend to be called non-significant, not variable, indicating that the test correctly accounts for stochastic noise from low numbers of observations in determining statistical significance.

For each mock dataset y, simulated null data was generated from a negative binomial distribution, fixing the size parameter k\ny but allowing the mean \u03bc\ng,y to vary for each of 1000 genes; simulated true-positive gene families were drawn from a negative binomial distribution with size equal to z\nk\ny or k\ny/z, where z is the effect size. A-C) The choice of estimator affected the accuracy of size estimates. The mode method-of-moments estimator (C, y-axis) more accurately estimated the true size specified in the simulation (x-axis) than the harmonic mean (A, y-axis) or median (B, y-axis), and was more tolerant to differences in the ratio of true-positive variable and invariable gene families (colors). D-E) When the size parameter was known, \u03b1(D) and power (E) were well controlled, with \u03b1 approximately equal to 0.05 at p\u22640.05 and power approaching 1. Here, each simulation comprised three mock studies with different size parameters, mirroring our actual data. Bar heights represent means from four simulations and error bars are \u00b12 SD. The proportion of variable/invariable gene families was 0.5, and 44% of genes were true positives.(PDF 170 kb)",

Clinical covariates for HMP were obtained from dbGaP accession #phs000228.v3.p1. Funding support for the development of NIH Human Microbiome Project - Core Microbiome Sampling Protocol A (HMP-A) was provided by the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research. Clinical data for HMP-A were jointly produced by the Baylor College of Medicine and the Washington University School of Medicine. Sequencing data for HMP-A were produced by the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center, The Broad Institute, the Genome Center at Washington University, and the J. Craig Venter Institute. These data were submitted by the EMMES Corporation (Rockville, MD, USA), which serves as the clinical data collection site for the HMP.
