AZLI improves lung function and quality of life, and reduces exacerbations-improvements attributed to its antipseudomonal activity.

As such, we sought to determine if AZLI affects the CF lung microbiome and whether community constituents can be used to predict treatment responsiveness.",

Furthermore, beta diversity demonstrated clustering with respect to patients, but had no association with AZLI use.

Ultimately, 60\u201380% of CF patients will become chronically infected with P. aeruginosa [1]. Chronic infection with P. aeruginosa and its conversion to an alginate hyper-producing mucoid phenotype is associated with progressive decline in lung function, worsening quality of life, increased risk of hospitalization, and reduced survival [2]. Accordingly, novel management strategies for both acute and chronic infections have been at the forefront of efforts to improve outcomes in CF. The concept of aerosolized antibiotics as a means of delivering potent therapy to the lower airways was first proposed in 1946; however, it has only been widely implemented in the last three decades [3]. Aerosolized delivery of antipseudomonal antibiotics allows for the deposition of supra-therapeutic levels of drugs directly to infected airways. This may overcome many intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms of P. aeruginosa while avoiding systemic exposure to high levels of the medication and its resultant toxicity [4].",

Studies have demonstrated that AZLI improves clinical outcomes in CF including lung function, quality of life indices, weight gain, and delayed time to next pulmonary exacerbation [5\u20139]. In a 6-month comparative trial, AZLI exhibited superior effects compared to tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) in improving lung function and reducing exacerbation frequency [6]. Improvements in CF patients prescribed inhaled antibiotics, and AZLI in particular, have long been presumed due to their antipseudomonal cidal effects and resultant reduction in P. aeruginosa sputum density (approximately 1.5 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/g of sputum during cycles on therapy) [5\u20139]. However, P. aeruginosa persists at a range of 5.5\u20136.0 log10 CFU/g of sputum despite potent inhaled antibacterial therapies. Furthermore, no correlation has ever been demonstrated between improvements in lung function and decline in P. aeruginosa density [3, 5\u20139]. This suggests that these inhaled antibiotics may have additional unknown mechanisms of action.",

Unfortunately, studies regarding the microbiome have generally been limited to short-term longitudinal or cross-sectional cohort studies [12, 13]. Importantly, components of the microbiome (such as the Streptococcus anginosus group) have been associated with disease pathogenesis [14], while other organisms are thought to protect the microbiota by the production of antibiotic degrading enzymes [15, 16]. The administration of systemic antibiotics has been shown to have dramatic, albeit transient, effects on the microbial community composition [17].

However, we speculate that the exceedingly high concentrations achieved through aerosolization may extend their spectrum of activity to other members of the CF microbiota including Gram positives and anaerobes [18]. Indeed, it may be that several existing CF therapies exert their therapeutic response through the manipulation of the microbiome. We hypothesized that at least a portion of AZLI\u2019s beneficial effect is microbiome mediated. To determine if this may be the case, we sought to define the changes induced in the CF microbiome following the initiation of AZLI and correlate whether microbiome composition influenced response to therapy.",

To determine changes in lung function following the initiation of AZLI, FEV1% values recorded in the year before and after AZLI measured during periods of clinical stability were modeled using a linear mixed effects model. Periods of clinical stability were defined as samples free of systemic therapies for >1\u00a0week and free of pulmonary exacerbation. We have purposefully selected a 1-week time frame as systemic antibiotics have been shown to have transient effects on the microbiota and community composition returns to baseline within approximately 1\u00a0week [12, 13, 17, 22]. Patients were differentiated into AZLI \u201cresponders\u201d and \u201cnon-responders.\u201d The definition of responder was a priori defined as achieving an improvement in FEV1 of \u22653% predicted over the year (excluding values obtained during pulmonary exacerbations) following AZLI initiation, based on evaluation of clinical study data where short-term improvements of 2.7\u201310.8% were observed [5, 6, 8, 9].",

Samples collected prior to treatment (pre) were compared with those collected after treatment (post) to determine how AZLI impacts the microbiome of a na\u00efve patient population. Post-samples were further stratified based on whether they were collected during \u201con\u201d vs \u201coff\u201d cycled AZLI therapy. Those samples collected within 7\u00a0days of parenteral antibiotics for a pulmonary exacerbation were assessed for changes associated with systemic therapies and excluded from other analyses to limit confounding effects [17]. In order to determine if there are biomarkers associated with clinical response to AZLI, the microbiome of responders vs non-responders was also compared. Finally, we analyzed whether there were gender-based differences in the microbiome as an attempt to better characterize the gender gap in CF lung disease [32]. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and paired t tests were used to test for significant differences in alpha diversity measures of observed OTUs and Shannon diversity indices (SDI), in the phyloseq package in R [31, 33]. Community structures were assessed using Bray-Curtis (BC) beta diversity measures after proportionally normalizing all samples as previously described [12]. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to analyze statistical differences in beta diversity using the vegan package in R [33]. Results were visualized using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots. In addition to community-wide differences, we were also interested in differences at the genus and OTU level; Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and paired t test were employed to calculate differences in the relative abundance values of organisms present in >20% of samples for the different categorical variables being assessed. Log abundance plots were used to visualize these results using ggplot2 package in R [34]. Samples with an abundance value of 0 were changed to a value of 1 since log(0) is undefined and log(1)\u2009=\u20090. As a sensitivity analysis, a linear mixed model with random intercepts was constructed to examine differences in diversity as well as relative abundance of organisms present in >20% of samples (similar to above) for the pre- and post-AZLI period. Secondly, a restricted analysis (using only one sample/patient/category) of the observations closest to initiation of AZLI in the pre- and post-periods was conducted utilizing paired t tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for the previously detailed tests as a comparator.",

                    "text": "We further sought to determine if the microbiome may be used as a biomarker to identify patients more or less likely to demonstrate a clinical improvement on AZLI. According to our a priori definition, 14/24 patients achieved a \u22653% improvement in lung function following the initiation of AZLI. Number of exacerbation events in the year following AZLI did not differ between responders and non-responders (median 0 vs 1, p\u2009=\u20090.66) nor did total days of IV antibiotics (median 9 [IQR 0\u201326] vs 16 [IQR 0\u201332], p\u2009=\u20090.6). When comparing only pre-samples (excluding those on systemic therapies), we found no significant shifts in SDI or Bray-Curtis beta diversity measures using PERMANOVA (p\u2009=\u20090.49) (Fig.\u00a04a, b). However, when response was stratified by female gender, there was significance (p\u2009=\u20090.02) suggesting gender is a confounder. When permutations were constrained by patient, the p value increased (p\u2009=\u20090.85) (Fig.\u00a04b). Next, we sought to identify changes at the genus and OTU level. Non-responders trended towards lower abundance of Pseudomonas 43.0% (IQR 12.9\u201372.8%) compared to responders 57.0% (14.4\u201381.4%) (p\u2009=\u20090.61). Non-responders had a higher abundance of Staphylococcus, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella (Fig.\u00a04c\u2013f). When restricted analyses were conducted, Fusobacterium and Prevotella (OTU 41) were no longer significantly different. No significant differences were detected in SDI (Fig.\u00a05a) or Bray-Curtis beta diversity measures using PERMANOVA (p\u2009=\u20090.07) (Fig.\u00a05b) in samples collected after AZLI initiation. Furthermore, when permutations were constrained by patient, the p value increased dramatically to p\u2009=\u20091.0 suggesting that differences may be derived by patient rather than response status (Fig.\u00a05b). Higher abundances of Fusobacterium and Bacteroides following treatment initiation were also associated with lack of clinical response (Fig.\u00a05c, e). Responders had a higher abundance of Prevotella, although it was not the same OTU (34 rather than 41 and 73) associated with lack of response in the pre-sample assessment (Figs.\u00a04e, f and \u200band5d).5d). Restricted analyses demonstrated similarly that SDI was comparable following AZLI initiation in responders and non-responders.\n\n",

We identified that both SDI and community structure of samples on vs off systemic antibiotics were significantly different (Fig.\u00a06a, b). This was true even when permutations were constrained by patient (p\u2009=\u20090.04). Furthermore, samples collected during use of systemic therapies had significantly reduced levels of Streptococcus. Gender analysis revealed that samples collected from males had a significantly higher SDI; this correlated with a reduced proportional abundance of Pseudomonas and increased abundance in other genera including Streptococcus, Dialister, Shuttleworthia, and Stenotrophomonas (Fig.\u00a07). Males also had a higher abundance of Rhodanobacter and Tepidimonas; however, these organisms were present in very low abundance. Conversely, females had a higher abundance of Pseudomonas and trended towards improved responsiveness to AZLI: 9/12 vs 5/12 (p\u2009=\u20090.24). Community-wide differences as measured by PERMANOVA show significant differences (p\u2009=\u20090.001) between males and females (Fig.\u00a07b). However, when constraints to permutations are set by patient in the PERMANOVA, the p value becomes 1.0 suggesting these differences may be due to inter-patient variability in the microbiome (Fig.\u00a07b). Sensitivity analyses using restricted observations were similar with the primary results; however, SDI and the abundance of Stenotrophomonas and Neisseria were no longer significantly different.\n\n",

However, the role of these complex communities remains to be elucidated. While the CF microbiome is commonly cited as a single entity, microbial communities are highly individualized, although some trends are evident [12]. Generally, diversity inversely correlates with lung function as patients with advancing lung disease have communities dominated by core pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) [13, 37, 38]. An individual\u2019s microbiome is relatively constant during clinical stability [12, 13]. However, acute therapies during pulmonary exacerbations with systemic antibiotics are known to induce large, yet transient changes, as the microbiome reverts to baseline following their discontinuation.",

Indeed, the development and implementation of acute and chronic antibacterial therapies targeting classical pathogens are purported to be one of the major factors responsible for improving clinical outcomes [39]. Three classes of inhaled antimicrobials are commonly used to treat chronic P. aeruginosa infection in CF owing to an abundance of supporting clinical data: colistin, tobramycin, and aztreonam [3, 18, 40]. Whereas these agents are typically considered to have a spectrum of activity limited to aerobic Gram-negative organisms based on levels achievable parenterally, aerosolization achieves extremely high concentrations of the drugs specifically to the airways. Indeed, AZLI achieves aztreonam concentrations in sputum of 400\u2013550\u00a0\u03bcg/ml [7]. Accordingly, we postulated that inhaled antibiotics like their systemic counterparts may induce changes in the microbial communities of the lower airways in individuals with CF and that these communities may influence treatment response. Moreover, it may be possible to use signatures within the microbiome of individuals with CF to predict treatment response to particular CF therapeutics.",

As parenteral aztreonam is not a Health Canada-licensed medication, its use is uncommon in our cohort (~7% of all exacerbations) making the assessment of the impact of AZLI on the microbiome minimally confounded by prior exposure to parenteral aztreonam [21]. Our study demonstrates that although there are no shifts from a gross community perspective, subtle shifts are observed at the genus and OTU level. Moreover, these shifts are not limited to aerobic Gram-negative bacteria suggesting that AZLI may impact anaerobes and Gram-positives as well. Of particular interest, we observed that non-responders consistently have a higher abundance of the obligate anaerobe Fusobacterium pre- and post- the initiation of AZLI suggesting that this organism may be associated with lack of response to AZLI. Although Fusobacterium has been previously found in the CF microbiota, it has not been associated with outcomes. Fusobacterium species have been linked to other human diseases such as periodontal diseases [41] suggesting this organism may have a pathogenic potential and may create a more virulent lower airway community which may result in patients being less responsive to certain therapies. Similarly, in a study conducted by Bradshaw et al. 1998, they found that interspecies interactions between Fusobacterium nucleatum and other species enhanced the survival of other obligate anaerobes such as Prevotella nigrescens [42]. Staphylococcus aureus is now the most prevalent CF pathogen reported in international registries and commonly co-infects with P. aeruginosa. Notably, S. aureus is highly resistant to the effects of monobactam antibiotics and hence may explain why patients with a higher abundance of Staphylococcus are less responsive to AZLI.",

Noteworthy, Sherrard et al. 2015 observed that many strains of Prevotella derived from CF airways produce extended-spectrum-\u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs) [15]. Accordingly, it may be possible that non-responders have a higher abundance of the Prevotella isolates that produce ESBLs, which would be effective at degrading antibiotics such as AZLI. Moreover, their work suggests that Prevotella isolates may protect P. aeruginosa from the effects of antimicrobial agents thereby suggesting that the constituents in the CF microbiota may alter treatment responsiveness.",

This was evident in both measured differences in alpha diversity and differences in specific OTUs and genera. Samples taken from males generally had a more diverse microbiome as demonstrated by SDI and lower P. aeruginosa abundance. Indeed, these findings are supported by previous works showing females have earlier and higher rates of infection with P. aeruginosa [32, 48, 49]. Although, differences were observed in beta diversity using PERMANOVA, when permutations were constrained by patient, these differences were no longer significant suggesting that microbiome data should be analyzed very carefully to avoid misinterpretations due to confounding variables.

Additional in vivo studies will be needed to support our findings and further understand these complex interactions. Samples were collected as part of an ongoing biorepository based on when patients were in clinic as opposed to a prospectively enrolled study, which would allow for scheduled collection of samples. Future studies looking at the effects of inhaled antibiotic in a cyclical fashion where they are evaluated at pre-determined intervals would be more powerful than our \u201cbinning\u201d cycled therapy as on vs off. Moreover, samples collected during the off AZLI cycle may have been on different inhaled antibiotics during chronic sequential treatments therefore potentially confounding our findings. This study is limited by its inclusion of patients with particularly advanced disease\u2014a necessity given AZLI\u2019s role of salvage in Canada [35]. These individuals have significantly less diversity in their microbiome [37, 50], and as such, induced changes would be less apparent than in those with milder lung disease. However, clinical studies have shown AZLI to be particularly effective in individuals with moderate to severe disease, whereas fewer improvements were noted in those with milder disease [5, 6, 9, 18].",

Our primary analysis utilized multiple samples per patient without accounting for the intra-person correlation effects which may have impacted the results in either direction. However, we did incorporate sensitivity analyses including a mixed effects model to account for the repeated measures in the pre- and post-periods for diversity and relative abundance and restricted observation analysis to address the potential impact of multiple measures. The sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the primary analysis which provides more confidence to study results although we suggest larger prospective studies.",

Another limitation is the use of sputum as our sole sample type given the potential for oral flora to contaminate sputum. Importantly, however, sputum remains an easily accessible non-invasive sample from the lower airways and, regardless of contamination, can be harnessed as a relevant biomarker. Other sample types such as a bronchoalveolar lavage may help reduce biases and false positives and be more representative of the spatial heterogeneity that exists in the CF lung microbiome but poses risk.",

Although no significant changes were observed in overall diversity measures after initiation of AZLI, differences were observed at the genus and OTU level suggesting subtle shifts in certain constituents of the microbiome may occur because of AZLI therapy. Lack of response to AZLI was observed in patients whose sputum had a higher abundance of OTUs belonging to Fusobacterium, Staphylococcus, Prevotella, and Bacteroides. Further studies assessing treatment response in the context of pre-therapy microbiome signatures may enable personalization of therapy. Such a strategy would enable improved patient outcomes and avoid the negative economic and health outcomes associated with prescribing a less effective therapy.\n",
