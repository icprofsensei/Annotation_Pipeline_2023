Diabetic foot ulcers occur in 15% of patients with diabetes mellitus, with a yearly incidence of 1%\u20132% [2]. Diabetic patients have higher rates of hospitalization for skin and soft-tissue infections than patients without diabetes [3]. Most studies based on culture have shown that the infections are polymicrobial, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus species (especially Staphylococcus aureus) being the most prevalent isolates [4, 5]. Traditionally, the pathogenesis of these wounds has been attributed to factors such as neuropathy (a functional disturbance in peripheral nerves), repeated trauma, and peripheral vascular disease [6]. More recently, the roles of wound bioburden and functionally equivalent pathogroups in diabetic wound infections have been studied [7, 8]. Data on the composition of the cutaneous microbiota of diabetic patients is lacking. One of the few studies to address this question was performed in 1975, in the era prior to high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing (HTS) technology [9]. No differences in culturable organisms between control and diabetic skin were found, but the study also did not examine the feet.",

In contrast, on intact skin on the contralateral (opposite) limb of patients with unilateral diabetic ulcers, only 7% of the microbiota was represented by Staphylococcus species [13], suggesting a loss of these protective organisms or their replacement by other species. HTS identification based on deep sequencing is currently being used to better characterize the human microbiome [14, 15]. We sought to use HTS along with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to better characterize the microbiota of the diabetic foot. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences in surface microbiota of the arm and foot between nondiabetic men and diabetic men without a history of diabetic foot ulcer.",

These representative sequences were further aligned using PyNAST [22] with the Greengenes core-set alignment template, and the alignment was used to reconstruct an approximate phylogenetic tree, using FASTTREE [23], for the purpose of calculating UniFrac beta-diversity indices [24]. The OTU absolute abundance table and UniFrac beta-diversity matrices [25] were extracted from the pipeline for further analysis in the R statistical programming environment [26, 27]. The rarefactions for richness and Shannon diversity indices were calculated using scripts based on Community Ecology Package vegan. PCoA analysis was performed using the ade4 package in R. Intergroup and intragroup beta-diversity comparisons were performed using 1-way analysis of variance with the Tukey honestly significant difference multiple comparison correction procedure. The OTU relative abundances were calculated by dividing the absolute abundances by the total sequence count per sample analyzed. Differential relative abundance of specific taxa and OTU was calculated using the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, for simultaneous diabetes status and site comparison, and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test, for within-site comparisons. The P values were adjusted for false discovery, using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [28].",

The minimal sequence depth was 1775, and the median depth was 5274. The plantar aspect of the feet of diabetic subjects had greater taxonomic richness and Shannon diversity at all taxonomic levels, compared with the plantar aspect of the feet of controls (Figure \u200b(Figure3).3). Forearm samples from both controls and diabetic men had similar alpha diversity to each other and to the diabetic foot samples (Figure \u200b(Figure3).3). The bacterial composition, as determined by HTS and stratified by anatomical site and study group, is shown at the phylum and genus level in Figure \u200bFigure44A and \u200band44B. We examined the taxa that composed \u22651% of the total microbiota of the foot (Figure \u200b(Figure44C). The relative abundance of Staphylococcus species in the control group was similar to prior reports, at approximately 70% [9, 10].\n\n",

As expected, most of the differences occurred between arm and foot specimens. Among arm samples, no significant differences in relative abundances were found between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Among foot specimens, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was greater in controls, compared with diabetic subjects (78.8% vs 33.0%; P < .01 after adjustment for false discovery rate [FDR]), while Actinobacteria had a greater relative abundance in foot specimens from diabetic men, compared with foot specimens from controls (31.1% vs 16.2%; P < .03 after adjustment for FDR). At the genus level, Staphylococcus had the greatest relative abundance in foot specimens from both controls and diabetic patients (76.0% and 30.5%); however, because of the intersubject variability, the difference was not statistically significant (P = .08 after adjustment for FDR). On the other hand, Corynebacterium abundance was greater in the feet of diabetic subjects (18.2%) than in the feet of controls (5.1%; P < .03 after adjustment for FDR).",

We found that bacterial populations at the plantar aspect of the feet of diabetic men were more diverse and had different composition, compared with values for nondiabetic men. In particular, the quantity of Staphylococcus organisms was reduced on the diabetic plantar aspect of the foot, whereas the more virulent S. aureus was present in greater quantities; these changes may be precursors to diabetic foot infection and ulcer development. The quantity of Staphylococcus species at the interdigital space of the feet of diabetic men was significantly lower than that for controls, by qPCR. This finding, along with pyrosequencing data for the plantar aspect, which showed a trend toward a higher relative abundance of Staphylococcus species in control subjects (76.0% vs 30.5%; P = .08), suggest that the diabetic foot has a lower population of Staphylococcus species present. Since both groups had low total levels of S. aureus, most Staphylococcus species present were coagulase negative and less virulent.",

The increased diversity and loss of possibly protective coagulase-negative staphylococcal species [29\u201331] and the enrichment of S. aureus are findings that correlate with the elevated risk of skin and soft-tissue infections that occur in diabetic patients [1]. This risk is also supported by the trend among diabetic subjects toward higher S. aureus carriage rates on the foot (Figure \u200b(Figure2).2). As such, the differing populations of the plantar aspect of the diabetic foot, vis-a-vis the controls, may reflect a dysbiosis [32] that enhances disease risk. To further understand the role of the relevant microbial populations in disease, longitudinal study of high-risk patients is needed.",

No other factors in our study, including glycosylated hemoglobin levels, correlated with bacterial diversity. However, there were no differences in the arms between the diabetic group and controls, suggesting that the ambient temperature did not play a major role in the differences observed. Since diabetes status also correlated with diversity, we speculate that diabetes mellitus alters the microenvironment of the skin. Sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles all contribute to specific microenvironments and each have their own microbiota [33]. Diabetic patients are known to have altered sweat and thermoregulatory responses, even prior to the development of clinical neuropathy [34, 35]. Similarly, the glucose concentration of sweat is elevated during diabetes [36]. These factors together may explain why bacterial diversity in our study correlated with ambient temperature and diabetes status. Altered thermoregulation of the skin on the foot also could help explain why the microbiota is more diverse. Sweat gland output of the forearms of diabetic patients and controls was similar, while in the lower limb, patients with diabetes had less sweat output [37]. The data indicating that forearm diversity is similar in the diabetic subjects and controls but increased in the plantar aspect of the feet of diabetic individuals are consistent with the differential propensity for skin ulceration at the 2 sites.",

Antimicrobial peptides, such as dermcidin [39], secreted from eccrine sweat glands, have activity against S. aureus and other cutaneous microbes. Since these glands are less prevalent in the lower extremities of diabetic patients, this mechanism may contribute to the differences in the microbiota observed in our study. Defective sweat glands and low levels of dermcidin may contribute to atopic dermatitis [38, 40] and may be part of the pathogenesis of diabetic skin infections. Further investigation of the pathogenesis of the cutaneous microbial composition may provide a link between the functions of antimicrobial peptides and the resident microbiota in diseases such as diabetes.",

A few of the strengths of our study were that we analyzed a cohort of single-sex (ie, male) veterans, who were well matched, that all samples were taken by the same researcher who followed a consistent protocol, and that our control population was similar to previously reported controls in the literature in terms of microbial composition and quantitation [10, 11, 43]. The sampling occurred over a number of months, and there was a trend toward more cases being recruited during warmer months of the study. This limitation in the study may curtail interpretation of the correlations that we observe. However, the overall diversity at the forearm of the diabetic subjects and controls remained similar, which indicates that the differences may indeed reflect the effects of diabetes on pedal microbial populations, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of wound infections.",
