Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to use a deep-sequencing approach to identify the effect of smoking on the peri-implant microbiome in states of health and disease. Peri-implant biofilm samples were collected from 80 partially edentulous subjects with peri-implant health, peri-implant mucositis, and peri-implantitis. Bacterial DNA was isolated and 16S ribsomal RNA gene libraries sequenced using 454-pyrosequencing targeting the V1 to V3 and V7 to V9 regions. In total, 790,692 classifiable sequences were compared against the HOMD database for bacterial identification. Community-level comparisons were carried out using UniFrac and nonparametric tests. Microbial signatures of health in smokers exhibited lower diversity compared to nonsmokers, with significant enrichment for disease-associated species. Shifts from health to mucositis were accompanied by loss of several health-associated species, leading to a further decrease in diversity. Peri-implantitis did not differ significantly from mucositis in species richness or evenness. In nonsmokers, by contrast, the shift from health to mucositis resembled primary ecological succession, with acquisition of several species without replacement of pioneer organisms, thereby creating a significant increase in diversity. Again, few differences were detected between peri-implantitis and mucositis. Thus, our data suggest that smoking shapes the peri-implant microbiomes even in states of clinical health, by supporting a pathogen-rich community. In both smokers and nonsmokers, peri-implant mucositis appears to be a pivotal event in disease progression, creating high-at-risk-for-harm communities. However, ecological succession follows distinctly divergent pathways in smokers and nonsmokers, indicating a need for personalized therapeutics for control and prevention of disease in these 2 cohorts.",

Studies have reported that peri-implant mucositis occurs in 50% to 90% of implants, while 20% of implants with an average function time of 5 to 11 y develop peri-implantitis (Roos-Jansaker et al. 2006; Zitzmann and Berglundh 2008; Mombelli et al. 2012).",

Taken together with the higher rates of tooth loss in smokers (Salvi et al. 2014), this suggests that these individuals represent a high-need, high-risk cohort for implant therapy.

Exclusion criteria included diabetes; pregnancy; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); use of immunosuppressant medications, bisphosphonates, or steroids; antibiotic therapy or oral prophylactic procedures within the past 3 mo; need for antibiotic coverage before dental treatment; and fewer than 20 teeth present in the dentition.

A diagnosis of implant health and disease was made according to the criteria delineated by the Consensus Report of the Sixth European Workshop of Periodontology (Lindhe and Meyle 2008). Briefly, peri-implant health (20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) was diagnosed when the peri-implant crevice demonstrated no bleeding on probing (BOP), redness, and suppuration and the implant demonstrated radiographic evidence of less than 2 mm of marginal bone loss after being at least 1 y in function. Implants with only clinical signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, BOP, suppuration) and absence of radiographic bone loss following loading were classified as peri-implant mucositis (10 smokers and 10 nonsmokers), whereas implants with the presence of both clinical inflammation and radiographic evidence of more than 2 mm bone loss since the prosthesis installation were diagnosed as peri-implantitis cases (10 smokers and 10 nonsmokers).

Briefly, a single-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with broad-range universal primers and 22 cycles of amplification was used to amplify the 16S rRNA genes as well as to introduce adaptor sequences and sample-specific barcode oligonucleotide tags into the DNA. Two regions of the 16S rRNA genes were sequenced: V1 to V3 (spanning Escherichia coli 16S gene regions 8\u201327 and 519\u2013536) and V7 to V9 (spanning E. coli 16S gene regions 1099\u20131114 and 1528\u20131541). The primers used for sequencing have been previously described (Kumar, Brooker, et al. 2011). Adaptor sequences were trimmed from sequences with an average quality score of 25 and sequences binned into individual sample collections based on barcode sequence tags, which were then trimmed. Sequences <200 bp were discarded, and the rest were clustered into species-level operational taxonomic units (s-OTUs) at 97% sequence similarity and assigned a taxonomic identity by alignment to the HOMD database (Chen et al. 2010) using the Blastn algorithm. Analyses were conducted using the QIIME pipeline (Caporaso et al. 2010), as well as our own internally developed analysis pipeline (Dabdoub et al., PhyloToAST: Bioinformatics tools for species-level analysis and visualization of complex microbial communities, manuscript submitted), available at http://github.com/smdabdoub/phylotoast.

The data are available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information\u2019s sequence read archive (SRR192 1025). Figure 1A shows the diversity (Chao) and Chao estimate of shared species in the health-associated peri-implant microbiomes of smokers and nonsmokers. Smokers had a significantly lower diversity and shared greater numbers of species than did nonsmokers (P < 0.05, Welch ANOVA). The Table shows the distribution of sequences in healthy implants of smokers and nonsmokers by s-OTUs. In total, 166 of the 486 health-associated s-OTUs were different between smokers and nonsmokers (P < 0.05, Welch ANOVA assuming unequal variances); 79 species, notably those belonging to the genera Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Treponema, Propionibacterium, and Pseudomonas, demonstrated higher abundances in smokers, while 77 species, especially those belonging to Streptococcus, Selenomonas, and Porphyromonas, were elevated in nonsmokers. The core microbiome (species shared by at least 75% of individuals) of peri-implant health in smokers and nonsmokers is shown in Figure 1B. Both smokers and nonsmokers exhibited a core peri-implant microbiome comprising 13% of the 486 species; 34 species were common to both smokers and nonsmokers, 19 species were unique to smokers, and 12 were unique to nonsmokers.",

The microbial profiles of smokers exhibited significant clustering based on health or disease association (P < 0.05, ADONIS). Figure 3B shows the alpha diversity associated with peri-implant health, mucositis, and implantitis in smokers. Both mucositis and implantitis were associated with a significantly lower diversity than health; however, only mucositis was statistically significant (P < 0.0001, Tukey HSD). The Table shows the distribution of sequences by species in smokers. The greatest differences in abundances were observed between health and implantitis or health and mucositis (P < 0.05, Tukey HSD). Fewer differences were observed between mucositis and implantitis. Figure 3C shows the unique species acquired in each state; 44 species were unique to periodontal health, while 15 species were uniquely found in mucositis and only 6 in implantitis. Furthermore, two-thirds of the core microbiome in smokers demonstrated a change in either abundance or frequency during shifts to disease.",

                    "text": "The oral cavity hosts a complex microbial ecosystem, with several habitat-specific communities. Several studies have shown that the tooth surface, the subgingival crevice, and the oral mucosa each host distinct microbial communities (Human Microbiome Project 2012; Socransky and Haffajee 2005). With the rising popularity of dental implants, a significant fraction of the population now has a new oral habitat for bacterial colonization. Our previous work has shown that dental implants, although functionally similar to the tooth, provide a distinct ecological niche for microbial colonization (Kumar et al. 2012; Dabdoub et al. 2013). The purpose of the present investigation was to characterize the peri-implant microbiome in health and disease in current and never smokers by combining a case-control study design with a high-throughput, deep-sequencing methodology and computational phylogenetics. The results provided a new insight into the shifts that occur in these ecological niches during transitions from health to disease and suggest that peri-implant mucositis may create an at-risk-for-harm microbial community.",

                    "text": "We have previously demonstrated that smoking is associated with pathogen-rich subgingival microbial communities even in states of clinical periodontal health (Kumar, Matthews, et al. 2011; Mason et al. 2014). In the present investigation, we examined the effect of smoking on the peri-implant microbiome using 2 analytical approaches. We initially examined the difference in abundances of species between 20 clinically healthy nonsmokers and 20 smokers. The peri-implant microbiome of smokers exhibited a significantly lower diversity than did nonsmokers (Fig. 1A) and was enriched for species traditionally regarded as periodontal and/or systemic pathogens, including those belonging to the genera Capnocytophaga, Treponema, Propionibacterium, Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, and Leptotrichia (Table). These results are very similar to those seen in our investigation of subgingival microbiota (Mason et al. 2014). Especially intriguing is the presence of Lactobacilli, Propionibacteria, and Rothia exclusively in smokers. While Lactobacilli were detected in 45% to 60% of samples, Propionibacterium propionicus was found in the core microbiome of smokers. Propionibacteria have been found in several periprosthetic joint infections (Achermann et al. 2014) and are increasingly being implicated in the etiology of failing shoulder and knee implants, as well as neurosurgical shunts and endodontic infections (Portillo et al. 2013). It is long known that Lactobacilli and Propionibacteria share a nutritional symbiosis (Liu and Moon 1982). It is possible that this cooperativity contributes to the persistence of Propionibacteria in the peri-implant sulcus and predisposes it to future disease. Rothia aeria and Rothia mucilaginosa have been implicated in prosthetic hip and knee infections, and it has been suggested that oral habitats may play a role in predisposing susceptible individuals to infections elsewhere in the body (Verrall et al. 2010; Mahobia et al. 2013). While these events are biologically plausible, there is currently no evidence to suggest this as a pathogenic mechanism and warrants further investigation.",

We defined the core peri-implant microbiome as that which is found in 75% or more of individuals. This is a far more conservative approach than that used by other investigations (Human Microbiome Project 2012; Abusleme et al. 2013) and ensured that the species under investigation were truly representative of the peri-implant microbiome. The core peri-implant microbiome of both smokers and nonsmokers comprised 65 species, which represented a mere 13% of the health-compatible peri-implant microbiome, typifying the great interindividual variability in oral bacterial communities. However, while smokers and nonsmokers shared 34 species, they differed by 31. The data indicate that while there exists a core microbiome composed of species that are most suited to the peri-implant habitat, smoking modifies this environment.",

To understand how these communities were different, we first examined changes in microbial diversity associated with shifts in health status. Diversity did not change from health to disease (Fig. 2B). Since diversity is a measure of both species richness (number of species) and evenness (abundance of each species), we compared relative abundances of community members (community structure) as well as the loss and gain of species (community membership). Shift from health to mucositis was associated with a decrease in the abundance of a few species (Table), loss of certain others, and, most important, gain of several new species (Fig. 2C). Thus, the similar diversities in health and mucositis were attributable to 2 entirely different phenomena; while health was associated with higher abundances of fewer species, mucositis was characterized by a decrease in abundances and loss of a few health-associated species, along with acquisition of several new members. Thus, a key event in the development of mucositis appears to be an increase in community membership. These new species demonstrated heterogeneity in their prevalence among different individuals, and the core microbiome associated with peri-implant health remained unaffected. However, an important observation was that species acquired in mucositis persisted into implantitis; implantitis was similar to mucositis both in species richness and evenness. The results thus suggest that peri-implant mucositis may be a key event in the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. It is important to investigate this hypothesis with prospective studies.",

This microbiome became further reduced during the shift from health to mucositis, with loss of several species belonging to the core microbiome (Fig. 3B, \u200b,CC and Table). A similar observation has been previously reported in the subgingival microbiome of smokers in periodontal health and disease (Bizzarro et al. 2013; Mason et al. 2014). Thus, in smokers, 2 important events were evident in the transition from health to disease: not only did the process of pathogen enrichment observed in health continue into disease, but also the species that were being replaced were similar between individuals. Very few species were acquired between mucositis and implantitis, suggesting that the pathogen-rich state established in mucositis persists in implantitis.",
