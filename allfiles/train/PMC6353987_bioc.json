Incidence of T1D cannot be fully explained by genetic background, and environmental factors have been assumed to play a role. Environmental conditions and composition of human microbiome have been found to correlate with the incidence of T1D. We asked whether mothers\u2019 prevalent vaginal microbiome could correlate with the incidence of T1D in child. To test this hypothesis, we collected samples of vaginal microbiomes from eight mothers that had at least one child with T1D (child age maximum of 11 years at the time of sampling), born with a vaginal delivery. Eight control mothers had child/children with vaginal delivery and no diabetic child/children. The microbiomes were studied by using 16S rRNA Ion Torrent high throughput sequencing. We found that composition of total and Lactobacillus microbiome was altered, and saw an indication that diversity of vaginal microbiomes of the mothers with a diabetic child could be higher. Based on these pilot observations, we strongly encourage a larger population study to verify whether mother vaginal microbiome diversity and composition are linked to the prevalence of T1D in children.",

Potential changes in diversity of T1D mother vaginal microbiomes were linked with alteration in the community of the dominant bacterial genus Lactobacillus37. Different Lactobacillus community, and decreased dominance of Lactobacillus in the vaginal bacterial flora may be linked to the more diverse microbial community in T1D mothers. In the gut microbiota, especially L. johnsonii abundance has been found to correlate negatively with the incidence of diabetes in a rat model40,41. De Goffau et al. reported increased microbial diversity in the gut of diabetic children (over 2.9 years) compared to non-diabetic children42, although it is known that in the late progression phase of T1D in humans, the gut microbiome becomes more monotonous4. The amount of Lactobacilli in the vagina is related to production of lactic acid and vaginal pH37,39,43,44.",

However, temporal variation related to menstrual cycle, sexual activity and gestation have been found37,39,44. Therefore, factors such as mother age, age at birth of child/children, stage of menstrual cycle and information about the sexual activity should be controlled in the future studies. In contrast to earlier studies (e.g. Cho & Blaser)22, Drell et al. recently found that vaginal microbiome of the mother and the child microbiome (e.g. child gut microbiome) do not correlate with each other although they share same bacterial taxa31. There may thus also be other than microbiome-related mechanisms between increased risk of the child to get T1D than mother vaginal microbiome.",

More detailed research on the potential connection between the mother vaginal microbiome and the child T1D is therefore of major importance. We also suggest that vaginal seeding of neonates born by cesarean section45 should be applied with caution until we know whether a vaginal microbiome could pose a health risk related to T1D or other more common disease46. We emphasize that our results should be treated as indicative, and they need to be verified by a more extensive population study; especially with a more thorough background information collected from the study units (mothers), the age of child/children, and antibiotic treatments controlled.",

The Ion Torrent sequences were processed and analyzed with QIIME using state-of-the-art procedures47. Briefly, the sequences were binned according to sample-specific barcodes using the QIIME split_libraries.py tool, after which the barcode and primer sequences were trimmed and filtered for quality using the default parameters. Chimeric sequences were removed with the Usearch quality-filtering tool in QIIME using the rRNA16S.gold.fasta reference database. The final dataset consisted of 251 431 reads from 4\u2009\u00d7\u20098 (32) samples after filtering out low-quality and chimeric readings, with a median of 7,612 reads per sample. The sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) employing a similarity threshold of 97% in an RDP Naive Bayesian Classifier. The OTUs represent taxonomic units based on differences between sequences of bacterial DNA data. The total number of OTUs serves as an estimate of the total number of bacterial species in the sample but is not an exact equivalent of the number of different microbiological species. The phylogenetic trees were constructed from NAST-trimmed aligned sequences in FastTree248. The OTU table was constructed using the Biom formatted table in QIIME v1.9 and all the samples were rarefied to 4300 sequences prior the OTU-based analysis, as it was the lowest number of readings observed in the community. Taxonomy was assigned using gut-specific microbiome HITdb49. We have deposited the raw Ion Torrent data in NCBI-SRA with the accession number SRP132770. Chao1, Shannon and Simpson indices were used to estimate the diversity of the microbiome. Data is available from the corresponding author on request.",

Statistical analysis was conducted using a linear mixed effects model with the total OTU relative abundance, Chao1, Simpson and Shannon diversity indices as the dependent variables, and the mother group (control or with a T1D child) as an explanatory factor. The swab type was used as a random factor in the analyses and mother was used as an additional random factor (by nesting swab within mother) for OTU relative abundance and diversity indices. We carried out non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the statistical test by PERMANOVA (functions metaMDS and adonis is package vegan 2.3.550) analysis for the bacterial communities, both for relative abundance and presence/absence data. The fit of the statistical models was confirmed by using diagnostic plots51 and suitable transformation/s were carried out for the dependent variable when appropriate.
