In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), the gastrointestinal mucosa is damaged, and colonizing bacteria are impacted, leading to an impaired intestinal microbiota with reduced diversity. We examined the impact of intestinal diversity on subsequent mortality outcomes following transplantation. Fecal specimens were collected from 80 recipients of allo-HSCT at the time of stem cell engraftment. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were characterized, and microbial diversity was estimated using the inverse Simpson index. Subjects were classified into high, intermediate, and low diversity groups and assessed for differences in outcomes. Mortality outcomes were significantly worse in patients with lower intestinal diversity; overall survival at 3 years was 36%, 60%, and 67% for low, intermediate, and high diversity groups, respectively (P = .019, log-rank test). Low diversity showed a strong effect on mortality after multivariate adjustment for other clinical predictors (transplant related mortality: adjusted hazard ratio, 5.25; P = .014). In conclusion, the diversity of the intestinal microbiota at engraftment is an independent predictor of mortality in allo-HSCT recipients. These results indicate that the intestinal microbiota may be an important factor in the success or failure in allo-HSCT.",

Characteristics of patients within each of the diversity groups differed in terms of relative distribution. Patients with lower bacterial diversity were likely to have received conditioning regimens of greater intensity compared with those with higher bacterial diversity. In examining each individual element comprising the conditioning regimens, we found no evidence that this association was due to any 1 particular drug or to total body irradiation (supplemental Table 2); rituximab was associated with higher diversity but was exclusively given in nonmyeloablative regimens. Patients who developed acute kidney injury, received any of several antibiotics (intravenous vancomycin, metronidazole, \u03b2-lactams), or were diagnosed with C difficile infection more frequently fell into the low diversity group. Underlying disease, pretransplant morbidity, and time to engraftment were not different by Fisher\u2019s exact test, but still demonstrated distributional differences suggestive of some degree of association with microbial diversity.",

Overall survival was significantly different between the 3 diversity groups (P = .019), where subjects with lower intestinal diversity were more likely to die. Estimated overall survival at 3 years was 67% for the high diversity group, 60% for the intermediate diversity group, and 36% for the low diversity group. Similar differences between diversity groups were found for transplant-related mortality (P = .003), where estimated transplant mortality at 3 years was 9% for the high diversity group, 23% for the intermediate diversity group, and 53% for the low diversity group. Findings were similar if microbial diversity was estimated using Shannon index, an alternative measure to the inverse Simpson (supplemental Figure 1). Further analysis using the end point of death due to GVHD or infection also showed significant differences between the diversity groups; in contrast, we did not find significant associations between diversity and death due to relapse or progression (supplemental Figure 2).",

Microbial diversity at engraftment was significantly associated with increased risk of death from any cause. In particular, patients with low diversity were approximately 3 times more likely to die within the follow-up period compared with those with higher microbial diversity. This effect remained significant in the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for pretransplant comorbidity, disease risk, and antibiotic administration (intravenous vancomycin, fluoroquinolones, and \u03b2-lactams). Other variables that were found to be independently associated with overall survival were disease risk and fluoroquinolone administration. Further analysis showed microbial diversity to be an independent predictor of transplant-related mortality as well, with a higher estimated magnitude of association compared with that of overall survival (Table 3). Not surprisingly, 1 difference between models for these 2 outcomes was that disease risk was predictive of overall survival but not transplant-related mortality. The follow-up and outcomes are depicted individually for each subject in Figure 2. Of the 36 deaths, 21 (58%) were transplant related and 15 (42%) were due to relapse or progression of disease. Transplant-related deaths were frequently due to GVHD or infection and were more frequent in patients with low microbiota diversity. We did not observe any evidence of censoring bias. As inverse Simpson diversity decreased, the corresponding taxonomic composition of the fecal microbiota appeared less complex, with fewer distinct members. In subjects with lower diversity, the microbiota was generally dominated by a single bacterial genus. Dominating genera included Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia and Kluyvera), and Lactobacillus. These bacterial taxa were also observed in a prior report characterizing the microbiota of this allo-HSCT patient cohort.3",

Furthermore, a stronger association was observed with death due to transplant-related causes, with no discernible association with mortality arising from relapse or progression of disease, suggesting that lack of microbial diversity is primarily linked to transplant-related deaths such as infection and GVHD. We reanalyzed these data using a series of pairwise models containing diversity and each of the other clinical variables; results remained unchanged, and diversity continued to demonstrate strong independent effects (data not shown).",

Although there is some debate, some studies have suggested that the individual microbiota can be categorized into enterotypes based on microbial composition.17,18 The composition of the intestinal microbiota has been implicated in several areas of human disease. A recent study found that patients with new onset rheumatoid arthritis harbor an intestinal microbiota with a higher frequency of Prevotellaceae, a family of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria that defines 1 of the 3 enterotypes.17,19,20 Other studies have demonstrated that microbiota composition influences malnutrition and the development of kwashiorkor,21 development of obesity,22 and metabolism of orally ingested drugs.23 Some members of the microbiota induce development of Th17 cells, which contribute to antimicrobial defense but also contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, whereas other microbes produce short-chain fatty acids and contribute to the development of regulatory T cells and intestinal tolerance.24,25 Older studies have demonstrated that a healthy microbiota enhances resistance to infection by intestinal pathogens through the poorly understood process of colonization resistance.26,27 Given the broad impact of an intact intestinal microbiota on human health, it is perhaps not surprising that the loss of microbiota diversity can result in increased mortality. The relevance and impact of an abnormal intestinal gut flora has been described in a variety of disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, C difficile infection, obesity, and many others.28-31",

Moreover, adverse events following allo-HSCT do not occur independently of one another; associations have been observed between separate complications such as C difficile infection and gut GVHD37,38 or GVHD and adenovirus infections,39 which suggests that these overlapping gastrointestinal complications may be symptoms of a more central disorder.",

Interpretation of these results may be not straightforward, because many antibiotics may have been confounded by the situation they were given in. In this study, patients were given antibiotics for a variety of purposes, such as infectious prophylaxis of a specific subpopulation, or treatment that could either be targeted or empiric. In many cases, antibiotics were not directly associated after multivariate adjustment for other allo-HSCT factors. Interestingly, in the case of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, administration was associated with mortality in the unadjusted analysis but was not in the multivariate model that included microbial diversity, particularly for transplant-related mortality. It is possible that intestinal diversity serves as a causal mediator of \u03b2-lactam administration, where the microbial impact of \u03b2-lactams is encapsulated by intestinal diversity, which lies on the causal pathway to death. We surmise that the cumulative effects of several preceding adverse factors such as antibiotics and conditioning regimen intensity on the intestinal microbiota may be summarized by microbial diversity.",

As a known predictor of transplant-related mortality, the HCT-CI is presumably mediated by a number of transplant related complications. In this case, it could be that patients with underlying comorbidities are most likely to suffer derangements of the intestinal microbiota that lead to decreased microbial diversity, and subsequently, death.",

Although it may not be entirely certain, we suspect the differences in diversity observed with each antibiotic may be partly explained by its degree of antianaerobic activity. Fluoroquinolones have previously been shown to impact diversity,42 but likely to a lesser degree than antibiotics with broad activity against obligate anaerobic bacteria. In our prior work, we found that fluoroquinolone administration decreased colonization by Proteobacteria, a phylum that includes oxygen-tolerant gram-negative pathogens such as the Enterobactericeae and Pseudmonas, but which exists as a minor population in the absence of antibiotic-mediated microbiota perturbation. Intravenous vancomycin was also significantly associated with decreased diversity; administration of intravenous vancomycin can result in some biliary excretion, although prolonged exposure is usually required, and there is significant interpatient variability in vancomycin levels in the gut.43 We suspect that the vancomycin/diversity association is confounded by the fact that it is frequently given concurrently with \u03b2-lactams, which readily access the gut lumen and significantly alter the intestinal microbiota. Although diversity provides one measure of microbiota health, identification of more specific microbial alterations might provide insight into the mechanisms of specific transplant complications. In our explorative analysis of microbial composition, we identified Lachnospiraceae and Actinomycetaceae as commensal members that were associated with survival. Both families of bacteria commonly inhabit the human intestinal tract under normal circumstances. Specifically, other studies have identified Lachnospiraceae bacteria as potential promoters of gut health; for instance, Lachnospiraceae have been shown to have protective effects against C difficile infection in preclinical studies.44,45 In contrast, we found Enterobacteriaceae and other gram-negative bacteria from the Proteobacteria phylum to be positively correlated with death. Although some Proteobacteria are pathogens, it is not clear whether Proteobacteria contribute directly to death or simply emerge as a result of diversity loss or intestinal inflammation. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that products of host inflammation can enhance the growth of bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family.46",

Limiting exposure to antibiotics that destroy obligate anaerobic bacterial populations of the intestine may reduce untoward microbial disruptions. Replenishment of commensal bacterial populations that are lost during transplantation, through fecal microbiota transplantation or targeted restoration of specific beneficial bacteria, may also improve outcomes. These approaches should be evaluated carefully; although we have shown the intestinal microbiota to be highly predictive of mortality, independent of other clinical factors, it still remains to be seen if this relationship is directly causal. Ultimately, controlled interventional studies are needed to define the full extent to which the intestinal microbiota contributes to the outcome of allo-HSCT.",
