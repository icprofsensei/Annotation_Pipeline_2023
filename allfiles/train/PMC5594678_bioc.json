Analyzing cumulative sequence data from 1,351 blood samples collected from 188 patients enabled us to assemble 7,190 contiguous regions (contigs) larger than 1 kbp, of which 3,761 are novel with little or no sequence homology in any existing databases. The vast majority of these novel contigs possess coding sequences, and we have validated their existence both by finding their presence in independent experiments and by performing direct PCR amplification. When their nearest neighbors are located in the tree of life, many of the organisms represent entirely novel taxa, showing that microbial diversity within the human body is substantially broader than previously appreciated.",

It is not only human cells that shed their nucleic acids into the blood: DNA from plant-based foods has been detected (15), and other life forms such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi release their DNA and RNA into the blood, a phenomenon which has been exploited to determine the presence of infectious disease (12, 16) and to measure alterations of the virome due to pharmacological immunosuppression (17). There are roughly an order of magnitude more nonhuman cells than nucleated human cells in the body (18, 19); combining this observation with the average genome sizes of a human, bacterium, and virus (Gb, Mb, and kb, respectively) suggests that approximately 1% of DNA by mass in a human is derived from nonhost origins. Previous studies by us and others have shown that indeed approximately 1% of cfDNA sequences appear to be of nonhuman origin, but only a small fraction of these map to existing databases of microbial and viral genomes (16). This suggests that there is a vast diversity of as yet uncharacterized microbial diversity within the human microbiome and that this diversity can be analyzed through \u201cunmappable\u201d sequencing reads.",

Of these putatively nonhuman reads, only approximately 1% could be identified in a curated microbiome database of almost 8,000 species of known bacteria, viruses, fungi, and eukaryotic pathogens (Fig. 1B, Left). This miniscule fraction of reads encompasses the known microbiome. Less than 1,800 known species (800 known genera) are observed across all samples. The rarefaction curve of species prevalence quickly plateaus, and the species abundance distribution has only a slight positive skew (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). These both indicate that the number of known species we measure has saturated (20), and deeper or broader sequencing of cfDNA from humans is unlikely to substantially increase the richness of known species.",

The construction of assemblies used an iterative approach (Fig. 1E, Top). Nonhuman reads were assembled on a per-sample basis, and reads that aligned to low-complexity or human-derived contigs were removed. This process of assembly and cleaning was repeated for remaining reads, pooled first by patient and then by cohort, and resulted in a total assembly of 40 Mbp. Over 25 megabases of low complexity or residual human-derived contigs were removed (15% of reads) (Fig. 1A, Right), many of which were identified as human microsatellites or primate BAC/FOSMID clones (Dataset S1). The iterative assembly process captures more reads in each stage as the number of reads pooled together increases (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). The cohort assemblies constructed 7,190 contigs larger than 1 kbp and 131 larger than 10 kbp. Compared with the proportion of reads that map to known organisms, an order-of-magnitude greater fraction of reads map to the cohort assemblies (Fig. 1B, Right).",

S3 and S4; i.e., BLAST alignments span less than 20% of bases and an average gene identity of less than 60%). Application of these filters results in the selection of 4,354 contigs over 1 kbp. Two additional steps removed contigs that have homologies in expanded microbiome sequence databases. First, we aligned all assemblies from phases II and III of the HMP and blacklisted the 47 contigs that had matches. As many of the HMP assemblies are of previously known organisms or had been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide (nt) database, the BLAST coverage filter encompasses most of the HMP-filtered contigs (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The second filter used the web service Onecodex (21) to remove contigs with homologies in their database.",

Alignments between contigs from different levels created a graph structure, allowing us to investigate the additive structure derived from pooling more samples together. Under ideal circumstances, contigs assembled at lower stages should be wholly contained at higher stages and they should not end up orphaned (i.e., having no homology to a later stage\u2019s contig). Only 3,301 of the 25,765 sample contigs (over 500 bp, nonhuman, not low-complexity) are orphaned, compared with the patient contigs. Over 3,000 of these are from single-end read samples and are ignored by the assembler at later stages, as the longer paired-end reads tend to be more informative. The patient-orphaned contigs mostly had high BLAST coverages (10,768 of 15,321 had coverage >20%) and encompassed the following genera most frequently: Lactobacillus (5,975), Streptococcus (1,449), Saccharomyces (1,315), Leuconostoc (1,051), and Lactococcus (610). Likewise to the sample-to-patient case, the vast majority of the remaining contigs (>85%) derive from patients who only have single-end sequencing. If we look in the other direction, i.e., at the lower contigs contained within the novel contigs, the majority of them derive from a single patient\u2019s assembly (with some reads recruited from others), and only 387 were not assembled at any lower stages. The increased complexity of assembling due to more pooling does not appear to reduce the power to assemble what is present or to produce strong evidence of chimeric sequences. The consistency of the novel microbiome was further analyzed by calculating the similarity between longitudinal samples from the same patients. Times within approximately 3 mo tend to be highly correlated before the observed contigs start to diverge.",

As the fragmented nature of cfDNA prevents the amplification of large fragments, we designed primers against numerous short (60\u2013100 bp) templates. Sequencing libraries known to express the templates targeted were used as positive controls (fifth column in SI Appendix, Fig. S8). Eight primers for a novel TTV (LT_node_191) and nine primers from unrooted contigs (HT220, HT552, HT76, PR78) were tested (Dataset S3). One of the eight patients had evidence at both time points for four templates from the TTVs, and three additional patients had evidence for one TTV-derived template (Fig. 2). None of the unrooted templates were seen in these samples. This was not surprising, as the median of the maximum number of reads of the unrooted contigs in the samples is 21; in contrast, the TTVs have a median value of 180 reads observed. Only through sequencing many foreign molecules from hundreds of samples were the unrooted contigs (and other novel ones) able to be found.",

This, coupled with the fact that many of the sequences are viral-like, led us to conclude that a taxonomic classification based on 16S rRNA sequences is unfeasible. Thus, the taxonomic position was estimated based on choosing the lowest common ancestor of the majority of genes with homology, based on the gene\u2019s taxonomic assignment from alignment. For known contigs, this method agrees with the best nucleotide alignment of a contig at the species level over 85% of the time (94% accurate at genus level), indicating the suitability of this approach for taxonomic classification. Contigs with both bacterial and phage genes had their taxonomic placement refined by ignoring the phage genes if that made the assignment more specific. To visualize the taxonomic diversity, a \u201csolar system\u201d was constructed for all novel contigs (Fig. 3). Individual dots are contigs, with the rings representing the taxonomic levels; their radial position within the ring is proportional to the average gene identity (inner is high, outer is low), and the angular position is dependent on the superkingdom or phylum to which the contig was assigned. The 844 yellow contigs placed on the outermost ring cannot confidently be placed in any superkingdom based on gene homology because for almost all of them the predicted genes have no known homology. Over two thirds of sequences appear to be bacterial; the majority of these are most similar to proteobacteria. Most longer contigs (>5 kb) are bacterial or prophage-like and can only be placed at the phylum or superkingdom levels.",

An adaptive boosting classifier trained on known genes allowed us to bin all except 16 of the unrooted contigs into single or multiple superkingdoms (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). The vast majority (n = 640) are bacteria, and, similarly to the rooted contigs, many others (n = 87) have viral and bacterial genes and are treated as phage or prophages. There are hints that horizontal gene transfer across superkingdoms may be prevalent in biological dark matter, with 106 unrooted contigs having diverse sets of genes. Despite this substantial taxonomic distance from known species, we were able to consistently assign the novel contigs to taxonomic locations on the tree of life.",

Although the divergent and known contigs are fewer in number, they are much more precisely placed, both in their taxonomic level and their average gene identity (reflected in the points being placed closer to the rank rings in the solar system). As more sequences are identified or classified, we expect many of the novel contigs in the outer orbitals to be attracted toward the center. The novel contigs are not restricted to individual samples or patients and most appear ubiquitously across the cohort populations. Each novel contig is observed in a median of 51 patients, and the median number of novel contigs observed in each patient is 924 (also see histograms in SI Appendix, Figs. S16 and S17). Even though elements of the human microbiome have been well-studied by deep sequencing from particular body sites, it is evident that other niches accessed by plasma contribute substantial novel diversity, which we report here for the first time.",

Distinguishing between a phage and its bacterial host is difficult with short sequences, as they both are prone to incorporate each other\u2019s genes. Indeed, of the 523 contigs containing phage genes, 333 also have bacterial genes. Nonetheless, identifying these is important, as the contigs with the most predicted genes are all phage or prophage candidates. Half of the genes have no homology for the top 15 such contigs, with some (HT_node_2, HT_node_16, cluster_12) having over three quarters of genes without matches. Of the identified genes, their closest homologies are commonly hypothetical proteins. These two facts conspire to make functional annotation unfeasible at this time. The nonhypothetical genes present on the phage contigs include DNA primases, phage-tail proteins, terminases, capsid proteins, and DNA polymerases I and III. Many of their bacterial genes are from species within the proteobacteria phylum, with some from actinobacteria (HT_node_11, LT_node_6) or containing genes from a flavobacterium (bacteroides phylum) phage. Additional sequences were searched for in the recently published global virome from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) (4). Only 21 of the unmerged contigs had matches over 50% of their lengths, and these derived from just six of JGI\u2019s scaffolds. Three of these are from Coloradan soil samples, one each from a wastewater bioreactor, a freshwater lake, and the upper troposphere. Our contigs matching to these are mostly best assigned as a cyanobacteria phage or unclassified Siphoviridae. The phage-like contigs were highly prevalent across patients and exhibited only minor clustering by cohort (SI Appendix, Fig. S18). These phages are likely to be associated with bacteria in the background microbial flora. Given that these contigs are observed ubiquitously in our data (77\u2013287 samples) and seen in the JGI data only in a few exotic environments, we hypothesize that they are bona fide members of the human virome, and their presence in the JGI data is due to coincident discovery of related environmental species.",

Their detection here represents another validation of the taxonomic assignment based on gene homology. A phylogenetic tree was built using these contigs along with reference sequences from previously characterized anelloviruses (Fig. 5). Both reference and de novo assembled contigs can be clustered into three distinct classes: a class of nonhuman infecting reference anelloviruses (green), a set of novel anelloviruses that have only 35\u201348% sequence similarity with any reference sequence (yellow), and the rest, which we identify as new species or subspecies of existing TTVs. This work has almost doubled the total number of anelloviruses found in humans, including a new potential genus of human-infecting anelloviruses. Therefore, assembly-based metagenomic methods can uncover vast amounts of prevalent diversity even in known viral families with numerous reference sequences.",

Nonhuman reads were grouped by sample, patient, or cohort and assembled with SPADes (27), gene annotations provided by PRODIGAL (28), and homologies mostly determined using blastn or blastx against the NCBI nt and nonredundant protein (nr) databases. The solar system plot was constructed using the NCBI taxonomy and the ETE3 (29) python package. The anellovirus tree was constructed using FastTree (30) (GTR+CAT model and gamma option). Other cfDNA samples were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive and processed identically to our samples before alignment to the novel contig database.
