Vaginal lactobacilli, through the production of lactic acid, create a vaginal environment characterized by a low pH, and this, in combination with bacteriocins and possibly other components, inhibits the colonization and growth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and reduces the phylogenetic diversity of the vaginal microbiome. In a state of dysbiosis termed bacterial vaginosis (BV), the lactobacilli are depleted and replaced with a polymicrobial, anaerobic microflora that includes Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Sneathia, Prevotella spp, Megasphaera, and others. Although BV is frequently asymptomatic, this dysbiotic state is significantly associated with other clinical complications including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and spontaneous abortion. When BV occurs during pregnancy, it is associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk for preterm birth. This is important because preterm birth accounts for as much as 70% of neonatal mortality, 75% of neonatal morbidity, and nearly 50% of long-term neurologic sequelae. A significant portion of moderate and late preterm births and the majority of very preterm births (<32 weeks) may be attributable to infection and subsequent inflammation and recent microbiome analyses reveal an association between term birth and abundance of healthy lactobacilli and an association between preterm birth and BV-associated bacterial taxa1,2",

Although some studies failed to detect an association, possibly because vitamin D deficiency is low among certain populations, many others and a recent meta-analysis, suggest that vitamin D deficiency increases the rate of preterm birth, particularly early preterm birth3. It plays roles in maintenance of maternal and fetal calcium homeostasis, which is linked to skeletal integrity, in general fetal growth and development, and in the regulation of immune function11,12. There also appears to be a relationship between vitamin D and BV status during pregnancy. Multiple reports describe higher rates of BV among women with insufficient 25(OH)D concentrations (often defined as <20 nmol/L or <30 nmol/L)13\u201315. However, studies in non-pregnant women have yielded conflicting results. One randomized controlled trial that investigated the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in conjunction with metronidazole in eliminating BV in non-pregnant women did not detect a positive effect of vitamin D16 while another study found that vitamin D supplementation was effective in eliminating BV17.",

Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent among people with limited sun exposure and among people with dark skin. Children of African ancestry are more likely than those of European ancestry to experience hypocalcaemic seizures and to develop rickets18. Women of African ancestry are also twice as likely to receive a clinical diagnosis of BV, and analyses of the vaginal microbiota reveal that they are more likely to be colonized by certain BV-associated bacteria19. Furthermore, African American women (though not African-born women) are nearly twice as likely to give birth preterm (<37 weeks gestation) and more than twice as likely to give birth early preterm (<34 weeks)20,21 and vitamin D deficiency has been linked to preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age infants born to women of African ancestry22,23. There is an urgent need to understand and address these important health disparities and an important first step in understanding whether or not the three parameters, vitamin D status, vaginal microbiome, and preterm birth, are linked. As a component of a prospective vitamin D supplementation trial in pregnant women funded by the W. F. F. Kellogg Foundation, referred to as the Kellogg Study, we analyzed a cohort of 230 healthy women and investigated the relationship between plasma 25(OH)D concentrations, the vaginal microbiome, and preterm birth.",

All subjects gave written, informed consent. Women of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds presenting to their obstetrician or midwife at the Medical University of SC (MUSC), Charleston, SC obstetrical facilities within the first 14 weeks after last menstrual period (LMP) with confirmation of a singleton pregnancy were eligible for enrollment in the Kellogg Study. Obstetrical dating was confirmed by early ultrasound by an MUSC obstetrician at the first prenatal visit. In those women with greater than a 2-week discrepancy between dating by LMP and ultrasound, the ultrasound dating was used. Mothers with pre-existing calcium, uncontrolled thyroid disease, parathyroid conditions, or who required chronic diuretic or cardiac medication therapy including calcium channel blockers were excluded. Mothers with pre-existing sickle cell disease (not trait only), sarcoidosis, Crohn\u2019s disease, or ulcerative colitis were also ineligible to participate in the study. In addition, because of the potentially confounding effect of multiple fetuses, mothers with multiple gestations as determined by obstetrical ultrasound, were not eligible for participation in the study. Women who met the entry criteria were approached by the Kellogg Study team for enrollment in the study following their written, informed consent. A sub-group of approximately 100 subjects with known diabetes, hypertension, HIV, or morbid obesity (body mass index > 49) did participate but were subsequently excluded from analysis in the present study as the present study\u2019s focus was on healthy women at the start of pregnancy.",

Interaction terms were included to determine if the effect of gestational age and/or taxa relative abundances on 25(OH)D depend on treatment group. Given the significant association between education level and treatment/control group (see Table 1), education level was also included as a covariate.

For the purpose of this nested study, we analyzed circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and vaginal swab samples that were obtained at visit 1 (baseline; 7.6-15.1 weeks gestation; n=177), visit 4 (21.5-28.3 weeks gestation; n=220), and visit 7 (31.6-40.4 weeks gestation; n=200) from 112 women in the control group and 124 women in the treatment group.

Taxonomic assignments below 0.01% relative abundance were removed and the proportions were re-normalized. Furthermore, bacterial species not present in at least 5% of samples were removed. This protects against features with small mean and trivially large coefficient of variance. Vaginal 16S rRNA gene profiles from all samples were grouped based on total circulating plasma 25(OH)D concentrations of either < 30 ng/mL or > 40 ng/mL. There was no significant association between 25(OH)D concentration and alpha diversity as measured by Shannon index or Inverse Simpson Index (supplementary figure S1a). Principal Coordinates Analysis performed on the bray-curtis dissimilarity distances between samples did not reveal any patterns between plasma 25(OH)D concentration and bacterial species (supplementary figure S1b). When the samples were grouped by dominant taxon, it was apparent, as expected, that women with vaginal microbiome dominated by lactobacilli had lower Nugent scores, overall (Fig 2). Furthermore, it appeared that women with > 40 ng/mL 25(OH)D at the time of sampling had vaginal microbiomes with greater abundance of lactobacilli relative to women with < 30 ng/mL 25(OH)D (Fig 2a, 2b). The microbiomes in this group were 1.6 times, 2.3 times, and 1.5 times as likely to be dominated by the healthy Lactobacillus species L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri (respectively), and 0.2 times as likely to be dominated by the unhealthy BV-associated species G. vaginalis or BVAB1 (Table 2). When separated by ethnicity, the effect appeared to be more pronounced among women of African ancestry (Fig 3).",

We also developed a model to incorporate the mixed effects of treatment group and gestational age, and we analyzed the different ethnic groups separately. Because education differed between the control and treatment groups, education was accounted for in the model. When treatment group and gestational age were fixed, both treatment and gestational age significantly correlated with 25(OH)D concentrations, but the associations between many of the taxa and 25(OH)D were no longer significant, suggesting that covariation of abundance levels with gestational age, treatment group, and/or ethnicity exerted an effect. Despite the covariation, there remained a significant correlation (p = 0.0088) between Megasphaera species and 25(OH)D concentrations among women of African ancestry insofar as women with higher 25(OH)D had less Megasphaera. Among women of European ancestry, a significant interaction between L. crispatus and treatment (p=0.0123) was observed and suggests that the association of L. crispatus with 25(OH)D depends on treatment/control. In particular, among women of European ancestry in the control group, but not the treatment group, total circulating 25(OH)D concentrations correlated positively with abundance of L. crispatus.",

                    "text": "The hypothesis driving this study was that vitamin D status is associated with the vaginal microbiome. Vitamin D could affect the vaginal microbiome through a number of mechanisms. First, it could promote the barrier integrity of the vaginal epithelium. Vitamin D was shown to upregulate genes encoding epithelial cell junction proteins and stimulated proliferation of the vaginal epithelium35,36. Furthermore, two studies found that postmenopausal women receiving vitamin D treatment had increased numbers of superficial vaginal epithelial cells compared to women not receiving treatment, and that this increase was accompanied by decreases in vaginal pH37,38. Together these studies suggest that vitamin D may promote vaginal epithelial cell growth, differentiation, and function, which may increase vaginal thickness to prevent atrophy and improve barrier function. Second, adequate vitamin D during pregnancy may impact the vaginal environment so that it is more supportive of beneficial flora. It is well established that insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis39, and more recently it has been proposed that vitamin D induces insulin synthesis40,41. Vitamin D was also shown to increase the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase, an inhibitor of glycogen synthesis, in adipose tissue42. Therefore there is also a possibility that vitamin D sufficiency alters glucose homeostasis in the vagina to promote increased glycogen deposition. Increased vaginal levels of free glycogen positively correlate with Lactobacillus relative abundance43, and so if vitamin D is indeed promoting vaginal glycogen production, the accompanying increase in lactobacilli and decrease in pH may result in the decreased abundance of pathogenic and BV-associated organisms. A third possibility is that vitamin D influences abundance of BV-associated bacteria through its effects on immune function. Previous studies have shown that vitamin D treatment induces the expression of the LL-37 antimicrobial peptide in keratinocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and bladder and gingival epithelial cells as well as \u03b22 defensin in keratinocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes44\u201346, as well as potentiates the secretion of IL-8 and CXCL10 from airway epithelial cells47. These effects could promote leukocyte recruitment to the vaginal epithelium and modulate the antimicrobial response of leukocytes upon arrival to the tissue48.",

We analyzed 16S rRNA gene survey data to determine whether plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with the vaginal microbiome. Women in both the control (400 IU vitamin D daily) and treatment groups (4 400 IU vitamin D daily) displayed higher circulating 25(OH)D concentrations with increasing gestational age. While initial analyses suggested a substantive association between 25(OH)D and the vaginal microbiome, we found that gestational age was a strong covariate. While multiple studies have shown that the abundances of certain BV-associated bacterial taxa decrease during pregnancy49,50, a correlation with gestational age has not been demonstrated and a report of a longitudinal study suggested that the vaginal microbiome is remarkably constant over the course of pregnancy51. In our study, however, G. vaginalis decreased significantly in abundance between visit 1 (7.6-15.1 weeks), and visit 7 (31.6-40.4 weeks) (Fig 5).",

Specifically, among women of African ancestry, there was a negative correlation between 25(OH)D and abundance of Megasphaera spp.. The majority of reads that were categorized with the genus Megasphaera were Megasphaera Type 1, which we have found in another study (Glascock, Fettweis, manuscript in preparation), to be the most common vaginal type. Detection of Megasphaera by PCR has been shown to accurately predict of BV52 and Megasphaera is associated with bacteria vaginosis and spontaneous preterm delivery53\u201355. Megasphaera has also been linked to genital tract inflammation56 and HIV acquisition among African women57. Among women of European ancestry in the control group, women with higher 25(OH)D concentrations were more likely to have higher abundance of L. crispatus. L. crispatus is a healthy H2O2-producing lactobacillus species that is associated with decreased risk for developing BV and decreased risk for HIV acquisition58,59. Thus, although only two taxa were significantly associated with 25(OH)D, these results suggest that vitamin D could have a positive impact on the vaginal microbiome.",

Most women are not taking a prenatal vitamin or a multivitamin at the start of pregnancy and since most women have limited sunlight exposure or use sunscreen limiting their endogenous synthesis of vitamin D, and because the average American woman is provided ~200 IU vitamin D/day from her diet60, the addition of 400 IU/day results in a slight but measurable increase in 25(OH)D over time.",

In this study, plasma 25(OH)D was the only marker of vitamin D status that was measured; however, maternal 1,25D and other vitamin D metabolites such as 24,25(OH)2D and the 3-epi-25(OH)D could also be important factors. Because the subjects in this cohort were pregnant, plasma 1,25D concentration would be expected to be higher and could influence immune function and the vaginal microbiota. Another limitation was that the relatively small cohort size may not have provided the study with adequate power to detect significant associations between 25(OH)D concentrations and bacterial taxa, particularly in light of other covariates (gestational age, ethnicity, and random treatment group assignment). While all participants in the study provided a blood sample to measure total circulating 25(OH)D, only a subset of those women provided a vaginal sample at the 3 timepoints, which further decreased the sample size. The vaginal microbiome is a complex parameter and consequently, microbiome studies often require large cohorts to detect biologically relevant results. An additional potential confounder is that women who were diagnosed with BV by Nugent score were prescribed treatment, and while treatment occurred after vaginal swab samples were obtained, it could have influenced the composition of the microbiome at subsequent visits.",
