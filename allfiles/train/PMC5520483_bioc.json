They have been associated with gastroenteritis in humans and in pigs but not in other animals. In addition, some strains from pigs, chimpanzees and rodents show close sequence identity with human SaVs thereby suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmissions. Bats are known to be a major reservoir of zoonotic viruses, however, very little is known about the genetic diversity of SaVs in bats. To explore the genetic diversity of bat SaVs, fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus were treated according to the NetoVIR protocol and sequenced by Illumina technology. Nearly complete genome sequences of six highly divergent SaVs and one partial SaV (only VP1 region) were identified in Eidolon helvum and based on sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis, they potentially represent two novel genogroups, only distantly related to known SaVs. Furthermore, comparing these sequences with currently used screening primers and probes indicated that the novel SaVs would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies in humans in case an interspecies transmission would occur. Therefore, we designed and validated new primers that can detect both human and bat SaVs. In this study, we identified multiple novel bat SaVs, however, further epidemiological studies in humans are needed to unravel their potential role in gastroenteritis.",

Since 2002, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has assigned these viruses to the Sapporo virus species, Sapovirus genus, in the family Caliciviridae,3 together with four other genera: Norovirus, Lagovirus, Vesivirus and Nebovirus (www.ictvonline.org/). SaV particles are made up of a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid of 30\u201338 nm in diameter, with typical cup-shaped depressions on the surface.4 Inside the particle resides the positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~7.1\u20137.7\u2009kb with a 3\u2019- poly (A) tail. Generally, SaV genome contains two open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1 encodes for a large polyprotein containing the nonstructural proteins (helicase, VPg, protease, RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp)) followed by the major capsid protein, VP1; ORF2 is predicted to encode for the minor structural protein VP2.5 However, a third ORF has been found in some human6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and bat12 SaV strains, although a known function is yet to be assigned. Until recently, SaVs were classified into five genogroups (GI\u2013GV).13 With the exception of SaV GIII, SaV genogroups were further subdivided in one or multiple genotypes based on the full-length nucleotide (nt) sequence of VP1.2, 13 GI, GII, GIV and GV SaVs are known to infect humans, while GIII infects pigs.10 Recently, more SaVs have been detected in different animal species, and novel genogroups GVI\u2013GXV were proposed on the bases that strains with \u226557% pairwise aa identity of VP1 should be in the same genogroup.14 A number of SaVs from animal hosts, such as chimpanzee15, pig16, 17, 18 and rodents19 have been found to cluster closely with human SaVs in GI, GV and GII, respectively. This clearly indicates the possibility of cross-species transmission of SaVs;20 however, this does not indicate the direction of the interspecies transmission. To further elucidate the zoonotic potential of SaVs, more human and animal samples need to be screened. Bats (order Chiroptera) constitute the second largest group of mammals after the order Rodentia21 and have recently been implicated as a reservoir of many different viruses including some highly pathogenic to humans.22 Little is known about the genetic diversity of SaVs in bats and currently bat SaVs have been described only in two studies conducted in China12 and Hungary.23 The bat SaVs found in these studies were highly divergent from other SaVs known thus far.",

Captured bats were retrieved from the net traps and held in paper sacks for 10\u201315\u2009min, allowing enough time for the production of fresh feces. Sterile disposable spatulas were used to retrieve feces from the paper sacks, and placed into tubes containing 1\u2009mL of universal transport medium (COPAN Diagnostics, Brescia, Italy). Labeled samples were put in ice and then transferred to the Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Biotechnology Unit, University of Buea, Cameroon and stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C. Later on, they were shipped to the Laboratory of Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, Leuven, Belgium and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Each captured bat was assessed to determine species, weight (g), forearm length (mm), sex, reproductive state, and age (adult or juvenile). Parameters such as body temperature, activity, photophobia were not measured. All captured bats were then marked by hair clipping to facilitate identification of recaptures. Trained zoologists used morphological characteristics to determine the species of the bats before they were released. None of the captured animals showed physical signs of disease.",

Hong Kong Hipposideros Pomona bat SaVs (TLC34, TLC39 and TLC58) identified by Tse et al12 shares 99%\u2013100% aa identity among each other, are only 37%\u201342% similar to other SaVs, and were previously assigned to genotype XIV.14 On the other hand, two unpublished Chinese strains, GX2012 (from Rhinolophus sinicus) and JX2010 (from Myotis myotis), are only 50% similar to each other on the aa level while M63 (a Hungarian strain from Myotis daubentonii)23 shares 71% identity (67% nt identity) with JX2010. Therefore, the genotype numbers GXVI and GXVII were tentatively assigned to the strains GX2012, and JX2010 and M63, respectively. The sequences of the seven bat SaVs identified in Cameroon have an aa identity ranging from 31% to 41% (40%\u201349% nt identity) with all other SaVs and only 37%\u201341% (46%\u201348% nt identity) with other bat SaVs. On the basis of sequence similarity, the Cameroonian strains fall into two groups. The first group has two nearly identical pairs: Limbe65 and Limbe899b; Limbe 25 and Limbe 899a (99%\u2013100% nt and aa identity) and between these pairs, there is an aa similarity of 77% (71% nt similarity). The rest of the strains (Limbe900, Lysoka36 and Limbe894) are more closely related to each other, with an aa similarity ranging from 61% to 78% (62%\u201372% nt similarity) among each other. These two groups share only 49%\u201354% aa (53%\u201357% nt) similarity among them.

To answer this question, we compared the frequently used screening primers (SaV124F, SaV1F, SaV5F and SaV1245R) and probes (SaV124TP and SaV5TP)35 with sequences of the novel bat strains (Table 3). It showed that the percentage similarity ranged from 25% to 66.7% for forward primers and 94.7% to 100% for the reverse primers. Considering the probes, the percentage similarity was only 42.9% and 57.1%. These primers and probes are unlikely to pick up SaVs from bats, and therefore we designed novel screening primers based on the RdRP segment of human and bat sequences, to screen both human and bat fecal samples positive for SaVs. The used samples contain human SaVs of genogroup GI.1, GI.3, GII.3, GII.5, GII.6, GIV and GV and the novel putative bat SaVs of genogroups GXVIII and GXIX. As expected, the novel primers detected both human and bat SaVs while the currently used primers detected only human SaVs (Figure 3).",

Due to an increasing interest in bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses and the fact that bat SaVs have only been sporadically reported, there is an eminent need to fully explore bat species for this virus and its zoonotic potential. Here, we collected and metagenomically screened 87 bat samples from fruit bats in Cameroon. SaV reads were present in samples from both juvenile and adult, as well as male and female bats, suggesting that viral presence does not seem to be restricted by either age or sex. We were able to obtain six nearly complete genomes and one capsid protein (VP1) of SaVs in Cameroonian bats, each of which encoded two ORFs. SaVs of genogroup GI, GIV, and GV have been reported to encode a third ORF overlapping the VP1 gene,10, 36 which was also detected in a previous study in bats, although their ORF3 did not overlap with the VP1 of ORF1.12 The fact that the third ORF was not identified in our novel strains and other animal SaVs18 points to the fact that the protein encoded by this ORF in bats and human GV strains might not be mandatory. To ascertain the function of the protein, cell culture propagation, functional and knockout studies are required. Furthermore, the GC content of the newly described bat SaVs falls within the typical GC range of the genus Sapovirus (49.0% to 53.6%). However, SaVs identified previously in Pomona roundleaf bat (Hipposideros pomona) showed a relatively high GC content (up to 60.2%).12 In addition, the overlap of ORF1 and ORF2 in the genome of Lysoka36 (Figure 1D), to the best of our knowledge is novel. This highlights the existence of a high genomic diversity of bat SaVs, although the true diversity is most likely much larger. Further studies are needed to better understand the SaV diversity in bats and other animals.",

Each cluster differs from the other and all other SaV genogroups by at least 40% aa identity and therefore constitute two new genogroups within the SaV genus, tentatively assigned as genogroups GXVIII and GXVIX, respectively. SaV genogroups GI, GII, GIV and GV infect humans while all other SaV genogroups (GIII and GVI\u2013GXVII) have been identified in animals. Phylogenetically, some of the strains isolated from animals are related to human SaVs. Two SaVs (IJC09 and IJC04) isolated from chimpanzees in The Republic of Congo clustered closely with human G1 SaVs. Given that these chimps were living in close contact to humans (in the sanctuary) the authors suggested that there might have been a recent cross-species transmission of these viruses.15 Also three porcine SaV strains (TYMPo239, TYMPo031 and WG194D-1) and one California sea lion SaV were identified independently and are relatively closely related to human SaV GV.14, 32, 33 Lastly, based on the pairwise nt distances between the rodent strain Manhattan/Ro-SaV2 and the closest human SaVs (GII.1 to GII.7), it can be concluded that this rodent strain also belongs to the genogroup GII SaV. This suggests that these human and rat strains have a common origin, most likely reflecting an interspecies transmission event in a (distant) past.19 All these data from animal studies suggest that interspecies transmission of these viruses might have occurred in the past and as a consequence, raise the possibility of circulating animal SaVs strains in humans. Given that the bats we sampled live in closely proximity to humans in the region, there might have been an ample opportunity for such interspecies transmission to occur between bats and humans. However, most of the epidemiological SaVs studies described so far used conserved screening primers in PCR assay to identify and sequence the VP1 or VP1-RdRp region. Due to the nt divergence of bat SaVs observed here, even if there were zoonotic strains from bats circulating in humans, they might not be detected by the existing primers. Therefore, the novel primers presented here will be able to detect both zoonotic strains especially from bats. Further, to fully delineate the zoonotic capacity of these bat SaVs, in vitro studies in cell cultures would be very useful, as well as screening human samples around the same region for bat SaVs.",
