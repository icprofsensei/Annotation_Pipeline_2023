VAP diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical and radiological signs, usually coupled with a quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid [5, 6], with the drawback that cultures postpone VAP diagnosis by 48\u201372\u00a0h. Microbiological culture surveillance of endotracheal aspirates (ETA) helps to identify early and with reasonable probability the VAP pathogen and improves empirical treatment. However, an effect on mortality has not been proven [7\u201310]. Studies with a clear demonstration of the efficacy and safety of routine culture surveillance are still lacking. In addition, the presence of a pathogen in surveillance cultures, even with a high bacterial burden, is not systematically associated with the development of VAP and clearing of bacteria by the host immune system is possible, even in the absence of antibiotics [11]. Other strategies are, therefore, needed for the early identification of patients at highest risk of VAP and with a high likelihood to benefit from preventive measures, such as aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions (OPS), silver-coated tubes, continuous control of cuff pressure, selective oropharyngeal or digestive decontamination [12, 13], or preemptive antibiotic treatment [14].",

The 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic profiling of bacterial communities (metataxonomics) in respiratory specimens allows to study the whole respiratory microbiota and identify many bacteria and potential pathogens that are not routinely cultured [15\u201317]. Only a few studies have evaluated the usefulness of metataxonomics and other molecular approaches for the prediction or diagnosis of VAP [18\u201321], but the specificity of the results obtained with such sensitive techniques has been a concern [22, 23].",

Sequencing (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009300) was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using a MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at LGC Genomics (Berlin, Germany). Merged and quality filtered sequence reads were denoized by mapping to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with the Greengenes reference OTU database [25] pre-clustered at 99% using USEARCH [26]. The taxonomy was assigned to sequence reads using the Mothur\u2019s RDP reference database [27, 28]. To remove putative contaminant OTUs, we first calculated the R-OTU value for each identified OTU [29]. The dataset was decontaminated by removing the reads with R-OTU\u2009>\u20090.1. This arbitrary selected R-OTU value performed well in removing known contaminant taxa, while not affecting taxa typical of oral/respiratory microbiota (Table\u00a0S1).",

The analysis was based on Bray\u2013Curtis similarity matrix of the square-root-transformed relative abundance of bacterial genera. Group average clustering of the Bray\u2013Curtis similarity matrix was performed in PRIMER, based on the square-root transformed relative abundance of bacterial families. Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) [31] was performed on the Euclidean distance matrix of the relative abundance of genera or OTUs using PRIMER. CAP maximizes the group differences in the multivariate cloud of points [31] to separate samples into a priori defined groups (VAP, controls) and the proportion of correct classifications can then be computed.",

These changes were associated with a decrease in bacterial diversity (Fig.\u00a02a and S2). At the genus level, the significant differences corresponded to a decrease in the abundance over time, except for Mycoplasma which increased (OPS samples; Fig.\u00a0S3). Temporal changes of both OPS and ETA microbiota centroids were negatively related to the first Principal Coordinate (PCo) axis (Fig.\u00a02b) and, to a lesser extent, positively correlated to the second PCo. Although this general trend was found in most patients, variations between individuals were substantial (Fig.\u00a02c, d), as shown in a previous report [21]. For example, for OPS samples, the intra-individual D0\u2013DVAP Bray\u2013Curtis similarity was in the 2.5\u201365.7 range (median 50.4) in VAP patients and between 3.9 and 63 (median 39.4) in controls.

In DNA extracts from OPS and ETA taken from D0 to DVAP, bacterial and human DNA loads were higher in VAP patients in most cases (Table\u00a0S4). This was particularly obvious with human DNA in ETA (Fig.\u00a04c) and bacterial DNA in OPS sampled on the day of VAP (Fig.\u00a04d). Using a cutoff of 124.7\u00a0ng/\u00b5L, human DNA concentrations in the ETA sample extracts allowed to differentiate VAP vs. controls with a sensitivity of 94.1% and a specificity of 83.3% (Fig.\u00a04d). Likewise, in the extracts of 6/7 (81%) ETA samples taken on the same day as BAL samples that turned culture-negative (controls), human DNA concentrations were also below this cutoff (data not shown). Bacterial DNA load in ETA and OPS at DVAP was higher in VAP patients, but these measurements were less discriminant compared to the human DNA load in ETA at the same time point (Fig.\u00a04d and Table\u00a0S4). BAL samples collected at DVAP from VAP patients also had a significantly higher bacterial load (p\u2009=\u20090.013) compared to BAL fluids taken at different time points in controls (n\u2009=\u20097) (data not shown).",

Using metataxonomic techniques, we found that at the time of intubation: (1) a lower abundance of Bacilli (normal Gram-positive oropharyngeal flora) in OPS was associated with the development of late-onset VAP with a sensitivity and specificity\u2009>\u200980% (Fig.\u00a04b); (2) canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) of microbiota in OPS allowed a reasonable allocation of patients who eventually developed VAP or not.",

This is in accordance with Conway Morris et al. who showed that BAL fluids of VAP patients had a higher bacterial burden than those who did not have criteria for VAP [18]. A significantly higher human DNA load was also measured in ETA compared with controls (Fig.\u00a04d). We hypothesize that this result reflects the presence of host inflammatory cells in ETA samples on the day of VAP [24]. The level of significance of differences in human and bacterial DNA load between VAP patients and controls increased when getting closer to the day of VAP. Interestingly, CAP did not show this trend. CAP of OPS microbiota better differentiated VAP from controls on the day of intubation than in time points closer to the day of VAP. This may be due to patient-specific changes in microbiota profiles during intubation.",

Mycoplasma was frequently detected in the three types of respiratory specimens obtained during intubation, i.e., OPS, ETA and BAL fluid. Although we observed a trend of more Mycoplasma in patients with VAP, the difference did not reach statistical significance. An increased abundance of Mycoplasma in BAL fluids from patients with VAP compared with intubated controls has recently been reported [34]. However, these were mainly commensal species of Mycoplasma and not M. pneumoniae. Mycoplasma represents a typical illustration of a bacterial taxon not cultured with standard techniques but detected by metataxonomics that could play a role in the pathogenicity of VAP. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential implication of commensal Mycoplasma and other uncultured bacteria in the development of VAP.",

This decrease of diversity may be related not only to antibiotic therapy, but also to changes caused by mechanical ventilation [21] which may favor the emergence of VAP bacterial pathogens with an advantage of growth. The dynamics of changes in microbiota profile varied between individuals (Fig.\u00a02c, d and S5), similar to previous studies on the respiratory microbiome in intubated patients [16, 17, 21]. These individualized responses of the microbiota to intubation are blurred by averaging the data across patients, resulting in non-significant differences in beta-diversity measure (Bray\u2013Curtis similarity at the genus level) between VAP patients and controls. While the similarity measures based on the relative genera abundance did not provide the evidence of a more profound dysbiosis in VAP patients, univariate analyses showed that several higher-level taxa had significantly higher absolute abundance in VAP patients, notably on the day of VAP (Fig.\u00a0S3).",

This is in line with ICU prevalence studies showing that antibiotics are used in 71% of patients on a particular day [36].
