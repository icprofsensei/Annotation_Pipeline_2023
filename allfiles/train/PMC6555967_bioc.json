[15\u201325] Several authors have also used prospective, observational cohorts to compare the lung microbiota of subjects with COPD both during clinical stability and later during exacerbation, [26\u201331] the largest studies of which are AERIS [32] and COPDMAP. [33] Several studies note an increase in Proteobacteria during exacerbations compared to periods of clinical stability, [29, 31\u201333] with some studies specifically citing Moraxella [31\u201333] and Haemophilus [32] as the genera responsible for this increase. While alpha diversity appears to decrease with a decline in FEV1, there is no consensus on whether or not alpha diversity changes at the time of exacerbation. [31\u201333] In particular, the COPDMAP study [33] noted differences in alpha diversity patterns across their three study centers, raising the possibility that local practice patterns in the management of COPD exacerbations may influence alpha diversity. The AERIS study [32] also described how alpha diversity and changes in taxonomic abundance are associated with severity of lung obstruction, but did not detect a statistically significant association between alpha diversity and exacerbations status. There were also limited associations between exacerbation status and taxonomic abundance.",

Results were also assessed after controlling for FEV1 percent predicted (FEV1pp), a potential co-linear clinical variable with phenotype. ASV count data was used to cluster samples with complete linkage hierarchical clustering using hclust function in base R. All analyses were performed in R version 3.4.2. Additional statistical analysis methods are found in the Additional file 1: Supplemental information.",

We sought to understand whether there is a correlation between oral wash and sputum \u03b1-diversity in the same subject. In linear models with only oral wash \u03b1-diversity as a predictor of sputum \u03b1-diversity, both Shannon and Simpson oral wash scores were significant predictors of Shannon (p\u2009=\u20090.0002) and Simpson (p\u2009=\u20090.0003) sputum diversity, respectively (Fig.\u00a04). We expanded these linear models to include exacerbation phenotype and the interaction of oral wash \u03b1-diversity and phenotype as predictors of sputum \u03b1-diversity. Inclusion of these additional factors in the Shannon diversity model showed that oral wash Shannon diversity alone narrowly missed significance (p\u2009=\u20090.07), while phenotype alone and the interaction of oral wash diversity and phenotype were non-significant. In the Simpson diversity model, oral wash diversity alone remained significant (p\u2009=\u20090.008), while phenotype alone and their interactions were non-significant. Close inspection of the figure, particularly the Simpson diversity model, reveals the presence of a low diversity x-outlier (boxed). Removal of this x-outlier did not significantly change the findings of the Shannon diversity model (oral wash alone remained significant [p\u2009=\u20090.039], while all factors were non-significant in the full model). However, removal of this low diversity x-outlier from the Simpson model did result in all factors becoming non-significant (oral wash alone and in combination with phenotype and their interactions; Additional file 1: Figure S2). This suggests that sputum \u03b1-diversity likely is associated with oral wash alpha diversity, but this potential relationship does not appear to be robust.",

Among oral wash samples with an FDR\u2009<\u20090.10, none of the ASVs differed by exacerbation phenotype. Among sputum samples, we did not find statistically significant differences in Haemophilus, Moraxella, or Streptococcus relative abundance at the ASV or genus level, as only 3 of the 9 available FE sputum samples exhibited striking shifts in abundance of these taxa. We did find 12 less common sputum ASVs that differed by exacerbation phenotype (Table\u00a05). Actinomyces, a gram-positive anaerobic organism capable of causing both oral and pulmonary infections had the most evidence for a difference. It was more common in the sputum of IE compared to FE. Since exacerbation phenotype and FEV1pp may be associated with each other in our dataset, we used FEV1pp as a co-variate in our model. Actinomyces, Capnocytophaga, Gemella, Ruminococcaceae, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, Prevotella, and Bergeyella ASVs all exhibited an FDR\u2009<\u20090.10 with respect to exacerbation phenotype, after correcting for FEV1pp. All ASVs were more abundant in IE sputum compared to FE sputum.",

COPD exacerbations are associated with bacterial infection as well as excess morbidity and mortality, and the exacerbation-associated lung microbiota is an area of active study. Few studies have compared the lung microbiota of FE and IE during periods of clinical stability. Here we have shown that the sputum of FE has lower alpha diversity than the sputum of IE even during periods of clinical stability and without recent administration of antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids. This finding is consistent with the general observation that lower alpha diversity is associated with worsening lung health. Although our data show significant within-subject similarity of the oral and sputum microbiota, this did not preclude the identification of shifts in sputum abundance of select taxa in association with exacerbation phenotype.",

Oral wash samples alone did not appear to distinguish frequent from infrequent exacerbators. Although decreased alpha diversity and changes in taxa abundance correlated with exacerbation phenotype here, observational studies such as ours are unable to determine causation. Other clinical factors associated with exacerbation phenotype (medication use, obstruction severity, etc.) may be responsible for these associations between exacerbation phenotype and alpha diversity or taxa abundance. Although we excluded subjects who had received antibiotics in the last 1\u2009month, it is likely that FEs received a greater number of antibiotic courses in the past year than were received by the IEs over the past year. Prior antibiotic exposure may have been responsible for some of the changes in alpha diversity between phenotypes noted here. Our facility favors the use of doxycycline to treat COPD exacerbations. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic, whose effects on the oral and gut microbiota were shown to be less persistent than the effects of other antibiotics like ciprofloxacin or clindamycin. [40] However, prior antibiotic exposure should have affected both the oral and sputum microbiota of our subjects. Our study identified greater phenotype-associated changes in the sputum compared to oral microbiota, suggesting that antibiotic-associated changes are unlikely to be responsible for all of the lung-specific changes noted here.",

This is consistent with studies of other chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, in which lower alpha diversity is associated with more severe disease. Review of the taxa found in FE sputum samples demonstrates that three subjects (5, 19, and 22) exhibited a high relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria (specifically Haemophilus and Moraxella, two organisms associated with COPD exacerbations), which corresponded to low alpha diversity scores. The pathogen dominance exhibited by these three FE sputum samples is in contrast to these subjects\u2019 oral wash findings, which had higher diversity scores and did not exhibit pathogen dominance. Conversely, there were no IE sputum samples that demonstrated pathogen dominance and resulted in very low diversity scores. The three FEs with low sputum alpha diversity did not appear to differ from the FE group as a whole with respect to obstruction severity, number of exacerbations in the last year, or symptom severity. Our data are most consistent with the notion that even during exacerbation-free intervals, a minority of FEs have low alpha diversity due to colonization with potentially pathogenic organisms\u2014and they are not readily distinguished from non-colonized FEs based on other clinical factors.",

Clustering analysis demonstrated that for 18 sputum samples, in nine instances the sputum sample\u2019s nearest neighbor in the dendrogram was the oral wash sample from the same subject. Of these nine very similar sputum-oral wash sample pairs from the same subject, six sample pairs were from IE while three sample pairs were from FE. In contrast, sputum and oral washes from FE subjects 5, 19, and 22 did not cluster together in the dendrogram or the beta diversity plots. Despite the overall similarity in oral wash and sputum sample beta diversity within subjects, we did not detect a change in within-subject beta diversity related to exacerbation phenotype (as we may have expected based on the findings from FE subjects 5, 19, and 22). Additionally, oral wash alpha diversity appeared to be a predictor of sputum alpha diversity, further supporting the similarities we saw between subjects\u2019 oral and sputum microbiota. While there is likely a correlation between the sputum and oral wash microbiota from the same subject, additional exploration of the potential role of exacerbation phenotype in this relationship is warranted.",

Although the literature suggests that COPD severity clustering is more likely due to sputum microbiota changes and clustering based on dental habits or tobacco use is more likely driven by the oral microbiota changes, due to our small sample size we did not evaluate which sample site or taxa were the primary drivers of clustering.

The most likely explanation for this lack of statistical significance is that increases in these two taxa were only noted in three of nine FE sputum samples. Actinomyces was significantly more abundant in IE sputum compared to FE sputum, and this result persisted after controlling for obstruction severity (FEV1pp). Increased relative abundance of Actinomyces in the sputum microbiota was also recently associated with survival following hospitalization for COPD exacerbation. [41] While Actinomyces is a common and clinically-relevant oral and lung pathogen, we currently lack robust evidence to assert a protective effect on the microbiome in COPD. It is possible that Actinomyces in the COPD lung provides protective benefits unrelated to other organisms, or that Actinomyces helps eliminate other more pathogenic members of the COPD microbiota, or simply that its relative abundance in the lung appears to increase when harmful and abundant COPD-associated taxa (such as Moraxella or Haemophilus) are not present. Additional studies will be needed to differentiate among these possibilities. Of note, oral wash sample taxa abundance did not appear to be correlated with exacerbation phenotype. This is consistent with exacerbation phenotype primarily influencing the lung (as opposed to oral) microbiota and suggests that phenotype-associated effects are not solely related to differences in antibiotic exposure between phenotypes.",

Firstly, we wished to compare the two sites to determine if sputum was or was not too heavily contaminated by oral bacteria during expectoration to identify phenotype-associated factors. Our data show that oral contamination of sputum samples has not prevented us from identifying phenotype-associated sputum microbiota changes. Secondly, we wished to address the possibility that differences in antibiotic exposure between phenotypes are responsible for the associations we identified. While antibiotic use should affect both the oral and sputum microbiota, the changes we observed in the sputum (but not oral) microbiota support the hypothesis that the lung microbiota changes we observed were due to phenotype-associated factors in the lung rather than systemic factors such as antibiotic use. In addition, the oral microbiota is the source of the lung microbiota through microaspiration or direct mucosal dispersion. The two sites are closely related and therefore the inclusion of oral samples in this study enhances our understanding of the COPD lung microbiota.",

We were able to study subjects during periods of clinical stability (at least 1\u2009month after exacerbation treatment had ended), when their oral and sputum microbiotas had reached a period of relative clinical stability and were less likely to be significantly influenced by recent antibiotic or systemic corticosteroid exposure. In spite of the similarities between subjects\u2019 oral and sputum microbiotas, we were able to observe differences in sputum taxa abundance and overall beta diversity based on exacerbation phenotype. We suggest that exacerbation phenotype, rather than increased antibiotic exposure among FEs, is responsible for the observed sputum microbiota changes. If increased antibiotic use among FEs had been entirely responsible for the exacerbation phenotype-related changes we observed in the sputum microbiota, we should also have observed similar phenotype-related changes in the oral microbiota. Both sites should be affected by antibiotic exposure.",

Most importantly, this study is unable to determine if sputum microbiota changes caused the development of the FE phenotype or if the FE phenotype caused the sputum microbiota changes. Separating cause from effect in this instance would require identifying and sampling subjects prior to development of the FE or IE phenotype or significant antibiotic exposure. As in any non-randomized study, it is possible that factors other than exacerbation phenotype are responsible for the changes observed here. In addition, the degree of similarity between the oral and the sputum microbiota may suggest that sputum is too contaminated by oral taxa to be a reliable indicator of the lung microbiota. This concern is unlikely to have significantly affected our results as we were able to observe several alterations in the sputum microbiota correlated with exacerbation phenotype, and the effect of oral contamination would have been to mask sputum differences between phenotypes. There was a non-significant trend towards more significant lung obstruction in the FE group compared to the IE group. Therefore, some of the observed differences between phenotypes may be related to increased obstruction. However, many of our taxa abundance results remained significant following statistical correction for obstruction severity. Due to our sample size, we were also unable to determine if clustering on beta diversity analyses was primarily the result of differences between oral or sputum samples and we may have been underpowered to detect some differences, particularly between exacerbation phenotypes.",

We identified differences in taxa relative abundance between phenotypes in sputum but not oral wash samples, and many of these differences persisted after correction for severity of obstruction. The upper airway microbiota of COPD subjects demonstrated clustering based on COPD exacerbation phenotype, inhaled corticosteroid use, tobacco use, severity of obstruction, and time since last professional dental cleaning. Dental care habits, tobacco cessation, and inhaled corticosteroid use are all modifiable factors and potential future targets for improving lung health via alterations in the upper airway microbiota.",
