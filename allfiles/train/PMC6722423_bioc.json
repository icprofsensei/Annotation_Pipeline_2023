In this study, we collected in vivo dental plaque formed on hydroxyapatite disks for 6 h from 74 young adults and identified initial colonizing taxa based on full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. A long-read, single-molecule sequencer, PacBio Sequel, provided 100,109 high-quality full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence reads from the early plaque microbiota, which were assigned to 90 oral bacterial taxa. The microbiota obtained from every individual mostly comprised the 21 predominant taxa with the maximum relative abundance of over 10% (95.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2%, mean \u00b1 SD), which included Streptococcus species as well as nonstreptococcal species. A hierarchical cluster analysis of their relative abundance distribution suggested three major patterns of microbiota compositions: a Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus sp. HMT-423-dominant profile, a Neisseria sicca/Neisseria flava/Neisseria mucosa-dominant profile, and a complex profile with high diversity. No notable variations in the community structures were associated with the dental caries status, although the total bacterial amounts were larger in the subjects with a high number of caries-experienced teeth (\u22658) than in those with no or a low number of caries-experienced teeth. Our results revealed the bacterial taxa primarily involved in early plaque formation on hydroxyapatite disks in young adults.",

Multiple studies have identified early-colonizing taxa capable of attaching to the acquired pellicle covering the enamel, which has been accomplished using several different approaches, such as cultivation (4), a checkerboard hybridization technique (5), an oral microbe identification microarray (6), a microarray and a culture collection (7), and an 16S rRNA gene clone library (8). These studies consistently demonstrated that the early plaque microbiota is constituted primarily by Streptococcus species, in particular Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis, with a subset of nonstreptococcal species, such as Neisseria, Rothia, and Gemella. In contrast, Diaz et al. (8) indicated that the microbiota composition varies on a subject-specific basis in terms of bacterial diversity and composition. Considering the small sample size of previous studies (2 to 15 participants), further investigations are still needed to understand the composition of early plaque microbiota, including investigation into the variation among individuals. In addition, there are no reports on the bacterial composition of early dental plaque in an Asian population, although geographical differences in oral microbiota had been studied (9, 10).",

Although the raw sequencing reads provided by this platform are still error prone, multiple observations of the same base of a single molecule is allowed by template DNA circularized by ligated adaptors, resulting in the acquisition of consensus insert sequences with high read accuracy (11). Several studies have conducted accurate and detailed identification of the complex microbial communities based on the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene using this platform with the circular consensus sequence (CCS) technique (12,\u201314). In addition, with the latest model of this platform, Sequel achieved approximately a throughput gain of \u223c7\u00d7, allowing for a much deeper sequence depth than the previous model (RS II).",

A principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot based on the weighted UniFrac metric demonstrated that early plaque microbiota exhibited community structures distinct from those of the salivary bacterial population (Fig.\u00a01). The number of species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified from each early plaque sample (114.2\u2009\u00b1\u200925.6, mean \u00b1 SD) was significantly lower than that identified from the salivary bacterial populations (156.8\u2009\u00b1\u200924.7; P\u2009<\u20090.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), suggesting that a limited number of bacterial taxa present in saliva attach to the surface of the hydroxyapatite disks. Notable differences between the early plaque and saliva samples were also observed in relative abundances of OTUs commonly (>90% of the participants) detected in the early plaque samples (Table\u00a0S1). These divergences in the microbiota composition indicated that the early plaque observed in this study was a unique bacterial community formed via selective attachment and growth on the surface of the hydroxyapatite disks.",

The rarefaction curve for the number of unique sequences almost approached a plateau in each sample, although the numbers of sequence reads were not the same among all samples, suggesting that the 16S rRNA gene sequences of initial colonizing bacterial taxa of the 74 young adults were mostly covered by the obtained sequences (Fig.\u00a02). Out of 625 unique sequences, 574 sequences which corresponded to 97,517 reads (97.4% of the total reads) were assigned to 94 oral bacterial species (90 bacterial taxa) deposited in the expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD) (16) with >99% identity (Table\u00a0S2). However, this study did not distinguish between S. mitis and Streptococcus sp. HMT-423; between Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis; or between Neisseria sicca, Neisseria flava, and Neisseria mucosa, because some of the sequences correspond to both species with the same identity value.

Streptococcus species, as well as nonstreptococcal species, were included in the 21 predominant taxa (Fig.\u00a03), which is consistent with the result of the V1-V2 data (Table\u00a0S1). S. mitis/Streptococcus sp. HMT-423 and N. sicca/flava/mucosa were the two major taxa observed in the early plaque samples, and the bacterial composition of each individual could be approximately classified into three patterns: an S. mitis/Streptococcus sp. HMT-423-dominant profile (right group), an N. sicca/flava/mucosa-dominant profile (left group), and a complex profile with higher diversity (Fig.\u00a03). Of the other 120 taxa, 106 were present in fewer than five participants, and 79 of them were found in only one participant. However, they occupied only small fractions of the microbiota in each participant (1.8%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7% and 0.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9%, respectively).",

The total bacterial amounts in the early plaque calculated by quantitative PCR analysis were larger in the high-caries group than the no-caries and moderate-caries groups (P\u2009<\u20090.01, Tukey test) (Fig.\u00a04). In contrast, a PCoA plot based on both unweighted and weighted UniFrac metrics implied that notable differences were not observed in the bacterial community structures among the three groups (Fig.\u00a05). No significant difference in dental caries experience status was observed between the three microbiota profiles classified in Fig.\u00a03 (P\u2009=\u20090.70, Fisher\u2019s exact test). There was no significant difference in the alpha diversity indices (Table\u00a0S3), relative abundances (Table\u00a0S4), and detection frequency (Table\u00a0S5) of the 21 predominant taxa in the early plaque microbiota among the three groups. No significant difference in the total bacterial amounts in the early plaque was observed between the participants with and without active caries lesions (6.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 and 6.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 [log copies], respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.43, Student\u2019s t test). The prevalence of the participants with active caries lesions was not significantly different among the three microbiota profiles classified in Fig.\u00a03 (P\u2009=\u20090.45, Fisher\u2019s exact test), and both unweighted and weighted UniFrac diagrams also showed that there were no notable differences in the bacterial community structures between the participants with and without the active caries lesions (Fig.\u00a05).",

Identification of initial colonizing bacteria using the open-ended molecular approach was conducted in a previous study by Diaz et al. (8). However, the high cost and labor of first-generation Sanger sequencing allowed for the microbiota analysis of only six samples (4-h and 8-h plaque for each of three individuals) with little depth (a total of 531 16S rRNA gene sequences). In this study, we used a third-generation sequencer with the CCS approach and obtained over 100,000 full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences in the early plaques from 74 young adults. The plateaued curve in the rarefaction analysis (Fig.\u00a02) suggests that the sequences obtained almost completely covered the initial colonizing taxa of this study population. Our data add more comprehensive and detailed information on early plaque microbiota with a larger sample size than previously used, which could benefit future investigations of the relationship between early plaque microbiota and dental health status.",

The most abundant taxa were Streptococcus species, including S. mitis, S. oralis, and Streptococcs sanguinis, which is consistent with previous results (4, 6,\u20138). Our data additionally identified not-yet-named Streptococcus species such as Streptococcus sp. HMT-064 and Streptococcus sp. HMT-066 as dominant initial colonizing microbes. The presence of the former species in the early plaque is in agreement with a previous study (7), whereas that of the latter species is a novel finding to the best of our knowledge. Along with Streptococcus, the genera Neisseria and Rothia occasionally showed the highest relative abundances in the microbiota (23 and two of 74 participants, respectively; data not shown). The majority of Neisseria species were N. sicca/flava/mucosa, which were present in the early plaque of all three participants in the study by Diaz et al. (8). The predominant Neisseria species in saliva, such as N. flavescens, N. subflava, and N. oralis, were also observed in high proportions in some participants. Of the three identified Rothia species, R. dentocariosa and R. mucilaginosa have been reported as initial colonizers (6, 8). Our results add Rothia aeria, which was differentiated from R. dentocariosa in 2004 (18), to the principal members of the early plaque microbiota. Gemella haemolysans, Abiotrophia defectiva, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were additionally found to be members of initial colonizers, as shown in a previous study (8). This study found the dominance of two notable species, including Lautropia mirabilis, which forms the center of cauliflower-like structures composed of multiple species, and Porphyromonas pasteri, which forms a corncob shell within the plaque biofilm, as indicated in the microscopic structural analysis (19). The microbiota of every individual was mostly occupied by these 21 taxa (95.8%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2%). Based on the relative abundance distribution of these 21 taxa, three compositional patterns are proposed: an S. mitis/Streptococcus sp. HMT-423-dominant profile, an N. sicca/flava/mucosa-dominant profile, and a mixed profile (Fig.\u00a03). In contrast, Actinomyces species, which have been indicated as an initial colonizer in earlier studies using cultivation (4) and microscopy (20), were present but were not included owing to their lower relative abundances (maximum relative abundance of Actinomyces sp. HMT-175 was 4.2%) compared with those of the above 21 taxa.",

HMT-423, N. sicca/flava/mucosa, R. aeria, G. haemolysans, and L. mirabilis, were present in significantly higher relative abundances in the early plaque microbiota than in saliva (see Table\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material). Considering that most major members of the salivary bacterial population, including Prevotella, Veillonella, and Granulicatella, were significantly less predominant in the early plaque microbiota (Table\u00a0S1), these bacteria would be highly capable of attachment and growth on the intact tooth surface. A recent study explored the coaggregation partners of nonstreptococcal taxa, including R. dentocariosa, R. mucilaginosa, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, as well as streptococci (7). Our findings support the importance of such investigations and further indicate that the roles of the less well known taxa, such as L. mirabilis and R. aeria, in the plaque development should be further investigated in future studies.",

In contrast, even no bacterial genera, including Streptococcus, were shared across the early plaque in this study population. These results suggest that selective adhesion to a tooth surface would result in the greater interindividual differences in the bacterial members of the early plaque microbiota than in the bacterial population in the entire oral cavity.",

However, although the bacterial composition of the 6-h plaque varied among individuals, as has been indicated previously (8), no notable differences corresponding to the status of dental caries experience was found in this study (Fig.\u00a03 and \u200band55 and Table\u00a0S3 to Table S5). This result suggests that the membership of the bacterial taxa first attaching to the enamel surface does not play a critical role in the dysbiotic pattern of the plaque microbiota development. In contrast, the total bacterial amount of the 6-h plaque microbiota in the highly caries-experienced group was larger than that in the no-caries and moderate caries-experienced groups (Fig.\u00a04), as observed in 24-h, 48-h, and 72-h plaque formation in a previous study (2), implying that the environmental conditions of intraoral cavities with a higher risk of dental caries would be better for the growth of the initial colonizing bacteria than those with less dental caries risk. Marsh (22) stated that unfavorable environmental conditions additionally drive a compositional shift in the microbiota toward a disease-associated community. The maturation process is therefore more likely to be a more important contributor to succession to the dysbiotic plaque microbiota than the composition of the initial colonizing taxa.",

On the other hand, one study using a microarray reported that S. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were present in the tooth swab samples of some subjects (6). The researchers collected the samples from the coronal two-thirds of buccal dental surfaces of all teeth except the second and third molars, which contain the early plaque formed at the neighboring regions of interproximal area. The discrepancy might be due to such differences in the collection sites. We emphasize that our study mimics the early plaque formed only on the smooth buccal surface of the teeth, but not in the pit and fissure.",

Therefore, we might have missed the initial colonizing taxa found only in individuals with severe dental caries experience. Further investigation is still needed to clarify the relationship between the initial colonizing taxa and dental caries susceptibility.",

Prior to early plaque collection, the dental examination was conducted for each participant by a dentist. Circular hydroxyapatite (HA) disks (9-mm diameter) were fabricated for the collection of early plaque samples because we assumed that careful attention was required for the collection of initial colonizing bacteria without contamination of residual previously formed dental plaque and salivary bacteria. The use of the standardized disks also enabled us to accurately calculate the total amount of attached bacteria for 6 h per unit area. The HA disks were prepared by pressing commercial HA powder (HAP-200; Taihei Co., Osaka, Japan) at 100\u2009MPa onto a uniaxial mold, followed by sintering at 1,200\u00b0C for 5 h, and then the disks were polished by SiC sandpaper at #1200 to simulate the surface of tooth enamel. After a meal and tooth brushing, the HA disks pressed on thermoplastic mouth guard sheet material (Erkoflex, 1.0\u2009mm thick; Erkodent, Pfalzgrafenweiler, Germany) were set in each buccal side of the maxillary second premolar and held in place by passing a string of dental floss around the tooth (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material). The disks were retrieved from the oral cavity 6 h later and placed in a microcentrifuge tube after rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline. Gum-stimulated saliva was also collected from each participant. DNA was extracted from early plaque formed on the disks and saliva using lysozyme and achromopeptidase, as described previously (23). For one subject, DNA extracted from the early plaque sample was inappropriate for later analysis due to its low quality, and therefore, the subject was excluded from the study.",

The quality-checked CCS reads were further processed by using the DADA2 pipeline (15) with default settings for PacBio reads (version 1.9.1), which provided the table of exact amplicon sequence variants present in each sample by the denoising and chimera-filtering procedures. The denoised CCS reads were aligned using PyNAST (24), and the UniFrac distance metric (25) was used to determine the dissimilarity between pairs of bacterial communities in QIIME (26). The taxonomy of each denoised CCS sequence was determined using BLAST against 16S rRNA gene sequences of 671 oral bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences (\u201cOral\u201d was included in the \u201cBody Site\u201d status) in the expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD 16S rRNA RefSeq version 15.1) (16), and the nearest neighbor taxons with \u226599% identity were selected as candidates for each sequence. The numbers of the denoised CCSs corresponding to the same taxa were combined, and the relative abundances and detection frequencies of each taxon were calculated in R. Some taxa deposited in the eHOMD database are difficult to distinguish even with the use of the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences because of high sequence similarity among them. For example, only two nucleotides (0.1% of the total 1,497 nucleotides) differ between the sequences of the two distinct Neisseria species, N. sicca and N. flava. When a single denoised CCS corresponded to multiple species with exactly the same identity (which also exceeded 99%), we considered them indistinguishable taxa, and the number of their corresponding sequences was combined. The taxonomy of sequences with no BLAST hit was further determined to the genus level using the RDP classifier with a minimum threshold of 80%.",
