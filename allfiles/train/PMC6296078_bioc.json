We also sequenced viral-like enriched particles from 28 fecal samples, and we detected the presence of the Mexican-crAssphage genome in 8 samples (28.5%). To our knowledge, our data is the first whole genome report of the crAssphage isolated from the Latin American Population and provides valuable information for the experimental characterization of the most abundant human gut bacteriophage.

After that, a crAss-like family was discovered and appears to be abundant and widespread in diverse habitats, both animal and environmental associated [7]. Various bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes appear to be the primary hosts of crAss-like phages [6, 7]. For example, \u03a6CrAss001, isolated from the human feces, was the first member of the extensive crAssphage family to be grown in pure culture and this phage infects the human gut symbiont Bacteroides intestinalis [8]. Recently, 98 complete circular genomes of crAss-like phages were reported and helped to establish the classification of this phage family into four candidate subfamilies composed of 10 candidate genera [9]. Furthermore, crAssphage was not associated with diarrhea in Chinese patients [10]. The crAssphage genomes have been isolated from the human gut of several geographical origins (Data file 1 in\u00a0Table\u00a01). However, a genome sequence from this phage family has not been reported to date in a Latin American population. Hence, being one of the most abundant phages in the human gut microbiome more investigation at the genomic level is necessary to improve our understanding about their function, especially in the Latin American population.",

Then, Amicon was washed using one volume of SM Buffer, and the viral particles were concentrated in 200\u00a0\u00b5l of SM buffer. We extracted the DNA using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin kit (57704, QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The DNA quality and quantity were measured using agarose gel electrophoresis and Qubit High-sensitivity fluorometric assay (Cat. Q32851, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), respectively. The DNA was used to construct the pair-end libraries using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Cat. FC-131-1024, Illumina, CA, USA) selecting an insert size of 400\u2013600\u00a0bp with the Ampure XP beads (Cat. A63882, Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). The libraries were analyzed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument (Cat. 5067-1504, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), and sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq500 with a 300 cycle paired-end format (FC-404-2003; Illumina, CA, USA) at the National Institute of Genomic Medicine in Mexico City. The reads were analyzed using FastQC version 0.11.5, and only the reads with a quality\u2009>\u2009Q20 were used for further analysis. The resulting reads from each sample were mapped against the crAssphage reference genome (GenBank ID: JQ995537) using SMALT version 0.7.6. After that, we selected the sample with the highest number of reads mapped to crAssphage genome to conduct a denovo genome assembly using Spades version 3.8.1. The resulting contigs were ordered using MeDuSa [12] setting the\u00a0default parameters.",

To visualize the read depth and codified proteins along the Mexican-crAssphage genome we used DNAPlotter (Data file 2 in\u00a0Table\u00a01). A total of 87 coding sequences (CDS) were predicted using RAST [13]. They were largely co-oriented, organized in two blocks of CDS alongside the genome. These sequences were BLASTed against the non-redundant (NR) proteins database\u00a0using Blast2GO [14]. After that, 12 proteins (13.8%) were unknown, and 60 proteins (68.9%) were defined\u00a0as hypothetical protein. The genome showed to encode phage proteins, including proteins involved in nucleic acid manipulation (helicase, ligase, primase, and polymerase), and phage structural proteins. Notably, we did not find any transfer RNA genes in the genome sequence.",
