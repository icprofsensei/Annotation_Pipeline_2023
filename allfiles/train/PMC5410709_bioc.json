A Random Forest classifier provided further support for the differentiation of IBS1 and HC groups. Microbes belonging to the genera Faecalibacterium, Blautia, and Bacteroides contributed to this subclassification. Clinical features distinguishing the groups included a history of early life trauma and duration of symptoms (greater in IBS1), but not self-reported bowel habits, anxiety, depression, or medication use. Gut microbial composition correlated with structural measures of brain regions including sensory- and salience-related regions, and with a history of early life trauma.",

IBS is the most common chronic visceral pain syndrome. In the absence of agreed upon biomarkers, the syndrome is defined by symptom criteria which include the presence of chronically recurrent abdominal pain associated with alterations in bowel habits [4]. This hypothesis has been based on the reported findings of gut microbial differences between healthy control subjects (HCs) and IBS patients, on findings in rodent models of IBS, and on the theoretical appeal of such a hypothesis to explain various clinical observations. These include the observations in some patients that antibiotic treatment can both trigger and attenuate IBS symptoms [2], the development of IBS-like symptoms following gastroenteritis in a small percentage of patients [5], and the beneficial effects of the fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) elimination diet and probiotic ingestion [2]. In addition, the well described interactions between the gut microbiota with the brain and the gut-based immune system provide plausible mechanisms consistent with a role of altered gut microbiota in IBS [6]. However, to date, few consistent differences have been identified in the gut microbiota between HCs and IBS. This may be in part related to the clinical (age, sex, medications) and physiological (intestinal transit, history of early adverse life events [EALs], stress reactivity) heterogeneity of patients selected solely by symptom criteria. One exception is an increased ratio between the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (F-B ratio) which has been reported by several investigators [7\u201310]. A recent study provided evidence for subgroups of IBS patients based on gut microbial composition, which were independent of predominant bowel habits and established symptoms criteria [10].",

In animal models, early adverse life events have been shown to be associated with stress-induced alterations in intestinal transit (indexed by increased fecal pellet output, [11] and in the composition of the gut microbiota [12, 13]. In addition to a growing list of abnormalities described by different investigators in the different components of the peripheral gut connectome [14, 15], both structural and functional alterations of the brain have been identified in IBS subjects [16]. Recent analyses have identified widespread gray and white matter alterations in the brain of IBS patients, including extensive changes in the somatosensory system (thalamus, basal ganglia, S1, and M1). A history of early adversity has also been shown to be correlated with brain structural changes [17]. A recent study showed cross sectional correlations between brain structure and gut microbial composition [18]. The fact that functional activity in some of the same regions (somatosensory regions, basal ganglia) was increased when healthy women consumed a probiotic mix over 4\u00a0weeks [19] suggests the possibility of a link between gut microbial composition and sensory processing and integration in the brain, both in healthy control subjects (HCs) and in a subgroup of IBS patients.",

Is there an association between a history of early adverse life events (EALs) and gut microbial composition? 3.

They were later placed in cryo-containers and shipped to the Texas Children\u2019s Microbiome Center. Bacterial DNA from the self-collected stool specimens was extracted, amplified, and sequenced, as previously described.[9, 33\u201335] Briefly, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence libraries were generated using the V3-V5 (357F/926R) primer region [9, 36] and sequenced on the 454 platform (Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA). The sequence libraries were parsed by barcode and quality filtered using the Genboree Microbiome Toolset [35], where sequences shorter than 200\u00a0bp, having average quality scores <20, containing ambiguous base calls, or including mismatches to barcode or sequencing primer were culled. After quality filtering and the removal of barcode and primer sequences, all remaining sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity level using QIIME (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology, v1.3.0) [37]. OTUs were clustered using the CD-Hit algorithm [38], and reads were screened for chimeras using ChimeraSlayer [39]. All potential chimeras were excluded from further analysis. OTU identities were assigned using the Ribosomal Database Project Classifier [40] with the Greengenes reference database (version 12-10) and confidence scores \u226580%. To accommodate for variance in sequencing depth, all sequence libraries were randomly sub-sampled to a depth of 1355 sequences, the size of the smallest quality filtered sequence library, prior to downstream analysis. Bacterial community profiles were analyzed by global parameters (described below) including determination of diversity, evenness, richness, and relative abundance of the bacteria identified in each sample. Output sequences were classified at the domain, phylum, family, genus, and species levels where possible, depending on the depth of reliable classifier assignments [41].",

We also tested for differences in the brain morphometry of somatosensory-, motor-, and emotional-related regions between the microbiota-derived clusters, IBS1, HC-like IBS, and HC using contrast analysis within the framework of the general linear model. Group was specified as a factor, and total gray matter volume was specified as a covariate. Somatosensory and motor regions included the basal ganglia (putamen, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus), primary sensory (postcentral gyrus, postcentral sulcus, central sulcus), secondary sensory (subcentral gyrus (central operculum) and sulci), motor (precentral gyrus, inferior part of the precentral sulcus, superior part of the precentral sulcus), and mid and posterior insula (long insular gyrus and central sulcus of the insula, inferior segment of the circular sulcus of the insula, posterior ramus of the lateral sulcus) regions. Emotional-related regions included the amygdala and the hippocampus. Analyses examining the relationship between brain structure and microbiota analyses were considered exploratory and important for future hypotheses generation. We report uncorrected p values as Type II error control and is equally important in exploratory research. We caution against reliance on significance testing and instead emphasize interpretation of effect sizes of brain-microbiota associations for future studies.",

Group differences in predicted metagenes were identified using DESeq2 in R, which employs an empirical Bayesian approach to shrink dispersion and fit non-rarified count data to a negative binomial model [49]. P values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR procedure. DESeq2 was also employed to identify metagenes with a statistically significant association with brain structural features that differed among the three microbial clusters. Selected metagenes associated with brain morphometry and microbiome clusters were further analyzed with FishTaco (http://borenstein-lab.github.io/fishtaco) [50]. This method uses a permutation approach and Shapley value analysis to quantitate the contribution of individual taxa to shifts in metagene abundance between two clusters (https://borenstein-lab.github.io/fishtaco/).

This was motivated by the possibility that altered bacterial production of neuroactive metabolites could contribute to the association of microbial clusters with brain morphometric parameters. Counts of bacterial genes (metagenes) were predicted from the 16S rRNA gene sequence data using PICRUSt, which imputes gene content for each OTU based upon the phylogenetically closest reference genome. The resulting count data were fitted to negative binomial models using DESeq2 with microbial cluster as a predictor. In pairwise comparisons, 606 metagenes (i.e., bacterial genes predicted by PICRUSt) differed in abundance between the IBS1 subgroup and HC-IBS with adjusted p value <.05 and 1223 metagenes differed between IBS1 and HC. In contrast, there were no differential metagenes between HC-IBS and HC. In parallel analyses, the same methodology was used to identify metagenes associated with the 10 brain morphometric parameters (each analyzed separately) that differed among the three microbial clusters at p\u2009<\u2009.01 (Table\u00a03). Twenty-seven metagenes were found that were significantly associated with both the IBS1 subgroup and with brain morphometric parameters, including 20 that were associated with the surface area of the right inferior segment of the inferior segment of the circular sulcus (a region of the posterior insula) (Additional file 11: Table S7). Of these, we focused on two metagenes enriched in IBS1 that are involved in neurotransmitter metabolism\u20144-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, which degrades \u03b3-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and glutamate dehydrogenase, which mediates glutamate synthesis/breakdown\u2014and on two metagenes enriched in IBS1 that are involved in short chain fatty acid metabolism\u2014acetate co-A transferase subunit B, which mediates the final step of butyrate synthesis, and propionate catabolism operon regulatory protein, which regulates an operon of propionate catabolism genes (Fig.\u00a05a). The individual taxa that made the greatest contribution to the association of these metagenes with IBS1 were identified using FishTaco. This highlighted a prominent role for one particular taxon, an unclassified Peptostreptococcaceae, which had a trend toward significant correlation (p\u2009=\u2009.058) with the right inferior segment of the circular sulcus though it fell short of significance as compared to the metagene encoding 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (p\u2009=\u2009.008) (Fig.\u00a05b).\n",

To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating a correlation between the architectures of the brain and the gut microbiota in a distinct subgroup of IBS patients. These findings suggest a possible influence of the gut microbiota and their metabolites on specific brain structures which may play a role in the pathophysiology of altered sensory processing in IBS.",

As a group, all IBS subjects showed significantly greater alpha diversity and richness than HCs, a difference that was largely explained by the greater diversity within the IBS1 subgroup. Higher alpha diversity has previously been reported in an IBS subgroup [10], in patients with celiac disease [51], and with autism spectrum disorder [52], all syndromes which are often accompanied by IBS-like symptoms.

While the abundance of Firmicutes was significantly greater in IBS1, that of Bacteroidetes was lower. In contrast, the HC-like IBS group did not differ from the HC with respect to these relative abundances. The finding of gut microbiota-based IBS subgroups and some of their gut microbial composition is similar to findings recently reported by Jeffery et al. [10], even though they identified two IBS clusters that differed from HCs in addition to a subgroup similar to HC. The finding of IBS subgroups based on gut microbial composition that had identical clinical symptoms suggests that the difference in microbial architecture is either not necessary for symptom generation in IBS, or that identical clinical presentations can be caused by different underlying mechanisms, one involving gut microbial alterations. Similar to the current finding in the IBS1 subgroup, both clusters in Jeffrey\u2019s study showed a greater abundance of Firmicutes and a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes. Altered F-B ratios have been reported in other chronic diseases [54], with increased F-B ratios reported in both preclinical and clinical studies of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and high fat intake [55\u201357].",

F-B ratios in healthy individuals are highly variable, despite similarities in microbial function [58]. However, age [59] and diet [55, 57, 60] are important modulatory factors. For example, animal models of obesity, obese individuals, those with metabolic syndrome, and those on a Western diet with high animal fat content were found to have increased F-B ratios [55\u201357]. Fatty acids in high fat diets, such as in the typical North American diet, have been shown to increase the F-B ratio, and this increase has been associated with an increase in gut epithelial permeability and low grade inflammation [61]. It is intriguing to speculate that the increased F-B ratio in a subgroup of IBS patients is related to alterations in epithelial permeability and low grade inflammation which have been implicated as possible disease mechanisms in IBS [62]. Even though we observed trends for higher BMI and higher plant-derived fat intake in the IBS1 group, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Specific dietary habits, such as increased consumption of fat, have not been reported for IBS [63, 64]. No other dietary differences between the groups were identified.",

The IBS1 group showed a greater relative abundance of several Firmicutes-related taxa, including members of Bacilli and Clostridia at the class level, of Bacilli-associated Lactobacillales at the order level, and of Holdemania at the genus level. The IBS-associated enrichment in Clostridia is particularly interesting in light of the finding that select spore-forming bacteria, dominated by Clostridia Cluster IV and XIVa, sufficiently induce serotonin biosynthesis by colonic enterochromaffin cells [65]. This aligns well with the reported links between intestinal serotonin dysregulation and IBS [66]. Holdemania are commonly found in the healthy gut, but there are few generalizable results for this genus. IBS1 differed in these relative abundances from both HC-like IBS and HCs, with the exception of differences in the abundance of Lactobacillales, which were only seen in comparison to HCs. This finding is surprising in view of the common recommendation of probiotics to treat IBS symptoms, the majority of which contain Lactobacilli. As acute laboratory stressors have been shown to decrease Lactobacilli in the stool in both clinical and preclinical studies, one would expect a reduction of Lactobacilli in a stress-sensitive disorder like IBS.",

As subjective ratings of predominant bowel habits generally show poor correlations with colonic transit times, and the colonic transit times are normal in the majority of IBS patients regardless of reported predominant bowel habit, the observed lack of correlation of such ratings with microbial composition is not surprising. As commonly observed in clinical studies, IBS patients as a group had a significantly higher level of anxiety symptoms while IBS1 and HC-like IBS did not differ from each other. However, no correlations between anxiety (or depression) symptom scores and microbial parameters were observed.",

Even though the observed correlation between a history of ELAs and the microbiome needs to be confirmed in future studies, one may speculate that brain driven disturbances of the gut microbial environment in early life [12] may have a long lasting effect on gut microbial composition persisting throughout life, which in turn may lead to further changes in brain structure/function.",

For example, the Firmicutes-associated Clostridia (higher in IBS1) and the Bacteroidetes-associated Bacteroidia (lower in IBS1) showed correlations with the volume of several subcortical brain regions involved in sensory integration and modulation and the motor cortex. For the majority of these regions, increased volumes were observed with decreases in Bacteroidia taxa and increases in the Clostridia taxa characterizing IBS1. On the other, decreased volumes of the anterior insula and ventral prefrontal regions were associated with the taxa profile of IBS1. Whether Clostridia-mediated modulation of peripheral serotonin levels [65] may be involved is unclear, increasing evidence reveals microbiome-mediated changes in neurochemical signaling and neurophysiology. The abundance of the Firmicutes-associated Bacilli (increased in IBS1) was related to only a few regional brain volumes including positive correlations with the right nucleus accumbens and subregions of the frontal gyrus, and negative correlations with other prefrontal cortices and the posterior cingulate cortex.",

Several possible explanations for these structural brain changes have been proposed, including genetic and epigenetic factors, the effect of gut microbial metabolites, as well as the effect of longstanding increased sensory signaling from the periphery [6].",

For the sensory brain regions, it is conceivable that neuroactive or proinflammatory metabolites generated by altered gut microbiota reach the brain, inducing neuroplastic changes. As most patients with IBS symptoms have a longstanding history of symptoms, often dating back to childhood, it is likely that such altered gut microbiota to brain signaling could have shaped the brain from early on in life. This view is also consistent with the observed correlation of microbial composition with EALs.",

                    "text": "In support of this possibility, we found that the surface area of the posterior insula was associated with the predicted abundance of 20 bacterial genes increased in the IBS1 group. The posterior insula is considered the primary visceral cortex and was chosen a priori without corrections for type I error. The identified genes included two that influence synthesis/degradation of GHB and glutamate. GHB is a neurotransmitter found naturally at high levels in the intestine that inhibits intestinal peristalsis via GABAB receptors and has sedative effects in the CNS [70, 71]. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the enteric nervous system and in the brain where it also plays an important role in synaptic plasticity [72]. The posterior insula was also associated with abundance of a subunit of butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase, an enzyme used by intestinal bacteria such as Faecalibacterium in the final step of butyrate synthesis [73, 74]. Butyrate has histone deacetylase activity and signals through GRP43 and GRP109a (expressed by enterochromaffin cells, vagal afferents, and microglia), all potential mechanisms by which it could influence brain function or structure [75]. Interestingly, a positive regulator of proprionate catabolism operon was also associated with this region of the posterior insular, suggesting a shift in the short-chain fatty acid profile [76]. Association of these metagenes with IBS1 group was largely attributable to a single unclassified member of the Peptostreptococcaceae. It is unclear why this taxon bloomed in a subset of IBS patients, though diet or fiber supplementation are possibilities [77]. Mechanistic studies in rodent models are warranted to investigate these hypotheses.",

The sample was relatively small and composed of both male and female subjects and did not include measures of intestinal transit times. Self-ratings of bowel habits are known to have a poor correlation with intestinal transit time. All correlations with brain structure were cross sectional, and no conclusion about causality can be made from our results. The observed gut microbial changes could be secondary to altered autonomic nervous system output to the gut, changing the microbial environment [78]. Alternatively, the brain changes could be the consequence of altered signaling to the brain through microbial metabolites, or both mechanisms may be involved [6]. Sequencing depth of the microbiome may be a limitation as rare members of the microbiota may be undetected, and differences in sequencing depth may affect relative distributions of microbial taxa. Finally, predicted metagenomics analysis to impute potential metabolites involved in the observed structural brain differences is limited, and results need to be confirmed by metabolomics analyses.",

Regardless of the causation underlying the observed associations, several intriguing conclusions can be made from this study. Both the correlations of abundance of certain microbial taxa with early adverse life events and with distinct brain structural changes previously reported in IBS suggest a possible role of gut microbes and their metabolites in the development and shaping of the gut-microbiota-brain axis early in life. Confirming results from a previous study [10], IBS subgroups can be identified based on gut microbial composition, which do not correlate with clinical findings such as bowel habits, or with psychological symptom scores. These findings suggest the possibility of a new classification of IBS patients based on gut microbial signatures (and eventually on metabolomics profiles) rather than on clinical characteristics. Furthermore, consistent with clinical observations, the findings suggest the possibility that treatments aimed at altered gut microbial composition with antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and certain diets may only work in subgroups of patients with an altered gut microbiome. Not only could such subgroups explain the lack of response to such treatments in a significant proportion of patients but also the worsening of IBS symptoms in subsets of patients with intake of food, fiber supplementation, and even probiotics. Identifying IBS subgroups based on gut microbiota, their related metabolomic profiles and corresponding brain signatures is likely to play an important role in optimizing therapies in IBS.",
