To assess engraftment of the new microbiota, recipients were paired with their respective donors and stool 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis was performed. Sequencing results demonstrated post-FMT compositional dissimilarity (Unweighted UniFrac, P = 0.04, FDR q = 0.22) between the two recipient\u2013donor groups. Specific taxonomic dynamics included post-FMT increased abundance of Paraprevotellaceae, previously associated in descriptive studies with responsiveness to treatment, and significant reductions in abundance of \u03b2-proteobacteria, previously associated with reduced response to treatment. Immunohistochemical stains of biopsies demonstrated an increased post-FMT infiltration of antigen presenting cells (CD68+) in the gut (paired T-test, P = 0.008) and in the tumor (P = 0.0076). Post-treatment intra-tumoral CD8+ T-cell infiltration was also increased. Three patients had a partial or complete response to treatment post-FMT.",
