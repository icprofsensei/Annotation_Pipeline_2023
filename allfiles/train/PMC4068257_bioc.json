Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successfully used to treat recurrent C.\u00a0difficile infection. It is hypothesized that FMT aids in recovery of a microbiota capable of colonization resistance to C.\u00a0difficile. However, it is not fully understood how this occurs. Here we investigated changes in the fecal microbiota structure following FMT in patients with recurrent C.\u00a0difficile infection, and imputed a hypothetical functional profile based on the 16S rRNA profile using a predictive metagenomic tool. Increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed following FMT. The fecal microbiota of recipients following transplantation was more diverse and more similar to the donor profile than the microbiota prior to transplantation. Additionally, we observed differences in the imputed metagenomic profile. In particular, amino acid transport systems were overrepresented in samples collected prior to transplantation. These results suggest that functional changes accompany microbial structural changes following this therapy. Further identification of the specific community members and functions that promote colonization resistance may aid in the development of improved treatment methods for C.\u00a0difficile infection.",

It is estimated that there are more than 500,000 cases of CDI in the United States annually, and estimates of the financial burden attributed to CDI range from $1.3 billion to $3.4 billion (2, 3). The manifestations of CDI can range from cramps, diarrhea, and colitis potentially to more severe outcomes, including toxic megacolon and death (1). Of significant concern is the rate of recurrence following an initial CDI episode; 20 to 40% of patients do not resolve their infection following standard CDI treatment (metronidazole or vancomycin) and experience a recurrence of disease, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality (1, 4). Once recurrence has occurred, the risk of subsequent recurrences is increased further (5).",

A healthy gut microbiota is thought to limit colonization by pathogens, a function of the microbiota known as colonization resistance. A major risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use, which disrupts the normal structure of the gut microbiota and leads to the loss of colonization resistance (6). The difficulty in acquiring patient samples prior to the development of CDI has limited the identification of specific members of the microbiota that are capable of providing colonization resistance against CDI in humans. While it is hypothesized that recurrent CDI occurs due to the inability of the indigenous microbiota to recover following antibiotic use (7), it is still unknown whether a specific microbial community is more prone to recurrence than others. Comparison of the fecal microbiota in patients developing nosocomial diarrhea with and without C.\u00a0difficile colonization revealed few community differences to indicate specific community structures susceptible to CDI (8), although prior studies have demonstrated that a small number of patients with recurrent CDI exhibited a unique microbiota community structure (9). More than likely, the structural differences observed following antibiotics reflect changes in the functional, or metabolic, environment that contribute to CDI susceptibility (10).",

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the introduction of intestinal microbiota from a healthy donor to restore the indigenous gut microbiota, has been successfully used to treat recurrent cases of CDI when standard therapy fails (5, 11,\u201313). Although the use of FMT has a reported 90% success rate for recurrent CDI (12), the specific mechanisms by which FMT restores colonization resistance remains undetermined. Recovery of colonization resistance to C. difficile has been described for both human (14) and mouse (15, 16) studies following FMT therapy, but few studies have explored the functional changes following FMT. One recent study using targeted metabolites observed an increase in secondary bile salts following FMT, suggesting that recovery of a microbiota community capable of restoring bile salt metabolism is important in limiting recurrent CDI (17). It is likely that a complex set of metabolites is required for full recovery of colonization resistance.",

Following removal of low-quality or chimeric sequences, 569,880 high-quality sequences were available for analysis (an average of 14,243 sequences/sample). To characterize the microbial communities, sequences were aligned to the SILVA reference alignment and clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (cutoff = 0.02) using the software program mothur (v.1.31) (18). Sequences were taxonomically classified, or phylotyped, using the RDP database (v9) (19). A total of 1,796 unique OTUs were detected within all samples, belonging to 164 genera (see Table\u00a0S2 in the supplemental material).",

The majority of sequences within pre-FMT samples were classified as Proteobacteria (48.2%), whereas the relative abundance of these sequences were significantly lower in post-FMT (11.2%; P < 0.001 using Wilcoxon\u2019s nonparametric test) and donor (0.73%; P < 0.0001) samples. At the genus level within pre-FMT samples, Cronobacter (17.9%) and an unclassified Enterobacteriaceae member (20.3%) were most abundant. Although these genera were observed in post-FMT samples (8.8%), they constituted only 0.12% of the sequences assigned in donor samples. Considerable genus-level diversity within the Firmicutes was detected in all samples, albeit at higher levels in post-FMT (51.6%) and donor (65.4%) samples compared to levels in pre-FMT samples (43.6%). In both post-FMT and donor samples, OTUs classified as Blautia (6.0%), Lachnospiraceae (incertae sedis, 5.6%), unclassified Lachnospiraceae (11.0%), and Faecalibacterium (4.3%) comprised the most abundant Firmicutes (Fig.\u00a02). In contrast, Bacteroidetes members were severely depleted in pre-FMT samples (1.3%) compared to levels in post-FMT (32.3%; P < 0.0001) and donor (32.8%; P < 0.0001) samples. At the genus level within post-FMT and donor samples, OTUs classified as Bacteroides (24.0%) and Alistipes (3.7%) comprised the majority of the Bacteroidetes phylum members.",

Additionally, ordination supported distinct clustering of pre-FMT, post-FMT, and donor samples (analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA], P < 0.001) (Fig.\u00a05; see also Fig.\u00a0S3 in the supplemental material). We calculated the correlation of each axis with OTU abundance and detected several OTUs likely to contribute significantly to the observed shifts within the axes (Fig.\u00a05). Not surprisingly, many abundant OTUs were significantly correlated with sample type.

The relative abundance of KOs present in pre-FMT samples was predominantly decreased compared to that in post-FMT and donor samples. To encompass the major functional categories covered by individual KOs, we determined the overall gene pathway and module abundance using HUMAnN (HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network) (21). Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), we identified 75 gene modules (consisting of 5 to 20 genes per pathway) that were significantly differentially abundant among donor, pre-, and post-FMT samples (Fig.\u00a06). Several modules related to basic metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and carbohydrates were underrepresented in pre-FMT samples compared to donor and post-FMT samples. For instance, NAD (KEGG module M00115), histidine (M00026), and lysine (M00016) biosynthesis were all significantly decreased in pre-FMT samples. A similar pattern of underrepresentation was seen for genes involved in core metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis (M00001 and M00002) and the pentose phosphate pathway (M00004 and M00006), with these also being underrepresented in pre-FMT samples compared to findings for donor samples.",

In many prokaryotes, GABA production is a stress response (22). Interestingly, some pathways that utilize glutamate as a substrate, such as the biosynthesis of UMP (M00051) or ornithine (M00028), were increased in donor and post-FMT samples, suggesting an imbalance of pathways involved in controlling glutamate metabolism within pre- and post-FMT samples. Transport systems for amino acids, such as for histidine (M00226), glutathione (M00348), and arginine (M00229), were also overrepresented in pre-FMT samples. These data suggest that in addition to the observed structural differences between recipients and donors, the potential metabolic contribution by the community is also greatly different between pre-FMT and donor/post-FMT samples.",

For one symptomatic patient who tested positive for C.\u00a0difficile (recipient 005), a 7-day vancomycin course resulted in successful clinical recovery and an eventual negative test. Patient 006, who also tested positive, became symptomatic after the initial post-FMT visit and was treated with vancomycin for an indefinite time. Other than a brief follow-up phone contact to assess the status of the patient\u2019s CDI symptoms up to 6\u00a0months after the procedure, study protocol did not dictate that further data be collected upon a positive C.\u00a0difficile test.

Our data suggest that the fecal microbiota in post-FMT samples resembles the community of each respective donor rather than the community observed prior to FMT, supporting previous observations about the fecal microbiota community following FMT for the treatment of C.\u00a0difficile (7, 11, 14, 17, 23). By comparing community composition and structure per FMT pair, we observed differences in functional potential of the microbiome based on the type of community present within individual recipient-donor pairs. The results presented here suggest that an imbalance of the microbiome during recurrent CDI is at least partially returned to healthy status following FMT despite interindividual differences in community structure observed prior to FMT. Interestingly, the resulting post-FMT microbial community within the recipient did not necessarily predict C.\u00a0difficile test results or clinical recovery status of the recipient patients. For instance, the post-FMT sample from patients 006 (symptomatic) and 012 (asymptomatic) both clustered within the donor samples despite a positive C.\u00a0difficile test at their follow-up visit (Fig.\u00a02; see also Fig.\u00a0S2 in the supplemental material). Similarly, the post-FMT sample for patient 007 clustered among the pre-FMT samples despite testing negative during their follow-up. However, the post-FMT samples from patients 005 and 012, which harbored a high abundance of Proteobacteria, clustered within the pre-FMT samples (Fig.\u00a02; see also Fig.\u00a0S1).",

However, we observed that the most abundant OTUs within post-FMT samples (collected up to 1\u00a0month following the procedure) were not necessarily the most abundant OTUs of the donor (see Table\u00a0S2). It is hypothesized that microbes from the donor directly colonize the recipient, thus restoring colonization resistance. A longitudinal study by Hamilton et al. investigated community dynamics up to 4\u00a0months following FMT in three patients (14). While the community post-FMT was structurally more similar to the donor sample than the pre-FMT sample, the most abundant OTUs >3\u00a0months post-FMT were not those of the donor. Similar observations of transient colonization by the donor community were described by Angelberger et al., who analyzed the temporal dynamics following FMT in ulcerative colitis patients (24). While the donor\u2019s most abundant OTUs were considered the most abundant within a week post-FMT, the authors concluded that colonization by the donor community was transient in most patients, followed by colonization patterns that were not directly from the donor source. This suggests a less direct contribution of FMTs in restoring colonization resistance, such as functional provision of an environment conducive for growth of existing Bacteroidetes and/or Firmicutes that can now repopulate the microbiota and/or direct inhibition of C.\u00a0difficile growth via niche exclusion.",

                    "text": "To gain insight into the functional differences among recipients with CDI and what a donor community might provide via FMT, we used PICRUSt to predict the metagenomic contribution of the communities observed. PICRUSt predicts metagenomic potential by imputing the available annotated genes within a known sequenced database, such as the KEGG catalogue, based on the presence/absence of OTUs of a 16S rRNA survey. PICRUSt has been utilized previously to describe differences in potential function within human samples and positively corresponds to actual metagenomic and metabolic comparisons, despite flaws used in imputation (25, 26). Similar to the structural observations based on 16S profiles, our results suggest an imbalanced representation of gene pathways between pre- and post-FMT samples. PICRUSt analysis suggested that core metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway, were underrepresented, while an increase in the types of transport pathways were overrepresented, within pre-FMT samples. Furthermore, this analysis suggested that differential representation of amino acid biosynthesis pathways was present in pre-FMT compared to donor and post-FMT samples, such as an increased coverage of pathways involved in biosynthesis of histidine, an amino acid observed to promote C.\u00a0difficile growth (27). Additionally, several peptide transport systems found in the Proteobacteria, such as those for histidine, glutathione, and arginine, were overrepresented in pre-FMT samples. Interestingly, Morgan et al. observed similar results in samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (25). For instance, glutathione is involved in inflammatory cascades during oxidative stress, which may be relevant in the development of gastrointestinal inflammation. Although experimental validation of the human metabolic environment that is able to promote C.\u00a0difficile is necessary, metagenomic prediction tools, such as PICRUSt, provide an important first glance at the functional contribution of a healthy community within the gut, leading to testable hypotheses.",

                    "text": "Our results support previous observations that in addition to changing the structural landscape of the gut (removal of specific organisms), antibiotic-induced loss of colonization resistance affects the metabolic potential of the environment as a whole (10, 28). In some individuals, this may develop into a more favorable environment for C.\u00a0difficile to either colonize or grow. A study by Theriot et al. identified significant shifts in the intestinal metabolome of antibiotic-treated mice (29). In particular, levels of sugars that C.\u00a0difficile can utilize were greatly increased in susceptible mice, reflective of a less diverse community structure. Additionally, the abundance of taurocholic acid, a known germinant for C.\u00a0difficile, was increased following antibiotic use. Few studies have described the metabolic profile of CDI patients in addition to the structural changes. Antharam et al. observed a depleted butyrate-producing bacterial profile in CDI and diarrheal control patients, suggesting that butyrate production may be important in limiting C.\u00a0difficile growth (8). A recent study by Weingarden et al. employed targeted and untargeted metabolomics to describe changes in the metabolome before and after FMT and observed similar shifts in the full metabolome, as with microbial composition (17). Specifically, they observed increased amounts of primary bile acids in recurrent CDI patients, consistent with in vitro findings of C.\u00a0difficile growth and in vivo mouse models. However, it is unclear whether these observations are a result or cause of CDI. The availability of prospective samples prior to CDI infection in human studies is limited, making functional comparisons prior to initial CDI difficult. Additionally, the interindividual variation of the microbiome in humans and differences in immunity complicate the identification of specific members that may provide functional or structural colonization resistance. However, identifying the specific metabolites, as well as the microbes that can potentially provide these, that contribute to C.\u00a0difficile growth will hopefully lead to new hypotheses of why certain individuals become susceptible to CDI.",

All OTUs were clustered at a cutoff of 0.02 (98% similarity) and classified using the Ribosomal DNA Project (RDP) database (v9) (19). Heat maps, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), and bar plots were created in R using the packages vegan and gplots (35, 36). Statistics using the Wilcoxon test, analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were calculated using JMP v.10.0 and R. For PICRUSt, we normalized the OTU results by subsampling to the lowest sequence count (3,500 OTUs/sample). This table was input into the QIIME pipeline, which was used to reference the Greengenes 16S rRNA database (v9), the required input for PICRUSt (20, 37). Within PICRUSt, OTUs were normalized by 16S rRNA copy number, and metagenomes were predicted from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) catalogue (38). HUMAnN was used to predict downstream pathway coverage from the KEGG Ortholog results (21). ANOVA in R was used to calculate the significantly differentially abundant pathways (P < 0.001).",
