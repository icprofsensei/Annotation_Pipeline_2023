Alkali generation by oral microbes, specifically via arginine catabolic pathways, is an essential factor in maintaining plaque pH homeostasis. There is evidence that the use of arginine in dentifrices helps protect against caries. The aim of the current study was to investigate the mechanistic and ecological effect of arginine treatment on the oral microbiome and its regulation of pH dynamics, using an in vitro multispecies oral biofilm model that was previously shown to be highly reflective of the in vivo oral microbiome. Pooled saliva from 6 healthy subjects was used to generate overnight biofilms, reflecting early stages of biofilm maturation. First, we investigated the uptake of arginine by the cells of the biofilm as well as the metabolites generated. We next explored the effect of arginine on pH dynamics by pretreating biofilms with 75 mM arginine, followed by the addition of sucrose (15 mM) after 0, 6, 20, or 48 h. pH was measured at each time point and biofilms were collected for 16S sequencing and targeted arginine quantification, and supernatants were prepared for metabolomic analysis. Treatment with only sucrose led to a sustained pH drop from 7 to 4.5, while biofilms treated with sucrose after 6, 20, or 48 h of preincubation with arginine exhibited a recovery to higher pH. Arginine was detected within the cells of the biofilms, indicating active uptake, and arginine catabolites citrulline, ornithine, and putrescine were detected in supernatants, indicating active metabolism. Sequencing analysis revealed a shift in the microbial community structure in arginine-treated biofilms as well as increased species diversity. Overall, we show that arginine improved pH homeostasis through a remodeling of the oral microbial community.",

The dynamics of dental plaque pH were first described over 80 y ago (Stephan 1940), when Stephan observed that dental plaque universally undergoes a rapid drop in pH when exposed to a sugar source, followed by an eventual recovery to neutral. Dental caries is caused by acid demineralization of enamel; frequent exposure to sugars causes prolonged periods of acidification, leading to increased demineralization and risk of caries. Indeed, individuals with active caries display a lower plaque pH and a longer recovery time after exposure to a sugar source (Lingstr\u00f6m et al. 2000; Gao et al. 2001). A healthy plaque microbial community exists in equilibrium with the host and allows for a quick recovery from the pH drop (McLean 2014; Edlund et al. 2015).",

With the knowledge that the relative proportion of acid- and base-producing bacteria is an important determinant of caries risk, a potential therapeutic objective is to promote a shift in the microbial community to favor base-producing bacteria. The catabolism of arginine by oral bacteria is an important contributor to plaque alkalinity (Casiano-Col\u00f3n and Marquis 1988; Burne and Marquis 2000); because of this, arginine has been investigated as a potential caries therapeutic. Studies have shown that high levels of free arginine in saliva are associated with caries resistance (Van Wuyckhuyse et al. 1995). Results from clinical studies have shown that arginine-containing dentifrices are effective at reversing caries and providing caries protection (Acevedo et al. 2008; Kraivaphan et al. 2013; Yin et al. 2013).",

Then, 1 mL was added to each well of a 24-well plate that had been precoated with sterilized, cell-free saliva. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16 h in microaerobic conditions (2% O2, 5% CO2, balanced with nitrogen) to allow biofilm formation, then were washed and starved (incubated without a carbon source) in chemically-defined medium (CDM), adjusted to pH 7, (McLean et al. 2012) for 2 h. Then, 75 mM L-arginine (adjusted to pH 7), 15 mM sucrose, or both, was added to the CDM. For arginine-treated biofilms, 15 mM sucrose was subsequently added after 6, 20, 48, or 54 h. Time 0 biofilms were collected prior to the addition of any arginine or sucrose. Negative controls were incubated in CDM only. pH was measured by pipetting 20 \u03bcL of each sample onto pH indicator strips. All experimental conditions were performed in duplicate.

We also performed an arginine utilization assay in which we quantified the metabolites present over time after incubation with arginine and subsequent removal.

Targeted LC-MS of the biofilm pellets showed that arginine was internalized by the cells. Three major products of arginine catabolism\u2014ornithine, putrescine, and citrulline\u2014were detected in the supernatants, indicating that arginine was metabolized during the experiment. Interestingly, in biofilms treated with only arginine at Time 0 and not exposed to sucrose (Fig. 3A), the amount of arginine inside the cells at the end of the experiment (54 h) was almost 30-fold less than detected in the biofilms collected at 20 h, as well as much less (12- to 30-fold) than in biofilms subsequently treated with sucrose (Fig. 3B) collected at the same time point; the metabolites in the supernatant followed this same pattern. There is evidence that arginine uptake and metabolic pathways are regulated by pH (Burne and Marquis 2000). The arginine-only biofilms rose to a sustained pH of 8 (Fig. 2); therefore, arginine uptake may eventually become inhibited to avoid over-alkalinization. In the sucrose-treated biofilms (Fig. 3B), the pH was lower or fluctuated throughout the experiment, which may have activated specific arginine pathways to protect against the acidity, and a proportion of intermediates (ornithine, putrescine, and citrulline) was secreted into the supernatant. Arginine uptake is mediated by the arginine-ornithine antiporter found in many oral species (Liu and Burne 2009); thus, ornithine is expected to be secreted by the cells.",

Analysis revealed a total of 8 phyla, 54 genera, and 130 species-level OTUs across all biofilms. At the end point of the experiment (54 h), results show a shift in the community structure with increasing time of pretreatment with arginine before the addition of sucrose (Fig. 4). The microbial community results are confirmed by the PCoA plot of UniFrac distances (Fig. 5A). In general, biofilms in which protection from the sucrose-induced pH drop occurred clustered separately from the biofilms in which pH protection did not occur. The stacked bar graphs in Figure 4 show that at each taxonomic level, the biofilms in which sucrose and arginine were both added at Time 0 resemble the community in which only sucrose was added and also appear closer together on the PCoA plot. Conversely, the community that was pretreated with arginine 20 h prior to the addition of sucrose more closely resembled the community in which only arginine was added. The community treated with arginine 48 h before the addition of sucrose appears different from the rest of the biofilms due in part to the large increase in abundance of Veillonella dispar. Notably, treatment replicates clustered closely together on the PCoA, indicating that pretreatment with arginine and subsequent sucrose exposure had reproducible effects on the microbial community.",

Clinical studies with arginine-containing dentifrices have shown caries protection as well as an increase in plaque pH (Acevedo et al. 2008; Kraivaphan et al. 2013; Srisilapanan et al. 2013). In the current study, we tested the effects of arginine treatment on an in vitro oral microbial community using a biofilm model (Edlund et al. 2013; Edlund et al. 2015). With a specialized medium (SHI medium) developed in our laboratory (Tian et al. 2010), we are able to culture and maintain a diverse multispecies oral community and can mimic plaque pH dynamics, allowing for highly relevant investigations into the oral microbiome (Edlund et al. 2013). The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of arginine as a caries therapeutic and its effects on the ecology of the oral microbiota.",

Pretreatment with arginine prior to sucrose exposure was able to protect the biofilms from the drastic pH drop that occurred with no arginine treatment (Fig. 2). We found that this protection correlates with changes that occur in the microbial community in the arginine-treated biofilms (Figs. 4 and \u200band55).",

                    "text": "Previous in vitro studies have shown that arginine treatment has positive effects on the community structure, in some cases increasing the species diversity (Kolderman et al. 2015) or stabilizing the community and preventing potential detrimental species such as Candida albicans from proliferating (Koopman et al. 2015). In addition, investigations of clinical samples have shown that microbial communities isolated from carious lesions are less diverse than those from healthy sites (Jiang et al. 2014; Kianoush et al. 2014; Xiao et al. 2016). In the current study, species richness increased over time in the untreated biofilms as well as in the arginine-treated biofilms; these samples also clustered together in the PCoA plot (Fig. 5). Conversely, in biofilms also treated with sucrose, the species diversity at the end of the experiment is much less. In our model system, it seems that arginine allows for the natural evolution of the community as would occur without any external perturbation, while the introduction of sucrose into the environment halts this progression and results in a less diverse community.",

                    "text": "Beta-diversity analysis revealed that the biofilm communities in which protection from the sucrose-induced pH drop was observed were more alike than the biofilms that were not protected, indicating that the protection is due to differences in the microbial community between the biofilms. Specifically, the phylum Bacteroidetes, including the genus Prevotella, was increased in the biofilms incubated with arginine for 6, 20, or 48 h prior to the addition of sucrose compared to biofilms only treated with sucrose or treated with sucrose and arginine at the same time (Fig. 4). Increased abundance of Prevotella due to arginine treatment was also observed in a previous in vitro study (Kolderman et al. 2015), and earlier studies found that Prevotella intermedia has neutralizing activity at low pH in the presence of amino acids (Takahashi et al. 1997; Takahashi 2003). At the species level, V. dispar and S. anginosus were increased in the arginine-treated, pH-protected biofilms. V. dispar, usually metabolically supported by Streptococcus species, has been previously associated with arginine treatment in vitro (Kolderman et al. 2015; Koopman et al. 2015) and was also found to be an important contributor to pH recovery and neutralization by upregulation of activity and gene expression of arginine catabolic pathways (Edlund et al. 2015). S. anginosus was associated with neutral pH in another in vitro study (Kianoush et al. 2014), suggesting its increased abundance may be a result of the increased pH of the community.",

                    "text": "According to the extended ecological plaque hypothesis (Takahashi and Nyvad 2008), the cariogenic disease process is driven by changing environmental conditions that lead to a shift in the microbial population structure. The plaque community adapts to changing pH; acidic conditions shift the community in the favor of acid producers and acid-tolerant species, while a higher pH favors a community with less cariogenic potential. As a carious lesion develops, the community evolves in a continuum that correlates with the changing pH (Takahashi and Nyvad 2011; Kianoush et al. 2014). The catabolism of arginine by oral bacteria is a major contributor to plaque alkalinity mainly due to the generation of ammonia and other alkaline products via the arginine deiminase system (ADS) and the agmatine deiminase system (AgDS) (Burne and Marquis 2000; Liu et al. 2012). Subjects in a clinical study with an arginine-containing dentifrice showed an increase in ADS activity within plaque as well as a shift in the microbial community (Nascimento et al. 2014); also, Nascimento et al. (2009) had previously demonstrated that caries-free individuals have higher levels of ADS activity compared to individuals with active caries, indicating that this pathway plays an important role in caries protection. In our experimental model, arginine treatment led to an increase in ornithine and citrulline, primary products of the ADS, as well as an eventual increase in putrescine, a product of the AgDS (Fig. 3). In the initial arginine utilization assay, our results show that these products were still detectable in the supernatants more than 6 h after the removal of arginine from the culture medium (Fig. 1), suggesting that the pH-raising effects can last long after the arginine treatment itself is removed. The changing pH gradually modifies the community, and eventually, the acidogenic organisms may no longer be present in large enough numbers to maintain the low pH when sucrose is added. In our model system, protection from a sustained pH drop occurred after 20 h of pretreatment with arginine before sucrose exposure. These results indicate that arginine treatment creates sustainable modifications of the microbial community via alkaline-generating metabolism.",

Because these are early stage (16 h) biofilms, this system reflects the conditions that occur after brushing in the evening, in which biofilm forms overnight. Therefore, addressing the impact of arginine on the early stages of biofilm growth provides valuable, practical information. Using this model, we are able to maintain a complex bacterial community that is highly diverse, reproducible, and well characterized (Edlund et al. 2013). Furthermore, the biofilms respond to a sugar source with a characteristic drop in pH, making the model useful and relevant to in vivo conditions. Overall, the oral biofilm system used here provides an excellent model to test the pH response of oral bacterial communities to various substances and potential therapeutics. Our results show that arginine is taken up by the cells within the biofilm, is readily metabolized, and improves pH homeostasis by altering the microbial ecology, demonstrating its potential as an effective caries therapeutic.",
