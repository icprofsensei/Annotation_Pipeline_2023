Viral transfer, colonization, and reactivation are typically monitored using assays for specific viruses, leaving the behavior of full viral populations (the \u201cvirome\u201d) understudied. Here we sought to investigate the temporal behavior of viruses from donor lungs and transplant recipients comprehensively. We interrogated the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood viromes during the peri-transplant period and 6\u201316 months post-transplant in 13 donor-recipient pairs using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Anelloviridae, ubiquitous human commensal viruses, were the most abundant human viruses identified. Herpesviruses, parvoviruses, polyomaviruses and bacteriophages were also detected. Anelloviridae populations were complex, with some donor organs and hosts harboring multiple contemporaneous lineages. We identified transfer of Anelloviridae lineages from donor organ to recipient serum in 4 of 7 cases that could be queried, and immigration of lineages from recipient serum into the allograft in 6 of 10 such cases. Thus, metagenomic analyses revealed that viral populations move between graft and host in both directions, showing that organ transplantation involves implantation of both the allograft and commensal viral communities.",

The virome of various human body sites, including the respiratory tract (5\u20138), is only beginning to be characterized. Recent studies have shown that Anelloviridae are ubiquitous in the human eukaryotic virome (9). Anelloviridae is a family of highly diverse, non-enveloped, small circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that infect humans and other mammals (9). Human Anelloviridae have not been associated with any diseases, although other small circular ssDNA viruses are important veterinary pathogens (10\u201312). Anelloviridae are likely under chronic immune control given that levels in blood increase in immune-suppressed states (13\u201315). Lower Anelloviridae burden in blood has been associated with solid organ rejection, suggesting that Anelloviridae DNA copy numbers may be a useful \u201cfunctional\u201d indicator of immune status (14, 16, 17). Whether lung allograft rejection might be associated with low Anelloviridae levels within the lung itself, perhaps as an indicator of local immune function, has not been investigated.",

We also observed unexpectedly high levels of Anelloviridae DNA in the lungs of donors prior to organ recovery, and found an association between perioperative Anelloviridae dynamics and primary graft dysfunction (19). In these studies, it was unclear whether Anelloviridae genomes in recipients\u2019 allografts were derived from the donated organ or by entry of circulating viruses present in the recipient before transplantation. It was also unknown whether Anelloviridae from the donor organ could disseminate and establish infection outside the lung. We hypothesized that the abundance of Anelloviridae in the donor lungs would result in virus transfer to immunosuppressed LTxRs and that viruses already present in the recipient might also transfer into the allograft. To test this, we investigated the dynamics of whole viral populations from donor lungs before procurement, and in lung allografts and blood during the first 6\u201316 months post-transplant.",

In contrast, uneven coverage represents reads aligning to conserved genomic regions or cross-contamination between samples. Differences in viral lineage detections, quantities, and homology between groups were tested using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and ANOVA.

Thus, while the specific immune mechanisms responsible for regulating Anelloviridae in vivo are unknown, it has been proposed that monitoring levels in blood might serve as a \u201cfunctional\u201d measure of immune activity to manage organ transplant immunosuppression (14, 16). Our data are consistent with previous findings in blood. In addition, a novel observation here is that Anelloviridae within the lung allograft are also relatively decreased prior to ACR. Since controlling immune activity within the allograft is the key goal of organ transplantation management, further studies appear warranted to determine whether lung Anelloviridae levels might reflect local compartmentalized immune function, and/or could offer actionable information useful in immunosuppression management.",

Additionally, certain individuals had, by chance, some Anelloviridae sequences that were highly similar to those in unrelated individuals. Tracking populations of related yet distinct viral genomes within subjects is challenging, so we combined breadth and depth of genome coverage using the Gini index and compared representation of specific Anelloviridae lineages within and between individuals. We show that some Anelloviridae lineages contained within the donor organ emigrate from the allograft and circulate systemically in recipients. Conversely, some Anelloviridae species from the recipient entered and populated the allograft. Donor-recipient transmission of clinically important viruses during organ transplantation is well-described (50), but engraftment of an entire viral population along with the organ, with bidirectional flow from the allograft to the recipient and vice-versa, is novel.",

Detection of Merkel cell polyomavirus and KI polyomavirus in whole BAL or tissue of lung transplantation patients has been described (52), although DNA in acellular BAL is a novel finding that suggests production of extracellular viral particles, consistent with active viral replication.

Because replicate samples were not available, the effect of sampling stochasticity could not be quantified. Long term storage of BAL and our methods of sample processing may have reduced our sensitivity to detect low abundance enveloped DNA and RNA viruses. Our small sample size limited our ability to compare the magnitude of association of Anelloviridae and ACR in lung versus blood, and the number of subjects in whom we could track individual lineages precluded an analysis of donor versus recipient strain-specific relationship to outcomes.
