The developed method accurately distinguished control samples from those of patients with IBD; the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) value was 0.83 (corresponding to 80.3% sensitivity and 69.7% specificity at a set threshold). The accuracy was maintained among data sets collected by different sampling and sequencing methods. The method identified taxa associated with disease states and distinguished patients with Crohn\u2019s disease from those with ulcerative colitis with reasonable accuracy. The findings were validated using samples from an additional group of 68 patients; the validation test identified patients with IBD with an AUC value of 0.84 (e.g. 92% sensitivity, 58.5% specificity).",

We employed our Synthetic Learning in Microbial Ecology (SLiME) method to classify samples from the existing data set as IBD or control. SLiME is a software pipeline which applies supervised classification algorithm to sequencing data, using associated metadata as the classification label. Demultiplexed sequences are classified into lineages, clustered to select a representative set and used to estimate the abundance of each taxa in each sample. The resulting frequency table is normalized and fed to a supervised classification algorithm. SLiME is based on Random Forests (RFs) [34], which we chose for its accuracy and speed, although we achieved similar results using other supervised learning approaches such as bagging, stacking and support vector machines (see Fig. S1). Applying SLiME to the existing data set yielded accurate classification of patients into IBD or non-IBD groups. Based on repeated ten-fold cross validation, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) \u2013 which is a measure of the overall accuracy of the classification algorithm over the range of possible disease incidence [35] \u2013 was 0.73 (Fig. 1A). Choosing a cutoff on the curve which gives relatively high sensitivity (ie. 87.6%) yields 47.3% specificity, amply surpassing the accuracy of the clustering method originally employed [24].",

[24] data set were encouraging, there are several reasons why they might not translate to a clinically useful diagnostic test. First, samples were obtained invasively through surgical tissue resection from adult patients with advanced disease, and may not reflect changes observed in fecal samples from patients with less advanced disease. Second, the control specimens in the Frank et al. study were largely composed of tissue from cancer patients, and thus were not typical of patients investigated for IBD in the pediatric setting. We therefore designed a new case-control study to evaluate whether fecal samples from children not undergoing surgery could be utilized to differentiate between patients with and without IBD.",

For instance, choosing a cutoff on the curve at relatively high sensitivity (Fig. 1B, circle) yields 80.3% sensitivity and 69.7% specificity for the test.

Table S6 and S7 show how the classifier performs amongst the three disease groups (CD,UC and control) at one arbitrary threshold. To test if the chosen sequencing technology altered the classification of patients into controls and IBD samples, we repeated sequencing for 10 of the samples using the Sanger sequencing method. Supervised learning results, however, were independent of the sequencing method employed (Fig. S2). We hypothesized that some of the improvement in performance might be due to increased sampling depth if a subset of discriminatory bacteria are present at low abundance. To test this hypothesis, we identified the bacterial taxa most strongly associated with IBD (either positively or negatively), and plotted their abundance. As shown in Fig. S3, many of the most informative taxa are present at a level of less than 1% per sample \u2013 the level at which we would expect to see one count or less at the sequencing depth used in Frank et al [24].

To address this question, we measured disease activity by means of standard clinical indices (PUCAI [37], PCDAI [38]), based on symptoms and blood test results [39], and compared to SLiME predictions. While SLiME could not reliably classify on the basis of activity due to the small number of patients in each distinct level of disease severity, we nevertheless observed that overall microbiota diversity was strongly associated with disease activity. As disease severity increased, independently of the type of disease (CD or UC), overall bacterial diversity decreased as measured by the Shannon diversity index (Fig. 4). These results further support the view that IBD reflects an overall GI tract dysbiosis rather than the effect of a small number of pathogenic taxa [20], [24], [40]. Moreover, a number of microbial taxa showed significant association with disease activity levels. Among the most discriminative taxa was the Proteobacteria phylum (Fig. 5, see also Fig. S6). Specifically, the Gammaproteobacteria class was prevalent in all active forms of the disease. Severe disease in particular was associated with the Serratia and Escherichia-Shigella genera as well as the Coryneobacteriacea family.",

To identify microbial groups potentially associated with the establishment of active disease, we compared the composition of bacteria in fecal samples taken during active disease and remission periods. Classification with SLiME could distinguish between active and remission samples with an AUC of 0.72. Amongst the taxa which were significantly associated with active disease (Fig. S7) we found Proteobacteria (q-value <0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test, FDR adjusted [36], E(\u03c00)\u200a=\u200a0.35, see Fig. S8) which was in agreement with previous observations [41]. This finding appears to confirm the hypothesis that before or during active disease Proteobacteria rapidly expand and potentially displace other bacterial groups, such as Actinobacteria. On the other hand, members of the Eubacteriaceae, Incertae Sedis XIV and Bifidobacteriaceae families were associated with remission, which to our knowledge has not been reported previously. The Lachnospiraceae family, Subdoligranulum and Butyricicoccus, a butyrate-producing organism that can ferment dietary polysaccharides, were also associated with remission.",

This observation is consistent with a simple model of antibiotic effect on the gut microbiota: most taxa and bacterial groups are killed by antibiotics, while the few bacterial strains which have resistance survive and increase in relative abundance.",

Classification of pediatric IBD patients into UC or CD at the time of fecal testing is desirable, given the different clinical management of the two diseases. Even though distinguishing UC from CD was not the primary aim of our study design, we found that SLiME applied to the case-control data set could separate UC patients and control patients (Fig. 6A, cross-validated AUC\u200a=\u200a0.82 and 0.83 respectively), but was less accurate in distinguishing Crohn\u2019s disease patients (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.68). When we excluded controls from the data and attempted to distinguish between CD and UC in all IBD patients, we were able to do so with accuracies (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.76,ie. a specificity of 49% at 95% sensitivity) superior to current noninvasive clinical methods [13].",

In this study, we employed SLiME to achieve high sensitivity as well as high specificity in differentiating IBD samples from controls.

Similar approaches could evaluate the efficacy of novel therapies (e.g. probiotics, antibodies), predict the outcome of disease and forecast the timings of flare-ups. While not replacing endoscopy and histological examination as diagnostic tools, we propose that classification based on microbial diversity can be included as an effective complementary technique to aid in the diagnosis of IBD, particularly in pediatric patients.",

Multiple p-values were then converted to q-values, by FDR adjustment [36] and a significance threshold was chosen between q-value <0.01 or q-value <0.05 by estimating the \u03c00 parameter as well as the number of false positives vs. cutoff (see [36] for details).
