This discrepancy may\nrelate to how CC is defined, which in most studies, involves Baker Grade, applanation\ntonometry, or the breast augmentation classification.49-53 These metrics, however, are influenced not only by CC, but also\nthe unique density and volume of the prosthesis, and the elasticity and surface area of\nthe surrounding soft tissue envelope. For example, in two patients with histologically\nidentical capsules, the one with pre-existing glandular ptosis who receives only a\nbreast augmentation with a moderate profile saline implant will have a lower\nintramammary pressure compared to a patient with dense breasts who receives a high\nprojecting cohesive gel implant with concomitant mastopexy. In this case, with the same\ncapsule histologically, one may be a Baker 1 and the other a Baker 3. Baker Grade and\napplanation tonometry are still extremely useful, particularly when repeat measures of\nintramammary pressure are serially applied to the same breast in a longitudinal study\ndesign. However, in a cross-sectional study design when different breasts are compared\nto each other, additional variables are introduced that impact breast\n\u201cfirmness\u201d that may or may not be the result of changes to the capsule\nitself. While Baker Grade in particular was not originally intended to evaluate the\nperiprosthetic capsule around tissue expanders, we utilized this scale along with\napplanation tonometry in the absence of a more specific clinical grading system and also\nsupplemented this recognized deficiency with a robust histologic analysis. The\nunintended widespread use of Baker Grade as a ubiquitous, subjective method to analyze\ncapsular contracture is recognized, and its adaptation for classifying prosthetic breast\nreconstruction has been reported.31 More robust techniques for evaluating capsular contracture including\nclinical assessment with ultrasound elastography,54 computed tomography,55 or histologically have been described,2,9,29,39,56-58 but have yet to be widely\nadopted.",

The species,\nconcentration, and environmental triggers that cause a bacterial biofilm to trigger a CC\nrather than an unrelated immune response have not been described.1 Bacteria may form biofilms as a\nsurvival mechanism to ensure viability when exposed to hostile proinflammatory\nenvironments. It is therefore possible that stressful stimuli independently lead to both\na biofilm and inflammation, rather than the biofilm causing the inflammation. Strong\nevidence shows that antimicrobial therapy induces biofilm formation in\nsome clinical paradigms to confer resistance.94-96 Contrary to\nevidence favoring antibiotic pocket irrigation to attenuate CC rates,20,22 recent cohort studies comparing triple antibiotic to saline\nirrigation demonstrate no difference in CC rates.94,97,98 Elucidating a relationship between\nbiofilm formation and CC merits further study.",
