                    "text": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder in women. Gut microbiota has been implicated to play a critical role in metabolic diseases and may modulate the secretion of mediators of the brain\u2013gut axis. Interaction between gut microbiota and the endocrine and biochemical disturbances in PCOS still remains elusive. Here, we showed an altered gut microbiota significantly correlated with PCOS phenotype. There were 33 patients with PCOS (non-obese PCOS individuals, PN, n = 12; obese PCOS individuals, PO, n = 21) as well as 15 control subjects (non-obese control individuals, CN, n = 9; obese control individuals, CO, n = 6) enrolled in our study. The plasma levels of serotonin, ghrelin, and peptide YY (PYY) were significantly decreased in patients with PCOS compared with controls, and have a significantly negative correlation with waist circumference and testosterone. Sequencing of the V3\u2013V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples revealed the substantial differences of gut microbial species between the PCOS and non-obese controls. Bacterial species were clustered into 23 co-abundance groups (CAGs) based on the SparCC correlation coefficients of their relative abundance. The CAGs increased in PCOS, including the bacteria belonging to Bacteroides, Escherichia/Shigella and Streptococcus, were negatively correlated with ghrelin, and positively correlated with testosterone and BMI. Furthermore, the CAGs that were decreased in PCOS, including the bacteria from Akkermansia and Ruminococcaceae, showed opposite relationship with body-weight, sex-hormone, and brain\u2013gut peptides. In conclusion, gut microbial dysbiosis in women with PCOS is associated with the disease phenotypes.",

Women with PCOS are faced with increased risk of endometrial cancer, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in the long term (Legro et al., 1999; Hardiman et al., 2003; Dumesic and Lobo, 2013). They showed hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology (Landay et al., 2009), and had 2.8-fold higher prevalence of obesity compared to women without PCOS according to a recent meta-analysis (Lim et al., 2013). Although the genetic (Vink et al., 2006), gestational environment (Abbott et al., 1998) and lifestyle factors (Zhang J. et al., 2015) have been suggested to involve in the development of PCOS, the precise underlying triggers for these key biochemical and metabolic disturbances remain largely unclear.",

Further evidence suggests that gut microbiota and its metabolites have the ability to regulate inflammation pathway activation, brain\u2013gut peptide secretion and islet \u03b2-cell proliferation, thus leading to abnormal or excessive fat accumulation, insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia (Vrieze et al., 2010; Barber et al., 2015). The shifts of gut microbiota had been observed in the letrozole-induced PCOS mouse models (Guo et al., 2016; Kelley et al., 2016), and fecal microbiota transplantation from the letrozole-induced PCOS mice to germ-free mice indicated that gut microbiota also has a close relationship with its host\u2019s sex hormone levels, estruscycles and ovarian morphological changes (Guo et al., 2016). In addition, according to another mouse model experiment, female recipients of male cecal microbiota displayed increased testosterone levels, compared with unmanipulated females and female recipients of female cecal micriobiota (Markle et al., 2013). On the other hand, some mediators of the brain\u2013gut axis, such as serotonin, ghrelin and PYY, whose secretion were affected by gut microbiota (Samuel et al., 2008; Yano et al., 2015; Perry et al., 2016), were involved in appetite regulation, systemic energy homeostasis and LH secretion (Konturek et al., 2004; Ogata et al., 2009; Jun et al., 2015). But the experimental evidence of the relationship between gut microbiota, mediators of the brain\u2013gut axis and metabolic phenotypes of PCOS in human is still absent.",

Diagnosis criteria for PCOS established by Chinese Medical Association was based on Rotterdam criteria and the currently available evidences in Han Chinese. In our study, to avoid the confusion due to the different diagnostic criteria, each participant had met the three features based on Rotterdam criteria and the Chinese criteria as follows: oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries (Rotterdam Eshre/Asrm-Sponsored Pcos Consensus Workshop Group, 2004). Women in control group had no history of diagnosed PCOS and did not meet any of the Rotterdam Criteria. Individuals with one of the followings were excluded from the study: pregnancy, androgen-secreting tumors, adrenal disorders, thyroid dysfunction, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, smoking, hypertension, and lipid-dysregulation. Included participants had also no administration of hormonal medication, insulin sensitizer or antibiotics within the preceding 3 months. After submitting written informed consent, all participants with PCOS (n = 33) or without PCOS (n = 15) were then stratified according to BMI into the following four subgroups: obese PCOS patients (PO group, n = 21), non-obese PCOS patients (PN group, n = 12), obese controls (CO group, n = 6) and non-obese controls (CN group, n = 9). Obesity was defined as BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2 and the non-obesity otherwise according to the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2000). The study protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Shanghai General Hospital (No. 2014KY091) ahead of procedure of enrollment.

Adjusting for age and BMI, it revealed that the testosterone level (\u03b2, -2.5296; P < 0.001), neutrocyte count (\u03b2, 0.38753; P < 0.01) and waist circumference (\u03b2, -0.29091; P < 0.05) were independently associated with plasma serotonin levels; the waist circumference (\u03b2, -0.27497; P < 0.05), the PCOS group (\u03b2, -9.447; P < 0.05) and neutrocyte count (\u03b2, 0.41872; P < 0.01) were independently associated with plasma PYY levels; while the testosterone level (\u03b2, -1.3728; P < 0.05), the PCOS group (\u03b2, -12.6121; P < 0.001), BMI (\u03b2, -0.889; P < 0.01), and P2hINS (\u03b2, -0.3382; P < 0.01) were independently associated with plasma ghrelin levels in all participants. Thus, the levels of the brain\u2013gut peptides and the brain\u2013gut indole were correlated with the PCOS related phenotypes.",

In total, 852,886 usable raw reads (264,105 unique sequences) were obtained from all 48 samples. 770,892 high-quality reads (14,480 \u00b1 4,325 reads per sample) were clustered into 567 OTUs at 97% similarity level. According to observed OTUs and the Chao1 index, CN group owned the highest richness, followed by CO and PN group, and PO group showed the lowest richness of gut microbiota (Figures 1A,B), while no difference was found for the Shannon index and the Simpson\u2019s diversity index. CAP and MANOVA based on the Bray\u2013Curtis distance revealed a separation between CN group and the other three groups (Figures 1C,D). Notably, the gut microbiota composition of CO group was more similar with that of PN and PO groups, rather than CN group. CAP and MANOVA based on the UniFrac distance also showed similar trends (Supplementary Figure S1). Thus, the overall composition of the gut microbiota was disrupted in PCOS.",

RDA confirmed that both PCOS and obesity were significantly correlated to the dysbiosis of gut microbiota (Monte Carlo Permutation Procedure, P = 0.0002 and 0.0490, respectively). We identified 28 key OTUs that responded to the differentiation between the four groups according to RDA (Figure \u200bFigure22). OTU4 belonging to genus Bacteroides was enriched in PO group than CN and CO groups (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively), with PN group falling in between them. The average relative abundances of 21 OTUs were higher in CN group than PO group (P < 0.05), which mostly belonged to the genera Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Clostridium IV, Lactobacillus, Oscillibacter, or unclassified genera from family Ruminococcaceae, while in CO and PN groups, the abundances of these OTUs were lower than CN group but were higher than PO group. Five OTUs were enriched in CO group, which belonged to the genera Collinsella, Paraprevotella, Slackia, and unclassified genera from class Clostridia and kingdom Bacteria. OTU7 belonging to Bacteroides showed decreased abundance in CO group, compared with the other three groups (Figure \u200bFigure33).",

There were 225 OTUs shared by at least 20% of the samples were clustered into 23 CAGs based on SparCC correlation coefficients (Figure \u200bFigure4A4A; Supplementary Table S1). The results showed bacteria species in the same genus could have different response to the environment perturbations. For example, OTU5, 86, 506, 393, 491, and 336 belonging to genus Blautia were divided into CAG1 (both OTU5 and 506), 3, 15, 22, and 23, respectively. According to the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, 14 CAGs showed no significant difference between the four groups. CAG1, 4, and 7 were enriched in PO group rather than CN group. CAG 1 contained 14 OTUs, which belonged to genera Bacteroides, Escherichia/Shigella, Streptococcus, Blautia, and Parabacteroides. CAG4 contained 5 OTUs, which mainly belonged to Clostridium XlVa, Alistipes and Weissella. CAG7 contained OTUs belonging to Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Rothia. While, CAG10, 11, 12, and 13 decreased in PO group rather than CN group. The dominant OTUs in CAG10-13 mostly belonged to Akkermansia, Alistipes, Coprococcus, and Ruminococcus. In CO and PN groups, the relative abundances of all these above CAGs fell in between those in PO and CN groups. In addition, CAG17 and 18 showed increased trends in CO group compared with the other groups (Figure \u200bFigure4B4B).",

In the current work, compared to women with obesity or PCOS alone, obese women with PCOS had more deleterious metabolic disorder, including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, in accord with previous studies (Lim et al., 2013; Behboudigandevani et al., 2016). Based on our data, changes of gut microbiota also had trends similar to the variations of metabolic symptoms. Women with obesity and PCOS shared similar dysbiosis of gut microbiota. When compared with women with obesity or PCOS alone, obese women with PCOS possessed a more serious dysbiosis of gut microbiota. We observed that some gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Escherichia/Shigella significantly increased in the gut of PCOS women with obesity. Bacterial LPS produced by gram-negative bacteria has been demonstrate to induce chronic inflammation, obesity, and insulin resistance in LPS-infused mice (Cani et al., 2007). While various experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, have verified that high levels of circulating insulin stimulates the ovarian theca cells to produce androgen (Poretsky, 1991). It suggests that gut microbiota antigen might also associate to the metabolic disorder in PCOS. On the contrary, we found that Akkermensia decreased in obesity and PCOS, which can restore host mucus layer and has been considered to contribute to the reduction in metabolic endotoxemia (Everard et al., 2013). Hence, the dysbiosis of gut microbiota, as increasing LPS-producing bacteria and decreasing protective bacteria, may correlate with the development of metabolic disorder in PCOS.",

Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of ghrelin significantly reduced serum LH level and pulsatile frequency in rats (Ogata et al., 2009). However, the relationship between the levels of serum mediators of the brain\u2013gut axis and PCOS remains controversial in human studies. For example, the ghrelin level had significant difference between PCOS and BMI-matched controls in a Spanish study (Micic et al., 2007), but this orexigenic hormone showed association only with body weight in an Australian PCOS cohort (Samantha et al., 2014). The fasting PYY level also had conflicting results from different cohort (Zwirska-Korczala et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2015). Our study showed that women with PCOS had a significant decrease of serotonin, ghrelin, and PYY level compared with controls, and obesity enhanced the difference of serotonin and ghrelin in PCOS. Moreover, we find that the levels of serotonin, PYY, and ghrelin had a negative correlation with PCOS related parameters, such as waist circumference and testosterone. Our results indicated that the mediators of the brain\u2013gut axis are associated with PCOS.",

It has been shown that serotonin biosynthesis is promoted by spore-forming bacteria isolated from the mouse and human gut microbiota, known to be dominated by Clostridial species, while species belonging to Bacteroides didn\u2019t show this function (Yano et al., 2015). In our study, most of the decreased key OTUs were Clostridial species, and the increased key OTU was Bacteroides spp. in both PCOS and obesity cohorts. PYY secretion is influenced by short chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by gut microbiota (Tremaroli and B\u00e4ckhed, 2012). In the current, we also found the association between ghrelin and gut microbiota. For example, CAG1, which includes Bacteroides, Escherichia/Shigella and Blautia, was negatively correlated with ghrelin, while CAG10, including Akkermansia, was positively correlated with ghrelin. But we did not find a significant association between serotonin, PYY and the gut microbiota, which might be explained by the limitation of small sample size and require further studies. Regardless, according to existing evidences, regulating the mediators of the brain\u2013gut axis might be one of the pathways for gut microbiota to effect on PCOS.",
