Gut microbiota and faecal metabolites are involved in several gastrointestinal diseases. In this study, 16S rRNA-specific denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR analysis showed that the mean similarity of total bacteria was significantly different (P<0.001) in faecal samples from patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; n\u200a=\u200a11) and from non-IBS (nIBS) patients (n\u200a=\u200a8). IBS subjects had a significantly higher diversity of total bacteria, as measured by the Shannon index (H\u2032) (3.36<H\u2032<4.37, P\u200a=\u200a0.004), Bacteroidetes and lactobacilli; however, less diversity was observed for Bifidobacter (1.7< H\u2032<3.08, P<0.05) and Clostridium coccoides (0.9< H\u2032<2.98, P\u200a=\u200a0.007). In this study, no significant difference was found in total bacterial quantity (P>0.05). GC/MS-based multivariate analysis delineated the faecal metabolites of IBS from nIBS samples. Elevated levels of amino acids (alanine and pyroglutamic acid) and phenolic compounds (hydroxyphenyl acetate and hydroxyphenyl propionate) were found in IBS. These results were highly correlated with the abundance of lactobacilli and Clostridium, which indicates an altered metabolism rate associated with these gut micro-organisms. A higher diversity of Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus groups in IBS faecal samples also correlated with the respective total quantity. In addition, these changes altered protein and carbohydrate energy metabolism in the gut.",

IBS cases have been reported worldwide, and it has been shown that adults and adolescents are more prone to developing IBS. In western European and North America, 10\u201315\u200a% of the population have IBS, and 6.6\u200a% of the Korean population are affected (Han et al., 2006). Although the aetiology of IBS has not yet been identified, it is believed that genetic, environmental, psycho-social and physiological factors, as well as an individual\u2019s diet, may be responsible for IBS (Ohman & Simr\u00e9n, 2007). In addition, recent studies have shown differences in the microbiota between IBS diarrhoea patients and healthy controls (Krogius-Kurikka et al., 2009). Short-chain fatty acids were found to be at higher levels in diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients than in other IBS patients (Mortensen et al., 1987).",

Most of the micro-organisms found in the GI tract are anaerobic bacteria, which are uncultivable under standard laboratory conditions. The type and number of bacteria in the GI tract varies depending on age, gender, geographical origin (Mueller et al., 2006) and environmental factors, such as diet and dietary supplements (Kajander et al., 2009). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the dominant beneficial bacteria present in the normal human GI tract, and the latter was reported in lower numbers in constipation-predominant IBS patients (Rajili\u0107-Stojanovi\u0107 et al., 2007). A variety of factors determine the intestinal residential and transient species populations (Heavey & Rowland, 1999). Therefore, the composition and proportion of individual bacterial populations, as well as metabolites, are continuously changing; in addition, the bacterial community depends on diet. As the GI tract harbours complex microbial, digested and non-digested food materials, micro-organisms cannot respond independently. Rather, group-specific bacteria act as a consortium and coordinate other competing microbials as well as the host metabolism, either positively or negatively. The general estimation of diversity and the selected beneficial and predominant community size may be correlated with healthy and diseased GI tracts. Metagenomics-based studies on microbial genomes in the GI tract have provided a more thorough understanding of the indigenous micro-organisms and their contribution to IBS. PCR was previously combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to provide more detailed information on microbial composition and diversity, and their specific roles in IBS (Rajili\u0107-Stojanovi\u0107 et al., 2007).",

Multivariate statistical analysis by partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) has been employed to elucidate significant differences and to screen for potential biomarkers that could account for the variance of biological samples (Gao et al., 2009).",

Briefly, PCR samples were applied to polyacrylamide gels in 1\u00d7 TAE with a urea and formamide denaturing gradient [7 M urea and 40\u200a% (v/v) formamide corresponded to the 100\u200a% gradient] as described by Muyzer & Smalla (1998). Electrophoresis was carried out at 60 \u00b0C with a constant voltage, as described in Table 1. The gels were stained with SYBR Green I (Invitrogen), observed under UV transillumination and documented with a Molecular Imager GelDoc system (Bio-Rad). The PCR amplicons of type strains and a representative study sample were included as markers to provide a possible indication of the identities and to compare bands between the gels. The following type strains were obtained from the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC) or Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC): Bacteroides fragilis (KCTC 3688), Bacteroides vulgatus (KCTC 2639), Bifidobacterium breve (KCTC 3220), Bifidobacterium longum (KACC 20597), Campylobacter jejuni (KCTC 5327), Clostridium clostridioforme (KCTC 5572), Enterococcus faecalis (KACC 13807), Escherichia coli (KCTC 1682), Lactobacillus acidophilus (KACC 12419), Lactobacillus casei (KACC 12413) and Ruminococcus productus (KCTC 3695).",

Based on qPCR analysis, the content of Bacteroidetes was 15\u200a% higher in the IBS samples than in the nIBS samples. Bacteroidetes-specific DGGE profiles were not consistently observed among the subjects and they varied dramatically between samples as well as between the two groups. As the diversity was sample specific, 64\u200a% of the IBS and 50\u200a% of the nIBS subjects were grouped into mixed clusters. In the PCA analysis, nIBS was grouped into PC1 (51\u200a%). Different species of Prevotella were identified with >96\u200a% identity using the database. Bacteroides xylanisolvens was identified in clustered IBS samples (64\u200a%), with a relative concentration ranging from 7.5 to 20\u200a% in the individual samples. Bacteroides fragilis was mostly associated with the male IBS samples (4\u201320\u200a%).",

In addition, significantly different metabolites (P<0.05) were observed in IBS, including glucopyranose and hydrocinnamic acid; however, these metabolites were not comparable to the currently available gut microbiota due to insufficient literature on gut bacteria and its metabolites. These differences in metabolites between IBS and nIBS faeces were highly correlated with changes in the gut microbiota and provide powerful evidence of the microbial diversity in IBS patients.",

The mean similarity between the subjects, as well as in the nIBS cases, was low (<50\u200a%), in agreement with published reports (Codling et al., 2010). Three variable regions (V3\u2013V5) of the 16S rRNA gene produced higher variability in the DGGE profile, which implied a low similarity. In contrast, V3-specific amplicons showed the greatest mean similarity (59.2\u200a%) in the faecal bacterial community in Korean samples (Nam et al., 2008). The Dice similarity and UPGMA analyses of the total bacterial DGGE profiles indicated that the nIBS samples were clustered into two groups.",

The total Bacteroides\u2013Prevotella\u2013Porphyromonas quantity determined in this study was in agreement with previous studies, which have reported a relatively increased abundance of these bacteria in elderly people and in those with infectious colitis (Zwielehner et al., 2009). Faecal carbohydrates and insufficient available nitrogen are the limiting factors for GI bacterial metabolism. Prevotella produces toxic materials under limiting nitrogen conditions, which is challenging to the survival of other bacteria. Transcriptional activation studies have emphasized the prevalence of Bacteroides sp. in other intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (Rehman et al., 2010). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii produces aminobutyric acid, which is a crucial energy source for colonic epithelium and may enhance the integrity of the epithelial barrier and modulate the GI immune system (Lara-Villoslada et al., 2006). Butyrate has also been reported to modulate inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease patients, possibly by downregulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. F. prausnitzii might be important not only for its provision of butyrate to the host but also due to the release of high interleukin (IL-10/IL-12) cytokine levels (Schwiertz et al., 2010).",

A similar instability of the Clostridium group has been observed, and no inter-individual differences between IBS samples were noted (Codling et al., 2010). Direct sequencing has demonstrated that the loss of normal anaerobic bacteria is responsible for the reduction in microbial diversity in IBS (Ott et al., 2004).",

The normal dietary fibre-consuming group contained more bifidobacteria than the group consuming less fibre (Benno et al., 1989). A decrease in the amount of dietary fibres consumed led to a reduction in bifidobacteria, which caused constipation in patients with IBS. Bifidobacterium is a well-documented taxon with regard to its phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics (Schwiertz et al., 2010). Although the diversity was significantly higher in nIBS, no major difference was observed in terms of total number of bifidobacteria. Bifidobacterium breve and Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic combinations have been reported to reduce the severity of IBS symptoms, and the prebiotics oligofructose and inulin selectively stimulate bifidobacterial growth and reduce constipation, predominant in IBS patients (Saggioro, 2004).",

                    "text": "With regard to the Lactobacillus group, neither the IBS nor nIBS subjects clustered separately, as the diversity and abundance were higher in the IBS group but lower for the Dice similarity index. Among the selected 20 phylotypes, 3 different genera and 12 species were matched (>97\u200a%) with either the type strains or isolates from fermented foods. Qin et al. (2010) reported that the abundance of many bacteria varies greatly within individuals over a period of time and even within the phylum level. It has been recognized that probiotic bacteria help human digestive health. However, modern and advanced tools have improved our understanding of bacterial niches and the influence of metabolites. It is understood that the colonic environment has different nutritional patterns and microbial ecosystems, which has a relationship with metabolic niches. The increased level of faecal d-alanine produced by lactic acid bacteria modulates the immune system in a colitis animal model (De Vos, 2005). The elevated levels of purine in faecal metabolites suggested extensive glycogenolysis and glycolysis; it also indicated increased microbial activity in either the proliferation or degradation of bacterial cells. In contrast, qPCR revealed that the quantity of lactobacilli was lower in nIBS patients than in the normal gut, but it was higher in IBS patients, and it has been suggested that lactobacilli and the secreted organic acids may cause IBS symptoms (Tana et al., 2010). The low level of alanine and pyroglutamic acid in nIBS indicates lowered bacterial protease and peptide catabolism, whereas Lactobacillus activity was increased in IBS, as evidenced by the elevated levels of faecal alanine released by protein catabolism (Romick-Rosendale et al., 2009). GI tract proteins are partially hydrolysed as a result of the acidic conditions of the GI tract and produce peptides, which are then broken down by gut microbial proteases to release amino acids (Romick-Rosendale et al., 2009). There are two possible reasons for the elevated levels of faecal amino acids: one is catabolism of peptides by the higher bacterial load; the second is malabsorption of amino acids in IBS patients. The elevated level of gut bacteria is also reflected in energy metabolism changes, thus stimulating gut carbohydrate metabolism. When the carbohydrates and free amino acids are replaced by protein/peptides, the fermented phenolic compounds were increased in the faeces. Lactobacilli produce pyroglutamic acid, bacteriocin, lactic acid and acetic acid, which act as antimicrobials and also lower the pH levels, thus preventing the colonization by other bacterial communities (Engberg et al., 2000; Salonen et al., 2010). Fermentation of tyrosine by proteolytic bacteria ends with phenol products. This metabolic signature is similar to that observed in conditions of stress and trauma under the influence of human physiological changes.",

The IBS samples displayed higher levels of hydroxyphenyl acetate and hydroxyphenyl propionate, which are converted from phenylalanine and plant phenolic compounds by Clostridium spp. as intermediates (Winter et al., 1991). The increased level of aminobutyric acid in IBS was strongly correlated with the presence of F. prausnitzii, which was the most significant n-butyrate-producing gut bacterium, with well-known effects on host energy metabolism and mucosal integrity (Li et al., 2008; Pryde et al., 2002).",

Our results demonstrated a clear discrepancy between the faecal microbial diversity and richness measured as the presence of 16S rRNA gene signatures of bacteria and their metabolic activities. Key bacterial communities were shown to be significantly different in diversity and dominance between IBS and nIBS samples. The diversity and quantity were inter-linked only in the Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus groups. The higher levels of amino acids and phenolic compounds indicated increased bacterial metabolism and also altered energy by the predominant gut microbiota.",
