In this study, we evaluated the performance of six preservation solutions (Norgen, OMNI, RNAlater, CURNA, HEMA, and Shield) for these aspects. Following storage of human stool samples with these preservatives at room temperature for 7 days, three hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V1-V2, V3-V4, and V4) were amplicon sequenced. We found that samples collected in two preservatives, Norgen and OMNI, showed the least shift in community composition relative to \u221280\u00b0C standards compared with other storage conditions, and both efficiently inhibited the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RNAlater did not prevent bacterial activity and exhibited relatively larger community shift. Although the effect of preservation solution was small compared to intersubject variation, notable changes in microbiota composition were observed, which could create biases in downstream data analysis. When community profiles inferred from different 16S rRNA gene hypervariable regions were compared, we found differential sensitivity of primer sets in identifying overall microbial community and certain bacterial taxa. For example, reads generated by the V4 primer pair showed a higher alpha diversity of the gut microbial community. The degenerate 27f-YM primer failed to detect the majority of Bifidobacteriales. Our data indicate that choice of preservation solution and 16S rRNA gene primer pair are critical determinants affecting gut microbiota profiling.",

The study of gut microbiome has been empowered in a culture-independent manner through high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analyses (9,\u201311).

                    "text": "Immediately freezing stool samples at \u221220\u00b0C or below is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d to prevent shifting of microbial community composition (12). However, this approach is not feasible for sample collection in remote areas without reliable cold chain transport, or in studies where subjects are requested to send self-collected household samples to laboratories at ambient temperature. The effects of several storage conditions in revealing microbiota composition have been compared to immediate freezing at \u221280\u00b0C. For example, stool samples stored at room temperature for at most 1 day, or at 4\u00b0C and \u221220\u00b0C for up to 2\u2009weeks, had little effect on microbiota composition shift (13,\u201315). When samples are exposed to room temperature or higher other than ultralow freezing, however, use of preservation methods becomes essential and critical. Ethanol in concentrations of 95% or higher preserved bacterial DNA for long-term storage well (15), but another study has reported low DNA yield as a potential drawback of using ethanol (16). In addition, self-collected household samples stabilized with ethanol (70% and above) might require special shipping, depending upon local transportation regulations. RNAlater, commonly used as a general preservative for RNA samples, has been shown to have decreased DNA purity and to perform relatively poorly in maintaining microbiota composition derived by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (16, 17). Buffers containing EDTA can inhibit the growth of certain bacteria (18), but they significantly influenced gut microbiota profiles, such as an increased abundance of Bacteroides and Proteobacteria and a reduction of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria (13). OMNIgene.Gut, a commercially available approach to preserve stool samples at ambient temperature, has recently been reported to generate community profiles that diverge the least from \u221280\u00b0C standards (13, 19). However, its effectiveness relative to other approaches needs to be independently assessed over longer time scales. Moreover, these prior studies have generally not evaluated the bactericidal ability of preservatives in rendering microbiota samples noninfectious.",

A total of 121,532 high-quality sequence reads for 45 samples (mean \u00b1 SD of 2,700\u2009\u00b1\u2009667) was obtained, clustering into 308 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). These ASVs represented 105 bacterial taxa at genera or higher levels, while 64 were detected at \u22651% relative abundance in at least one sample. The gut microbial community assigned at order level is displayed in Fig.\u00a02A. As expected, the nonpreserved stool samples stored in PBS (8_PBS) and Cary-Blair transport medium (9_CB) at room temperature for 7 days had significant changes in microbiota composition compared to \u221280\u00b0C standards and preserved stocks (samples 1 to 7), as discriminated by a principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) using either weighted or unweighted UniFrac distances (Fig.\u00a02B and \u200bandC).C). Using the Adonis function in R\u2019s package Vegan, however, a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) based on weighted UniFrac distances (df\u2009=\u20092, R2 = 0.504, pseudo-F\u2009=\u200921.346, P < 0.001) found a higher variability in microbial community composition than unweighted UniFrac distances (df\u2009=\u20092, R2 = 0.093, pseudo-F\u2009=\u20092.160, P < 0.01) in separating nonpreserved samples from preserved ones, indicating that the sample clustering was driven more by the proportion of microbial community members than the presence/absence of bacterial taxa. For example, a significant increase of the relative abundance of Enterobacteriales (Fig.\u00a02D) and Fusobacteriales (Fig.\u00a02E) and a reduction of Clostridiales (Fig.\u00a02F) and Betaproteobacteriales (Fig.\u00a02G) were observed in nonpreserved gut samples (Table\u00a0S2).",

The variation was statistically attributed to subjects (df\u2009=\u20094, R2 = 0.779, pseudo-F\u2009=\u200928.034, P < 0.001) but not preservatives (df\u2009=\u20096, R2 = 0.055, pseudo-F\u2009=\u20091.309, P = 0.118) based on unweighted UniFrac distances. In line with these observations, the principal-coordinate analysis supported that microbial variation was mainly associated with differences between individuals (Fig.\u00a03C and \u200bandD).D). In order to examine the small effects of variation by preservation methods, we subsequently calculated the pairwise distances between \u221280\u00b0C standards and preserved samples collected from the same subjects using weighted UniFrac distances, since unweighted UniFrac distances did not reveal statistical significance (P = 0.997) (Fig.\u00a03C). As shown in Fig.\u00a03D (weighted), samples stored in various preservatives exhibited diversified microbial community shifts relative to \u221280\u00b0C standards (intrasubject distance to standard of 0.06 to 0.26) (P = 0.027), suggesting that all preservation methods contributed impacts on the variation in microbiota profiling. We found, however, that two preservatives (Norgen and OMNI) showed the least shift in community composition (mean distance to the standards of 0.09 and 0.09, respectively) while RNAlater had the highest impact (mean distance to the standards of 0.18). Consistent with the pairwise distance comparison, the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Ruminococcaceae UCG-002 increased significantly in samples stored in RNAlater compared to \u221280\u00b0C standards (Tukey honest significant difference [HSD] post hoc test, P = 0.0499 and P = 0.0408, respectively) (Table\u00a0S3). Similarly, an increase of the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium from samples stored in Shield (P = 0.0239) and a decrease of the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae (Eubacterium eligens group) in OMNI (P = 0.0461) relative to \u221280\u00b0C standards were observed.",

In this study, we compared the different performances of primer pairs targeting three hypervariable regions of bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V1-V2, V3-V4, and V4) in profiling gut microbiota composition. Overall, 254,363 and 420,622 high-quality sequence reads (mean \u00b1 SD of 7,267\u2009\u00b1\u20091,139 and 12,017\u2009\u00b1\u20093,799) were obtained with V1-V2 and V4 primer pairs, respectively. When analyses on the divergences of preservation methods in revealing gut microbial community were repeated, the sequences generated by V1-V2 and V4 primer pairs (Fig.\u00a04; Fig.\u00a0S2 and S3) showed similar results as that of V3-V4 reads. The surveyed stool samples mainly clustered by subjects. Although variations in microbiota composition were observed for samples in all preservatives tested, the effects were relatively small (PERMANOVAs using weighted UniFrac distances: V1-V2, R2 = 0.163, P < 0.001; V4, R2 = 0.167, P < 0.001) compared to the high heterogeneity between individuals (V1-V2, R2 = 0.709, P < 0.001; V4, R2 = 0.709, P < 0.001). Samples in Norgen preservative consistently showed the least shift in community composition relative to \u221280\u00b0C standards. Meantime, the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium in samples stored in Shield was significantly higher, as revealed by all three 16S rRNA gene region primer pairs (Table\u00a0S3).",

                    "text": "However, the choice of primers targeting different hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene may specifically impact microbial community profile and bacterial taxon assessment. When all three region reads were combined for principal-coordinate analyses and PERMANOVAs using fragment insertion SAT\u00e9-enabled phylogenetic placement (SEPP) technique, we found strong bias of gene regions in sample clustering based on either unweighted (df\u2009=\u20092, R2 = 0.218, pseudo-F\u2009=\u200942.239, P < 0.001) or weighted (df\u2009=\u20092, R2 = 0.197, pseudo-F\u2009=\u200951.940, P < 0.001) UniFrac distances, although the majority of variability was consistently from differences between subjects (unweighted, df\u2009=\u20094, R2 = 0.527, pseudo-F\u2009=\u200951.073, P < 0.001; weighted, df\u2009=\u20094, R2 = 0.507, pseudo-F\u2009=\u200966.863, P < 0.001) (Fig.\u00a05A and \u200bandB).B). The impact of preservation methods on microbial community shifts was relatively small (unweighted, df\u2009=\u20096, R2 = 0.018, pseudo-F\u2009=\u20091.156, P = 0.198; weighted, df\u2009=\u20096, R2 = 0.122, pseudo-F\u2009=\u200910.707, P < 0.001). We also found that the V4 prime pair showed a higher Shannon diversity for gut microbiota profile than did other primer sets (Fig.\u00a05C), in line with the higher levels of alpha diversity with rarefied V4 region reads (at genus level and above) (Fig.\u00a0S4). The relative abundance of 11 bacterial orders was significantly variable among reads generated by different primers (Fig.\u00a05D; Table\u00a0S4). For example, the commonly used V1-V2 primer pair failed to detect the majority of Bifidobacteriales (mean relative abundance of 0.03% versus 6.40%, P < 0.001) but revealed more Enterobacteriales (5.69% versus 2.57%, P < 0.001) and Erysipelotrichales (3.2% versus 2.0%, P < 0.001) compared to another two primer sets. The V3-V4 primers showed the highest abundance of Clostridiales (56.69% versus 44.12%, P < 0.001), which likely led to the apparent decrease of Bacteroidales (26.91% versus 34.97%, P < 0.001), Betaproteobacteriales (2.45% versus 3.58%, P < 0.001), Coriobacteriales (0.26% versus 0.71%, P < 0.001), and Pasteurellales (0.13% versus 0.31%, P < 0.001). Mollicutes RF39 was amplified only by the V4 primer set, although the relative abundance of this bacterial group was extremely low in the surveyed stool samples.",

The most common sequence variations are shown in Fig.\u00a06, with the corresponding dominant bacterial group(s) in which the sequence variations are observed. It is noted that the V1-V2 forward primer-binding site sequences in most Bifidobacteriales and Chlamydiales 16S rRNA genes were not precisely accommodated by the commonly used degenerate 27f primers, differing at two and three positions from the best-matching 27f-YM primer, respectively. Similarly, the nondegenerate form of the V1-V2 reverse primer used in this study (338R) may have low sensitivity in detecting Planctomycetales, for which three mispairings were identified. The V1-V2 reverse primer (338R) and V3-V4 forward primer (341F) showed mismatches with Mollicutes RF39 16S rRNA genes in two positions, which could confer a low efficiency in detecting this group of bacteria (Fig.\u00a05D). Optimization of primer pools to minimize the mispairing at primer-binding sites is proposed (Fig.\u00a06B).",

Although immediate freezing at \u221220\u00b0C or below has been considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for microbiota preservation, this approach is not feasible for many studies, especially field sampling from remote areas or self-collected samples requiring shipment to the laboratory without cold chain transport. In such cases, a proper preservation method to minimize microbiota composition shift to reduce bias and to inactivate infectious agents for samples to be handled safely becomes critical. Hence, we evaluated the effects of multiple preservation solutions and 16S rRNA gene hypervariable regions in revealing gut microbiota composition. Our data showed that the profile of gut microbiota can change dramatically over a course of 7\u2009days at room temperature in the absence of protection of preservation. The use of a proper preservative without cold chain, in contrast, provides satisfactory prevention of community shifts. The effects of these preservatives were small compared to intersubject variations; however, notable changes in microbiota composition were observed. Nevertheless, we found that two preservatives, Norgen and OMNI, showed the smallest microbial community shifts, and both efficiently inhibited the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, suggesting they may serve as useful solutions for stool sample transportation and storage. Recent studies have reported that OMNIgene.GUT (here called OMNI) is able to stabilize DNA at room temperature for up to 14\u2009days, with little difference in microbiota composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (13, 15, 19, 21). RNAlater, a commonly used preservative for RNA samples, on the other hand, exhibited larger community shift in bacterial relative abundance at room temperature for 7\u2009days, consistent with previous reports that the microbial community in RNAlater may lose stability at longer time frames when maintained at ambient temperatures (12, 15, 16, 22). However, under cold conditions (e.g., 4\u00b0C or \u221220\u00b0C) or for a short period of room-temperature storage (e.g., within same or another day), it performed equally well as other storage conditions, such as 95% ethanol, FTA cards, and OMNIgene.GUT (21, 23, 24). Interestingly, RNAlater and CURNA (with similar components as RNAlater) do not prevent bacterial activity, highlighting themselves as potential alternatives for microbial sample collection when live bacterial culture is necessary. According to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, HEMA was initially developed for the stabilization of buffy coat samples and there was no previous report evaluating its use as preservative for samples intended for microbiota studies. Shield performed well in microbiota preservation and disinfection but consistently showed increased relative abundance of Faecalibacterium regardless of the choice of 16S rRNA gene primer pairs. We recommend the use of Norgen or OMNI for microbial sample preservation and caution against RNAlater for long-term storage at ambient temperatures.",

                    "text": "Choosing primers to target certain regions of the 16S rRNA gene for bacterial taxonomic profiling is another difficult challenge, and the comparability of primers with microbes from various communities requires attention (25, 26). The V1 to V4 region, for example, is more divergent than V4 to V7 and can provide a higher resolution in bacterial clustering for stool samples (20, 27). In this work, we compared the performance of three commonly used primer pairs targeting the 16S rRNA gene V1-V2, V3-V4, and V4 regions in profiling gut microbial community and found a higher alpha diversity and richness revealed by V4 primers. Our results also indicate an immense impact of primers with regard to amplification of bacterial taxa. Close examination of primer-binding sites revealed several sequence variations within cohesive phylogenetic groups (e.g., Bifidobacteriales) that are not accommodated by the commonly used 27f primer sequence. In such cases, the use of pooled primers to minimize mismatches with this bacterial group will provide an effective approach for revealing the true bacterial diversity (26, 28, 29). Knowledge of how primer pairs differentially amplify bacterial taxa is important for study design and relating results to prior studies. Alternatively, the quickly developing next-generation sequencing platforms, such as PacBio and Nanopore, may facilitate the characterization of full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes and allow global comparisons of microbiome studies across sample types and gene regions (30,\u201332).",

We expand the current understanding of the performance of several DNA and RNA preservation solutions, including CURNA and HEMA, to our knowledge being evaluated for the first time, in retaining gut microbiota composition. The data provide a useful reference for knowing the biases introduced by storage conditions. We have expanded the knowledge of bactericidal ability of the surveyed preservatives that may provide alternatives in study design considering the potential of infectious agents and bacterial culture. We have also identified the significant difference of 16S rRNA gene primer pairs in charactering bacterial taxa and emphasized the importance of a consistent methodology for large epidemiological studies. Nevertheless, one of the shortcomings of this study is the small sample size and the conserved sample source (5 subjects who were all male, young, and healthy), which may underestimate the impact of preservation solutions and primer pairs in charactering the diversity of gut microbiota. Further methodological comparison is needed to expand to other settings, including patient groups and population-based epidemiological studies. Only sequencing-based evaluation was performed in this work, while the concordance of preservation solutions in other omics studies, such as proteomics and metabolomics, may be largely variable. For example, RNAlater was reported to be not feasible for metabolomics measures probably due to its high sodium sulfate content, making the preserved samples incompatible with metabolomics platforms (22, 33). Last, more robust qualitative and quantitative testing under variable conditions, such as extreme temperatures, increased freeze-thaw cycles, or longer storage periods, may provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness and stabilization of storage methods at preserving microbial DNA quality and yield.",

Choices of preservation solution for transportation of stool samples at ambient temperature and of gene region for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing are critical determinants impacting the observed microbial community profiling. We recommend the use of a proper preservative, such as Norgen or OMNI, that can minimize microbial community shift and efficiently inactivate bacterial growth, allowing the resulting samples to be handled and shipped safely and stably. Amplicon sequencing-based human microbiota studies are highly dependent on choice of primer pairs targeting different hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.
