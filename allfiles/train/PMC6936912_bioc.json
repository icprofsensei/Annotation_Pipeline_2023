It has previously been shown that extraction techniques are impactful for the analysis, however, these studies have often been performed with a single cultured sample, or with evenly distributed mock communities, failing to provide variability often seen with human source samples and excluding the impact of amplification and/or sequencing related bias.",

Additionally, there were unexpected genera found within these communities indicating contamination uniquely introduced by each protocol. Trends were noted among different kits, in either over- or under-representation of specific genera of communities. Similar trends were observed in the results of sequencing controls, indicating the contamination and/or bias introduced after extraction. Overall, these findings illustrate the importance of utilizing controls at multiple stages of the process, to better assess the impact of the findings of any human samples.",
