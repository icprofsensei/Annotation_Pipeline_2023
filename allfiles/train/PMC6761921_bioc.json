However, the former has detrimental side effects on the health of individuals, even after the cancer is cured, due to the impact of treatment on development. Recently, correlations have been made between the gut microbiome and cancer in several studies but only on adult participants. There is always a complication of dealing with pediatric cancer treatment protocols because they usually include a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and intensive prophylactic antibiotics. In the current study, a pilot study was conducted to analyze ten fecal samples from three pediatric cancer patients, suffering from rhabdomyosarcoma near their pelvic region, and two healthy individuals. A correlation between microbial composition and response to treatment was reported, in which the responders had generally a lower microbial diversity compared to non-responders. In addition, nucleotide changes and deletions in the tested 16S rRNA sequences post radiotherapy were detected. Despite the small sample size used in the experiments due to the uncommon rhabdomyosarcoma in children, the results can help in understanding the influence of radiotherapy on the gut microbiome in pediatric cancer patients. More work with larger sample size and different cancer types need to be conducted to understand the influence of radiotherapy on gut microbiome to mitigate the deleterious impact of radiation on treated children.",

The gut is considered the richest in colonization in terms of classification, diversity, and amount of bacteria. Many other factors also play a role in the microbial distribution and colonization such as age, medical condition, and environment (Morelli, 2008; Neish, 2009; Sekirov et al., 2010). The set of microbes inhabiting a certain organ or tissue is known as the microbiome or collectively defined as \u201cthe microbiome cloud\u201d (ElRakaiby et al., 2014). The gut microbiome is highly inconstant in different states of health and disease and highly affected by different factors, starting from childbirth such as age, diet, and genetic factors (Aziz, 2009; Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010; Yatsunenko et al., 2012; Odamaki et al., 2016). Microbial imbalance as a result of infection or medication side effect is known as microbial dysbiosis (Hall, Tolonen & Xavier, 2017).",

It was reported that the gut microbiome can go through remolding for gynecological cancer patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy. The remolding was associated with diarrhea in most of the patients understudy (Nam et al., 2013). Several studies addressed the effect of chemotherapy on gut microbiome and consequent occurrence of dysbiosis. One study showed the effect of chemotherapy on pediatric cancer patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia. It was found that during the treatment course, the microbial diversity was generally low and unstable when compared to the healthy individuals at the same age (Van Vliet et al., 2009). Another study addressed the effect of a common chemotherapy, 5-fluorouracil, on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and reported severe damage to GI wall along with several changes in the microflora composition (Stringer et al., 2009). Moreover, it was found that germ-free mice that were exposed to lethal doses of radiation were resistant to post radiation injuries (Mclaughin et al., 1964; Crawford & Gordon, 2005). However, the effect of radiotherapy on the gut microbiome was mainly addressed in adults rather than pediatric cancer patients.",

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer; yet, it is highly aggressive and requires up to 50.4 Gy of gamma radiation along with a complex set of chemotherapeutic agents. It represents 3\u20134% of pediatric cancers and usually occurs at the age below 18\u00a0years. Due to the scarcity of the disease in children, only ten fecal samples were collected from five male participants, three cancer patients and two healthy controls. The samples were collected from patients at three different time points; before, mid (25.2 Gy\u201328.8 Gy), and after (50.4 Gy) radiotherapy treatment.

The analysis was completed on QIIME 2 pipeline (version 2017.12) (Bolyen et al., 2018), q2cli command line interface. The denoise command was used followed by length trimming to 230 bp. Feature table was constructed on the same program using Deblur approach. The Deblur approach uses an error profile that operates on per-sample bases and depends on the read length and diversity in amplicon sequences. Thus, it offers a higher sensitivity and requires lower computational power compared to other OTU clustering algorithms (Amir et al., 2017). Taxonomy classes were assigned using the constructed feature table in comparison with SILVA database (Silva-119 99% OTUs full-length sequences). Unrooted phylogenetic tree was also constructed on QIIME 2 (qiime phylogeny fasttree). The taxonomic classification was appended to the feature table and exported as a biom format file. The phylogenetic tree was exported as Newick tree format and the sequences corresponding to the classified OTUs were exported into a fasta file. All exported files from Qiime2 analysis were imported to phyloseq package (McMurdie & Holmes, 2013) on R-CRAN for figure plotting and further analysis. It is important to mention that reads were not rarefied to an even sampling depth (McMurdie & Holmes, 2014). Shannon Entropy was calculated from Fasta sequences of Streptococcus and Escherichia-Shigella bacterial genera using Oligotyping software (Eren et al., 2014). The threshold was selected as 0.2 (Eren et al., 2014) above which the variation in considered as mutation rather than sequencing error.",

From the bacterial genera identified (Table\u00a0S1), two were randomly selected to determine Shannon entropy at a single nucleotide position (comparing before radiation to after radiation at the same nucleotide position). The entitled analysis was performed on Streptococcus and Escherichia-Shigella. Shannon entropy increased (Figs. 5 and \u200band6)6) at definite nucleotide positions in both genera and post exposure to radiation. Values below 0.2 were considered as sequencing errors and accordingly excluded. Escherichia-Shigella, gap insertions were clear (Fig. 5) to reach the best sequence alignment, which indicates a high probability of single point mutations in the bacterial DNA post radiotherapy. It is important to note that the Shannon entropy was performed only on a definite sequence length (approx. 200 bp from V3\u2013V4 region of the 16S rRNA of the bacterial genome).",

Comparing the alpha diversity of patients before radiotherapy to healthy controls showed an expected variation due to prior treatment with chemotherapy and antibiotics, as the healthy controls had higher alpha diversity. While alpha diversity per individual before and after treatment did not follow a constant pattern post radiation, some patients had experienced an increase except of one who experienced a decrease in alpha diversity post exposure to radiation. The discrepancy could be linked to treatment response, since the responders had low bacterial abundance while the non-responder had higher bacterial abundance. This observation comes in agreement with Crawford and colleagues who described the effect of radiation on germ free mice that were found to be resistant to lethal doses of ionizing radiation (Crawford & Gordon, 2005).",

The decrease in Firmicutes was associated with Proteobacteria increase in three patients. This pattern agreed with previous results of Wang and colleagues (Wang et al., 2015). The Shannon entropy analysis shed the light on the possibility of DNA mutations in the bacterial taxa that were found to be resistant to radiotherapy and were constantly increasing across all samples. The choice of 16S rRNA encoding gene for mutation analysis could be controversial due to sequence variability in both variable and the conserved regions (V\u011btrovsk\u00fd & Baldrian, 2013; Yang, Wang & Qian, 2016; Martinez-Porchas et al., 2017). Oligotyping software also provides values for Shannon\u2019s entropy, through which the changes could be judged and referred to sequencing error (values equal to or below 0.2 are excluded) or real mutations/changes due to external factors being tested. Accordingly, this pilot survey can be followed up with further mutational analyses across different bacterial genes post radiation to study the potential impact of radiation on acquiring the bacteria resistance to antibiotic.",

The treatment protocols usually combine chemoradiotherapy with prophylactic antibiotics to suppress any possible infection because the patient\u2019s immune system is highly compromised. The gut microbiome in children starts to develop untill reaching the adults composition. Therefore, it is crucial to detect any imbalance occurring at this critical stage due to cancer or treatment. Moreover, several studies linked the state of microbiome to the response of treatment (Iida et al., 2013; Alexander et al., 2017; Gerassy-Vainberg et al., 2018; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018). Thus, such profiling before and after treatment is highly needed to aid the physicians in determining the treatment plan for each patient according to his/her microbial diversity.",

In addition, a relationship between the microbial diversity and response to treatment was inferred, in which the increase in alpha diversity was related to a non-responsive radiotherapy treatment. Such a relationship could be useful in the prediction of response to treatment or the enhancement of treatment by microbial remolding. Moreover, a close insight to the bacterial 16S rRNA sequence via multiple sequence alignment to determine Shannon\u2019s entropy was described, before and after 50.4 Gy of radiation directed to the pelvic region. Several indels were pinpointed in the 16S rRNA sequences after the radiation course, which indicates a high probability of finding other mutations in the bacterial genome post exposure to radiation that might be detrimental. Finally, a decline in beta diversity was recorded along with the increasing in exposure to radiation. Although this study had limitations in the number of participants and sampling points due to the nature of cancer and patients\u2019 age, it gives an initial insight for the possible mutations occurring in the bacterial DNA post cancer treatment and the link between the microbial diversity and the response to treatment. The study is a start to offer a different angle for personalized treatment progress for pediatric cancer patients, based on the microbial profile rather than following a constant roadmap for the treatment protocol.",
