Using preterm pigs, we investigated the metabolic fate of HMO in three experiments with two different HMO blends. In addition, we examined effects on the colonic microbiota in the presence or absence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Thus, preterm pigs (n = 112) were fed formula without or with HMO supplementation (5\u201310) g/L of a mixture of 4 (4-HMO) or >25 HMO (25-HMO) for 5 (Experiment 1 and 2) or 11 days (Experiment 3). Individual HMO were quantified in colon contents and urine using MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry) and HPAEC-PAD (high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection). Microbial colonization was analyzed by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene tags. Intestinal permeability was measured by lactulose to mannitol ratio in urine. HMO supplemented to formula were detected in urine and colon contents in preterm piglets after 5 and 11 days in all three experiments. The amount of HMO excreted via the gut or the kidneys showed large individual variations. Microbial diversity in the colon changed from high levels of Firmicutes (dominated by Clostridium) at day 5 (Exp 2) to high levels of Proteobacteria dominated by Helicobacter and Campylobacter at day 11 (Exp 3). Colonic microbiota composition as well as HMO excretion pattern varied greatly among piglets. Interestingly, the 5-day supplementation of the complex 25-HMO blend led to low concentrations of 3-fucosyllactose (FL) and lacto-N-fucopentaose (LNFP) I in colonic contents, indicating a preferred utilization of these two HMO. Although the interpretation of the data from our piglet study is difficult due to the large individual variation, the presence of Bifidobacteria, although low in total numbers, was correlated with total HMO contents, and specifically with 2\u2032FL levels in colonic content. However, early supplementation of formula with HMO did not affect NEC incidence.",

                    "text": "Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that benefits of human milk for infants are partly explained by the abundance of complex oligosaccharides. Proposed functions concern their interactions with gut microbiota, the prevention of pathogen adhesion to the epithelium, effects on gut maturation or an influence on the developing brain (1\u20137). So far, the first human trials with one or two single human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), 2\u2032fucosyllactose (FL) or 2\u2032FL plus lacto-N-neo-tetraose (LNnT), in term infants demonstrated that the new formula were safe and lead to growth rates comparable to those found in term human milk-fed infants (8, 9). Within this context, metabolic aspects of HMO are an important issue as, for example, currently discussed systemic effects such as an influence on inflammatory processes or on brain functions and activity require the preceding absorption of HMO. Indeed, HMO have been detected in the circulation of breast-fed infants (10, 11). To investigate metabolic pathways of single HMOs, studies in infants are limited due to the low HMO availability and also for ethical concerns. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate alternative animal model is an important point to consider. In animals, it has been shown that some HMO can be absorbed (12, 13). As rats, however, do not seem to be suitable for HMO metabolic studies, we used pigs which may have a translational advantage based on the physiological similarity between pigs and humans with regard to the gastrointestinal tract, its delayed maturation and high natural sensitivity to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) after preterm birth (14, 15).",

Breast-fed infants were shown to have lower NEC incidences than formula-fed infants (18). In rat pups, three studies showed that the addition of HMO such as disialyl-lacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT), 2\u2032FL or 2\u2032FL plus sialylated galactooligosaccharides, the latter not being present in human milk, decreased NEC incidence (19\u201321).

Because of the potential for synergistic effects among different HMO, we investigated for the first time effects of a large range of HMO, e.g., mixtures containing either 4 or >25 HMO, the latter reflecting the complex oligosaccharide composition in human milk.

The infant formula was chosen to include a more translational aspect into the longer term experiment. At the end of the experiments, pigs were anesthetized (Zoletil 50, zolazepam/tiletamin; Boehringer Ingelheim, Copenhagen, Denmark), euthanized by injection with sodium pentobarbital, and biological material was collected. Colonic content and urine taken from the bladder were snap-frozen for determination of HMO, colonic microbiota composition, and intestinal permeability. Tissue samples were collected for evaluation of NEC as reported previously (19). Collection of colonic contents and urine could not be achieved from all animals in amounts necessary for all analyses; thus, the number of samples analyzed is given in the corresponding figures.",

After the amplification of fragments with adapters and tags, these were purified and clean constructs were quantified prior to library pooling, by using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The 2 \u00d7 250-bp sequencing reaction followed the standard procedure of Illumina MiSeq for pair-end reads. After sequence generation, the reads were demultiplexed and paired followed by a clean-up step to truncate primers, remove low quality sequences, and chimeras following the default settings of the UPARSE pipeline. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were picked with USEARCH at >97% sequences identity and classified using Mothur (v.1.33.3) and the RDP database (31, 32).

At the phylum level, only Firmicutes were detected in the 5-day experiment when preterm piglets were fed the 4-HMO blend, with Clostridium, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus being most abundant (Figure 5A). When the complex 25-HMO blend was supplemented within a 5-day period, only few more genera were present. Again, Clostridium and Enterococcus accounted for more than half of all bacteria (Figure 5B).",

In contrast to the 5-day experiments, Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum with mainly Camphylobacter and Helicobacter at the genera level. Furthermore, at the genus level, some Bifidobacteria which are well-known for their abilities to consume HMO, were detected in both HMO-fed and control pigs, with only slightly higher proportions in HMO-fed piglets compared to controls (P < 0.11). Nevertheless, an inverse correlation was found for Bifidobacteria density and total HMO concentrations in colon contents (P < 0.05). An even stronger inverse correlation was found for 2\u2032FL, but not for other HMO (Figure 6). No correlation was found for Lactobacillus and Bacteroides.",

Analyzing urine and feces across three different experiments, we found large individual variations in HMO excretion. This was particularly the case in the 4-days experiment (Figure 4) whereas after 11 days this large variation was markedly reduced. Due to the low number of individual samples, it is unclear at the moment whether the excretion is related to the relative distribution of HMO in the formula diet.",

Their concentration in the colon was very low although they belonged to the major HMO components in the 25-HMO blend. LNFP I is typically found in human milk of secretors (about 70\u201380% of the population) and shares similar functional epitopes with 2\u2032FL which is currently considered to be a highly potent HMO. 3-FL regularly occurs in human milk, but has until now received limited attention as compared to its structural isomer 2\u2032FL (25). In addition, the linkage of fucose on C-atom 2 of the galactose moiety of 2\u2032FL turns it into a structure with a high potential as an anti-adhesive and anti-inflammatory component. Although the secretor-specific \u03b11-2-fucose linkage is missing in 3-FL, an in vitro inhibiton of Norovirus binding has been reported for both isomers (34). While 3-FL might be primarily utilized by gut microbiota, as it is low in both, colon content and in urine, LNFP I seems to selectively be taken up and excreted in relatively large amounts in urine (Figure 3B). Another interesting observation regarding 2\u2032FL is that whenever the fecal excretion of 2\u2032FL was high, the excretion of all other HMOs in the same animal was high as well suggesting an overall low microbial activity.",

A gradual change in the fecal oligosaccharide profile in breastfed infants during the first six months postpartum has been reported, without LNT being identified in fecal samples (37). This is in contrast to our previous data (26, 35, 36, 38), where we detected LNT in all fecal samples from human term-born infants whenever HMO were excreted. In infants, there is a large variation in the amount and pattern of HMO excretions, ranging from large amounts to no excretion at all. The reason for this divergence is not known but may be related to a different gut microbial composition and, hence, a different HMO metabolism in the intestinal lumen. For example, LNT, the major core structure of HMO, was initially considered to be a unique growth promoter of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis although others, e.g., Bifidobacteria breve also use intact LNT (39, 40). In future studies, it is important to relate HMO metabolism in the gut lumen to subspecies level. In the present study we observed that microbial colonization in the two 5-day experiments was limited to Firmicutes (Experiment 1) and relatively low numbers of Actinobacteria and Bacteriodetes (Experiment 2), consisting mainly of Clostridium (cluster I) and Enterococcus. In Experiment 3 (11-day supplementation of the 4-HMO blend), more bacterial phyla were found, with Proteobacteria (mainly Campylobacter and Helicobacter) as the predominant phylum. Bifidobacteria were also detected but in lower abundance. There were no changes in the microbial colonization of the pigs when supplementing formula with the 4-HMO blend. The high abundance of Proteobacteria in the 11-day experiment is in agreement with observations in a study with preterm infants who were fed formula supplemented with HMO from pooled human milk (no specification of HMO were given) (41). The authors report low levels of Bifidobacteria and no Lactobacilli, concomitantly with increasing numbers of Clostridia and an unexpected trend toward an increase in Proteobacteria in both groups. Although the interpretation of the data from our piglets is difficult due to the large individual variation, the presence of Bifidobacteria, although low in total numbers, was correlated with total HMO contents, and specifically with 2\u2032FL levels in colonic content. The importance of 2\u2032FL particularly for Bifidobacteria through the interaction with a newly identified ABC transporter as a key genetic factor for the utilization of 2\u2032FL and other fucosylated oligosaccharides has been thoroughly discussed by Matsuki et al. (42). This could be important, as recent reports indicated a strong association of the secretor genotype with the composition of Bifidobacteria in the human intestine (43, 44).",

This data resemble the situation in human infants with no clear excretion pattern neither in term nor in preterm infants; (ii) HMO supplemenation was not related to NEC, bacterial colonization or intestinal permeability; (iii) the 5-day supplementation of the complex 25-HMO blend led to low concentrations of 3-FL and LNFP I in colonic contents, indicating a preferred utilization of these two HMO; (iv) In colon, only the abundance of Bifidobacteria, although low in total numbers compared to other microorganisms, correlated with total HMO in colon content and specifically with 2\u2032FL, (v) Increasing the HMO supplementation period to 11 days lowered the fecal excretion of HMO. Thus, intestinal immaturity, together with delayed bacterial colonization and low bacterial diversity, may lead to a different metabolic fate of HMO during the first 1\u20132 weeks after preterm birth. A sufficient gastrointestinal maturation may be required to observe clear benefits of HMO, both locally in the gut and beyond.",
