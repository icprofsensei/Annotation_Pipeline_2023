Poor understanding of the exact pathophysiology and mechanisms of preterm birth hampers development of effective prediction and prevention strategies. Decades of research have linked maternal infection to preterm birth (2-7), yet a causative microbe remains elusive and paradoxically antibiotic therapy does not mitigate the risk (8-11). Recent advances in culture-independent sequenced-based characterization of the vaginal bacterial microbiome have revealed new insights into normal bacterial communities of the vagina in non-pregnant women (12) and microbial communities that are associated with increased risk for preterm birth in pregnant women (13-15). Data from recent microbiome studies demonstrate that high diversity bacterial communities in the vagina early in pregnancy and instability of the vaginal bacterial communities are associated with preterm birth (13-15). However, bacterial communities alone are not sufficient to discriminate women at risk for preterm birth, suggesting other factors need to be explored.",

Vaginal eukaryotic DNA viruses and bacterial communities were studied together in a cohort of healthy adults as part of The Human Microbiome Project, using culture-independent, high-throughput metagenomic shotgun sequencing (16). Viruses were detected frequently in vaginal samples from many of the healthy, asymptomatic women. Some viruses were also detected in the same subject over time, suggesting women were persistently infected with the viruses. Eukaryotic DNA viruses were associated with high-diversity bacterial communities in the healthy subjects from the Human Microbiome Project (16), and this has also been demonstrated in other studies (17-19). This suggests a dynamic relationship between viral infections/clearance, bacterial communities, and the host. Taken together, these data suggest that viruses may be important yet unappreciated components of the vaginal microbiome.",

ViroCap is a panel of biotinylated probes that target all vertebrate viruses with sequenced genomes as of February 2014 in NCBI RefSeq, Genome Neighbors, and Influenza Virus Resource (337 species from 34 viral families). Probes are tiled across the complete genome lengths. When nucleic acid similar to a target virus is present in a sequencing library mixed with the ViroCap panel, the biotinylated probes bind the complementary viral nucleic acid. The viral nucleic acid is then enriched by capturing the biotinylated probes with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and washing to remove unbound material. For this study, targeted sequence capture was carried out using ViroCap according to the Roche NimbleGen instructions. After enrichment, libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA).",

This pipeline is adapted from our previously described methods (16,20,21), in this case updating alignment algorithms to include BWA-MEM (22) for nucleotide sequence alignments and DIAMOND (23) for translated amino acid sequence alignments. In brief, sequences were trimmed to remove low quality nucleotides and sequencing adapters, and low complexity sequences were masked. Human sequences were identified by aligning reads against the human genome reference HG37 using BWA-MEM, and aligned sequences were removed from subsequent analysis. Non-human sequence reads were subject to nucleotide and translated amino acid sequence alignments against viral reference sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) public database to identify putative viral sequences. These sequences were then subject to alignment against the comprehensive NCBI nt/nr databases to confirm viral identity. Sequences were considered viral only if they were unambiguously assigned viral taxonomy. Viral taxonomy was assigned to the genus level by default, signal due to cross-talk between pooled samples was subtracted (20), and viral alignments were manually reviewed to assign subgenus classification, including the subtyping of human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Anelloviruses (consisting of the genera alpha-, beta-, and gamma-torqueviruses) were placed into a single group, as genus-level subtyping is frequently inaccurate when based on short, Illumina sequences. Because sequencing library preparation and targeted sequence capture methods contain amplification steps, virus detection is not strictly quantitative. Therefore, we consider viral results as presence/absence for all analyses.",

No single virus or viral group was associated with preterm birth in our cohort. While previous studies have shown that bacterial community diversity early in pregnancy is associated with preterm birth, our data indicate that higher viral richness in the vagina is also significantly associated with preterm birth. This was true for both women with spontaneous and indicated preterm birth subtypes. Furthermore, women who had both high bacterial diversity and high viral diversity early in pregnancy had the highest risk for preterm birth suggesting that consideration of both bacterial and viral communities is critical for interpretation of associations between the microbiome and preterm birth.",

The first trimester appears to have the highest magnitude of difference in viral diversity between term and preterm birth patients. Therefore, the first trimester time point could be clinically useful to identify women at risk or not at risk for preterm birth and allow enough lead time to individualize surveillance and treatment plans.",

While infection and inflammation have been classically associated with the spontaneous preterm birth subtype, the finding of increased viral diversity in both preterm birth subtypes may be explained by the overlapping risk factors for both types of preterm birth (36-38). Additionally, indicated preterm birth is a competing outcome for spontaneous preterm birth. For example, if a microbial pattern is associated with a risk for spontaneous preterm birth, but an indicated preterm birth occurs first, the microbial pattern may be detected in a patient even though the etiology of the preterm birth was classified as indicated. In short, once a patient is delivered for a maternal or fetal indication, it is unknown whether a spontaneous preterm birth might have occurred later.",

First, although Lactobacillus-poor bacterial communities are associated with the presence of eukaryotic viruses in non-pregnant women (40-44), including in our sequence-based study of the Human Microbiome Project cohort, we did not observe the same association in pregnant women. This finding could be due to the dynamic changes in bacterial and viral diversity occurring as a result of pregnancy, which may alter bacterial-viral relationships seen in non-pregnant women. The question of whether the relationship between bacterial diversity and the presence of eukaryotic DNA viruses is affected by pregnancy or not could be tested by sampling the same women before conception and throughout pregnancy. This would also be a useful study in order to ascertain dynamic changes in the vaginal bacterial microbiome and virome that occur during the transition from the non-pregnant state to pregnancy.Second, these findings highlight changes in the microbial communities of the vagina over pregnancy in both patients with term and preterm birth. Although we found viral richness to be associated with preterm birth there are patients with high viral richness who do not deliver preterm. Future research should focus on integrating not only microbiological signatures but also host response. Third, these studies could be expanded to include other body sites and microbes. The gut microbiome, for instance, has been shown to change during pregnancy (45,46). This may enhance energy harvest from food, but changes may also reflect states of stress or immune response within the mother (46). Changes in both the vaginal and gut microbial communities are important to consider as they may affect the microbes transmitted to the fetus or newborn (46-49). As for microbes, while we have explored bacteria and eukaryotic viruses in our studies, future work could also include the study of bacteriophage. Bacteriophage in the gut may provide means for dynamic changes and resilience, two critical features for microbial community health (50-52). During pregnancy, bacteriophage may have a role in affecting the dynamic changes that have been observed in bacterial communities of the gut and vagina.",

Particularly, the polyomaviruses JC and BK are typically found in urine and may represent contamination of the swab during sampling. Some of the viruses we detected (adenovirus, varicellovirus) have been previously detected in samples from the female genital tract (53-55), although they are not viruses typically associated with the vaginal microenvironment. The anelloviruses are ubiquitous and found in many human tissues, including blood, nasal swabs, and stool, although they are not associated with symptomatic infections (56,57).
