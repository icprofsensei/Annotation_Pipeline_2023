Women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at high risk of HPV infection, as well as cervical disease [2], and these risks increase with diminishing CD4+ T-cell count [3\u20135]. A prior study by our group also showed that, in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women, the prevalence of HPV is high among those with bacterial vaginosis (BV) [6], a dysbiosis often characterized by a low abundance of Lactobacillus species, high pH, and immune cell infiltration. Interestingly, while HPV infection was associated with both BV as well as HIV in that earlier study, these relationships were independent of one another [6], as BV itself was not more common in HIV-infected than in HIV-uninfected women.",

Some studies have also reported that vaginal bacterial communities specifically dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus are associated with lower pH than those dominated by other lactobacilli [8]. This may be important because vaginal pH has been associated with HPV detection. For example, one frequently cited article found a 10%\u201320% lower risk of HPV detection in subjects with a vaginal pH a < 5.0 than in those with a vaginal pH of \u2265 5.0 [9]. It is therefore noteworthy that a recent study found no relation of vaginal pH levels with HIV status [7], a result consistent with our earlier report showing no relation of HIV seropositivity with BV (discussed above).",

We hypothesized that the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacillus species, most notably L. crispatus. Consistent with this, a high RA of L. crispatus has been associated with reduced risks of BV and STIs in several studies [8, 12\u201314]. However, data regarding the cervicovaginal microbiota and its specific relation with HPV infection are limited. In particular, there is a paucity of longitudinal studies of the cervicovaginal microbiota and HPV [15], and even among cross-sectional studies few have involved HIV-infected women. Last, despite considerable speculation that cervicovaginal pH may mediate the effects of the microbiota on HPV infection, no studies have, to our knowledge, assessed whether statistical control for pH weakens the HPV-microbiota association, which would be expected if pH was part of the causal pathway.",

Specifically, 3 study groups were defined: HIV-uninfected women (n=22); HIV-infected women with rapidly progressive immunosuppression, defined as an initial CD4+ T-cell count of >500 cells/mm3 followed by a drop to <200 cells/mm3, with a poor immunologic response to therapy (<100 cells/mm3 increase over a year) during the observation period (n = 20); and HIV-infected women with a stable immune status, defined as a CD4+ T-cell count of >500 cells/mm3 throughout the observation period, who were frequency matched at the index visit to those with rapidly progressive immunosuppression (n = 22). Matching was conducted using MatchIt, based in the R programming language and statistical software [17, 18]. The matching criteria included age (<40 years, 40\u201349, and >50 years), cigarette smoking, sexual activity (frequency and number of partners), and male condom use. The exclusion criteria were current laboratory detection of gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, or chlamydial infection at the index visit or exchange of sex for drugs or money at >5 visits during the observation period. These inclusion/exclusions criteria were intended to limit the factors that needed to be addressed while studying the original scientific question, namely, the influence of HIV on the cervicovaginal microbiota. In a separate independently conducted study, the presence of HPV DNA in CVLs was longitudinally assessed semiannually in all WIHS women with available specimens over a similar period of 8\u201310 years or more [5].",

Pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V1-V2 region amplicons was performed as described previously [8, 10]. Briefly, universal primers 27F and 338R were used for PCR amplification of the V1-V2 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes from genomic DNA extracts. The 338R primer included a unique sequence tag to barcode each sample. Barcoded amplicons were pooled in equimolar concentration and pyrosequenced on a Roche/454 Life Sciences FLX instrument. QIIME software [23] was used to bin the sequences based on their barcode, trim the primers and barcodes, and remove sequences with homopolymeric runs longer than 8 base pairs and those with ambiguous base calls and run shorter than 100 base pairs. Detection of chimeric sequences was performed using the UCHIME component of UCLUST, and chimeric sequences were removed. Taxonomic assignments were performed using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier trained on version 10 of the RDP database [24, 25]. The presence of amplification in subject samples was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, while negative controls (no template) were also subjected to PCR and showed no amplification. In general, each sample was run once since our previous studies indicated that duplicates of the PCR amplification and pyrosequencing have low variability [8, 10]. Nonetheless, repeat testing of several current samples across batches and runs was conducted and showed little variability in results between these runs. For the 398 samples in the current study, we obtained 2 387 346 high-quality sequences, with an average of 6266 sequences (range, 183\u201340 627) from each sample. Despite these several steps and results, as in other microbiome studies, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of bias due to sequencing variability, primer bias, and sequencing platform biases.",

To cluster pyrosequencing 16S rRNA results into corresponding community state types (CSTs), we used hierarchical clustering based on RA with Euclidean distance and Ward linkage.

The associations of SDI or CST with prevalent HPV detection were assessed using generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression, as previously described [29]. These models address serial testing of women over time (ie, repeated cross-sectional measures of association with prevalent HPV detection at each visit) and potential concurrent multitype infection by HPV, while accounting for the intraindividual correlation of the repeated observations. This approach made it possible to incorporate all the available type-specific HPV data at each person-visit, as well as time-updated covariates. It is a highly efficient analytic method, widely used in HPV research [30, 31]. In addition to CSTs, we conducted a priori\u2013planned analyses of the RA of lactobacilli (at the genus and species level), modeled as both continuous and ordinal data. Histograms of Lactobacillus species as a group (Figure \u200b(Figure1)1) and individual species suggested similar cut points of low (<7.5%), medium (7.5%\u201382.5%), and high (\u226582.5%) RA. Vaginal pH was also examined as a continuous and an ordinal variable (with cut points based on the Amsel criteria for diagnosis of BV [10]). All covariates except study group were time dependent. Furthermore, to study temporal associations related to changes in CSTs and HPV detection over time, we used continuous-time multistate Markov models fit using maximum likelihood, as described in an earlier article [15]. All tests were 2-sided, with a P value of .05 used to define significance.\n",

Figure \u200bFigure22 displays a heat map of the RA data for the 25 most abundant genera or species and how they cluster within each CST. L. crispatus dominated CST I, CST II was dominated by Lactobacillus gasseri, both CST III and IV-A were dominated by Lactobacillus iners, and CST V was dominated by Lactobacillus jensenii. Figure \u200bFigure22 additionally shows the SDI for each study visit, and as expected CSTs I through IV-A and V (each dominated by a single Lactobacillus species) had a low SDI, compared with CST IV-B. The figure also presents the proportion of oncogenic HPV\u2013positive women-visits for each CST.\n",

These models adjusted for HIV study group, time-updated covariates, and intra-individual correlations between repeated cross-sectional measures of association with prevalent HPV (see \u201cMethods\u201d section). While CST I (L. crispatus dominated) had an inverse association with detection of any HPV and especially with any oncogenic HPV, the relationship was of borderline statistical significance (eg, odds ratio [OR] for oncogenic HPV was 0.30 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .08\u20131.11]; P = .07). In contrast, when we assessed the RA of individual Lactobacillus species, characterized in an ordinal fashion (Table \u200b(Table4),4), we observed stronger, statistically significant associations with detection of HPV. Briefly, high (vs low) RA of L. crispatus was significantly associated with a lower relative odds of any HPV (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, .24\u2013.96; Ptrend = .03) or any oncogenic HPV (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, .01\u20131.59; Ptrend = .03). However, no associations were found between any HPV or oncogenic HPV detection and the RA of L. iners, L. gasseri, or L. jensenii (data not shown). In addition, no association between pH and HPV detection was observed in any of the above multivariate models, regardless of how pH was parameterized, including as a continuous or as an ordinal based on Amsel criteria. Nor did exclusion of pH from the above models discernibly alter any findings (data not shown). When we assessed SDI tertile instead of CST or Lactobacillus species in multivariate GEE logistic regression models, we found significantly higher oncogenic HPV detection in women in the highest SDI tertile (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.18\u20133.52; Ptrend = .01), relative to those in the lowest SDI tertile.\n\n",

The transition rate ratio (TRR), a value that can be thought of as similar to a hazard ratio [15], was 0.17 (95% CI, .04\u2013.79; P = .02) after adjustment for study group, and this effect estimate was little changed (TRR, 0.20; 95% CI, .03\u20131.14; P = .07) by adjustment for additional covariates, indicating that the most appropriate model was the parsimonious model adjusted only for study group.",

We predicted these results, because earlier (largely cross-sectional) studies had found inverse associations between L. crispatus abundance and the risks of several STIs [32\u201334]. Further, the one previous longitudinal study of cervicovaginal microbiota and HPV, as well as cross-sectional studies in Rwanda and South Africa, each reported inverse associations of HPV prevalence with CSTs dominated by L. crispatus or with L. crispatus RA [15, 32]. To our knowledge, the current study is the first investigation involving serially repeated molecular characterization of the vaginal microbiome and its relation with oncogenic HPV in HIV-infected women. This allowed us to conduct an exploratory analysis in which we prospectively assessed transitions between CSTs over time and found that transition to an L. crispatus\u2013dominated CST was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of a new (previously undetected) HPV type. If correct, these data could reflect either a reduction in the rate of newly acquired (incident) HPV infection or reduced recurrence/reactivation of previously acquired HPV.",

While there has been considerable discussion in the literature regarding the potential antiviral effects of low pH and its possible role in explaining the beneficial activity of Lactobacillus species against STIs, most of that research preceded widespread use of methods for comprehensively assessing the cervicovaginal microbiome [11]. The growing evidence of species-specific (eg, L. crispatus\u2013related) relationships between the cervicovaginal microbiome and HPV infection argues against a significant role of pH, since production of lactic acid is a common attribute of lactobacilli as a group, and our data showed that the greatest association with pH was with the RA of Lactobacillus species, not for L. crispatus RA or CSTs dominated by L. crispatus. Thus, biologic mechanisms other than pH are likely involved in the anti-HPV activity of L. crispatus.",

An antiviral effect of d-lactic acid would be consistent with our results for oncogenic HPV, since L. crispatus produces d and l isoforms of lactic acid, whereas L. iners produces only l-lactic acid [35, 36]. L. gasseri and L jensenii also produce d-lactic acid, and their RAs were nonsignificantly inversely associated with HPV detection in the current study. Thus, high d-lactic acid levels but not acidity per se could be associated with reduced infection and/or transmission of certain viruses, including HPV.",

On the other hand, bacteriocins produced by L. crispatus may have antiviral effects. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides and proteins [37, 38]. Relatively little has been written regarding the bacteriocins produced by cervicovaginal Lactobacillus species, with most of the bacteriocin literature to date focused on Lactobacillus species inhabiting the gut. L. crispatus has additionally been noted to have potential immunomodulatory activity. For example, Candida albicans growth in vitro was inhibited via modulation of Toll-like receptors 2/4 by L. crispatus in epithelial cell culture [39].",

These include the relatively small number of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects, even though longitudinal testing of nearly 400 CVLs was performed. This was addressed in part by the use of efficient analytic methods able to incorporate all available serial HPV and microbiome data. However, larger prospective studies will be needed to more comprehensively study the relation of the cervicovaginal microbiome to the full natural history of HPV, including the presence and development of cervical disease. These clinical/pathologic end points were too infrequent in the current data set to adequately study. Nor did we have sufficient data to assess statistical interaction (eg, by immune strata), and it may require subanalyses among sexually inactive women to help differentiate reactivation of previously acquired from newly acquired (incident) HPV. The study also focused on only premenopausal African American women, which was done to reduce the number of factors being studied. Thus, future studies will need to include women with a broader range of age, menopausal status, and race/ethnicity.",

However, if the current data are confirmed in large prospective cohort studies, randomized clinical trials of L. crispatus (eg, as a probiotic vaginal suppository) to reduce HPV and cervical disease might be appropriate, even if the mechanisms remain uncertain.
