HPV infection related cervical microbiome could be an induce factor of cervical cancer. However, it is uncommon to find a single test on the market that can simultaneously provide information on both HPV and the microbiome. Herein, a novel method was developed in this study to simultaneously detect HPV infection and microbiota composition promptly and accurately. It provides a new and simple way to detect vaginal pathogen situation and also provide valuable information for clinical diagnose. This approach combined multiplex PCR, which targeted both HPV16 E6E7 and full-length 16S rRNA, and Nanopore sequencing to generate enough information to understand the vagina condition of patients. One HPV positive liquid-based cytology (LBC) sample was sequenced and analyzed. After comparing with Illumina sequencing, the results from Nanopore showed a similar microbiome composition. An instant sequencing evaluation showed that 15\u2009min sequencing is enough to identify the top 10 most abundant bacteria. Moreover, two HPV integration sites were identified and verified by Sanger sequencing. This approach has many potential applications in pathogen detection and can potentially aid in providing a more rapid clinical diagnosis.",

Microbes can contribute to digestive disorders (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) and disease processes, such as an association with the degenerative lesions seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease, autism, depression3 and carcinomagenesis4. Furthermore, in gastric cancer, the presence of Helicobacter pylori is considered a major contributing factor5; while Fusobacterium species are associated with colorectal cancer6. Moreover, various studies have indicated that an altered microbiome can be associated with disease7,8. In HPV-positive women, cervicovaginal bacterial diversity is more complex relative to those who are HPV-negative9,10, which indicates that there may be a direct relationship between the cervical microbiome and disease development. In addition to bacteria, viruses have also been shown to be causative agents in disease11, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) associated with liver cancer, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and human papilloma virus (HPV) associated with cervical cancer12,13. So far, more and more studies found some virus integration status significantly correlated with disease development status, especially in HPV integration of cervical cancer14.",

                    "text": "While cervical cancer is one of the most common female cancers worldwide, a detection method that provides an economical, convenient, and accurate clinical screening approach is still required. Current cervical cancer screening methods are usually based on high-risk HPV DNA or RNA genotyping, or on the detection of cytological and/or molecular changes in cervical cells via an immunostaining method, such as a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear15. Most of the screening methods just target HPV instead of microbiome. However, several studies have identified a correlation between a microbiome with HPV and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical cancer16. One study identified a correlation between the cervical microbiota and CIN stage, with the co-effect of the microbiota and HPV determined to influence CIN risk17. Fusobacteria, including Sneathia, are the species most strongly correlated with HPV infections17. Additionally, another study showed that of the vaginal flora, Lactobacillusis the dominant species can protect against other pathogens18. Other studies have suggested that during an HPV infection, the microbiome balance may be disrupted, with other species, like Gardnerella vaginalis and Chlamydia trachomatis, meanwhile, Lactobacillus gasseri and other anaerobic species becoming more prevalent9,19,20. This vaginal microbiome alteration may then affect pathogenesis by affecting immunity or increasing the growth of pathogenic strains21. With more and more studies revealing that microbiome alterations can serve as disease diagnostic indicators, with the potential to be used as early screening triage markers for cervical cancer22, and aid in the development of analytical methods for detecting the microbiome, such as 16S rRNA sequencing, they have gained interest23.",

However, studies utilizing next-generation sequencing technology have predominantly used the V4 or V3V4 regions for identification26\u201328, while other studies have used other regions29,30. When determining which region to utilize, some regions provide more information when utilizing short sequencing reads31, while others are more informative when a taxonomic approach is employed32; therefore, some researchers utilize a full-length 16S rRNA sequence for analysis. With the development of third-generation sequencing technology, it is now possible to completely sequence a full-length gene with a maximum read length up to 2 Mb33. In one study, this technology was utilized to sequence the 16S rRNA gene and showed that accurate results can be obtained when compared with Illumina sequencing results34. However, this approach is not as portable as employing a Nanopore in the application. In a study evaluating mouse full-length 16S rRNA sequencing obtained using Nanopore or Illumina, with the V3V4 region utilized, the Nanopore sequencing provided better annotation results at the specie level35. However, due to the relatively high error rate that is associated with Nanopore sequencing, its application in clinical studies is still very limited.",

The annotation results from the Illumina platform were then compared with the Nanopore results at the phylum, class, order, and genus levels (Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary Tables\u00a0S2 and S3). When examining the bacteria, both platforms identified 4 phyla, 7 classes, 10 orders, 15 families, and 20 genera (Supplementary Tables\u00a0S2 and S3). Several conclusions can be drawn from the results: (1) both of the platforms identified p_Firmicutes, c_Bacilli, o_Lactobacillales, f_Enterococcaceae, and g_Enterococcusas being a significantly dominant population, with 85% and 94% relative abundances in the Illumina and Nanopore results, respectively. (2) The Illumina results have more unique taxonomic units than the Nanopore results, with the Nanopore results having only one unique genus (Vagococcus, 0.035%), while the Illumina results had multiple at the phylum (3/7), order (6/16), class (6/13), family (18/33), and genus (31/51) levels. These findings suggest that the Illumina platform is more sensitive and can detect more bacterial categories when compared with Nanopore. The difference could also be attributed to Illumina generating larger datasets with more sequencing depth or differences in the QIIME pipeline for short and long sequence reads. (3) While Illumina identified more unique taxonomic units, the two platforms generated an overlapping bacteria list for each level, with orders having an 80% overlap and belonging to the top 10 orders, while other units were all associated with the highest units (Supplementary Table\u00a0S2). Based on the calculated high abundance taxonomic unit results, there is only one unique Illumina units in the top 5 phyla, 3 in the top 10 classes, 2 in the top 10 orders, and none in the top 15 families or top 20 genera. These findings indicate that most of the unique units identified by using the Illumina V4 method are at a low abundance and may be attributed to an experimental or analytical bias. (4) Without performing any additional analytics, the identified taxonomic unit results when comparing the Nanopore and Illumina results show a strong concordance among the most abundant bacteria at each level (Supplementary Table\u00a0S3). When comparing the two platforms, the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation results gave a 0.9265616 at the phylum level, 0.8796751 at the class level, 0.8409996 at the order level, 0.7095144 at the family level, and 0.6583039 at the genus level. In conclusion, the Nanopore platform detected the dominant Enterococcus genus and 20 other genera that overlap with the Illumina V4 results. Furthermore, when examining the 16S rRNA, they were 100% consistent at the genus level, which strongly suggests that the Nanopore platform can provide acceptable results by sequencing a full-length 16S rRNA. (5) BV-related bacteria within the Illumina results were examined, and 10 genera were identified, with Bacteroides, Prevotella, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Peptostreptococcus also identified by the Nanopore platform (Supplementary Table\u00a0S4).",

The results annotated 5,574 reads to 23 genera (reads\u2009\u2265\u20092), with only 3 species clearly annotated using the QIIME_GreenGenes method, while the reaming 20 genera could not be annotated using this method (Fig.\u00a03a, Supplementary Tables\u00a0S5 and S6). The LAST_GreenGenes method identified 53 genera (reads\u2009\u2265\u20092) and annotated 19 species, with only 6 species of the overlapped genera identified. Since most of the genera were without specific specie annotations, the LAST_NCBI database was utilized to attempt to obtain better annotation results. By using this method, all 127 genera (reads\u2009\u2265\u20092) were annotated with at least one specific species. Overall, 197 specific species were found, including 70 species belonging to the 10 overlapped genera (Table\u00a02, Supplementary Tables\u00a0S5 and S6). When comparing all three of the analytical methods, only two genera, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus, had specie annotations in all three methods. When using the LAST_NCBI method, 7 of the 10 overlapped genera were identified in multiple species, especially Enterococcus, with over 90% of the identified reads annotated to 33 specific species. Another genus, Peptoniphilus, was classified to eight specific species (Supplementary Tables\u00a0S5 and S6). Overall, these comparison results clearly show that a significant improvement in specie annotations can be obtained when using the LAST_NCBI analysis method.",

The results showed that when extracting as few as 4,459 reads from the total sequenced reads, the Nanopore platform can detect the top 10 abundant species that were identified when utilizing all of the sequencing results. Statistical and correlation coefficient analyses showed that there is no significant difference when using a subset of the reads or the total number of reads in terms of identifying bacterial species. These findings indicate that using this Nanopore amplicon library sequencing method can enable both HPV and microbiota species to be identified in as short as about 15\u2009min when using this sequencing process. Overall, from the point of DNA extraction through sequencing, with sequencing times varying from 10\u2009min to several hours, the process takes an average of 6 h. However, while the combination of multiplex PCR and Nanopore sequencing to detect HPV virus and other potential microbial pathogens in clinical samples looks promising, further examination into the applicability of this rapid detection method is required.",

HPVDetector was used to analyze the integration sites and the results identified a number of integrations, with HPV16 E1 and L2 (NC_001526.4) significantly enriched in LRP1B on chromosome 2 within the human genome (GRCh37/hg19). The integration site distributions are shown in Supplementary Tables\u00a0S9 and S10, and the integration sites located within 200 bp are recognized as one. In the LRP1B gene, 4 sites were found to be integrated with HPV16 E1 or L2, with at least 10 sites identified by HPVDetector (Table\u00a04). The location of HPV and LRP1B was calculated based on the average values of the merged locations. Overall, a total of 461 potential HPV integration sites were discovered in 22 different genes (Supplementary Tables\u00a0S9 and S10). These identified high integration sites were then validated using Sanger sequencing, and a total of two unique HPV16 integration sites in the LRP1B gene were verified (Fig.\u00a04).

To investigate the role of microbiota in human health, including microbiotahost interactions and microbiota associations with diseases, especially cancers46,47, several methods have been employed for determining the microbial community composition from clinical samples48. Conventionally, microbial diversity analyses have focused on the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene and have utilized the Illumina platform49. However, the short sequencing reads obtained when using this platform often limit the microbial composition analysis at the species level due to a high similarity between the 16S rRNA amplicon sequences35. To overcome this limitation, obtaining a full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence using the Nanopore MinION sequencing platform has been explored29,50,51. In this study, a new strategy enabling the simultaneous analysis of an HPV infection and microbiomes using Nanopore sequencing was explored and shown to be effective.",

Furthermore, another study established an amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) workflow for predicting Newcastle disease viral virulence and genotype and was able to correctly identify NDV genotypes in all serial dilutions with an accuracy of 98.37%~100% after only 7\u2009min of sequencing53. Additionally, another study developed a portable system for analyzing 16S rRNA using a Nanopore sequencer and was able to detect 20 bacteria in a mock sample after 5\u2009min of sequencing, with the results being consistent with those obtained after 4 h of sequencing54. Herein, data analysis and sequencing were not performed simultaneously, but the above procedure was mimicked by partially extracting the data and analyzing it separately. The results presented herein show that even a small portion of the Nanopore data can identify high abundance bacteria accurately when compared with the results analyzed from all of the Nanopore sequencing reads. Future studies should focus on establishing a bioinformatics procedure that can combine the Nanopore sequencing and the detection of clinic pathogens in a timely fashion.",

Herein, a similar conclusion was not drawn, possibly due to this study utilizing the GreenGenes database for taxonomy annotations. This database did not have specie annotations for some of the identified reads, especially for the genus Enterococcus that comprised over 80% of both the Illumina and Nanopore sequencing results. To improve the annotations on the species level, the NCBI database was also employed and 15,221 bacterial species were identified, compared to the 4,309 bacterial species that were identified with the GreenGenes database. However, the NCBI database is not compatible with the QIIME software that was needed to compare the two platforms. Thus, the development of a database with more up to date species annotations would improve future studies and enable a more thorough evaluation of the advantages of third-generation sequencing of a full-length 16S rRNA56.",

While the error rate of this platform is still under debate, it shows clinical applicability for use as a rapid detection system for viral or bacterial detection50,58\u201360. Various studies have shown that utilizing certain data correction methods can significantly minimize the error rate. For example, CANU61 and MECAT62 can be used to do self-correction with Nanopore sequencing data or hybrid Illumina/Nanopore datasets, with this improved accuracy potentially broadening the applicability of this technology. Furthermore, some studies have even used this platform to accurately sequence antibiotic resistance sites63. Herein, only LAST was utilized to analyze and annotate the Nanopore sequencing. While the exact error rate of the sequencing data was not determined, the results showed a high degree of comparability with the Illumina results. One major reason could be that the most abundant microbe was present in several genera, thus providing enough coverage of the genus to annotate. In addition to the most abundant genera, the other genera with a relative abundance of about 0.03% could still be detected. These findings indicate that this method is feasible for detecting low abundance bacteria in clinic samples. However, further studies need to establish the lowest limit of detection.",

The main screening methods for cervical cancer are Papanicolaou (pap) smear, cervical liquid-based cytology, cervicography, cervical biopsy or HPV testing64\u201366. The liquid-based cytology (LBC) is widely used in the detection of gynecological specimens, vaginal or uterine, for the screening or diagnosis of cervical epithelial lesions67. Recent reports have increasingly focused on utilizing LBC in combination with HPV-DNA detection when screening for cervical cancer to improve accuracy and sensitivity in pathogen detection19,21,67,68. Studies examining correlations between the cervical BV-related microbiome, HPV screening and HPV infection, and cervical microbiome alterations have shown that there is a certain correlation between an HPV infection and the occurrence of cervicitis, cervical lesions, and cervical cancer69\u201371, while the vaginal microbiome plays a functional role in the persistence or regression of HPV infections and the occurrence of cervical cancer8,72. Lee et al. showed that Fusobacteria, including Sneathia spp., can serve as a possible HPV microbiological marker73. Furthermore, another study reported that the vaginal microbiome in high-grade (HSIL) samples is characterized by higher levels of Sneathia sanguinegens (P\u2009<\u20090.01), Anaerococcus tetradius (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (P\u2009<\u20090.05), while lower levels are characterized by Lactobacillus jensenii (P\u2009<\u20090.01) when compared to intra-epithelial lesions (LSIL)8.

Herein, a method based on molecular nucleotide information was utilized to define the microbiome information by successfully analyzing a liquid-based cytology sample and identifying an HPV infection and bacterial content. Although only one sample was used in this study, the findings support its future applicability of this method to define HPV and its types and infections. In this study, only one primer was designed, HPV16 E6E7, but there are tens of high-risk HPV types that exist. Of these, some types are prevalent in human samples, including cervical samples, head and neck samples, and more than ten kinds of human organ-related samples. Furthermore, full-length 16S rRNA sequencing can promptly provide a patient pathogen profile to aid in performing a clinic diagnose, including applications in bacteria discovery in meningitis75, liver abscess40, and empyema54. Thus, this workflow developed to detect HPV and the microbiome can be expanded to study other clinic samples and can aid in clinic diagnostic applications outside of cervical cancer.",

The level of HPV integration was reported to be positively correlated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades and has even been proposed as a marker for disease progression77,78. Moreover, another study found that HPV integration in LRP1B decreases its protein expression70. HPV integration in LRP1B has also been found in oropharyngeal squamous cell samples79. This study identified and verified two major HPV16 integrations (E1 and L2) in the human LRP1B gene. While many other integration sits were sequenced by the next-generation sequence, Sanger sequencing can only detect high abundance sequences due to the limitation of the technique. Thus, the other identified integration sites will have to be verified using other more sensitive molecular detection methods that are able to verify low abundance sequences in the future. Nevertheless, these results show correlations with previous studies. This study showed that this patient was not only infected with HPV16, but the virus was also integrated, thus indicating a potentially carcinogenic attribute to cervical cancer which requires further attention. Overall, identifying HPV integration breakpoints in the human genome and elucidating the mechanisms of integration can enable a better understanding of HPVinduced cervical carcinogenesis. Furthermore, it is also beneficial to discover novel and more specific biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",

Additionally, four HPV16 L2 or E1 integration sites within the LRP1B gene were identified, with two of them verified using Sanger sequencing. A deep analysis was performed to examine HPV infection and microbiome features associated with the examined patient sample to establish a broad potential application for HPV and microbiome analysis in a clinical setting.
