Besides, whether patients with CDI have alterations in the enteric virome and the extent of such changes have also not been studied. In this study, we postulate that bacteriophages may interact with host microbes and influence the clinical outcome after FMT. We herein performed ultra-deep virus-like particles\u2019 (VLPs\u2019) metagenomic sequencing and 16S rDNA sequencing to determine enteric virome and bacteriophages\u2013bacteria interactions in subjects with CDI compared with healthy controls. We also serially assessed changes in the virome post FMT and examined whether bacteriophage transfer is associated with the clinical outcome of FMT. To our knowledge, this pilot study is the first and largest to date to characterise the enteric virome alterations in CDI and to elucidate changes in viral communities after FMT and its relatedness with treatment outcome.",

Consecutive CDI subjects enrolled into this RCT were invited to participate in a substudy of assessment of faecal microbiota. Patients were included if they had three or more loose or watery stools per day for at least two consecutive days, or eight or more soft or loose stools in 48\u2005hours, and a positive stool test for C. difficile based on a two-step testing algorithm in our hospital, a positive GDH (glutamate dehydrogenase) screening test followed by a positive PCR test of C. difficile. A total of 24 subjects with CDI and 20 healthy household controls were recruited, and stool samples at baseline were obtained for analyses of virome and bacterial microbiome. Among them, 14 CDI subjects consented to have stool samples collected serially after treatment for microbiome analysis. Nine CDI subjects were treated with FMT and five were treated with vancomycin, and they were followed up at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 10 and 16 after treatment (see online supplementary figure 1). One patient FMT6 had recurrent CDI. This patient had five previous episodes of CDI prior to FMT. Subjects in the FMT group received 5\u2005days of vancomycin followed by donor-infused stool via nasojejunal route, and those who had standard therapy (STD) received oral vancomycin 500\u2005mg four times per day for 10\u2005days. A computer-generated randomisation schedule was used to assign patients to the treatment sequences. All patients kept a stool diary and were questioned about stool frequency and consistency and medication use.",

Among the common viral orders detected, the most abundant in both CDI and healthy household controls was Caudovirales, one taxon of a consortium of temperate double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages. Compared with healthy individuals, CDI subjects had a significantly higher abundance of Caudovirales (figure 1A), but a decreased diversity of Caudovirales at the species level (figure 1B) and at the contig level (see online supplementary figure 2A). There was also a significant decrease in the richness and evenness of Caudovirales in CDI compared with healthy controls (figure 1C, D). In line with that, the rate of acquisition of new Caudovirales taxa in control samples rapidly outpaced new taxa acquisition in CDI samples, further demonstrating a lower Caudovirales richness in CDI than in controls (see online supplementary figure 2B). At the family level, CDI showed a decreased abundance of Microviridae compared with that of controls (figure 1E), as well as a decrease in Microviridae diversity (see online supplementary figure 2C). In contrast, the abundance of Anelloviridae was increased in CDI compared with controls (figure 1E). Using linear regression test, we found no significant correlation between the diversity or richness of Caudovirales and age, gender, household relationship or time of sample collection (see online supplementary table S1). After adjusting for multiple comparisons, no significant correlation was shown by MaAsLin between viral abundances and age, gender or time of sample collection. There was however a correlation between viral abundances and household relationship (False Discovery Rate (FDR) multiple comparison adjusted q<0.05) which suggests a household effect on the gut virome structure. In healthy controls, there was a significant inverse correlation between Caudovirales and Microviridae, Caudovirales and Anelloviridae, which was not seen in CDI (figure 1F). Overall, these findings indicate dysbiosis of the enteric virome in patients with CDI.",

However, norovirus subjects had a significantly lower abundance of Caudovirales and Anelloviridae (both p<0.05) compared with healthy controls, while no marked difference was observed in the relative abundance of Microviridae between norovirus subjects and controls (see online supplementary figure 3B).

These recipients also showed an increase in the diversity of Caudovirales after FMT, though it is not consistent in the richness change post FMT (figure 3A, B). In these four CDI subjects who responded to FMT, the Caudovirales contigs found in the donor baseline sample outnumbered that of the contigs in the recipient baseline stool sample (figure 3C), further substantiating that donor Caudovirales richness was higher than that of the recipient. In contrast, when the Caudovirales richness of the donor was lower than that of the recipient (FMT2, FMT4, FMT7, FMT8 and FMT9), the treatment outcome was not consistent across the recipients. FMT2 and FMT4 responded to treatment, but FMT7, FMT8 and FMT9 did not. The Caudovirales diversity and richness alterations post FMT were inconsistent among these subjects.

These two subjects also had a low Caudovirales colonisation. Hence, early disease recurrence in FMT7 and FMT8 after FMT might be related to a lack of colonisation of both bacteria and viruses. Subject FMT9 experienced disease recurrence at week 28. This subject had low levels of Caudovirales taxa colonisation throughout the post-FMT follow-up stool samples even though there was an increase in bacterial diversity and richness and substantial bacteria colonisation after FMT (see online supplementary figure 6B,C). Overall, FMT responders had a lower colonisation of Caudovirales bacteriophages than non-responders. These data suggest a role of bacteriophages in the efficacy of long-term FMT outcomes.",

Not all the relative abundance of Caudovirales species was significantly enhanced with the colonisation of corresponding Caudovirales contigs from the donor (see online supplementary figure 7A), which indicates that the newly formed Caudovirales ecosystem post FMT was based on a more intricate interaction network. Furthermore, not all transfer of Caudovirales contigs from donor was dependent on a high donor-to-recipient ratio of abundance of species (see online supplementary figure 7B).",

In subjects who responded to vancomycin (STD3, STD4, STD5), there was no significant change in the Caudovirales diversity or richness (see online supplementary figure 8A), suggesting that antibiotics may have minimal effect on Caudovirales community. In subjects who did not respond to vancomycin (STD1 and STD2), there was substantial fluctuation in Caudovirale diversity and richness as well as bacterial diversity and richness over the course of vancomycin treatment. A significant correlation between bacterial diversity and richness was observed in vancomycin responders. In FMT responders, a correlation was found between Caudovirales diversity and richness as well as a correlation between bacterial diversity and richness (supplementary figure 8B). Moreover, marginally significant inverse correlations were observed between Caudovirales richness and bacterial diversity, and between Caudovirales richness and bacterial richness in patients after FMT but not after vancomycin treatment. These data suggest that FMT has a synergistic effect on both the bacterial and viral component of the gut microbiome whereas vancomycin may predominantly affect the bacterial microbiome. We performed taxonomical analysis to further elaborate the effects of vancomycin on the virome community. In CDI subjects who responded to vancomycin, the virome structure was not significantly altered over time, whereas marked oscillation of the virome was seen in subjects who did not respond to vancomycin (supplementary figure 8C). Moreover, Caudovirales abundance was increased after vancomycin treatment, but decreased after FMT (supplementary figure 8D). To define the differentially enriched viral species between FMT and vancomycin responders, we implemented a LEfSe analysis across all the follow-up samples of treatment responders. A multitude of overpresented viral species was observed in the vancomycin samples, and nearly half of them belonged to Caudovirales (supplementary figure 9).",

In controls, there was a significant correlation between Caudovirales diversity and bacterial diversity (Spearman's \u03c1=0.511, p<0.05), and between Caudovirales diversity and bacterial richness (Spearman's \u03c1=0.625, p<0.05) (figure 5A). However, these correlations were distorted in CDI. After FMT, we demonstrated a shift of the microbiome community from a low to high bacterial richness and diversity, and from a low to a high Caudovirales diversity (figure 5B). The microbiome of FMT non-responders changed less when compared with FMT responders. The temporal restoration of bacterial structure over the period of follow-up in subject FMT9 indicated bacterial reset, but disease recurrence at week 28 may be associated with unaltered virome structure after FMT. We further assessed the correlation of Caudovirales species with bacterial families in CDI subjects and controls. More positive correlations, particularly of bacterial families Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria with Caudovirales species, were found in CDI than in controls (see online supplementary figure 10). This corresponded with an increase in the relative abundance of these bacterial taxa in patients with CDI together with an overpresentation of Caudovirales taxa compared with controls. Among the Caudovirales taxa positively related to Proteobacteria, predominant bacteriophage species comprise Burkholderia phage, Planktothrix phage, Pseudomonas phage, Moraxella phage and Halomonas phage.",

In this pilot observational study, we showed that patients with CDI exhibited a state of enteric virome dysbiosis, characterised by an increased Caudovirales abundance and a decreased Caudovirales diversity, richness and evenness. The mechanism underlying the efficacy of FMT has been attributed to improved microbial diversity with re-establishment of a \u2018normal\u2019 bacterial microbiota as a host defence against C. difficile.2\n3 Recently, Ott and colleagues showed that sterile faecal filtrate transfer was effective in treating five subjects with CDI, which highlights the therapeutic potential of other components including bacteriophages within the faecal matters other than bacteria.15 In this preliminary study, the observation that disease cure was associated with Caudovirales bacteriophage colonisation and donor Caudovirales richness provides new insights into the potential importance of virome derived from donor that may influence treatment outcome. Our data further highlight a new concept to FMT in that bacteriophages may be critical components of FMT. Bacteriophages have the potential to alter the composition and function of host microbiota and influence treatment outcomes. In particular, correlations between specific bacteriophages and bacteria shown in this study appeared to be associated with the outcome of FMT in CDI.",

Virome dysbiosis seen in CDI appeared to be disease-specific and was not observed in stool of subjects with norovirus-associated diarrhoea. Unlike the high cure rate of FMT in CDI, only up to a quarter of patients with UC, a subtype of IBD, achieved a sustained response with FMT.22\u201324 One plausible hypothesis is that a higher Caudovirales richness in donor than diseased recipient is important for FMT efficacy. In line with this hypothesis, we found that when donor Caudovirales richness was higher than that of the recipient, all the recipients responded to FMT, while more than half of the recipients whose Caudovirales richness was higher than that of the donor (three out of the five) experienced disease recurrence after FMT treatment. This finding suggests a donor effect of FMT efficacy and highlights that future FMT therapy should take into consideration detailed characterisation of donor and recipient faecal virome, although these findings need to be confirmed in a larger cohort. As this study has a modest sample size and we were unable to prove causation between donor Caudovirales richness, transfer of bacteriophages and FMT treatment outcome, it remains unclear whether altered bacteriophages represent a primary or secondary phenomenon. Understanding how Caudovirales bacteriophage transfer and donor virome richness affect FMT responses in CDI could help us understand their effects for treatments of other human diseases.",

Correlation of CDI-enriched bacteria with Caudovirales species in CDI and a reset of correlation after FMT indicate a \u2018kill-the-winner\u2019 dynamics, where upregulated Caudovirales bacteriophages were observed with the overpresentation of certain bacterial taxa enriched in CDI.28 Our data showed that restoration of a balanced relationship between bacterial microbiome and virome is important after FMT.

Importantly, our study provides detailed insight into the dynamics of interactions between viruses and bacteria in the intestine during FMT therapy. Sustained intestinal viral dysbiosis after FMT, due to limited amount of Caudovirales transfer from the donor, could be a potential factor that predisposes patients towards disease recurrence. These findings contribute to our knowledge on \u2018optimal\u2019 donor selection and highlight that future FMT therapy may consider detailed characterisation of donor and recipient faecal virome.",
