Decades of research have attempted to link maternal infections and inflammation to preterm birth, but an exact causative microbe or microbial community remains elusive in the preponderance of cases. For example, the association between maternal genitourinary infections in pregnancy and the risk for preterm birth has been repeatedly demonstrated 3-10, yet antibiotics have not been shown to prevent preterm birth11-14, and in some cases treatment is associated with a paradoxically increased risk of preterm delivery 15.

Seminal work by Ravel et al. demonstrated that vaginal communities of asymptomatic, non-pregnant, reproductive age women clustered into five distinct \u201ccommunity-state types\u201d which differed both by dominant Lactobacillus species as well as overall community composition 16. A much higher proportion of African-American and Hispanic women harbored a non-Lactobacillus dominant community, suggesting that in some women a non-Lactobacillus based vaginal community may be a normal variant. This finding challenges long-held beliefs about the definition of normal and abnormal vaginal microbiota. Other groups have documented that the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy differs from that of the non-pregnant vaginal microbiome 17, 18 suggesting that the physiology of pregnancy itself alters the microbial composition of this niche.",

Reads passing quality control were then classified from phylum to genus level using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Naive Bayesian Classifier (version 2.5, training set 9). Taxa assigned with less than 0.5 confidence were reassigned to the next higher taxonomic level in which the classification threshold was greater than 0.5. To classify the Lactobacillus reads into species, we built a local database containing all the 16S rRNA genes of Lactobacillus species from the NCBI database and blasted the processed V1V3 reads to the Lactobacillus species database. If a read had the same bit score for more than one Lactobacillus species, it was designated as \u201cunclassified Lactobacillus.\u201d",

Alpha diversity indices including richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness index were were calculated as described 26. To test the change of alpha diversity across pregnancy in preterm and full term birth groups, we applied linear mixed regression with log-transformed alpha diversity index (richness, Shannon diversity, and Pielou evenness) as the response variable, three trimesters, and delivery status (term or preterm) as fixed variables, and subjects as random effects. We also included an interaction term of trimester and term versus preterm groups in the model. We used Wilcoxon-rank sum testing to measure the significance of differences in richness, Shannon diversity, and Pielou's evenness in each trimester for women with subsequent preterm birth compared to women whose pregnancies went to term.",

Both Lactobacillus-dominant and Lactobacillus-poor communities occur in all trimesters of pregnancy and in samples from both term and preterm birth outcomes. In highly Lactobacillus-dominant communities (dark red Lactobacillus bar) there were fewer rare taxa present whereas in Lactobacillus-poor communities (lighter red to yellow Lactobacillus bar) other taxa such as Prevotella, Sneathia, Atopobium, Mycoplasma and other taxa are more abundant. Gardnerella was more commonly detected in low Lactobacillus abundance communities (Figure 4\nPanel B).",

The inflection point for change in richness and diversity associated with preterm birth appears to be between the first and the second trimesters with a pattern of higher alpha diversity noted in the first trimester. Additionally within-subject serial vaginal samples in women with subsequent preterm birth were more dissimilar than in women who delivered at term, suggesting that the vaginal microbiome associated with preterm birth may be less stable than that associated with term birth. The low diversity communities were comprised almost entirely of Lactobacillus species whereas high diversity communities contained Lactobacillus of varying abundance but also contained taxa such as Lachnospiraceae, Atopobium, Prevotella, Megasphaera, Sneathia, Mycoplasma, and Gardnerella. However, no specific taxon or taxa distinguished preterm from term births.",

Their cohort had fewer subjects, only two African-American women, and only 15 women delivered preterm, though they employed a more frequent sampling strategy. In contrast, we identified a candidate signature for preterm birth with an association between changing community diversity and instability over pregnancy in preterm birth, with the most pronounced changes occurring among African-American women. In view of the known racial influence on vaginal microbial content 16, 19, 27, these inter-study differences might be explained by the different demographic composition of the study populations. Notably, the Shannon diversity scores reported by DiGiulio et al resemble the correspondingly low scores we noted in our non-African-American population (Supplement Figure 2). Similar to our findings, their data suggest that vaginal communities associated with preterm birth were detectable early in pregnancy, suggesting that early pregnancy may be an important ecological time in the vaginal community. Our data also suggest that early vaginal community fluctuation may be a marker for preterm birth, and changes may not immediately precede preterm delivery.",

Additionally, within subject analysis of beta-diversity suggests less similarity or more instability of serial samples within a women with preterm birth compared to those in a woman with term birth. This suggests that predicting preterm birth from vaginal microbiome community structure is not as simple as finding a highly diverse community, specific community type, or specific taxa at a single time point in pregnancy, and that kinetics of community composition need to be considered.",

Romero et al analyzed multiple bacterial phylotypes and found than no specific bacterial phylotype was associated with preterm birth. Likewise in our taxa abundance analyses neither Lactobacillus species abundance nor other rarer taxa in Lactobacillus poor communities such as Gardnerella were individually significant markers for preterm birth. While Ureaplasma was increased in the second and third trimesters of African American women who subsequently delivered preterm, the difference was not statistically significant. Also while the change noted in Ureaplasma could be attributed to chance, it is intriguing that Ureaplasma, found in higher abundance in women with preterm birth in this cohort, has previously been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth 28-34. However, our current data suggest that the presence, absence, or abundance of specific taxa alone is not categorically sufficient for the prediction of subsequent term or preterm birth.",

The high proportion of African-American women is a unique and informative feature of our analysis, especially as prior studies included predominantly non-African-American subjects. However, we acknowledge several study limitations. As with any observational study, differences between groups reflect associations and not necessarily causation. While our sample size is similar to or larger than those in prior studies, it was still too small to allow reliable statistical comparisons among non-African-American women. Nonetheless, the low diversity scores noted even in the small population of non-African-American patients of our study cohort is consistent with data from predominantly non-African-American populations in other reports 19, 21, and warrants further analysis.",

It is possible that the first trimester single time point comparisons which were not significantly associated with preterm birth may be underpowered. Likewise the beta-diversity measures examining stability from trimester 1 to trimester 2 also may be underpowered. The importance of the first trimester is illuminated both in this study as well as by DiGiulio et al 21, and highlights the need for future studies to adequately sample women early in pregnancy. Although women enrolled in the first trimester were clinically similar to those enrolled later in pregnancy it is unknown whether there are systematic differences in the microbiology of women who present for obstetric care earlier in gestation. Also, we included all preterm births in our analysis. While vaginal microbiological abnormalities are classically associated with spontaneous preterm birth, spontaneous and indicated preterm births are competing outcomes, and are not always accurately categorized 35. Additionally, our understanding of the association between vaginal bacterial communities and adverse pregnancy outcomes is still in its infancy. For these reasons, we chose a more general and agnostic approach to analyzing all preterm births, regardless of reason for the delivery.",
