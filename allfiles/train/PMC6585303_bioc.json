Gut RG abundance correlated with serum antibodies to only 1/8 RG strains tested. Anti-RG antibodies correlated directly with SLEDAI score and antinative DNA levels, but inversely with C3 and C4. These antibodies were primarily against antigen(s) in an RG strain-restricted pool of cell wall lipoglycans. Novel structural features of these purified lipoglycans were characterised by mass spectrometry and NMR. Highest levels of serum anti-RG strain-restricted antibodies were detected in those with active nephritis (including Class III and IV) in the discovery cohort, with findings validated in two independent cohorts.",

At the species level, patients with SLE displayed a mean 5-fold overabundance of an anaerobic Gram-positive taxon in the Firmicutes phylum and Lachnospiraceae family, identified as Ruminococcus gnavus\n23\n(RG) (range 0.00%\u201310.79%, mean\u00b1SD 1.35%\u00b12.01%) compared with controls (0.00%\u20131.27%, 0.25%\u00b10.39%, Mann-Whitney, p=0.01). Strikingly, RG relative abundance correlated with lupus disease activity, as even patients with SLE with low disease activity had a mean 4-fold RG overrepresentation, while those with high disease activity had >8 fold greater RG abundance (Mann-Whitney, p=0.01) (table 1, complete data in online supplementary table 2). Compared with those without a history of renal disease, patients with a history of renal involvement displayed an even greater abundance of a RG specific amplicon sequence variant (ASV) (Mann-Whitney, p=0.04), as well as several other ASVs that included two assigned to the Veillonella genus (online supplementary table 3). In an individual community these Veillonella species were highly correlated with each other (CLR-transformed, r=0.89, p<10\u201316) although less strongly with RG (39% V. parvula, 43% V. dispar, p<0.005). Hence, the microbiota in patients with lupus commonly displayed concurrent expansions of both RG and Veillonella species.",

Indeed, lupus patients with the highest disease activity scores also had the lowest abundance of B. uniformis (Mann-Whitney, p=0.01) (table 1), suggesting that these species may be in dynamic reciprocal relationships. Notably, as B. uniformis conveys anti-inflammatory properties that can ameliorate metabolic abnormalities in diabetes-prone mice,26 a paucity in active lupus patients could also be relevant to understanding the drivers of autoimmune pathogenesis.",

Furthermore, patients with lupus also displayed raised serum soluble CD14 (Welch test, p=0.0002) and raised \u03b11-acid glycoprotein levels (Welch test, p<0.0001) (figure 1H, I), which in other conditions have been attributed to gut bacterial translocation.28 29 Taken together, these findings suggest that patients with lupus may at times experience impaired gut barrier function, which potentially may enable commensals, or their components, to escape the intestinal lumen.",

Immunoblots revealed that many patients with lupus and healthy adult controls had IgG reactivity with antigenic bands, common to a range of RG strains (figure 2A\u2013D), and these were protease-sensitive (figure 2E). In contrast, lupus serum antibodies were not generally reactive with commensal strains P. copri or B. thetaiotaomicron (figure 2A\u2013C). Notably, serum IgG antibodies of lupus patients with SLEDAI activity scores of \u22658 were often highly reactive with specific conserved protease-resistant bands in the extract of the R. gnavus strain CC55_001C, which is here termed RG2 (online supplementary table 5). These conserved bands in the RG2 strain migrated with ~20\u201330 kDa protein markers, but such bands were not detected in the seven other RG strains tested (figure 2E).",

These changes reflected mass differences of 448.43 Da, 462.44 Da or 476.46 Da, respectively. For this series, molecules with varying number of hexoses were also detectable, as the signal pattern displays mass differences of 162.05 Da. A similar pattern was observed in the lower molecular range between 2000 and 2800 Da (figure 3C) for series Ade-O-acyl, for example, signals at 2050.663 Da, 2212.716 Da, 2374.768 Da and 2536.820 Da, representing the corresponding de-O-acylated molecules present in series Anative. Interestingly, LG2 mono-acyl variants of LGs of series A and B were also detected (online supplementary figure 1K), and LG2 had a third series (Cnative) of LG molecules that was also observed. Hence, although each of the three series most likely have differing core units, all LG variants display \u2018hexose-capping\u2019. The complete structural characterisation of these LGs from RG2 is beyond the scope of the current report. An analogous extraction of cell wall moieties from RG1 did not result in any yields of similar LGs, which suggests that RG strains differ in their capacity to produce cell wall LGs.",

In fact, preincubation of a lupus serum with LG3 at 2 \u00b5g/mL inhibited all immunoblot reactivity with the oligomeric antigenic bands in the LG2 and LG3 pools and with the nuclease-treated RG2 extract, but did not affect the IgG reactivity with the protease-sensitive bands (figure 4E, F). As predicted, lupus IgG immunoreactivity with these oligomeric bands was destroyed by periodate treatment (figure 4G), further supporting the notion that these immunodominant epitopes are on glyco-conjugate molecules.

Importantly, there was a significant direct relationship with lupus disease activity and with LN, and the highest levels of serum IgG anti-RG antibody responses primarily directed against a RG strain-restricted cell wall-associated LG-containing antigen. Whereas these RG antigens may leak out of the intestine to induce IgG antibody responses, conversely IgG cannot enter the gut lumen and reduce the representation of taxa such as RG. Notably, RG2 LG-containing pools included moieties that were potent in vitro NF-\u03baB immune activators via TLR2 (online supplementary figure 1M) that has previously been implicated in lupus pathogenesis.38 We speculate that the cross-reactivity of lupus autoreactive B cells to leaked stimulatory RG bacterial components, including TLR ligands(s), may contribute to the initiation and/or flares of lupus disease and especially LN that is a major source of early mortality and morbidity.39\n",

The properties of the LGs in RG2, as well as other strains, will also require further investigation. In addition, Gram-positive opportunistic pathogens may have lipoproteins that are activators of innate immunity,49 and such lipoproteins can be copurified along with other lipoconjugates using the HIC-based methodology. Hence, future studies will also need to directly assess the specific immunostimulatory properties of the LGs themselves.",

Indeed, the abundance of RG outgrowths correlated with lupus disease activity, with the greatest expansions in those with active renal disease, and these immune responses were primarily directed against a strain-restricted cell wall lipoglycan. Notably, individual lupus communities also displayed concordant significant expansions of Veillonella species, along with reciprocal contractions of Bacteroides uniformis. Furthermore, our findings also contribute to evidence of a widening range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions associated with a \u2018leaky gut\u2019,54 which may in part be responsible for the lupus-associated RG strain LG-directed antibody responses. We speculate that leakage of RG bacterial components contributes to nephritogenic autoantibody responses. To pursue these questions, it will be important to characterise the diversity and genetic features of RG strains and to understand when these strains colonise and expand in patients with lupus. In part, these investigations may lead to development of a biomarker assay that aids both earlier diagnosis and better prognostic determinations.",
