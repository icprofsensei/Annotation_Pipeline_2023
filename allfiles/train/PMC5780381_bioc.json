This is a prospective cross-sectional study assessing the intestinal microbiome (IM) of 39 adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD (15 simple steatosis [SS]; 24 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]) and 28 healthy controls (HC). IM composition (llumina MiSeq Platform) in NAFLD patients compared to HC were identified by two statistical methods (Metastats, Wilcoxon). Selected taxa was validated using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Metabolites in feces and serum were also analyzed. In NAFLD, 8 operational taxonomic units, 6 genera, 6 families and 2 phyla (Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes) were less abundant and; 1 genus (Lactobacillus) and 1 family (Lactobacillaceae) were more abundant compared to HC. Lower abundance in both NASH and SS patients compared to HC were confirmed by qPCR for Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Coprococcus. No difference was found between NASH and SS. This lower abundance in NAFLD (NASH+SS) was independent of BMI and IR. NAFLD patients had higher concentrations of fecal propionate and isobutyric acid and serum 2-hydroxybutyrate and L-lactic acid. These findings suggest a potential role for a specific IM community and functional profile in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.",

In addition, some of these studies did not perform liver biopsies in either the patient group10,12,16 or controls10\u201314,16, or did not assess other factors that may affect IM such as nutritional intake, environment, or physical activity12\u201316. In a previous study9 using qPCR, we found an inverse association between the presence of NASH and percentage of Bacteroidetes in the stool, and this was independent of dietary intake and BMI. However, the method only allowed for the assessment of a very limited number of taxa. Also, bacterial products were not analyzed and these products may play a role in the relationship between NAFLD and IM17.",

To ensure robustness of our conclusions to statistical assumptions, the differences in taxa abundances were assessed by two different methods. We additionally quantified select microbial taxa found to be differentially abundant in next generation sequencing data using qPCR, and examined their relationship with NAFLD, BMI and IR. In addition, we measured serum and fecal metabolites using nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.",

In order to ensure robustness of our conclusions to statistical assumptions we applied 3 different analysis methods and made inferences if the results of all analyses were consistent. First, zero-inflated Gaussian models to perform 3-group comparisons35. Then pairwise differences between groups were assessed by two non-parametric methods: Metastats35,36 and Wilcoxon rank sum test (details in Supplemental Materials). Correction for multiple comparisons was done using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate37, and q-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.

Size and direction of differences for HC vs SS and HC vs NASH comparisons were similar in both OTU and genus levels, and differentially abundant groups were similar in both of these comparisons. At the same time, the differences between SS and NASH groups were never significant and size of differences was small, suggesting similar microbiome characteristics for NASH and SS in our study. Based on this and taking into account low sample size in SS group, we combined NASH and SS into one NAFLD group for further analysis.",

For the taxa that differed between HC and NAFLD, partial correlations between diagnosis status and abundance were highly significant after controlling for BMI or IR. After controlling for diagnosis, there was no evidence of relationship between BMI and bacterial abundances, and for HOMA-IR only weak evidence of a positive relationship with F. prausnitzii (Fig.\u00a03). Therefore, our analysis suggests that NALFD is associated with reduced abundance of Ruminococcus, Coprococcus and F. prausnitzii independent of BMI and IR.",

Liver enzymes and insulin resistance measures were also higher in the NAFLD groups. All of these findings were expected given the typical NAFLD population39. In regard to age, previous studies have identified changes in IM over the lifespan, however, most changes occur in early childhood and elderly adults >70 years old40\u201342. Research into IM changes in the elderly has often been confounded by dietary changes, medication use, and declining overall health. Therefore, a cut-off age for IM change is undeterminable43. Our total population, with a maximum age of 68 years is therefore unlikely to have experienced a confounding effect of age on IM. In regard to BMI, the median BMI of the HC was in the overweight range 26.6 (19.5, 35.3) [median (min, max)]. However, the groups were characterized by liver histology, and HC were confirmed to have a normal liver. This is a strength in our study as, to our knowledge, no other studies published on NAFLD had a HC group with confirmed normal liver biopsies. Another strength is the HC group with a median BMI in the overweight range. This BMI range in the HC group is reflective of the current Canadian population44. The smaller difference in BMI between NAFLD and HC reduces potential confounding effects on IM when comparing the groups.",

Ruminococcus was previously reported only by Zhu et al., but the family Ruminococcaceae was consistently reported as less abundant in NAFLD12,14. In our study, liver biopsy was used to diagnose NAFLD while some of these previous studies12,14 relied mostly on imaging. Also, their healthy controls had no liver biopsy, were much leaner compared to NAFLD12\u201314 and differences in BMI were not considered in the analysis. This could have influenced the results.",

This is contrary to the findings by Boursier et al.15, who reported higher abundance of Bacteroides in NASH compared to SS patients and a positive association between Ruminococcus and fibrosis severity, independent of metabolic factors (assessed only by the presence or absence of diabetes). The diverging results can have multiple explanations. First, there can be differences in disease severity in study samples: our patients had milder disease (NAFLD activity score median 1 for SS and 4.5 for NASH) and only 18% had severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (stage 3 or 4). Secondly, differences in patient populations, environmental factors and dietary habits in Canada vs Europe, could have influenced associations between IM and disease severity. Finally, in our study, more stringent criteria to select differentially abundant species by controlling for multiple comparisons were applied compared to Boursier\u2019s study, which did not correct for increased chances of type I error when testing the hypothesis of differential abundance for multiple taxa.",

F. prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory commensal bacterium and its abundance is reduced in inflammatory bowel disease45 and metabolic syndrome46. Coprococcus was also lower in NAFLD patients, similar to the report by Zhu et al.11. A lower abundance of Coprococcus has also been observed in other inflammatory conditions47. Therefore, it is conceivable that lower abundance can promote chronic inflammation that may contribute to NAFLD pathogenesis. Ruminococcus belong to the family Ruminococcaceae which are also fermenting anaerobes that lead to the production of SCFA48. Both Zhu et al.11 and Raman et al.12 found a lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae in NAFLD patients, however, not in this particular genus.",

                    "text": "We expected to see differences in SCFA between groups. However, in feces, only propionate and isobutyric acid were higher in NAFLD compared to HC, whereas concentrations of butyrate, acetate, formate, and total SCFA were not different. There were no correlations between SCFA and bacterial abundances. The ratios of acetate:propionate:butyrate were similar to the normal values in both groups38. However, the amount and type of products can vary depending on species. For example, Ruminococcus genus contains species and strains which can be metabolically versatile49\u201351 which means the amount and type of fermentation products vary according to species. Some can use different substrates like mucus or cellulose, resulting in production of acetate, ethanol, succinate, lactate and formate, but very little butyrate as end products of glucose metabolism51. We also found higher serum 2-hydroxybutyrate and L-lactic acid. However, it is difficult to compare our results to previous studies as human data on SCFA in NAFLD are scarce. Wong et al. found that NASH patients had a lower prevalence of butyrate producing Faecalibacterium (similar to our study), but they did not measure butyrate levels13. Raman et al.12, comparing obese NAFLD diagnosed on imaging versus lean HC subjects, measured fecal volatile compounds and also showed higher levels of SCFA with elevated fecal propionic, butyric and acetic acids in NAFLD. Similarly increased volatile compounds were observed in NAFLD patients16 and higher total fecal SCFA, particularly propionate, was also found in overweight and obese adults compared to lean controls52. Higher SCFA from bacterial fermentation can lead to increased energy absorption of up to 150\u2009kcal per day53. It is conceivable that the higher concentration of fecal propionate and isobutyric acid found in our NAFLD group reflect this phenomenon. Mechanisms other than IM could have also contributed to the higher level of SCFA in NAFLD versus HC, such as slow transit time38 reported in obesity54 which may have increased fermentation, or differences in absorption rate55. 2-hydroxybutyrate (alpha-hydroxybutyrate) is a metabolite formed during amino acid catabolism and glutathione anabolism56. Although this compound has been mentioned as an intermediary in the bacterial metabolism of amino acids, it is not clear how much is actually produced and absorbed in the human colon and absorbed into the blood57. Oxidative stress in the liver that can be triggered by IR may have contributed to higher 2-hydroxybutyrate level by increasing the production of hepatic glutathione56,58.",

We applied robust statistical methodology appropriate for analysis of this type of data, including normalization methods and statistical testing. Particularly, we used 2 types of statistical tests for sequencing data to ensure robustness of conclusions. We also applied multiple comparisons corrections whenever appropriate to avoid identifying false positive taxa and confirmed the results with qPCR. The limitation of our study is the relatively low sample size that does not allow for more multivariate analyses and may have prevented us from showing differences between IM of SS and NASH. However, the sample size was similar to other studies11,13 that used liver biopsy to characterize NAFLD. The expanding study of the IM discovered numerous environmental factors that may influence the IM. Vitamin D deficiency, for instance, has recently been linked to dysbiosis and NAFLD59. In this study, vitamin D status was not examined, but the patient population was from a relatively small geographic region, and vitamin D intake did not differ between groups. Also, we cannot confirm causality owing to the observational design.",
