According to the 2017 National Vital Statistics Reports, [1] African American women face a nearly 50% greater risk of preterm birth (<37 completed weeks of gestation) compared to white women (13.2% vs 8.9%), a difference in risk that doubles (4.8% vs 2.4%) when considering early preterm birth (born\u00a0<\u00a034 completed weeks\u2019 of gestation). They are also at a higher risk to miscarry [2]. Adverse infant outcomes are likewise unequally distributed, with African American infants more than twice as likely to be born at low (<2500\u00a0gm; 13.2% vs 7.0%) or very low (<500\u00a0gm; 2.9% vs 1.1%) birthweight [1] and, as from 2013, face a doubling in the risk of total infant mortality (10.81% vs 5.07%). These health disparities are only moderately attenuated by accounting for known socioeconomic and medical risk factors and persist in spite of public health initiatives to improve access to, and the content of care. Faced with this continuing challenge, clinical and scientific attention has increasingly focused on gaining a better understanding of the underlying biobehavioral mechanisms by which the multiple, complex, and often inter-related social, biological and behavioral risk factors disproportionately experienced by African American families link to adverse birth outcomes including preterm birth. Among recognized risk factors for adverse birth outcomes are sociodemographic factors, chronic stress including racial discrimination, [3] dietary threats including micronutrient deficiency [4] and obesity, [5] sexual or hygiene behaviors that heighten the risk of infection or inflammation, [6] and exposure to tobacco or other toxins.",

This raises the possibility that if vaginal microbiome differences persist during pregnancy, a clear link to disparate outcomes might also exist. To date this hypothesis has been difficult to confirm due to the generally small sample size of African American women in most studies of the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy [15\u201319] and, with few exceptions, [14] the very low representation of African American women delivering infants at term. As a result, the \u201chealthy\u201d vaginal microbiome of pregnant African American women remains poorly characterized. Moreover, no studies to date of the vaginal microbiome of pregnant African American compared to pregnant white women have considered the key biobehavioral variables identified above that may underlie microbial community differences: exposure to chronic or acute stress, diet quality and obesity, concurrent local or systemic infection, reproductive tract hygiene, sexual risk and protective factors, or the use of tobacco or other substances.",

This is not unexpected given the potential for microorganisms colonizing the vagina to ascend into the uterine cavity and the recognition that the most common cause of spontaneous preterm birth is infection [6]. Nevertheless, the possibility of cross-contamination of bacteria from the oral or gut environments to the vagina, uterus or placenta, either through hematogenous spread or from direct colonization via oral, vaginal, or anal intercourse, or for the gut microbiome, via cross-contamination after defecation, emphasizes the need for further investigation. To date, however, far fewer studies have investigated other inhabited environments; only one [17] study to date has reported on the oral microbiome using RNA sequencing rather than culture-based methods during gestation, and only three on the gut microbiome in pregnancy, [17, 20, 21] with outcomes from these latter studies conflicting.",

Given that sociodemographic status is a determinant of the stress and health behaviors under study, we anticipate that the diversity across these hospitals will provide sufficient variation in the socio-demographic and biobehavioral factors of interest to probe their risk and protective effects on the microbiome and birth outcomes including preterm birth.",

Measures include the following (a)\nChildhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), which elicits information about abuse and neglect in childhood by asking about 21 experiences and subjects rating their occurrence on a 5-point Likert scale [24]. The CTQ has been extensively used in high-risk populations of African Americans and in a prospective study of pregnant women [25] (b)\nAdverse Child Experiences Questionnaire (ACE) ascertains experiences related to dysfunction in childhood home by asking about 10 experiences with each being scored 0\u20131 [26]. ACE is used extensively among women of reproductive age of various race/ethnicity and income status; elevated scores correlate with increased risk for adverse outcomes. (c)\nStressful Live Events Index ascertains whether during the past 12\u00a0months the woman experienced any of 13 stressful events (e.g., death of a family member, divorce, loss of job, intimate partner violence) with each being scored 0\u20131, with total scores ranging from 0 to 13. (d)\nKrieger Experiences of Discrimination scale measures perceptions of usual exposure and response to perceived discrimination in school, home, work and other domains using a Likert-scaled approach [27] (e)\nBrief Jackson-Hogue Stress Scale is a 36-item scale, with each item Likert scaled 0\u20135, developed based upon research at Grady Memorial Hospital to capture usual experiences of gendered racism and stress among African American women, [28] including during pregnancy. (f) Perceived Stress Survey (PSS) is a 14-item questionnaire that measures experiences of stress in the last month [29]. PSS scores have been reported to correlate with HPA axis function during pregnancy and postpartum. (g) Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory measures current stress and anxiety as well as anger traits using a 20-item inventory (scored 0\u20131). It has been widely used in perinatal studies and is well-validated in minority and low-literacy populations [30] (\nh) Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) is a common measure used to ascertain symptoms of depression in the previous 7\u00a0days. The EDS has 10-items, is easy to administer, and validated for pre- and postnatal use across multiple race/ethnic groups [31]. Validation against clinical interview identifies a specificity of 78%, sensitivity of 86%, and positive predictive value of 73%.
