Gastrointestinal injury is a frequent adverse event associated with NSAID use and evidence suggests that NSAIDs induce gastrointestinal microbial imbalance (i.e., dysbiosis) in both animals and people. It is unknown, however, whether cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective NSAIDs induce dysbiosis, or if this phenomenon occurs in horses administered any class of NSAIDs. Therefore, our objectives were to determine whether the composition and diversity of the fecal microbiota of adult horses were altered by NSAID use, and whether these effects differed between non\u2013selective and COX-2-selective NSAIDs. Twenty-five adult horses were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: control (n = 5); phenylbutazone (n = 10); or, firocoxib (n = 10). Treatments were administered for 10 days. Fecal samples were collected every 5 days for 25 days. DNA was extracted from feces and the 16S rRNA gene amplified and sequenced to determine the composition of the microbiota and the inferred metagenome. While the fecal microbiota profile of the control group remained stable over time, the phenylbutazone and firocoxib groups had decreased diversity, and alteration of their microbiota profiles was most pronounced at day 10. Similarly, there were clear alterations of the inferred metagenome at day 10 compared to all other days, indicating that use of both non-selective and selective COX inhibitors resulted in temporary alterations of the fecal microbiota and inferred metagenome. Dysbiosis associated with NSAID administration is clinically relevant because dysbiosis has been associated with several important diseases of horses including abdominal pain (colic), colitis, enteric infections, and laminitis.",

In veterinary medicine, NSAIDs are second only to parasiticides in frequency of use [2]. In equine veterinary medicine, the exact prevalence of NSAID use is unknown; however, clinical experience indicates that NSAIDs are used ubiquitously in horses for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Although NSAIDs are used routinely in both human and veterinary medicine, their use has been associated with numerous adverse effects including NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury. In the GI tract, NSAID-induced injury results in 2 clinical syndromes: 1) NSAID-induced gastropathy, affecting the stomach and proximal duodenum; and, 2) NSAID enteropathy, affecting the lower GI tract distal to the duodenum [3, 4].",

An additional 2/3 of both short- and long-term NSAID users develop subclinical or undiagnosed distal small intestinal lesions [6]. Although epidemiological data are lacking, NSAID enteropathy occurs in horses primarily as right dorsal colitis, which, similar to NSAID enteropathy in people, is difficult to diagnose and manage [7, 8].",

Interestingly, therapeutic doses of NSAIDs can result in a dysbiosis that drastically alters the GI microbiota of people and laboratory animals [8, 13\u201315]. It has been consistently demonstrated that the primary bacterial phyla in mammalian GI tracts (including horses) are Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [16]. Making comparisons between human and horse microbiota is difficult because of the relative paucity of studies examining the equine microbiota and because of differences in techniques, such that the specific ratios of major bacterial phyla vary among studies and health conditions of subjects. NSAID-induced dysbiosis is characterized most often by a reduction of the predominately Gram-positive phylum Firmicutes and a corresponding increase of Gram-negative bacteria, although this shift is not universal [8, 13\u201315, 17]. Several classes of Firmicutes that are decreased following NSAID therapy belong to a group of commensal Clostridia that are critically important in gut homeostasis, specifically members of Clostridium cluster XIVa and Clostridium cluster IV [15, 18]. The horse is a hind-gut fermenter and, as such, the GI microbiota is essential for digestion of nutrients and as an energy source [19, 20]. Therefore, any perturbation of the GI microbiota may have profound implications for the health and well-being of affected horses [9\u201312]. Given the implications of GI dysbioses in horses, the known effects of NSAIDs on the microbiota of people and other animals, and the highly prevalent use of NSAIDs in horses, it is possible that NSAID-induced dysbiosis might predispose horses to a number of diseases.",

Inhibition of COX-1, the constitutively expressed isoform of the COX enzyme, is thought to contribute to damage to the GI tract by NSAIDs. Therefore, great effort has been made to generate NSAIDs that selectively inhibit COX-2, the inducible isoform considered to cause inflammation [21, 22]. Although the use of COX-2 selective NSAIDs in people has decreased the incidence of upper GI tract lesions, this approach has been less effective at reducing the incidence of NSAID enteropathy [23]. While the mechanisms for this lack of efficacy are unknown, one possible explanation is the increasingly recognized constitutive expression of COX-2 in the GI tract [24]. In rodent models, there is some evidence that COX-2 plays a role in gut mucosal homeostasis that is as, or more, important than COX-1, suggesting that inhibition of COX-2 is not necessarily a safer approach for the GI tract [22]. The differential effects of COX-selective vs. non-selective NSAIDs in horses remains unknown. Therefore, our objectives were to determine if: 1) the composition and diversity of the fecal microbiota (as a marker of distal GI microbiota) of adult horses are altered by NSAID use; and, 2) whether there are differential effects of COX-2-selective NSAIDs and non-COX-selective NSAIDs on the fecal microbiota of horses.",

Twenty-five healthy adult horses from the university teaching herd were utilized for this study. Inclusion criteria included age (5\u201320 years), breed (American Quarter Horse), and health status (free of signs of illness based on physical examination). Prior to enrollment in the study, all horses underwent a complete physical examination and medical history was reviewed. Horses were excluded if they failed to meet inclusion criteria, if physical examination revealed any evidence of illness, or if review of their medical record revealed a history of any illness or medications administered in the 6 months preceding enrollment in this study. To assign treatment groups, 5 horses were randomly selected from all horses that met inclusion criteria. These 5 horses were matched at a ratio of 4:1 with other horses based on age (+/- 2 years), sex, and weight (+/- 100 pounds) for a total of 25 horses. One horse from each quintet was randomly assigned to the control group, and the remaining horses from the quintet were randomly assigned in blocked manner to either firocoxib (n = 2 per quintet) or phenylbutazone (n = 2 per quintet). For 10 days prior to the start of the study, each horse was fed the same diet including hay from the same cutting. Fecal samples were collected by rectal palpation (using an individual rectal sleeve for each horse) every 5 days for 25 days beginning on day 0. Samples were collected in sterile containers and frozen at -80\u00b0C immediately after collection. NSAID administration began on day 1 and continued for 10 days. Based on the assigned group, horses were administered phenylbutazone (ButaPaste, Henry Schein, Dublin, OH; 4.4 mg/kg, orally once daily), firocoxib (Equioxx, Merial, Duluth, GA; 0.1 mg/kg, orally once daily), or vehicle (control). These dosages were selected on the basis of standard clinical practice for management of inflammatory conditions in horses (e.g., osteoarthritis) and in accordance with label directions [25\u201327]. We chose firocoxib as the representative COX-2 selective NSAID for use in this study because it is the only FDA-approved COX-2-selective NSAID available in the United States for use in horses. In addition, firocoxib is highly COX-2-selective with a COX-1:COX-2 ratio of 200, whereas phenylbutazone has a COX-1:COX-2 ratio of 1, indicating no COX selectivity [28, 29].",

Briefly, samples were barcoded and subjected to PCR amplification using primers 515F/806R directed towards the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Barcoded amplicon libraries were prepared and sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina) following the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. The software Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME v1.9 (http://qiime.sourceforge.net) was used for data processing and analysis [31]. The raw sequence data were de-multiplexed, and low quality reads were filtered using database\u2019s default parameters. Chimeric sequences were detected using Uchime and removed prior to further analysis [32]. Sequences were then assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using an open-reference OTU picking protocol in QIIME against the Greengenes database filtered at 97% identity [33\u201335]. To adjust for uneven sequencing depth among the samples, each sample was rarefied to an even sequencing depth prior to further analysis. Alpha rarefaction, beta diversity measures, richness, taxonomic summaries, and tests for significance were calculated and plotted using QIIME. Diversity indices were analyzed with generalized linear models using S-PLUS statistical software (Version 8.2, TIBCO, Inc., Seattle, WA). The dependent (outcome) variables were either the number of OTUs or phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole tree index; independent variables of time, group, and their interaction were modeled as fixed categorical variables (ordered in the case of time) and individual horse was modeled as a random effect. Post hoc multiple comparisons among groups and times were adjusted using the method of Sidak [36]. Model fit was assessed by visual inspection of plots of standardized residuals versus fitted values. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots and UniFrac networks were performed with Phyloseq, an R-based package for analysis of microbiota sequencing data [37]. Differences in microbial communities within each treatment group were investigated by visual assessment of clustering on principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots, and by analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) [38] calculated on unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance metrics [39] using QIIME scripts. When significant differences were observed (P < 0.05), PRIMER (v 7.0) was used to conduct pairwise ANOSIM to determine which time-points were significantly different.",

There was substantial overlap of DE OTUs amongst the NSAID-treated horses (~50%) (Figs \u200b(Figs3C3C and \u200band4).4). This overlap in DE OTUs, however, underestimated the similarity in expression profile because the 46 OTUs that were DE only in firocoxib-treated animals (Fig 5) generally followed the same pattern of expression as those in phenylbutazone-treated animals. Similarly, the pattern of expression of the 58 OTUs uniquely DE in phenylbutazone-treated animals were generally the same for firocoxib-treated animals (Fig 6). Heatmaps of log2 fold-changes of DE OTUs revealed a reduction of members of the Firmicutes phylum, specifically the family Lachnospiraceae and, to a lesser extent, concomitant expansion of Bacteroidetes phylum, specifically Bacteroidales. This pattern was observed in both concordant DE OTUs between the 2 NSAID groups (Fig 4) and when examining DE OTUs unique to each treatment group (Figs \u200b(Figs55 and \u200band6),6), but not in control animals. Moreover, while exact OTU assignment was different, taxonomic classification of these reads represent very similar bacterial families (i.e., primarily Lachnospiracea and to a lesser extent Clostridiacea and Ruminococcacaea). Taken together, these findings suggest that administration of phenylbutazone and firocoxib at the tested dosages result in alterations of the fecal microbiota, with the most notable alterations occurring at day 10 compared to day 0.",

As above, count tables were constructed from BIOM files that were generated by PICRUSt of the inferred metagenome. These were normalized using edgeR function calcnormfactors with the method RLE, and then analyzed for differentially expressed KOs between days 0 and 10. MA plots revealed that many of the DE KOs were highly expressed with similar expression values and fold-changes in both groups of NSAID treated horses (Fig 8A and 8B). Specifically, these analyses revealed 1,871 DE KOs in the phenylbutazone group and 2,355 DE KOs in the firocoxib-treated group. There was substantial overlap of DE KOs in the NSAID-treated horses: ~81% of the DE KOs in the phenylbutazone comparison were also DE in the firocoxib comparison (Fig 8C), suggesting similar NSAID-induced alterations of the inferred metagenome. In order to determine the pathways to which these KOs belonged, the top 500 DE KOs (i.e., 500 KOs with smallest FDR P values) were uploaded to KEGG pathway analysis. Of these 500 KOs, nearly 20% affected metabolic pathways (Table 5). It appeared that there were NSAID-induced alterations in many aspects of the metabolic pathways of the fecal microbiota of these horses after 10 days of NSAID administration, with substantial overlap between firocoxib- and phenylbutazone-treated horses.",

Differential effects of COX-selective and non-selective NSAIDs on NSAID-induced dysbiosis has not been examined previously, nor have the effects of NSAIDs in the microbiota of horses. Here, we show for the first time that clinically-relevant duration and dosages of NSAIDs result in a transient dysbiosis of the fecal microbiota of healthy, adult horses. Importantly, we have demonstrated similar effects of non-selective and COX-2-selective NSAIDs on the equine microbiota. These changes were primarily characterized by loss of members of the Firmicutes phylum, specifically the family Lachnospiraceae and, to a lesser extent, the families Clostridiacea and Ruminococcacaea. NSAIDs are among the most frequently administered classes of medications in equine health care. Given the frequency of use of this class of medication, understanding their impact on the equine microbiota is clinically important because alteration of the equine GI microbiota has been linked to inflammatory diseases including colitis and laminitis [9\u201312].",

The current paradigm of the pathophysiology of NSAID-induced GI damage proposes that COX-2-selective NSAIDs should be safer for the equine GI tract. In human medicine, COX-2-selective NSAIDs have successfully reduced the incidence of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. However, the incidence of NSAID-induced lower GI damage remains unchanged despite increased use of COX-2-selective NSAIDs, suggesting that this class may not necessarily provide a safer alternative for NSAID enteropathy in people [23]. It remains unclear why COX-2 selective NSAIDs do not reduce the incidence of NSAID enteropathy in people. Some studies have suggested that both COX-1 and COX-2 are constitutively expressed in various tissues and that both isoforms contribute to the maintenance of GI homeostasis this inhibition of either isoform has deleterious effects [52]. Our findings suggest that, in horses, both selective and non-selective COX inhibitors result in a similar dysbiosis although the clinical significance of this dysbiosis remains unclear. Conflicting results have been obtained regarding the role of NSAID-induced dysbiosis. Xiao et al. demonstrated that NSAID-induced dysbiosis protects mice against NSAID enteropathy, but others have demonstrated opposite results [53\u201358].",

One possibility is that reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from intestinal epithelial cells following NSAID-induced mitochondrial damage contributes to this dysbiosis, as ROS molecules released during intestinal inflammation have been shown to induce a dysbiosis [59]. In rodent models and in vitro studies, NSAIDs have been shown to induce a topical effect on the intestinal mucosa whereby NSAIDs enter the enterocyte and affect numerous organelles including mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum eventually leading to ROS generation [60\u201363]. When ROS molecules react with luminal substrates such as thiosulphates, they can subsequently act as electron receptors for pathogens that use respiration, which allows the respiring bacteria to outcompete commensal bacteria that use fermentation for energy generation [64]. This results in loss of obligate anaerobes with expansion of facultative anaerobes and aerobes. The dysbiosis we observed was characterized by loss of Lachnospiracea, and to a lesser extent Clostridiacea and Ruminococcacaea, all obligate anaerobes. These findings suggest that NSAID-induced dysbiosis might cause inflammation resulting in increased ROS production. While not linked to dysbiosis, increased ROS production has been demonstrated during NSAID-induced intestinal injury [64, 65]. Another mechanism by which NSAIDs might induce a dysbiosis is the antimicrobial properties of some NSAIDs. It is unknown, however, whether phenylbutazone or firocoxib exhibit antimicrobial properties, especially because the GI luminal concentrations of these drugs in horses (or other species) remains unknown [66\u201368].",

                    "text": "The clinical significance of the NSAID-induced dysbiosis remains elusive. While the horses enrolled in this study exhibited no signs of illness, based on daily physical examination, there was no attempt made to document injury to the GI tract. The types of bacteria altered by NSAIDs in this study have been linked to disease in horses. Specifically, members of the family Lachnospiraceae were higher in healthy horses than in horses with colitis [69]. In addition, Clostridiales families Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae, both of which were reduced following NSAID administration, have been designated as integral players in the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis, particularly due to their ability to produce large quantities of the short chain fatty acid butyrate [18, 70]. It is unknown if NSAID administration resulted in decreased butyrate production or alterations in the gut metabolome of these horses. Nevertheless, our data suggests that dysbiosis may significantly impact the function of the microbiota, because we demonstrated functional differences in the inferred metagenome after 10 days of NSAID administration with similar changes between the 2 classes of NSAIDs. Limitations of the taxonomic resolution of 16S sequencing prevent further classification of the bacteria altered by NSAIDs beyond family and some genera assignment. Our results, however, demonstrate a great deal of concordance of the effects of NSAIDs on the fecal microbiota of adult horses. These findings suggest that NSAID administration over 10 days temporarily alters both the population and the function of the microbiota. The implications of these changes on host health remain unknown.",

                    "text": "This study has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively modest. Nevertheless, these data represent the largest and only study examining the effects of NSAID administration on the fecal microbiota of horses, and contribute important findings, irrespective of species, on the impact of COX-2-selective versus non-selective NSAIDs on the fecal microbiota. Second, we examined only the fecal microbiota. Although fecal samples are often used as indicators of the intestinal microbiota, it has been shown that fecal microbiota data do not always correlate with samples taken from regions of the tract, and that GI variation in the microbiota occurs among different anatomical sites of the intestinal tract [71]. For example, fecal samples might not have reflected the microbiota inhabiting the intestinal mucosa; the mucosal microbiota might be more important for immune development and modulating host inflammatory responses because it is more intimately associated with the immune cells of the host\u2019s intestinal tract. Third, our population was limited to a single equine facility and consisted of healthy horses. We do not know to what extent our results from these horses can be extrapolated to other populations of horses, particularly sick horses or horses being treated concurrently with other medications including antimicrobials. Finally, the metagenome of the microbiota was inferred rather than directly assayed. While the inferred metagenome has been shown to correlate with the true metagenome and is used routinely for these purposes, more robust and detailed information could be gathered by assaying the actual metagenome rather than the inferred metagenome [72, 73]. By utilizing the inferred metagenome it is difficult to assign specific function to specific bacteria to more precisely understand how the relative loss or gain of a specific bacteria might affect the metagenome. Similarly, we utilized 16S rRNA sequencing which, while well-accepted, has several well-recognized limitations that prevented deeper taxonomic resolution. Other approaches to query the microbiota exist, including whole genome sequencing or prior culture. These approaches could have allowed a more complete understanding of the community and function of the microbiota in our study.[74] A further limitation was that only a single dosing regimen of each drug was examined in this study. Each drug was dosed according to label directions, but many different dosing regimens are used clinically, including the use of a loading dose of firocoxib [75]. Future studies evaluating differences in efficacy and GI injury using different dosing protocols of these and other NSAIDs is warranted in order to determine if any approach is safer and more efficacious than another. A final limitation of this work is the relatively descriptive nature of this work. The clinical ramifications of NSAID-induced microbiota changes are unknown; however, documenting the effects of this class of medications on the equine microbiota is the first necessary step in understanding how these changes contribute to equine health and whether these changes render horses more or less susceptible to the effects of NSAIDs on the GI tract.",

These findings add to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that NSAIDs induce dysbiosis in both people and animals although the implications of this dysbiosis remain unclear. In addition, our findings demonstrate that NSAID-induced dysbiosis is similar for both COX selective and non-selective NSAIDs in horses. Deciphering the complex interaction of NSAIDs, the host, and the microbiota in both equine health and disease is the focus of ongoing and future work.",
