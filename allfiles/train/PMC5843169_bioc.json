The complexity of the lung microbial community in COPD patients has been highlighted in recent years. Evidence suggests that transplantation, medications, age, and disease severity influence microbial community membership. However, the dynamics of the lung microbiome in stable COPD patients remain poorly understood. In this study, we completed a longitudinal 16S ribosomal RNA survey of the lung microbiome on replicate sputum samples collected from 4 former smokers with COPD (Stage 2) within a 2-day time period. Samples from each individual over the two-day period were similar based on \u03b1-diversity, principle component analysis and taxonomy at the phyla and genera level. Sputum samples from COPD patients were also collected between 2\u20139 months of follow-up. Data suggest an increased variability of the sputum microbiota when comparing samples collected \u2264 3 months compared to those collected \u2265 4 months; however, no statistically significant shifts in the abundance (>2-fold) of taxa between the two time points was observed. Bacterial composition and the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) remained similar over time. Results from this study suggest that the sputum microbiome is relatively stable in clinically stable COPD patients (Stage 2). This study furthers our understanding of the dynamics of the lung microbiome in COPD patients.",

It was believed that the lungs of healthy individuals were sterile. However, since the first report of a lung microbiome, many studies have found evidence of bacteria in the lower airways using new culture-independent methods [5\u20138]. The core airway microbiome in the healthy lung is predominantly comprised of the phyla Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria [7,9,10]. This community is modified in individuals with lung disease [9\u201311]. Many patients with COPD during clinical stability show evidence of chronic bacterial colonization with pathogens of the phylum Proteobacteria including Haemophilus spp. and Moraxella spp. [8,12,13], while Bacteroidetes were more prevalent in control patients [8].",

One study examined the lung microbiome during acute exacerbations and found lower abundances of genera Moraxella and Streptococcus in sputum samples compared with samples taken during clinical stability [16]. Another study identified increases in Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, and Moraxella during exacerbations compared to paired sampling from periods of clinical stability in COPD patients [17]. All of these studies have shown that changes in the lung microbiome in patients with COPD occur when there are exacerbations and respiratory infections [19\u201321]. As yet, there are no longitudinal studies comparing baseline sputum samples with samples collected over time in clinically stable COPD patients.",

Briefly, freshly-collected sputum was weighed and 0.9 mL of the sample including all mucous plugs was solubilized in 0.1% dithiothreitol, diluted 4-fold with EDTA, and filtered through a 0.48 mm mesh strainer. Cells isolated from this fraction were cyto-centrifuged, stained using a Wright\u2019s-Giemsa histologic stain (Diff-Quik, Fisher Sci. St. Louis, MO), assessed microscopically using a Neubauer hemacytometer (four high-power fields or 400 cells counted per sample) and macrophages, neutrophils and epithelial cells quantified. Squamous cell number was recorded as an indicator of the sputum sample quality. Greater than 40% squamous contamination (from the mouth and throat) excluded the sample. DNA was isolated from the remaining solubilized sputum using a bead beating, solvent extraction method (PowerSoil DNA isolation Kit, Mo Bio) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. An approximately 460 bp sized fragment of the V3 / V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified (25 cycles of PCR) for each of the DNA samples beginning with 12.5 ng of DNA per Illumina\u2019s recommended protocol outlined in the 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). 16S Amplicon PCR Forward Primer = 5'TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 16S Amplicon PCR Reverse Primer = 5'GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC. Following generation of the amplicons, dual indices and Illumina sequencing adapters were added (8 cycles of PCR) using the Nextera XT Index kit (Illumina catalog # FC\u2010131\u20101001). Resultant libraries were multiplexed and 300 bp long, paired-end sequence data was generated on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using V3 chemistry per Illumina\u2019s recommendations. An ample yield of at least 4,000 reads/sample was used to characterize the bacterial community from each sample. The use of at least 4000 reads/sample as a threshold is appropriate in this study and reflects the microbial diversity in our samples because the rarefaction curves plateaued at 1500\u20132000 reads/sample (S1 and S3 Figs).",

Post-QC reads were aligned against the Greengene database [27]. The number of sequences excluded due to not aligning with the Greengenes database is presented in S1 and S2 Tables. Following the taxonomy assignment, the number of sequences assigned to a particular phylotype and the percentage of these sequences in the microbial community were calculated for each sample. Samples with less than 4,000 total cleaned reads were excluded. Reads with more than 97% identity were tallied to make the counts and percentages tables, with each row representing a different phylotype. Alpha (Shannon and Chao1 Indices) and Beta (Unifrac weighted) diversity scores were calculated. Unifrac distance metric was used for performing the Principal Component Analysis (PCoA) plots. Community membership and structure were examined using the PCoA plots to determine relatedness among samples. Heat maps showing similarity or dissimilarity among samples were also generated.",

The mean age of the participants was 63 years (\u00b1 7.4 SD) and had worked on a farm for an average of 35 years (\u00b1 20 SD). The mean FEV1/FVC ratio and % predicted FEV1 was 0.61 (\u00b1 0.1 SD) and 60.7 (\u00b1 7.7 SD), respectively. The number of OTUs detected at 97% identity was on average 375 (\u00b1 103 SD) for the 12 samples (Table 1). There were no significant differences in the number of OTUs obtained from day 1 and day 2 (p = 0.61, Mann-Whitney U Test). We compared the Shannon diversity indices for each patient at each time point using the Wilcoxin Signed-Rank Test. However, the N (5) was not large enough for the distribution of the statistic to form a normal distribution thus an accurate p-value could not be calculated. On average we observed a 3% (\u00b1 0.5 SD) change in the Shannon Index between day 1 and day 2 samples (Table 1).",

The majority of the participants (87.5%) was over the age of 60 and worked on the farm for greater than 20 years (62.5%). The mean FEV1/FVC ratio and % predicted FEV1 was 0.67 (\u00b1 0.04 SD) and 64.0 (\u00b1 7.3 SD), respectively. DNA sequencing reads (337,474) were selected after demultiplexing and quality control filtering, with each sample averaging 24,105 trimmed sequences. The average number of unique OTUs identified across 14 samples was 456 (\u00b1 130 SD). There were no significant differences in the number of OTUs obtained from baseline and at the later time point (p = 0.70, Mann-Whitney U Test). We used the Wilcoxin Signed-Rank Test to compare the Shannon index for a subject at each time point. The size of the N (7) was not large enough for the Wilcoxin statistic to form a normal distribution; therefore, it was not possible to calculate an accurate p value. There was on average a 3.6% (\u00b1 5.4 SD) change in the Shannon index for samples collected \u2264 3 months compared to a 10.2% (\u00b1 6.7 SD) change for samples collected \u2265 4 months.",

Of the 183 genera identified, the most abundant were Veillonella (17.2%), Prevotella (11.8%), Streptococcus (11.1%), Rothia (7.6%), and Haemophilus (3.9%), all of which are typical members of the lung microbiota [29] (S5 Fig, Bottom). These top ten genera were 100% prevalent across all samples from both visits (T1 and T2), suggesting that for our COPD cohort, the sputum microbiome did not undergo major shifts in genera over this time period [30].",

In this study, Firmicutes was the most prevalent phylum, a phylum primarily composed of gram-positive microorganisms, followed by Bacteriodetes. A study conducted by Hilty et al. showed Bacteroidetes, particularly Prevotella spp., was more prevalent in controls than in COPD patients [8], while Proteobacteria, a gram-negative phylum, was more prevalent in COPD patients compared to controls [8].",

In our study, only Streptococcus and Haemophilus, not Pseudomonas or Moraxella, were represented in the top ten genera of the 14 samples. Of note, Haemophilus was most prevalent in 2150-T1, possibly due to complex medical issues of this patient as described below.",

In previous studies, factors including interventions (transplantation and medications), age, exacerbations, and disease severity have been shown to influence microbial community membership [8,16,21,30,33]. We attempted to control for these covariates during the patient selection phase as described below. Patient ID 2150 showed the greatest differences in the bacterial composition between the two time points. This patient\u2019s medical chart indicated multiple health issues including heart failure, chest pain, and arrhythmia. Although patient ID 2150 was not taking antibiotics two months prior to collection of induced sputum samples, he had taken clindamycin after the first sample and prior to the second sample. Antibiotics have been shown to increase microbial diversity, though this did not occur in our observations of this patient [20,30]. Our observations did show a large decrease in Proteobacteria and an increase in Firmicutes in this patient, which is in agreement with previous studies regarding antibiotic use among COPD patients [20,30]. Age has been shown to be associated with microbial diversity [33]. Pragman et al. showed younger age is associated with less microbial diversity in COPD patients [33]. Although patient ID 2150 was the youngest compared to others in this study, only his second sample showed the lowest diversity among all samples.",

A study conducted by Sethi et al. identified lower densities of Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumonia in sputum samples collected during acute exacerbations compared with samples during clinical stability [16]. Another study examined sputum from COPD patients and identified increases in Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, and Moraxella during exacerbations compared to paired sampling from periods of clinical stability [17]. Both, Huang et al. and Molyneaux et al. found an increase in the phylum Proteobacteria during COPD exacerbation [21,30]. What\u2019s interesting to note is that Moraxella was found in only one sample of this study, ID 2396 (time = 2) at 0.7%.",

All of the patients in our study had Stage 2 COPD at the time of enrollment into the AgLung study; therefore, we were unable to investigate the relationship between COPD stage and bacterial diversity. Because this study only included patients with stable COPD, we cannot generalize our results to individuals without COPD. Although patient ID 2326 had a borderline diagnosis of COPD, the bacterial composition and diversity of his samples were similar to those with COPD stage two in this study. Notably, both of patient ID 2326\u2019s samples clustered with all other samples (except ID 2150) on the PCoA plot.",

Some believe that smoking in and of itself does not alter the lung microbial community [35]; however, current smokers were found to have lower 16S rRNA copy numbers. And while 16S rRNA copy number cannot be directly compared with measures of bacterial community diversity, as some bacteria can possess multiple copies of the 16S rRNA gene, some studies have shown smokers exhibit greater variation in the relative abundance and composition of bacteria inhabiting the nasal or oropharynx [36]. Hilty et al. examined the lung microbiome using airway brushings and included COPD patients that were current smokers (80%) [8]. They found Proteobacteria to be the most abundant phylum in COPD patients. Although Proteobacteria was one of the top four phyla in our study, Firmicutes was the most abundant. A handful of studies have evaluated the lung microbiome of COPD patients who smoke; however, additional studies with larger sample sizes are required to definitively determine if the lung microbiome is altered by smoking in those with COPD.",

Approximately 71.5% of individuals in this study worked with hogs, either in confinement or open lots, in their lifetime, while 100% were exposed to grain dust. All patients were former farmers in this study; and therefore, most likely the influence of the agricultural environment did not play a role in influencing the lung microbiome unless there were long term effects.

One of the admitted limitations of this study is the sample size, and therefore descriptive in nature. In fact, relatively small sample sizes have plagued many lung microbiome studies and most likely limited our ability to observe significant differences between our groups. Inducing sputum from patients is difficult and time-consuming and for safety reasons, we only induced sputum in those with COPD Stage 2. Collecting samples using induced sputum is a non-invasive alternative to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Studies comparing the microbiome at different sites along the aerodigestive tract find that this body site constitutes a microbiological continuum with substantial species overlap but with varying abundances [6,7]. Consequently, it is challenging to define a distinct lung microbiome to filter out oral contamination from the induced sputum 16S data. Additionally, sputum samples have been shown to have significantly lower diversity than other sample types such as BAL, cell-free BAL supernatants, and biopsies [32].",
