The three human groups differed significantly by the degree of diversity between and within individuals (e.g. beta diversity: Africans > Alaskans > Germans; alpha diversity: Germans > Alaskans > Africans). UniFrac, network, ANOSIM, and correlation analyses all indicated more similarities in the saliva microbiome of native Alaskans and Germans than between either group and Africans. The native Alaskans and Germans also had the highest number of shared bacterial interactions. At the level of shared OTUs, only limited support for a core microbiome shared across all three continental regions was provided, although partial correlation analysis did highlight interactions involving several pairs of genera as conserved across all human groups. Subsampling strategies for compensating for the unequal number of individuals per group or unequal sequence reads confirmed the above observations.",

In addition, while mostly harmless in their primary (oral) habitat, oral bacteria have been linked with systemic, life-threatening disorders, e.g. cardiovascular disease, stroke, preterm birth, and pneumonia [11-16]. Hence the oral microbiome significantly affects human health. Moreover, the oral ecological system is influenced by external factors, such as food, drink, living temperature and humidity, and oral hygiene measures [17-19] and previous studies have shown a high degree of inter-individual variation in the oral microbiome [20,21]. While the overall oral health/disease status is a principal determinant of the oral microbial community compositions [20,22], comparatively little is known about how the structure and diversity of the oral microbiome varies across healthy human hosts of different ethnic or environmental origin.",

Furthermore, we found that the saliva microbiome of Batwa Pygmies, a former hunter-gatherer group from Africa, is much more diverse than the saliva microbiome of two agricultural African groups, most likely because of their different lifestyle and diet [23]. Other studies have found signatures of ethnicity in the oral microbiome [24]. Hence, both environment and geography may play a role in defining a \u201chealthy\u201d human oral microbiome. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the salivary microbiome diversity of three different human groups living under different climatic conditions. We obtained new data from 76 native Alaskans from four different geographic locations, all sampled from the northern extremity of the North American continent, as well as from ten individuals from Germany. For comparison, we also analyzed previously published data from 66 individuals from three different African populations located near the equator [23]. In this study, we are able to compare the salivary microbiome composition of different human populations living under very different climatic conditions and geographic locations.",

We next carried out an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) at the genus level in order to investigate how much of the total variation in the saliva microbiome is due to differences within vs. among individuals from each group. The results (Table\u00a01) indicate that the Barrow, Nuiqsut and Wainwright groups have similar apportionments of variation (variance between individual: 6.75 - 10.21% and variance within individuals: 89.79 - 93.25%), while the group from Atqasuk has slightly more differentiation between individuals (13.43%) and correspondingly less variance within individuals (86.57%). Thus, the group from Atqasuk is characterized by a higher heterogeneity of the salivary microbiome among individuals, compared to the other three native Alaskan groups. By contrast, the German group was characterized by very little variance among individuals (only 2.32%), while the African groups were characterized by much more variance among individuals (13.81 \u2013 43.75%). When introducing an additional hierarchical level into the AMOVA by grouping individuals from the same population, the variance component among the four native Alaskan groups (\u22120.17%) was not significantly different from zero, indicating that the saliva microbiomes of the native Alaskan groups have similar compositions. By contrast, a variance component of 4.06% was observed among the three African groups, which is significantly different from zero. Thus, the composition of the saliva microbiome does differ significantly among the African groups. Overall, when grouped together according to climatic region (Table\u00a01), the German group showed the smallest variance among individuals (2.21%), followed by native Alaskans (9.69%), and then Africans with the highest variance among individuals (25.97%).",

The phylogenetic distribution of those genera with more than 0.5% abundance in at least one group are displayed in Figure\u00a01, while the exact values and pairwise significance values are given in Additional file 4: Table S1. The most common phyla are Actinobacteria (A), Bacteroidetes (B), Firmicutes (F), Fusobacteria (Fu), Proteobacteria (P) and TM7 (T), with an abundance rank order F\u2009>\u2009B\u2009>\u2009P\u2009>\u2009A\u2009>\u2009Fu\u2009>\u2009T for native Alaskans and Germans, and P\u2009>\u2009F\u2009>\u2009B\u2009>\u2009Fu\u2009>\u2009A\u2009>\u2009T for Africans. At the genus level, there were 13 genera (covering all six phyla) out of the 28 common genera with comparable abundance in both native Alaskans and Germans. Conversely, native Alaskans and Africans shared only six genera (Neisseria, Campylobacter, Granulicatella, Megasphaera, Selenomonas, Actinomyces) with comparable abundance while Germans and Africans shared only three genera (Actinobacillus, Aggregatibacter, Capnocytophaga,), see Additional file 4: Table S1.Three genera (Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Leptotrichia) were of similar abundance in all three groups, and seven genera (Enterobacter, Escherichia, Citrobacter, Gemella, Klebsiella, Rothia, and Veillonella) were of different abundances in all three groups.",

We constructed partial correlation networks to visualize the direct or indirect relationships among bacteria for Alaskans, Germans, and Africans separately. Significant correlations were found for 147 pairs of bacterial genera of which the majority (i.e. 107) were uniquely present in only one human group: 48 in the Alaskan group, 37 in the German group, and 22 in the African group. Of the remaining 40 pairs (see Figure\u00a03), 12 were shared between the Alaskan and the African group, 20 between the Alaskan and German group, and 4 between the German and African group. Four pairs of bacterial genera were shared between all three human populations, namely Actinomyces-Veillonella, Gemella-Granulicatella, Haemophilus-Veillonella, and Capnocytophaga-TM7_genera_incertae_sedis. Despite the high number of unique interactions at the genus level, the assignment of correlating genera to the phylum level showed a fairly consistent proportion of either phylum in the case of positive interactions (Additional file 6: Table S2). However, the number of negative interactions was much lower in the African group compared to the Alaskan and German group (Additional file 6: Table S2, Additional file 7: Figure S5).",

There are very few OTUs (0.16% - 0.22%) shared exclusively by two regional groups (Table\u00a02), and the percentage of sequences distributed in the shared OTUs is also quite low (0.20% -0.66%).

Thus, to evaluate the effect of uneven sequencing and sampling, we re-performed all calculations based on randomly subsampling ~2500 reads from ~12 individuals from each population. As expected, the absolute number of observed genera and OTUs are decreased due to the reduced sampling reads (Additional file 10: Table S4). However, the major results from the comparisons among populations or groups did not change, e.g. the AMOVA analysis (Additional file 10: Table S4), rarefaction analysis (Additional file 11: Figure S7), UniFrac analysis (Additional file 12: Figure S8), and diversity analysis (Additional file 13: Figure S9). In another approach we separately subsampled 10 individuals from Alaskans, Germans, and Africans while also correcting for the unequal number of reads, i.e. we sampled ~2500 reads from each group. The corresponding results were similar to those based on the original number of individuals as can be seen in the AMOVA analysis (Additional file 10: Table S4), rarefaction analysis (Additional file 14: Figure S10), and diversity analysis (Additional file 15: Figure S11).",

In addition, detailed examination of the oral health status or history of the donors was not carried out, nor was information available concerning dental hygiene practices of the donor; however, all donors were healthy and no donors were suffering from obvious oral lesions or diseases. Moreover, we do not detect consistent differences among groups in bacterial genera that have been previously shown to be associated with variation in dental hygiene (Figure\u00a02), such as Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas and Prevotella [31]. Thus, the differences discussed below are more likely to reflect differences in geography, climate, and/or diet, rather than differences in oral health/hygiene (although the latter cannot be ruled out completely).",

Therefore, geographic location and potentially different diets (the inland groups eat more caribou and less marine mammals than the coastal groups) did not play a crucial role in shaping the salivary microbiome composition of the four Alaskan groups. Conversely, the three African groups differed significantly, with the Batwa Pygmies (hunter-gatherer lifestyle) showing significantly higher saliva microbiome diversity compared to the other two African groups (farmer lifestyle). Hence, lifestyle, geography and/or diet also seem to play a role in shaping the salivary microbiome in the African groups. For comparison, we also analyzed the salivary microbiome composition of a German group, representing an intermediate geographic location with moderate climatic conditions. Interestingly, the salivary microbiome of the German group showed a high similarity with the Alaskan group at the genus level, while at the OTU level distinct differences could be observed. Overall, the salivary microbiome of the human populations from the northern continents were of comparable similarity, but differed strongly from the African groups at both the genus and OTU level. This finding corroborates our previous study, which showed an association between UniFrac distances and the geographic distance of analyzed individuals from the equator [21].",

Differences were more pronounced at the OTU-level than at the genus-level. Alpha diversity was highest for the German group and lowest for the African group, while the opposite was true for beta diversity (Additional file 2; Figure S2 and Figure\u00a05), which is in agreement with the AMOVA analysis (Table\u00a01). One potential explanation for the differences in alpha diversity could be the diversity of the diet. The diet of the German individuals probably encompasses a wider variety of substances (especially a multitude of different carbohydrates) than the diet of the native Alaskans or Africans, and those nutrients have an affect on the ecology of the mouth [32]. We therefore speculate that a rich buffet of different foodstuffs may provide a more complex array of substrates and thus ultimately allow a higher number of bacterial species (including low-abundant members) to thrive in the oral cavity, which would explain the differences in alpha-diversity observed in our study. Another explanation could be population density, which is higher in Germany than in the other regions, providing more opportunities for bacteria to be spread among individuals. High beta diversity reflects the heterogeneity of the samples, which in turn might be the result of the size and diversity of the sampled area (e.g. the German individuals reflect a more homogenous group coming from a fairly restricted area, while the Alaskan and African groups originated from far bigger geographic areas). Large areas are environmentally more heterogeneous than small areas and as a consequence the overall diversity of observed bacteria might be higher. Hence, despite relatively low diversity within individuals, the overall number of bacterial taxa may be higher in more geographically dispersed groups, as was observed for the African group (Table\u00a01).",

                    "text": "Studies on bacterial interaction within human ecosystems are still in their infancy, however they address important and challenging open questions regarding the human microbiome: namely, how is human health affected by the trophic interdependencies and disturbances among bacterial taxa? Here we used partial correlation analysis to construct the interaction network for each regional group (Alaskans, Germans, and Africans) based on genera. Interestingly, the resulting interactions were mostly unique to one particular human group. Although currently largely speculative in nature, these interactions may reflect the versatility of microbial trophic webs within humans [33]. As such these interactions might provide the basis for a better distinction of different human populations, which otherwise may not be distinguishable by the mere composition of their microbiota. Even at the phylum level a distinction was observed, since the African group showed a lower number of negative interactions, while the proportion of positive interactions were largely consistent among the human groups. Partial correlation analysis also showed that the Alaskan group and the German group shared the highest number of common interactions between genera, corroborating the overall result of this study. The network of 40-shared interactions (between at least two geographical regions) included also the recognized association of early, middle and late oral colonizers (Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium and Aggregatibacter, respectively [34]. Hence, the associations known from in-vitro experiments seem to stably exist in oral ecological niches across different ethnic hosts and/or different geographic environments. Furthermore four pairs of positive interactions were identified present in all human populations. Apparently, the involved genera (i.e. Actinomyces, Gemella, Granulicatella, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Capnocytophaga and TM 7) are not only permanently prevalent (though with different abundances, as can be seen in Figure\u00a01), but may reflect fundamental bacterial relationships in the human oral cavity (regardless of ethnicity or geographic origin). As such those genera may have a key role in human oral health or disease. This assumption is further warranted by the recognized central position of early colonizing Veillonella that emerges in saliva as a critical genus guiding the development of multispecies communities [34], and by the emerging key role of members of the phylum TM 7 in the salivary microbiome [35].",

However, comparisons with our study are not straightforward, as saliva samples made up only 6% of their samples and microbial relationships are presented largely at the family or class level. There is only one reported positive association at the genus level in saliva, namely between Aggregatibacter and Capnocytophaga, which we also observe in the African individuals. Otherwise, it is notable that most bacterial interactions were found in the oral cavity compared to other body sites [35], which may explain the relatively high number of interactions we found in our study.",

Hence, resemblance of salivary microbiomes between human populations rather occurs at higher taxonomic ranks and in how the microbiomes are structured (e.g. beta and alpha diversity). In addition, the relatively low number of OTUs shared among all continental groups (i.e. 56 OTUs accounting for 21% of all reads) provides at best limited support for the concept of a core human saliva microbiome at the 97% OTU level. Clearly, a core human microbiome (if truly existing) can be defined in more complex ways, depending on the ecological questions addressed [37]. However, it can be concluded that these 56 common OTUs probably represent key organisms that are important for sustaining the salivary microbial ecosystems in at least some humans.",

                    "text": "Interestingly the number of unique OTUs (i.e. those found only in one continental group but shared among all populations within this group) was highest in Africa, although the African group had the highest heterogeneity (according to the results of the beta diversity and AMOVA analyses). Most of these African specific OTUs are enriched in Enterobacteriaceae (i.e. Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Escherichia). In line with our previous observations [21,23], members of the family Enterobactericeae seem to be a consistent signature that distinguishes the salivary microbiome of African populations from other worldwide geographical regions. The reason for the high prevalence and abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in African populations remains currently unknown; knowledge of precise species would help elucidate the source of enterobacterial colonization (e.g. uptake of free-living species from plants vs. introduction through consumption of fecal-contaminated food or water). Besides diet or drinking water, we speculate that outdoor temperature is a hitherto unrecognized contributing factors that enhances/promotes the oral colonization of Enterobacteriaceae in Africans. First, members of Enterobacteriaceae grow best at temperatures beyond 37 degrees Celsius (e.g. the optimum growth rate of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sakazakii is 40.85 and 39.4 degrees Celsius, respectively [38,39]. Second, increased temperature by seasonal changes has been shown to be associated with increased human colonization by Enterobacteriaceae, as deduced from retrospective studies on Gram-negative bacterial bloodstream infections [40,41]. Third, outdoor temperature affects the oral temperature [42,43] and it is plausible to assume that the oral temperature of African individuals is at least slightly elevated compared to individuals from other climatic zones and therefore more amenable for enterobacterial growth. In addition to the temperature level itself, the constancy of the oral temperature may influence bacterial growth. It is conceivable that sudden drops or rise in oral temperature occur within Alaskan and German individuals (especially during wintertime) when leaving or entering heated houses, which clearly is not the case for individuals with close proximity to the equator.",

These sequence reads have been deposited in Genebank Sequence Read Archive (SRA) SRP028342. The aligned sequences used in the analyses are available from the authors upon request. Quality filtering of the raw sequence reads was performed with the AmpliconNoise pipeline [25], and the chimeras were identified by the Mallard [47] program by using a quantile value of 95% as the threshold for removing outliers. The filtered sequences were assigned to different genera by the Classifier approach [26] in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database [48]. Diversity statistics and apportionment of variation based on the frequency distribution of genera within and between individuals were calculated with Arlequin 3.5 [49]. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients were calculated with the R package. Diversity (dissimilarity) analysis, Shannon-Weaver index (alpha diversity), S\u00f8rensen index (beta diversity) were calculated by the \u201cvegan\u201d package in R, and the significances of diversity distributions between groups were implemented by the Mann\u2013Whitney u test. The dissimilarity tests among groups (ANOSIM) were also implemented by the \u201cvegan\u201d package in R. Rarefaction analysis was carried out using the Resampling Rarefaction 1.3 software (http://strata.uga.edu/software/). For the UniFrac analysis, the sequences were aligned with the Infernal 1.0 program [50] and a phylogenetic tree was constructed under a generalized time reversible (GTR) model with the FastTree software [51]. Fast UniFrac [52] was then used to compare the microbial communities, compute the distance matrix, and generate the cluster tree. The OTUs networks were constructed from the sequences aligned with Infernal 1.0 by using tools provided by the RDP website to first cluster all sequences that were 97% or more similar (based on a minimum overlap of 25 bases) into OTUs (to account for sequencing errors). We then used the Cytoscape 2.8 software [53] to generate and visualize the networks. Briefly, each individual is considered a Source node and each OTU is a Target node. Target nodes were linked to Source nodes in a bipartite network, with connections between Sources and Targets modeled as springs; both Source and Target nodes are placed in such a way as to minimize the forces across the network. The partial correlation network was constructed by \u201cGeneNet\u201d package in R [54]. The partial correlation coefficients were calculated from the abundance frequency of the 123 genera for the 152 individuals and the significance of correlations was estimated by permutation. We used an FDR (false discovery rate) of 0.01 as a cutoff to choose the top-ranked correlations among genera to build the connection network. For simplicity, we only displayed the connections among the 28 most common genera (i.e. those with a frequency >0.5% in either the Alaskan, German or African group). Additionally, the phylogenetic tree in Figure\u00a01 was implemented in the ARB program package [55] using the Jukes-Cantor correction.",
