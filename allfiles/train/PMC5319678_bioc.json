A distinct gut microbiota in CD has consistently been described in the literature[3], and while the evidence is in favour of a primary role in the aetiology of the disease, no specific bacterial taxon has yet been convincingly implicated as fundamental to CD pathophysiology. It is also unclear whether microbial perturbations precede or follow disease initiation and the contributory effect of gastrointestinal inflammation as shown previously [2, 4].",

Previous research in CD families has focused almost exclusively on the compositional differences of the faecal and mucosal microbiota but the findings remain inconsistent [5\u201310] and only a few studies provided a depiction of the global gut microbiota, using modern high-throughput sequencing techniques. As microbial composition does not reflect community function, there is now a pressing need to shift the paradigm from studies exploring compositional differences to those assessing functionality; the latter being potentially more relevant in health and disease. Studies which have explored both the composition and functionality of gut microbiota in IBD are currently lacking.",

After addition of 500 \u03bcl of 5% N-lauroyl sacrosine in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8) the sample was incubated at 70\u00b0C for 1 hour. Sterile zirconium beads (375 \u03bcl of 0.1 mm; Thistle Scientific, UK) were added and the bacterial cells were lysed (MP FastPrep 24, MP Biomedicals, California, USA) at 4.5 speed, three times for 60 sec. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) (15 mg) was added to the sample, which was vortexed and centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C.

After this, we applied a 10bp length threshold to discard reads that fall below this length. We then used pandaseq (v 2.4) with a minimum overlap of 50bp to assemble the forward and reverse reads into a single sequence spanning the entire V4 region[15]. After having obtained the consensus sequences from each sample, we used the UPARSE (v7.0.1001) as described in https://bitbucket.org/umerijaz/amplimock/src for operational taxonomic unit (OTU) construction. The approach was as follows: we pooled the reads from different samples together and added barcodes to keep an account of the samples these reads originated from. We then de-replicated the reads and sorted them by decreasing abundance and discarded singletons. Reads were then clustered based on 97% similarity, discarding reads shorter than 32bp. Even though the cluster_otu command in usearch removes reads that have chimeric models built from more abundant reads, a few chimeras may be missed, especially if they have parents that are absent from the reads or are present in very low abundance. Therefore, in the next step, we used a reference-based chimera filtering step using a gold database (http://drive5.com/uchime/uchime_download.html) that is derived from the ChimeraSlayer reference database in the Broad Microbiome Utilities (http://microbiomeutil.sourceforge.net/). The original barcoded reads were matched against clean OTUs with 97% similarity (a proxy for species level separation) to generate OTU tables for different samples. The representative OTUs were then taxonomically classified against the RDP database using the standalone RDPclassifier v2.6[16] with the default\u2014minWords option of 5. To find the phylogenetic distances between OTUs, we first multisequence aligned the OTUs against each other using mafft v7.040[17] and then used FastTree v2.1.7 on these alignments to generate an approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree[18].",

Where appropriate, the abundance data was normalised[23] choosing log-relative transformation before doing statistics for downstream analysis. To find OTUs that are significantly different between the conditions, we used the DESeq2 package[24]. This uses a negative binomial to model the abundance data (OTU frequencies) and empirical Bayes to shrink OTU-wise dispersions to identify OTUs that have the maximum log-fold changes between different conditions. Differential expressions were tested by performing a Wald test on shrunken log-fold changes adjusted for multiple comparisons. For community analysis (including alpha and beta diversity analyses) we used the Vegan package[25], in particular the two functions adonis for PERMANOVA and betadisper for the analysis of multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions. The p-values reported in such a case were those returned by the functions themselves. Microbial compositional structure was assessed using non-metric multidimensional scaling plot (NMDS). We applied the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index, which considers bacterial taxon presence and abundance, but also the unweighted Unifrac distance analysis which takes into account the phylogenetic distances (relatedness) of the bacterial taxa, without accounting for their abundance. Specifically, the abundance table was converted to a presence/absence table in the case of unweighted Unifrac distance. The taxa present in one or both samples were then placed on the phylogenetic tree. The distance between two samples was then calculated as the sum of unshared (taxa not common) branch lengths divided by the sum of all tree branch lengths, both shared (taxa common) and unshared, between pair of samples. To calculate Unifrac distances, we used the Phyloseq[26] package. We also performed local contribution for \u03b2-diversity (LCBD) analysis to measure the contribution of each sample to the total OTU \u03b2-diversity, calculated from all study samples together (% of total community dispersion) [27]. Samples with high LCBD represent samples that are markedly different from the average \u03b2-diversity of all study samples. For differences in metagenomic metabolic pathways, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test. For correlations between SCFA and discriminatory OTUs, we used Kendall rank correlation. For \u03b1-diversity, subanalysis was also performed accounting for the genetic relatedness of participants from the CD and CDR group (paired data). We used the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing in all analyses.

This significant difference in Bray-Curtis similarity index was due to a higher variation in the microbial community structure of the samples of the CD group compared with the samples from the two adult groups where community structure was more homogeneous (Bray-Curtis, CD vs CDR, p = 0.035; CD vs HUC, p<0.001). Notably, within the CDR group, where faecal calprotectin varied among subjects, there was a tendency for the community structure of the gut microbiota of subjects with increased faecal calprotectin to diverge from those with normal levels (Bray-Curtis, p = 0.07; unweighted Unifrac, p = 0.14) (Fig 1, Panel A & B).",

From the 21 OTUs which differentiated CDR from HUC, none was significantly associated with calprotectin within the former group. The relative abundance of OTUs which belonged to the Catenibacterium spp., Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae, Blautia genus, Ruminococcus genus and Howardella spp. were significantly lower in the CDR than the HUC group (Fig 2). In contrast, OTUs belonging to Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Dialister, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus genera were significantly more abundant in CDR participants (Fig 2).",

In contrast to the results by Hedin et al[7], no significant differences were observed between CDR and HUC for nine OTUs assigned to Roseburia and six OTUs assigned to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.

Healthy status was the strongest microbiota composition classifier. The CDR microbiota was significantly different to that of their relatives with CD and the taxon alterations we observed were similar to those reported between CD patients and unrelated controls in independent literature [28]. By inference, these findings suggest that an extensively altered microbiota, characteristic of CD dysbiosis, is not evident in genetically-linked unaffected relatives. This finding accords with previous research where the faecal microbial communities were found to be more similar between healthy identical twins than between twins with CD, especially those who were discordant for the disease[5]. Importantly, the observed perturbations in the microbiota of CDR participants were associated with composition rather than genetic functional capacity or the pattern of SCFA. These findings point towards a preservation of the microbial community functional capacity despite some alterations in microbiota composition in unaffected relatives of CD patients.",

Biomarkers of disease susceptibility in health relatives would be a helpful clinical tool to allow the development of preventative strategies.
