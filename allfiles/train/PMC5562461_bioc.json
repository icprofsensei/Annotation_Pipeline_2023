These species and others pathogenic strains were been found through previous work of poultry manure characterization (Lovanh et al., 2007, Wilkinson et al., 2011). The natural habitats of most the enteric pathogens are gastrointestinal tracts of animals. Whenever animal rejections are used into the farming activity, the antagonistic impact of native soil microbial community and the drastic conditions of soil may modify the longevity of pathogens.",
