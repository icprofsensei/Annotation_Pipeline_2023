Four of six subjects received prolonged, empiric antibiotic coverage secondary to clinical instability at the time of birth that persisted (figure 1, table A, early antibiotics). Subjects 1 and 4 who later developed late-onset sepsis following collection of sample 3, were treated as follows: Subject 1 with ampicillin and gentamicin for 3 days, then with clinical decompensation on day 4, blood cultures were resent and antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and cefotaxime for an additional 7-day course. Subject 4 received ampicillin and gentamicin for 7 days for presumed sepsis, and then demonstrated gastrointestinal symptoms concerning for necrotising enterocolitis, and antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and cefotaxime on day 7 for a further 5 days. Subjects 5 and 6 both received prolonged, empiric antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) for 6 and 7 days, respectively for presumed culture-negative sepsis (SIRS).",

Subject 1 had a predominance of Staphylococcus species at birth and went on to develop S aureus sepsis in week 4.

Interestingly, the mothers in this cohort were not exposed to significant amounts of peripartum antibiotics secondary to the urgency of their deliveries. These infants were perhaps in an unsterile environment inutero, and we postulate that the lower diversity was potentially attributable to maternal antibiotic exposure or an overabundance of primary pathogens. DiGiulio et al demonstrated in prenatal amniocentesis evaluation in the face of preterm labour that microbial density showed a dose relationship between microbial DNA and likelihood of premature delivery.38 Investigation of intrauterine environment, including detailed analysis of maternal infection and antibiotic exposure, and subsequent neonatal colonisation patterns in a large cohort might identify changes in colonisation that have clinical implications. We also demonstrate shifts in microbial populations attributable to antibiotic exposure; the associated decreased diversity may result in lengthening the instability of the developing microbiota and increased risk of disease in premature infants. Similar to our findings but in adults, Dethlefsen found profound alteration in intestinal microbial populations following ciprofloxacin, with incomplete recovery over a period of 10 months.18 Ubeda et al identified in humans that domination by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus preceded bloodstream infection in immune-compromised adults.23 We theorise that, similar to Ubeda\u2019s findings, pathogens are selected for following broad-spectrum antibiotic administration in premature infants. The complex interactions between the nearly blank canvas of the neonatal intestine, colonising microbes, nutritional and antibiotic practices, the developing immune system and risk of infection, may be significantly influenced by the intensive care environment and interventions required for premature infants.8,9,39",

We also demonstrate colonisation patterns that seem specific to subjects who develop sepsis, with a Proteobacteria and Firmicutes (Staphylococcus) predominance, whereas healthy subjects who receive limited antibiotics (<3 days total) and did not develop sepsis ultimately demonstrate an increase in relative abundance of anaerobes, potentially mirroring more \u2018mature\u2019 microbial communities, including Clostridium, Klebsiella and Veillonella.2 Jacquot et al identified a Staphylococcus predominance in the most premature infants studied, and found the least diversity of bacteria in the most premature infants.41\nStaphylococci have been described as commensals but are also among a short list of \u2018translocating\u2019 bacteria when present in abundance, which may be a contributing factor to the common risk of Staphylococcal sepsis in the NICU environment.2,42,43 Interestingly, the majority of contemporary studies of the microbiome using non-culture-based techniques are in highrisk neonatal populations rather than healthy term infants. The studies that have been published in healthy infants describe different results, including a Proteobacteria and Bifidobacterium predominance using targeted small sub unit (SSU) rRNA rRNA44 mirroring the traditional culture-based studies, and Palmer et al, using microarray, describes a predominance of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes45 which mirrors our findings for infants at risk for sepsis, with Proteobacteria and Firmicutes (Staphylococcus) predominance.",

We noted a divergence occurring between healthy infants and those who subsequently developed sepsis, with Staphylococcus predominance in subjects who go on to develop late-onset sepsis. Empiric, prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotics profoundly decreased gut microbial diversity and promoted a pathogen-predominant microbiota that was associated with sepsis due to the predominant pathogen in the microbiome. Our data suggest that premature infants who do not develop neonatal sepsis may have a definable \u2018healthy microbiome\u2019 that larger prospective studies might further elucidate.",
