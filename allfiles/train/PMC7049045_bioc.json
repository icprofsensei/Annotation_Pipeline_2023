Most patients with IUAs have fibrous band adhesions formed in the anterior and posterior walls of the uterus, and these vascular fibrous tissue adhesion bands are accompanied by different amounts of white blood cell infiltration (3). Adhesions begin to form when fibers and inflammatory exudate appear on the surface of the damaged endometrium, and then gradually develop into denser fibrous bands, eventually forming mass adhesions. Adhesion can lead to partial or total uterine cavity obliteration which reduces the implantation area of embryos. IUA hinders the endometrial blood supply and reduces the endometrial receptivity which is not conducive to the growth of the embryos (4,5). The common clinical manifestations of IUA include hypomenorrhea, amenorrhea, recurrent abortion, and secondary infertility. There are various causes of IUAs (6), and its prevalence rate increases yearly, which is mainly due to the increased incidence of iatrogenic endometrial trauma such as artificial abortion and postpartum curettage. Other causes include genital tuberculosis, pelvic irradiation, and uterine surgery (including myomectomy and surgery for uterine malformation, etc.) (7). Hooker et al. (8) reported that curettage was the most important reason for the formation of IUA during pregnancy. Iatrogenic endometrial trauma is the main cause of IUA, but this alone cannot fully explain the mechanism of adhesion formation. It is necessary to explore the potential pathogenic factors of IUA, so as to formulate specific preventive measures for IUA based on the study of these factors.",

It has been known for some time that the microbiome of the female reproductive tract plays an important role both in maintaining a healthy state and in the development of diseases in the female reproductive system. It is also widely acknowledged that lactic acid-producing microorganisms dominate the vaginal microbial community (9), maintaining a relatively healthy reproductive tract microenvironment by lowering the vaginal PH value. Previous studies have shown that vaginal dysbacteriosis will lead to a variety of diseases, such as postpartum endometritis, preterm delivery, pelvic inflammatory disease, spontaneous abortion, delivery of low-birth-weight babies, etc. (10-12).",

                    "text": "The etiology and progression mechanism of IUA caused by microorganisms is similar to that of other damaged tissues and organs with fibrosis (13). Tissue damage and bacterial imbalance not only promote inflammation, but also release a large number of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines by recruiting and activating innate and adaptive immune systems. For example, when infected by bacteria, Th1 response results in a release of large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines for the clearance of pathogens. The damaged tissues need an immune response, mainly of a profibrotic nature that is conducive to tissue repair. Meanwhile, a set of cytokines, including IL-25, IL-33, TSLP il-25, il-33, and TSLP are released by damaged epithelial cells, while other cells can directly or indirectly promote the development of Th2 immune response that promotes fibrosis (14). In previous studies, many researchers have discussed the specific immune pathways and immune cytokines that lead to fibrosis. However, few studies have directly investigated the relationship between the microbes in the uterine environment and the immune response induced by these microbes in the formation of IUAs. As far as we know, the pathological changes of IUA also affect the physiology and metabolites of the uterus, further affecting the diversity of vaginal microorganisms. Therefore, we investigated the association and interaction among IUA and microbes in the vagina. In this study, the data of 30 IUA patients and 30 healthy women were collected to analyze the correlation among vaginal microorganisms, immune cytokines, and the formation of IUAs.",

Other causes include removal of pregnancy residues, cesarean section, diagnostic curettage, myomectomy, and correction of uterine anomalies. Taskin et al. reported that IUA could be formed after hysteroscopic myomectomy, with a probability of 31.3% (20). If multiple myomectomy was performed, the incidence of IUA would rise to 45.5%, and 6.7% after hysteroscopic resection of a septum. Although hysteroscopic adhesiolysis (HA) has been widely used in clinic (21), the high recurrence rate of IUA and poor pregnancy outcomes after HA present a great challenge for clinical treatment and prevention (22).",

The human-coexisting microorganisms have important influences on human growth and development, physiology and pathology, immunity, nutrition metabolism, and other processes (30-35). Most of these microbiotas have a mutually beneficial relationship with their human hosts, and only a few opportunistic pathogens can cause chronic infections or other serious diseases under certain conditions. These microbial communities are also considered the body\u2019s first line of defense against foreign pathogens, competing to eliminate other invasive pathogens. As is well known, the symbiotic microorganisms are very important to the human body, but incredibly, people know little about the community composition and function of the microorganisms. Furthermore, we barely understand how microorganisms interact with each other, or how they can form a balanceable ecoenvironment. At present, many investigators are focusing on the research of human microorganisms, in order to get a better idea of the real role of these microorganisms in human health and disease (36).",

The most important one is lactobacillus (40,41), and the other microflora present in the vagina are mainly composed of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and virus. Under normal circumstances, the microbes in the vagina can reach an equilibrium state. Any factors that cause vaginal microecological imbalance can lead to inflammation, such as long-term application of antibiotics, frequent intercourse, vaginal flush, and a decline in estrogen (42). The balance of vaginal microecology can effectively resist the invasion of various foreign pathogens. The female reproductive tract is highly susceptible to bacterial infection. Once the immunity of the body is reduced, foreign bacteria or parasitic bacteria in the body may increase infection, causing cervicitis, endometritis, etc. (43). The main cause of IUA is injury to the endometrium associated with reproductive tract infection. Patients with IUA are usually infected with a variety of reproductive tract pathogens. Once these pathogens invade the vagina, they can enter the uterine cavity through the cervix, causing endometritis, salpingitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. Abortion preoperative cervicitis or endometritis in the case of no cure pre-abortion can lead bacteria into the uterine cavity and then cause intrauterine infection or increase the chances of IUA formation. In this study, compared with the control group, patients with IUA had a higher bacterial load and density, but less diversity in the vagina/cervix, a condition which may cause persistent damage by pathogens in the impairment of the endometrium. Some of the bacterial communities in IUA patients that disappeared in our study may play an important role in maintaining the health of the reproductive tract, and their absence may lead to a compromised repair function of the endometrium. After the iatrogenic injury of the endometrium occurred, the load of the opportunistic bacteria increased and the essential bacteria became absent, so that the normal repair function of endometrium tissue was reduced and replaced by fiber repair which lost normal function.",

                    "text": "To our knowledge, tissue injury and inflammation are important causes of tissue fibrosis. This study focused on the pathways from tissue damage and inflammation to fibrosis. The vaginal immune function is a component of the systemic immune function, including humoral and cellular immunity. The functions of systemic and local immunity jointly form an immune response network. When the local mucosa is attacked by pathogens, the immune response will quickly be generated in the blood and other mucosal sites. Some immune mediators released by immune T cells have both profibrotic and antifibrotic properties. After iatrogenic damage to the endometrium, pathological biological bacteria of the vagina and cervical canal invade into the endometrium, causing local inflammation and triggering the immune response of the endometrium, which will eliminate some pathogenic microorganisms and further change the composition of bacteria. Endometrial injury destroys the function of the surface barrier and increases the entry of harmless symbiotic bacteria or their products into the endometrium, resulting in the aggravation of the inflammatory response and fibrosis repair of the endometrium. Immune Th cells can be divided into two subgroups according to different functions, TH1 and TH2 cells, which play an important role in Th response. For inflammatory diseases, most available literature shows that Th1 expression is weak, while Th2 expression is strong, leading to the imbalance of TH1 with TH2. Cytokines secreted by immune Th cells are key regulators of immune responses to health and disease. As mentioned above, damaged endometrial epithelial cells release a series of immune cytokines, which directly or indirectly promote the development of Th2 immune response that is thought to promote fibrosis (44). The innate immune cells can release classical proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-\u03b3 which are also profibrotic. In our study, the IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 quantities in the serum of IUA patients were significantly higher than those of the non-IUA women (P<0.05). In repeated peritonitis models, inflammatory Th1 cells and cytokines IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 are essential factors in the occurrence and development of fibrosis (45). It was found that cytokine IL-6 increased the Th1 cell survival rate and up-regulated IFN-\u03b3 production, while negative feedback decreased MMP activity. Therefore, the fibrogenic effect of IL-6 is mainly due to the reduced degradation of matrix protein. Other studies have explained the role of IL-6 in promoting fibrosis by regulating the TGF-\u03b2 pathway (46,47). Profibrotic effects of IL-6 were observed in fibrosis models of different organs, including the lung (48,49), heart (50,51), kidney (47), and eye (52).",

IUAs seriously endanger the reproductive health of childbearingage females, and its pathogenesis is complex. Therefore, it is important to study the pathogenesis of IUAs and to find effective treatment. We analyzed the differences of vaginal microbiological structure between patients with IUA and healthy women. Our study found that vaginal microbial imbalance can cause endometrial inflammation and inflammation factors or related cytokines released in great quantities. Proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 were massively increased in IUA patients and played a role in promoting fibrosis, which in turn caused fibrinogen accumulation, extracellular matrix deposition, and eventually induced IUAs. A comprehensive understanding of microorganisms and immune function will allow us to better clarify the role of microorganisms and immune function in the development of IUA. From a new perspective of vaginal dysbacteriosis mediating a Th1-Th2 imbalance, the mechanism of IUA was revealed. Moreover, it was found that fibrosis could be successfully prevented by inhibiting pathogens, inflammatory factors, and cytokines. These findings provide a new platform for the prevention and treatment of IUA targeted at microbial and cytokine intervention.",
