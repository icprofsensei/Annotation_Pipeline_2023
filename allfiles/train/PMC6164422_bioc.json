Seven healthy subjects completed the dietary intervention with two 1-week test periods with a 1-week wash-out period in cross-over design (UMIN registration UMIN000023142). White bread or white rice and 21 frozen prepared side dishes were consumed during the test periods. At baseline and at the end of each period, fasting blood samples, breath samples, and fecal samples were collected. For fecal samples, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota. After the bread period, the abundance of fecal Bifidobacterium genus (19.2 \u00b1 14.5 vs. 6.2 \u00b1 6.6 (%), p = 0.03), fasting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (13.6 \u00b1 2.0 vs. 10.5 \u00b1 2.9 (pg/mL), p = 0.03), and breath hydrogen (23.4 \u00b1 9.9 vs. 8.2 \u00b1 5.5 (ppm), p = 0.02) were significantly higher than those of after the rice period. Plasma SCFAs also tended to be higher after the bread period. White bread contains more dietary fiber than refined short grain rice. These findings suggest that indigestible carbohydrate intake from short grain rice as a staple food may be smaller than that of white bread.",

                    "text": "In the current study, we examined the influence of staple foods on gut microbiota against the background in which subjects consumed fixed sets of side dishes. Many previous studies on the effect of dietary intervention on gut microbiota were conducted by using foods with a large difference in dietary fiber content [8,10,11,12,20,21] or by adding specific non-digestible carbohydrates to daily meals [24,25,26,27]. The strength of the current study is that the test meals used were very similar to everyday meals of Japanese people; we used two major staple foods, white rice and white bread together with ordinary kinds of side dishes. After the bread period, abundance of fecal Bifidobacterium, fasting plasma GLP-1 level, and breath hydrogen were significantly higher than those of after the rice period.Dietary fiber and resistant starch are prebiotics, which act as a fermentation substrate within the colon and stimulate preferential growth and activity of specific microbial species (e.g., Bifidobacterium) and confer health benefits on the host [27,28]. The major products of fermentable carbohydrate in gut microbiota are SCFAs (e.g., acetate, propionate, butyrate) and gases (e.g., hydrogen and carbon dioxide) [29]. In this study, 7-days intake of bread containing a higher amount of dietary fiber than rice induced higher abundance of Bifidobacterium and higher excretion of hydrogen. At species level, the abundance of Blautia faecis which belongs to the genus Blautia was significantly higher after the rice period compared with that after the bread period. A previous study reported that the composition of the Japanese gut microbiome showed more abundance in the genus Bifidobacterium and Blautia compared with those of Western and other Asian people [30]. However, to our knowledge, there is no report that dietary intervention affects the abundance of Blautia faecis. ",

GPR41 are activated by propionate and butyrate and GPR43 are activated by acetate and propionate [32,34,35]. In our study, plasma propionate and butyrate levels after the bread period tended to be higher than those after the rice period. These facts support the higher fasting GLP-1 observed after the bread period.",

In Japan, the japonica rice cultivars (short grain rice), which contain lesser resistant starch than long grain rice cultivars, are popular [37,38].
