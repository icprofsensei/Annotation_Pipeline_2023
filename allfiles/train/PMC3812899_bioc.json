Moreover, no integrated metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic or metametabolomic surveys on AB-treated human microbiota have been performed. Specifically, in the gut ecosystem, few studies have focused on metatranscriptomics. Turnbaugh et al\n18 focused on gene expression analysis in faecal samples from a monozygotic twin pair, whereas Booijnk et al\n19 and Gosalbes et al\n20 studied the faecal metatranscriptomes of healthy volunteers using cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism and pyrosequencing, respectively. Proteomic platforms have also been used to separate and identify thousands of proteins in faecal samples from healthy individuals,21\u201324 but these analyses have not uncovered the effect of ABs on the stability or expression of core proteins or their functions. Finally, metabolic changes in mouse\u2014but not human\u2014gut microbiota following treatment with the broad-spectrum AB enrofloxacin were recently evaluated using nuclear magnetic resonance based metabolomics.25 However, this study yielded limited information because the faecal samples were only analysed for changes in eight metabolites, including increased levels of amino acids and urea caused by the loss of microbial proteases and ureases, and reduced levels of acetate, butyrate and propionate generated by lactate-using bacteria.",

The patient (a 68-year-old man) was admitted to the Department for Internal Medicine at the University Hospital Kiel (Germany) due to an infected cardiac pacemaker. A clinical examination identified inflamed skin and subcutaneous tissue around the pacemaker, and laboratory findings revealed an elevated C-reactive protein level (CRP 19.7\u2005mg/litre; normal value <8\u2005mg/litre) and a full blood count within normal ranges. The patient did not present any intestinal disorders. The pacemaker had been placed to treat the patient's sick sinus syndrome, first diagnosed in 1994. His cardiovascular risk factors were arterial hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient was regularly taking amlodipine, ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide and glimepiride on a daily basis and Marcumar according to his international normalised ratio values. AB therapy was initiated with a combined intravenous therapy of ampicillin/sulbactam and cefazolin on the day of admission as a single dose and continued with intravenous cefazolin alone for the next 14\u2005days. The patient's CRP level returned to normal within 1\u2005week after the beginning of AB therapy. Faecal samples were collected on the day of admission, prior to AB treatment (day 0, FS-0), on days 3, 6, 11 and 14 of AB treatment (FS-3, FS-6, FS-11 and FS-14, respectively) and 40\u2005days after AB therapy (FS-40). Fresh faeces were collected, frozen immediately and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Informed consent was obtained from the patient, and the study was approved by the Ethical Board of the Medical Faculty of the Christian-Albrecht-University, Kiel, Germany. The patient provided written informed consent. Full descriptions of the materials and methods used for the following are available in the Materials and Methods in the online supplement: nucleic acid and RNA extraction; 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA sequencing; metagenome sequencing; mRNA purification, amplification and sequencing; metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis; protein extraction, separation and identification and data processing; and metabolite extraction, separation and identification and data processing.

In the first days of treatment, the majority of the total microbiota comprised species from the phylum Firmicutes, with the exception of FS-11 (11 days after AB treatment), which exhibited a remarkable shift towards Bacteroidetes (Parabacteroides and Bacteroides genera) and a significant increase in Betaproteobacteria (figure 1 and figure 1 in online supplement). The Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families constituted the most abundant taxa on days 3 and 6 of AB treatment. Meanwhile, the Firmicutes represented the most abundant active phylum in most samples. However, the shift towards the Bacteroidetes was even more distinct and occurred later, at the 14th day (FS-14) of AB treatment, among the active bacteria, with the Parabacteroides genus (74%) being the predominant taxa.",

However, certain taxa, such as Actinobacteria (Slackia and Bifidobacterium genera), Betaproteobacteria (Gemmiger genus), Streptococcaceae (Streptococcus genus), Lachnospiraceae (Roseburia genus), Porphyromonadaceae (Barnesiella genus) and Clostridiales (Eubacterium and Subdoligranulum genera) were lost. The heat map and clustering analysis (see figure 1 in online supplement) results support the restoration of the microbiota because untreated samples clustered together regardless of whether we considered the total bacterial composition or the active bacterial composition. The results of a correspondence analysis of the relative abundance of each taxon in the total and active microbiota fractions are shown in figure 2 in the online supplement. Approximately 55.90% of the total variation can be bundled in two axes (CA1 and CA2), each of which contributed a similar degree of variation. CA1, bundling 23.81% of the variation, indicates how divergent a given sample is from the average abundance of taxa, whereas CA2, bundling 22.09% of the variation, clearly differentiates the composition of the total (DNA) and active (RNA) microbiota. Moreover, the active microbiota clearly behaved in a more homogeneous manner than the total microbiota, and samples FS-40 and FS-11 exhibited the most divergent microbiota among the samples analysed.",

Together, the two axes projected 69% of the total variance in the data. Fourteen operational taxonomic units (OTUs) responsible for the differences between the samples were identified by the lengths of their vectors in the PLS-DA (see figure 4 in online supplement). Before and after AB treatment, OTUs with homology to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia wexlerae, belonging to the phylum of Firmicutes, were highly abundant. However, Enterococcus durans, an abundant OTU in FS-3, FS-6 and FS-11, was absent in the FS-0 and FS-40 samples. Furthermore, we observed an increase in OTUs with homology to different species of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides such as B fragilis, P merdae, B dorei, P distasonis, B uniformis and B ovatus in the FS-11 and FS-14 samples. Thus, during AB therapy, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes increased, whereas OTUs with homology to Firmicutes regained their dominance after cessation of the AB.",

The genes included in clusters 0 and 1 exhibited increased expression only on the 3rd day following AB treatment and returned to basal levels at later stages of the treatment. These genes were functionally categorised to have roles in protein transport and binding (potassium uptake protein, TonB-dependent receptor, nitrile hydratase propeptide microcin bacteriocin system ATP-binding cassette transporter, peptidase/ATP-binding protein), toxin production and resistance (resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily and hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux-1 transporters), detoxification (heavy metal efflux and CzcA permeases), mobile and extrachromosomal elements (phage lambda tail tape measure protein) and protein fate determination (TolC type I secretion outer membrane protein). Genes belonging to clusters 2, 3 and 4 (DNA metabolism/DNA replication, recombination and repair, protein fate/protein and peptide secretion and trafficking and protein synthesis/tRNA and rRNA base modification) presented a more uniform profile before, during and after AB treatment. The genes in cluster 5 remained constant but exhibited a relatively higher expression level on the 14th day following the beginning of AB treatment, returning to the basal level after the discontinuation of AB treatment; these genes functioned in molecule renewal and transport (proteins, peptides, amino acids, polysaccharides, purines, purine ribonucleotides, pyrimidines and glycopeptides (bio)synthesis, secretion, trafficking, transport, binding and/or degradation) and DNA metabolism/DNA replication, recombination, and repair and cellular processes related to sporulation and germination.",

In the FS-40 sample, Burkholderiaceae (46%) (phylum Proteobacteria) were the most abundant, despite the low abundance of 16S rRNA from these organisms (figure 1). However, in the other samples (FS-0, FS-3, FS-11 and FS-14), the Bacteroidaceae family was the major taxon responsible for the observed gene expression. This family contains genera, such as Parabacteroides and Bacteroides, that are resistant to ampicillin and cephalosporins, as previously reported.32 These results account for the three clusters shown in figure 2B.",

According to the probability of match with the isotopic pattern shown in table 2 in the online supplement, 49 distinct common features were tentatively identified. Based on their abundance level, five groups of molecules were established (see figure 12 in online supplement). Most long-chain fatty acids and peptides exhibited increased abundance on the 6th day (sample FS-6) as well as after the discontinuation of AB treatment (FS-40); they included two masses corresponding to putative sphingolipid-related compounds, such as C17 sphinganine and dihydroceramide C2, six unsaturated fatty acyls, two fatty acid amides, a lysophosphatidic acid and a tri-peptide formed by Asp/Ile/Phe, Asp/Leu/Phe or Phe/Glu/Val. Most of the putative glycerol(lyso)phospholipids (including five putative glycerophospholipids and fatty acid carnitines) exhibited increased abundance on the 11th and 14th days, but significantly decreased (from 4 to 20\u2005000 fold) after the discontinuation of AB treatment. Finally, nine putative human-associated derivatives of cholesterol, the cholesterol-precursor vitamin D, bile acids, prostaglandins and sterol lipids appeared only after AB treatment (FS-40), with production levels of up to six orders of magnitude higher than that of samples before and during AB therapy.",

Samples FS-11 and FS-40 exhibited clearly different protein expression profiles based on the correspondence (figure 6A) and clustering (figure 6B) analysis of differentially expressed proteins (figure 6A), which was corroborated by the corresponding functional analysis (see figure 11 in online supplement). These results suggest the restoration of the microbiota because untreated samples (FS-0 and FS-40) clustered together, indicating that the initial profile was recovered at the end of the treatment despite the drastic shift that occurred on the 11th day (see table 1 in online supplement), consistent with the analysis of the total and active bacterial compositions (figure 1).",

AB-treated samples were also characterised by a striking depletion of the translation elongation factors required for protein synthesis, such as GTPases, which facilitate the release of nascent polypeptide chains; this depletion was accentuated after treatment cessation (figure 7B). By contrast, samples taken during AB treatment were characterised by an enrichment of antimicrobial peptide transporters and multidrug efflux pumps that peaked on the 3rd day of AB treatment (figure 7D) and were absent in untreated samples (FS-0 and FS-40). Additional key proteins, such as aerobic CobN cobaltochelatases (COG1429) essential for the biosynthesis of vitamin B12, were also found to be depleted (see table 3 in the online supplement) in samples FS-3, FS-11 and FS-14 compared with untreated samples.",

Thus, the aims of this study were as follows: to provide a proof of concept for an integrated workflow to assess the nature of such changes in the intestines of patients undergoing AB treatment at the structural and functional levels; and to evaluate whether there is a relationship between these types of changes. For instance, changes in the total composition at a given time point may also be associated with changes in the AB-resistant bacteria, although not necessarily at the same moment or during the same interval. Two major active factors that modulate changes in the microbiota should be considered. First, it is important to understand how AB treatment determines the emergence of bacterial species that are resistant to \u03b2-lactams (such as ampicillin and cephalosporins) and how the microbiota recovers once ABs have been removed. Second, the speed at which such changes are observed according to the different levels under consideration should be carefully evaluated.",

Further, oscillatory population dynamics were observed (at both the DNA and RNA levels). An early reduction in Gram-negative bacteria at day 6 and an overall collapse in diversity was followed by possible colonisation of the upper gut by naturally resistant Bacteroidetes by day 11, a consequent increase in the colonisation of the lower gut with dominance at 11\u201314 days and eventual re-growth of the Gram-positive bacteria at day 14. Various studies based on 16S rDNA analysis revealed important variability in the recovery of the baseline bacterial composition after AB therapy depending on the individual and the AB used (type and dose).11\n14\n15 The large fluctuations in the relative abundances of the various bacterial taxa for the total and active microbiota throughout the follow-up study were most likely associated with an additive effect of ampicillin/sulbactam and the first-generation cephalosporin cefazolin as well as the widespread development of \u03b2-lactamases (for details, see the Discussion in the online supplement).13\n",

In our study, we observed a drastic shift 6\u2005days after the onset of AB treatment, at which time the predominantly active taxa were mainly members of the Streptococcaceae, Clostridiaceae and Bacteroidaceae, and at 40\u2005days after the end of AB treatment, when the most abundant active bacteria were members of the Burkholderiaceae (Proteobacteria phylum). Thus, these bacteria may have contributed to the distinct functional profiles and metabolic statuses of colonic bacteria during the follow-up therapy.",

                    "text": "A notable finding in this study was that protein expression appeared to decrease as a consequence of AB treatment; furthermore, the production of proteins needed for glycolysis, pyruvate decarboxylation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutamate metabolism, iron uptake, GTP hydrolysis and translation termination were enhanced at the initial stages of AB treatment (day 6), most likely to cope with an intermittent nutrient supply and the stress caused by the ABs, but decreased at later stages and after treatment cessation. Together, these results suggest for first time that AB treatment may \u2018presumptively\u2019 negatively affect the overall metabolic status of the colonic space (for an example, see the Discussion in the online supplement), although further studies may be required to further confirm this hypothesis. Additionally, the expression levels of all the genes belonging to the \u2018mobile and extrachromosomal element functions\u2019 category were decreased during treatment, and all of them were associated with clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). These genes encode a system that functions as a type of bacterial adaptive \u2018immune\u2019 response.34 Specifically, the genes that belong to the CRISPR/Cas system are involved in protecting cells from invasion by foreign DNA (viruses and plasmids) through an RNA-interference-like process.35 Thus, the decreases in the expression of these genes may render the bacteria more susceptible to the acquisition of foreign DNA. This could provide an advantage in an AB-containing environment because it increases the likelihood of obtaining resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer.",

In essence, this finding suggests that AB treatment altered the continual interplay between the liver/pancreas and bacterial enzymes operating in the colonic space and that AB therapy may have a positive long-term effect in human biology. This result is consistent with the finding that the biological production of host-beneficial molecules such as vitamin B12 and the uptake of key metals such as Co2+ by colonic bacteria were affected by AB therapy because the expression of genes and proteins associated with those functions was restored after treatment cessation. This is particularly important because it has been demonstrated that the microbiota from the distal guts of different individuals exhibit partial functional redundancy in addition to clear differences in community structure in the absence of ABs.36 By contrast, although further experimental evidence is required, our results suggest that the presence of ABs per se may have additional \u2018presumptive\u2019 collapse effects in key metabolic pathways independent of the community structure and that functional replacement events may be affected under AB stress.",

A \u2018presumptive\u2019 model related to the follow-up effects of ABs on bacterial and metabolic composition is summarised in figure 8. These data may help to identify specific strains of gut microbiota with potential benefits in human health or to design specific therapies to decrease intestinal inflammation or normalise dysfunctions of the gut mucosa; for example, minor bacterial taxa such as Proteobacteria have been shown to play a significant, active role in overall gut metabolism and host interaction despite their low number. Further studies investigating different ABs and (un)related individuals are required to better ascertain the link between bacterial producers and the presence of particular proteins and molecules, and the metabolic consequences of AB treatment; this may serve as a promising focus for therapeutic interventions or the treatment of pathogenic infections and diseases.",
