Culture based diagnostics have been the standard of care for identifying pathogens, but are often limited in scope [2,3]. The lung microbiome in CF is of interest as there has been an association between a loss of bacterial diversity and progression of lung disease [4]. While it is not completely understood, it appears that total antibiotic use is one of the strongest predictors of loss of diversity [5]. Before information from the lung microbiome can be utilized as a biomarker of disease progression and may assist clinicians in antibiotic selection, determining the best available sequencing platform is necessary.",

The PacBio produces much longer reads which can readily cover the full length of the 16S rRNA gene (~1450 bp), but has a lower accuracy with random base call ambiguity and an observed error rate of 1.8% [11]. To overcome this limitation, the use of circular consensus sequencing allows for sequencing by synthesis to occur on circularized amplicons, providing high single-molecule coverage [12]. Recent comparisons of PacBio and MiSeq at 16S metataxonomics [13] demonstrated a low percentage of non-matching reads if a high number of circular consensus cycles on the PacBio were performed and a similar correlation of abundances of bacteria in even and uneven microbial mock communities [8]. However, other studies have suggested that the long reads attainable with PacBio provide higher quality operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in a sample [14].",

Default settings were used to minimize sequencing errors as described in Schloss et al. [17] for the MiSeq reads and Schloss et al. [11] for the PacBio reads. Clean sequences were aligned to the SILVA_v123 bacterial reference alignment at http://www.mothur.org. Chimeras were removed using uchime [18] and non-chimeric sequences were classified using the na\u00efve Bayesian classifier of Wang et al. [19]. Sequences were clustered into OTUs at the 0.03 threshold (species level). OTU sequence representatives and taxonomy were imported (BIOM format) into QIIME [20] for subsequent analyses. The mothur OTU table was filtered to a minimum of 2 observations (sequences) per OTU. Samples were subsampled (rarefaction analysis) to the smallest sample size (3590 sequences) to remove the effect of sample size bias on community composition. Taxonomic alpha-diversity was estimated as the number of observed OTUs and by the Chao1, Fisher and Shannon indices, and estimates were compared between gene regions (16S_v4 versus full 16S) using non-parametric versions of the t-test. We used Procrustes analysis to determine whether we would derive the same beta-diversity conclusions, regardless of which gene region was used to compare the samples [21]. We then compared ordinations generated by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of Bray-Curtis and weighted Unifrac distances between 16S_V4 and full 16S groups [21]. Significance was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations).",

Specifically, the MiSeq analyses of the V3/V4 region produced paired reads with low Phred Quality Scores (<10) in the middle section (120 bp). As such, the bioinformatic analysis in mothur was more precise with increased overlap of the paired sequences using V4 alone. Additionally, because of the low Phred Quality Scores in the middle section, the V3/V4 sequence data could not be properly analyzed using mothur as it was unable to create appropriate contigs. BaseSpace, which uses a different algorithm, was still effective in performing the bioinformatic analysis of both regions, and the V3/V4 reads were analyzed and compared to V4 reads.",

Since sample collection and handling have been shown to influence sequencing results [7,23,24], the extracted DNA used for sequencing was taken from the same aliquot to eliminate any potential upstream variations. Likewise, the same computational pipeline and 16S reference database to analyze sequencing results were used to limit any variations in analysis. As such, the only source of variability was limited to the sequencing platform used.",

Prior studies have suggested that V4 provides the closest analogue to sequencing the full 16S rRNA gene [8, 25]. However, the sequencing information obtained from the V4 region alone was not able to assign a genus-level taxonomic rank to ~50% of the observed OTUs. The PacBio sequence data, however, was able to assign almost all the reads to a microbial genus. PacBio longer sequences accounted for at least 16 passes of the full 16S rRNA gene. Given the randomness of sequencing errors in the PacBio platform, that level of coverage and read length would have greatly reduced total error rate and increase accuracy of OTU assignment, a definite advantage. However, the total sequencing yield depth of sequencing of the PacBio remains much lower than that of the MiSeq and less abundant OTUs may have been missed by the former, which is an advantage of MiSeq. Lastly, the decreased cost to sequence the 16S rRNA gene using MiSeq compared to PacBio is also an advantage of MiSeq.",

When comparing the taxonomic profiles obtained by both techniques, there were key OTUs assigned to genera using the PacBio platform that were not able to be assigned using the MiSeq platform. One example was the difference in identifying Escherichia or Shigella in samples S6d, S12e, S12f, and S12g using PacBio while the OTU remained classified as Enterobacteriacae unclassified genus when using MiSeq. In the CF human population, the inability for the MiSeq to differentiate Burkholderia from other Pseudomonal taxa is very concerning, as this is a rare but important pathogen associated with severe clinical disease [6,26]. This limitation is likely due to our choosing only to sequence V4, and may be overcome with either broader 16S rRNA sequencing or shotgun sequencing. Unfortunately, the sample S5e that identified Burkholderia as a dominant pathogen using PacBio sequences did not sequence successfully using the MiSeq V3/V4 amplicon, so additional comparisons cannot be made. There were also occurrences where the dominant genus on the two platforms did not align, despite the ability of OTUs from both data sets to be assigned to those genera. Specifically, Prevotella was assigned as the dominant genera in samples S2d and S9d when using MiSeq V4 sequencing data. Using PacBio sequencing data, they were assigned as Streptococcus and Haemophilus, respectively. This finding is unique to our study, as other studies have shown MiSeq and PacBio data to correlate well with the abundances of bacteria in synthetic communities [8]. Another interesting finding was the frequency Escherichia was identified in our patient cohort. While this is a pathogen that has been described in the CF airway, it is by no means common [3,27].",

In other studies of the CF lung microbiome using 454, the observed OTUs typically were in the range of 3\u2013114 [4,5,7], which are more similar to the observed OTUs we found using PacBio (see Table 2). However, studies comparing 454 to MiSeq, PacBio, and Ion Torrent using a synthetic community have suggested that 454 may underestimate the number of OTUs [8]. Thus, the discrepancies in alpha-diversity observed here between MiSeq and PacBio could result from OTU underestimation in the latter.",

Although in that regard, Procrustes analysis showed short connecting bars (low dissimilarity) for most sample pairs and low to moderately low values of dissimilarity (as indicated by the Procrustes statistic M2) and highly significant result (P < 0.001), which implies that we would draw the same beta diversity conclusions from either data set. It would have been also helpful to compare the sequencing results to bacterial culture results to verify whether bacteria identified by one platform but not the other were truly present. Another limitation was not determining the bacterial load within each sample, as this also could have influenced our sequencing results.",

The longer sequence reads yielded by PacBio allowed for more accurate taxa assignment of OTUs. However, the larger depth of MiSeq likely led to finding more rare OTUs. These benefits and limitations should be considered when choosing the platform best suited for metataxonomic studies. When comparing microbiome diversity in clinical samples from CF patients using 16S sequences, MiSeq and PacBio NGS platforms may generate different results in microbial community composition and structure. It may be necessary to use different platforms when trying to correctly identify dominant pathogens versus measuring alpha-diversity estimates, and it would be important to use the same platform for comparisons to minimize errors in interpretation.",
