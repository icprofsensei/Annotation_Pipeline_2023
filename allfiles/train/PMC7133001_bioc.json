Despite a long-standing misconception, urine of healthy individuals is not sterile. In the past UTI were thought to result from an invasion of pathogenic bacteria into an otherwise sterile fluid and environment. Though with the recent advances made in microbiome research, in particular with the introduction of next generation sequencing, it was discovered that dysbiosis in the urinary microbiome, such as overgrowth of a pre-existent microbe, can lead to UTI.",

From previous research we know that a broad gamut of bacterial genera represent a steadily fluctuating flora in the urinary bladder [7\u201310]. These urinary bacteria have sophisticated genomic tools for keeping growth of potential bacterial competitors in a steady state and in a dynamic balance. Alongside with competition for nutrients, their genomic equipment ensures that none of the other microbial inhabitants can overgrow. Among these genomic tools are various fast responding operons, which encode polyketide synthases, cyclic lipopeptide synthases and extra-ribosomal peptide synthases, all generating biologically highly active compounds responsible for competition interference and antagonistic interaction [11\u201314]. These produced in a balanced mode keep urinary microbiota under healthy conditions in homeostasis. Therefore it is likely, that a disturbance of the physiological quantity and diversity of microbiota results in UTI [15\u201317].",

The supernatant was subsequently analyzed by LC-MS using a ZIC-pHILIC column on an Ultimate 3000 RSLC system linked to a Thermo Fisher Scientific q-Exactive instrument (m/z detection range 60\u2013900). Compound Discoverer 3.0 software was used for identification. An internal database and mzCloud database were applied. Analysis was restricted to 288 compounds identified as follows: 52 compounds were identified by matching retention time and exact mass (5\u2009ppm tolerance) to a previously measured internal standard sample of known compounds, in case an MS2 spectrum was available this was also taken into account. Further 236 compounds were identified by matching exact mass (5\u2009ppm tolerance) and MS2 spectrum to the mzCloud database. Note that a repeated detection of a compound with highly similar exact mass but at a different retention time may reflect for instance isomers (e.g. stereo isomers or structural isomers with similar fragmentation pattern) or additional peaks usually eluting later during the elution profile of a substance. For further data analysis, all areas were log2 transformed, and an average of the two replicates was calculated for days one to five respectively (corresponding to the log2 transformation of the geometric mean). Subsequently a linear regression model based on the least squares method was calculated for each compound (with 1 to 5 as x-values), and the list of identified compounds was sorted according to decreasing parameter m. Thus, compounds at the top of the list are those for which the model indicates the most pronounced increase, whereas compounds at the bottom of the list are those for which the model indicates the most pronounced decrease. The coefficient of determination R2 was also calculated as a measure of the fit between the linear model and the measured values. Finally, the log2-transformed ratio of the geometric means on day 5 to day 1 was calculated, as a measure of changes from the first to the last day of the observation period.",

The cross-sectional study design represents a further limitation as patients were not matched on AKI stages, types of AKI, urine output on day of sample collection, and immunosuppressive regimen, which could have had an impact on the urinary microbiota of RTX patients. Measurement of overall urine output was not available in all patients. In addition, although microbiome research is booming, microbial genomic datasets are still not entirely complete, albeit nearly-complete and reproducibility strongly depends on the database utilized [8]. Furthermore potential technical limitations associated with metagenomics and amplicon sequencing remain, which have already been extensively discussed in former literature. These include sampling errors, primer or processing biases, and the use of adequate analytical algorithms. Moreover identification of additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects remains challenging [32\u201335].",

We were able to detect a rich and diverse urinary microbiome in all included patients. Different bacterial genera could be detected in copious numbers in either RTX or nRTX only. The overall bacterial diversity was equal in nRTX and RTX AKI patients. Finally our single patient data suggest that the intraindividual urinary microbiome might undergo daily changes during the period of kidney function regain.",

Therefore we decided to analyze urinary bacteria on a genus level rather than on a family or phylum level, which is commonly done in microbiome research as analyses on a higher taxonomic level yield the advantage of increasing the chances for statistically significant results. However, reasons for the decision to analyze our data on a genus-level were based on clinical aspects, as hierarchal higher taxonomic levels aggregate a great number of bacteria but state little about the actual microbial flora. As a matter of fact, it can be argued that even with an analysis on a genus-level an uncertainty about the underlying bacteria remains. As an example, the genus Clostridium contains about 100 species, which exhibit different growth characteristics and are either harmless to humans or responsible for various diseases [39]. For instance, Clostridium botulinum produces the lethal botulinum toxin, which causes botulism [40]. Other species from the genus Clostridium include Clostridium tetani, the causative agent of tetanus, Clostridium perfringens, which causes gas gangrene, Clostridium difficile, the cause of diarrhea [41\u201343]. Unfortunately we could not analyze bacteria on a species-level as the V3 and V4 regions which are detected with 16S rRNA sequencing are highly preserved.",

This occurs as renal transplants mostly possess a shortened ureter, which leads into a shrunken urinary bladder, which has an effect on urine outflow when compared to nRTX patients [45\u201348]. (iii) The urinary metabolome differs in RTX and nRTX patients and it is likely that the urinary metabolite profile has a growth enhancing or growth inhibitory effect on certain bacterial genera [49].

This is consistent with our metabolome analysis of this patient. Another possible explanation for these intraindividual alterations is competitive growth of the bacteria themselves. When one genus is absent, or only present in small numbers, another genus is able to grow out and fill the niche. This could be facilitated by bioactive compounds in urine produced as a bacterial machinery of defense against other bacteria. As mentioned above, such antimicrobial products include polyketide synthases, cyclic lipopeptidases and extra-ribosomal peptide synthases [11\u201313]. Whether the production of antimicrobial products varies during AKI has not been investigated so far and needs to be evaluated in future studies.",
