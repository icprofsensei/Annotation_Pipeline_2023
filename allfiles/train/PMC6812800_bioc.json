For library preparation, 7 \u03bcl of nucleic acids were used, using the NEBNext\u00ae Ultra\u2122 Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina\u00ae, with several in-house adaptations to the manufacturers protocol in order to enable simultaneous detection of both DNA and RNA. The following steps were omitted: poly A mRNA capture isolation, rRNA depletion and DNase treatment step. This resulted in a single tube per sample throughout library preparation containing both DNA and RNA. Metagenomic sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and approximately 10 million 150 bp paired-end reads per sample were obtained.",

Interestingly, subtyping data was readily available by mNGS, accentuating the high resolution of mNGS, with rhinovirus (RV) species A and C being most frequent, followed by RV-B. RV-C was first identified in 2006 and associated with high symptom burdens in children and asthmatics [28, 29]. Recently, an asthma-related cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) gene variant [30] was associated with greater RV-C receptor display on pulmonary cell surfaces of children and adults, and associated with higher susceptibility to severe virus-triggered asthma episodes [31, 32]. In line, Romero-Espinoza et al detected predominantly RV-C in children with acute asthma exacerbations by mNGS [33]. The significance of RV-C infection in the adult population is less well studied. Although RV-C has been previously associated with exacerbations of COPD [34, 35], to our knowledge, to date, CDHR3 polymorphisms have not yet found to be associated with COPD.",

Lower bacteriophage abundance may be the result of viral expansion. Hypothetically, a healthy virome size and diversity fits a certain size and diversity of bacteriophages, while during viral infection, pathogens predominate the virome. Alternatively, others have hypothesized that viral and microbial diversity may play a role in infection susceptibility and the development of acute and chronic respiratory diseases [33]. Our results indicate that virome dysbiosis may be accompanied by bacteriome dysbiosis, though no significant differences were detected in line with other reports [40, 41]. However, these studies don\u2019t compare between COPD exacerbation with and without viral infections. Others have found a higher phage abundance in a patient with severe COPD when compared with one patients with moderate COPD and healthy controls, DNA sequencing, in line with the hypothesis of a state of dysbiosis that increases with disease progression [27]. In COPD patients, viral infections have been suggested to trigger bacterial overgrowth and infections [42, 43], demonstrating the significance of viral-bacterial interactions. Moreover, hypothetically, bacteriophages play a role in the horizontal gene transfer of bacterial virulence factors.",
