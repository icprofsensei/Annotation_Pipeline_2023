While multiple studies have aimed to understand its biology, most of them did not address it within the context of the human gut microbiota diversity and structure. Historically, Blastocystis has been categorised as an intestinal parasite.6\u20138 Its detection in faecal samples of asymptomatic individuals has urged researchers to consider a commensal relationship between Blastocystis and its human host,5 9 10 challenging the assumption of a parasitic strategy previously assigned to the entire genus.7 8 Similar to Escherichia coli, Blastocystis commensalism or pathogenicity is highly dependent on the organism\u2019s pan-genome (ie, coding for virulence factors and toxins). Therefore, only high-resolution-level analyses (at the strain/subtype level) can elucidate the pathogenic potential of Blastocystis subtypes or intra-subtypes.

Primers alignment against the most prevalent Blastocystis subtypes suggests these primers are suitable for amplification and subtyping of this genus in humans (online supplementary figure S8). Blastocystis subtypes could be identified based on the sequence of their 18S rRNA V4 region alone.

As a positive control, DNA from a previously characterised human stool sample was added; blanks were used as negative controls to monitor potential reagent and laboratory contamination. Amplicon concentration and fragment size distribution were analysed using a Fragment Analyser (Advanced Analytical Technologies) to produce equimolar pools. QIAquick PCR Purification Kit was used to purify and concentrate the pooled libraries and a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) was used to estimate the concentration and size distribution of the final pool. Size selection, before Illumina sequencing, was performed using Agencourt AMPure to remove fragments below 200 bases. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 (HiSeq-Rapid SBS kit V2 (500 cycles, 2\u00d7250\u2009bp)) at the VIB Nucleomics core laboratory (Leuven, Belgium). Sequencing depth ranged from 10\u2009493 to 109\u2009649 observations per sample, producing a total of 193 genera, including bacteria, archaea and SCE reads (online supplementary table S1).",

Among the 69 microbiota covariates included in our analysis, IBS status (as noted by the participants\u2019 general practitioners during anamnesis) was previously linked to the presence of Blastocystis in stool samples.40 41 Here, performing the largest screening to date in a single Western cohort, we did not detect an association between Blastocystis prevalence and IBS status (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p\u00a0value=0.6652).

We found Blastocystis presence to be associated with higher observed richness and Shannon diversity (Wilcoxon test, p\u00a0value<2e-16 for both indices). Beyond this association, among Blastocystis carriers, the highest diversity was observed in ST2 and ST4 samples compared with ST3 (Wilcoxon test, FDR<0.05; figure 2B). Focusing on community\u00a0types, Blastocystis prevalence was found to be unevenly distributed over DMM-characterised enterotypes (figure 2C), with the Bacteroides 1 and 2 clusters comprising significantly less carriers compared with Ruminococcaceae and Prevotella (Pearson\u2019s \u03c72, p\u00a0value<2.2e-16). However, in spite of the entero-subtype associations observed, subtype relative distributions among carriers were not significantly different in most pairwise comparisons.

We observed ST3 and ST4 Blastocystis to show opposite (negative and positive, respectively) correlations to Akkermansia abundances (figure 3A, B). In addition, this inverse association of ST3 and ST4 with Akkermansia was confirmed by reconstructing an ensemble co-occurrence network combining Spearman correlation and Kullback-Leibler similarity37 (online supplementary table S10). Of note, throughout all subtype-level analyses, ST4 was also shown to be positively associated with Methanobrevibacter relative abundances (figure 3A; online supplementary figure S6 D; online supplementary table S10). However, while increased relative abundances of both Akkermansia and Methanobrevibacter have been shown to be linked to hard stools,45 we did not detect a significant correlation between ST4 and stool consistency, potentially due to sample size and stool score distribution (online supplementary figure S7).",

In order to quantify the strength of the interactions between Blastocystis presence and microbiota composition, we computed the effect size of Blastocystis as a microbiota composition covariate in the FGFP population cohort. To do so, we applied a strategy previously described.17 To the list of 69 microbiota covariates, we added 7 Blastocystis-associated variables: genus carrier status, genus relative abundance and subtype carrier status, and subtype abundances (per subtype) (online supplementary table S11). Next, we performed a dbRDA on bacteria and archaea genus-level Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. In the subset of 616 FGFP samples analysed, subtype carrier status displayed a non-redundant effect size of 3.5%, outclassing stool consistency as top covariate of microbiota variation. Blastocystis-relative abundance, or proportion of Blastocystis sequences over bacteria, archaea and SCE sequences, was also found to contribute significantly to bacterial and archaeal microbiota variation with an additional contribution of 2.2% (figure 4; online supplementary table S11). These observations hint towards Blastocystis playing a putative key role in shaping the large\u00a0intestinal ecosystem.",

This observation questions the historical classification of this SCE as a pathogen6\u20138 since intestinal discomfort was not associated with presence of Blastocystis (online supplementary table S6). Moreover, the association between Blastocystis and gut health was additionally backed up by its lowered prevalence (4%) in an IBD cohort, in line with a previous report of a Danish/Spanish active ulcerative colitis cohort.15 Our findings suggest that the current ambiguity regarding the role of Blastocystis in human health could be related to subtype13 or even intra-subtype diversity within this prevalent genus.12\n",

Among them, ST4 was the most prevalent, in accordance with both our reanalyses of the TwinsUK and AGP cohorts, as well as with previous studies both in clinical32 46 47 and non-clinical settings.13 Our results also confirm previous reports of Blastocystis being associated with higher microbiota richness and diversity.15 16 Although questioned,45 48 microbiota richness is generally considered an indicator of ecosystem stability49 and human health.50 Regarding community types, we observed reduced prevalence of Blastocystis in both Bacteroides enterotypes, consistent with previous reports.51 The Bacteroides community type has been linked to obesity, low-grade inflammation52 and reduced microbiota resilience.49 The Bacteroides2 enterotype has been shown to present reduced microbial cell counts and to be more prevalent among patients with Crohn\u2019s disease.53 While the high richness and enterotype distribution observed in Blastocystis carriers indicate that it is a common member of a stable, resilient and health-associated microbiota, a subtype-level analysis revealed important differences within the genus. The most striking disparity is in the inverse associations found between subtypes ST3, ST4 and Akkermansia-relative abundance. Akkermansia is generally considered a health-promoting GI isolate. In murine models, administration of Akkermansia muciniphila has been shown to reduce weight gain and suppress development of low-grade inflammation.54 Studies regarding the effect of Akkermansia administration on metabolic syndrome occurring in obese human hosts are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02637115). The negative correlation between ST3 and Akkermansia could potentially indicate an association of this Blastocystis subtype with a less healthy host phenotype. Of note, ST3 was previously identified as more prevalent among IBS patients40, a finding that we were, however, unable to replicate in the FGFP cohort.",

Given the co-occurrence of Akkermansia and ST4, strict application of the current consensus protocol would result in discarding those faecal samples that might prove to be most valuable when, for example, applying FMT as treatment of metabolic syndrome.44 Thus, when selecting optimal donors, at least in the Flemish population, samples should be screened for bacterial and archaea diversity, rather than direct exclusion of Blastocystis carriers, which, as demonstrated here, should not be considered a marker of unhealthy gut microbiota.",

Out of 69 established microbiota covariates, only age was associated with Blastocystis carrier status\u2014with carriers of the most prevalent ST4 subtype being older than non-carriers. All four Blastocystis subtypes commonly present in FGFP samples were found to be less prevalent in Bacteroides enterotyped microbiota. However, the inverse correlations of ST3 and direct correlation of ST4 with Akkermansia suggest differential associations of subtypes with host health. Overall, given the significant association of subtype presence and abundance of microbiota variation, we recommend further characterisation of the link among Blastocystis and both microbiota community structure and host health at the subtype resolution, with special consideration of current FMT consensus protocols that might need to be adjusted accordingly.",
