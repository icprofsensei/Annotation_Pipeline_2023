Alterations in community representation introduced by variations in starting DNA concentrations have not been systematically investigated in stool samples. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of the genomic DNA (gDNA) concentration in the resulting 16S rRNA gene library composition and compare its effect to other sample processing variables in homogenized human fecal material. Compared to a gDNA input of 1\u00a0ng/\u03bcl, inputs of \u22641.6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl resulted in a marked decrease in the concentration of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon (P < 0.001). Low gDNA concentrations (\u22641.6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) were also associated with a decrease (P < 0.001) in the number of operational taxonomic units and significant divergence in \u03b2-diversity profiles (unweighted UniFrac distance, P < 0.001), as characterized by an overestimation of Proteobacteria and underestimation of Firmicutes. Even a gDNA concentration of 4 \u00d7 10\u22122\u00a0ng/\u03bcl showed a significant impact on the \u03b2-diversity profile (unweighted UniFrac distance, P = 0.03). Overall, the gDNA concentration explained 22.4% to 38.1% of the microbiota variation based on various \u03b2-diversity measures (P < 0.001). By comparison, the DNA extraction methods and PCR volumes tested did not significantly affect the microbial composition profile, and the PCR cycling method explained less than 3.7% of the microbiota variation (weighted UniFrac distance, P = 0.03). The 16S rRNA gene yield and the microbial community representation of human homogenized stool samples are significantly altered by gDNA template concentrations of \u22641.6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl. In addition, data from studies with a gDNA input of \u22644 \u00d7 10\u22122\u00a0ng/\u03bcl should be interpreted with caution.",

The impact of the template genomic DNA (gDNA) concentration in the community representation has been studied in sediment samples, where Wu et al.

Regardless, the initial gDNA concentrations, which often are not reported in publications, can potentially introduce relevant bias in study findings. In addition, dilution of stool gDNA templates has become a commonplace method to achieve optimal PCR efficiency and to dilute reaction inhibitors and host tissue DNA. However, the effect of the starting gDNA concentration in stool samples has not been studied. Similarly to the studies that established gDNA thresholds for accurate community representation in sediment and saliva samples, we sought to determine the level of input gDNA concentrations at which the microbial community becomes misrepresented in stool samples. We also studied the impact of different extraction methods and PCR conditions on the resulting microbial community profile.",

Analysis of correlations between the 2 major predictors of the microbial profile (gDNA and 16S rRNA gene concentration) showed a high correlation (Spearman r = 0.83) (Fig.\u00a01), suggesting that the effect of dilution on the microbial profile is likely mediated by the 16S rRNA gene yield.",

The \u03b1-diversity, which was investigated by determining the number of observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (measure of sample richness) and the Shannon diversity index values (measure of sample richness and evenness), showed that low gDNA input was associated with lower overall diversity (Fig.\u00a02). In particular, compared with a gDNA input of 1\u00a0ng/\u03bcl, a gDNA input of 8 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl or lower was associated with a significant decrease in species richness (P < 0.001), whereas a gDNA input of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl or lower was associated with decreased overall diversity, as measured by the Shannon index (P < 0.001) (Table\u00a02). Consistent with the \u03b1-diversity, the \u03b2-diversity analyses (Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac distances) showed microbiota dissimilarity for different levels of gDNA input. Although principal-coordinate analyses based on all three \u03b2-diversity measures showed that a decrease in gDNA input was associated with a clear change in the representation of the microbiota (Fig.\u00a03), the fact that the separation was more evident in the unweighted UniFrac analysis indicates that the major difference in microbiota occurs in the presence of and with an abundance of rare species (13) (Table\u00a03). On the basis of the unweighted UniFrac distance data, a gDNA input of 4 \u00d7 10\u22122\u00a0ng/\u03bcl or lower resulted in a significant difference in the \u03b2-diversity profile compared with an input of 1\u00a0ng/\u03bcl.

In particular, using 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl of gDNA input as a cutoff, the analysis identified 55 differentially abundant genera (false-discovery-rate [q] value, <0.01) (Fig.\u00a04a). The magnitude of difference for each of the taxa that were differentially abundant between samples with high gDNA input (>1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) and low gDNA input (\u22641.6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) is indicated with the \u2212log P value (Fig.\u00a04b). Interestingly, the abundances of several genera of the phylum Proteobacteria, including Pseudomonas, Delftia, Phenylobacterium, and Stenotrophomonas, were highly overestimated in samples with low gDNA input. In contrast, numerous genera from the phylum Firmicutes (Christensenella, Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, Megamonas, Eubacterium) were underrepresented with low gDNA input (Fig.\u00a04b). Moreover, the abundances of taxa of the low-gDNA-input group showed high variability (Fig.\u00a04c). These differentially abundant genera could effectively separate the 2 groups, as revealed by hierarchical clustering based on the abundance profiles (Fig.\u00a04d).",

                    "text": "In this study, we showed that template dilution and 16S rRNA gene yield had a significant effect on the representation of the microbial composition of stool samples. In particular, gDNA input at or below 8 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl was associated with significantly lower within-sample diversity (\u03b1-diversity) and divergences in between-sample diversity (\u03b2-diversity). Moreover, template dilution was associated with a change in the microbial lineage, and a gDNA input level of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl or less was associated with overrepresentation of Proteobacteria and underrepresentation of Firmicutes. In particular, of the 22 taxa enriched by dilution, 10, namely, Pseudomonas, Delftia, Stenotrophomonas, Flavobacterium, Pedobacter, Chryseobacterium, Enterobacter, Ralstonia, Pelomonas, and Streptococcus, have been previously identified as common contaminants (14). This indicates that some of the bias introduced may relate to the increase in the contamination signal caused by the use of diluted template. However, the remaining results representing taxa overrepresented by dilution effects are likely unrelated to contaminating sources. A low gDNA concentration also increases the variability of the relative abundances and hence results in a larger measurement error. The tested DNA extraction methods (manual PowerSoil [Mo Bio, Inc.] and automated Chemagic), PCR annealing conditions (70\u00b0C and 69\u00b0C touchdown), and PCR volumes (25 and 50\u00a0\u03bcl) had no significant impact on the microbiome composition.",

Of the 2 \u03b1-diversity metrics used (number of observed OTU and Shannon index), the effect of reduced gDNA concentration on the number of observed OTUs was the more prominent, suggesting that the strongest effect is on species richness (detection of rare species) rather than on species evenness. Our results suggest that use of a gDNA concentration at or below 8 \u00d7 10\u22123\u00a0ng/\u03bcl would result in a significant underestimation of the number of species present and hence would influence the conclusions of the study.",

Bias introduced at this level can artificially inflate sample divergence, leading to artificial groupings or diminishing the capacity to differentiate between truly divergent cohorts. We evaluated \u03b2-diversity with 3 metrics (Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac distances) and showed that the effect of dilution was strongest on the unweighted UniFrac data, which capture the difference in rare and less-abundant species. This finding was consistent with what we observed with \u03b1-diversity, indicating that the loss in detection of rare species affects not only the within-sample diversity metrics but also the between-sample comparisons, potentially skewing results toward erroneous conclusions. The microbiota variability caused by different gDNA concentrations is therefore a critical criterion for consideration.",

To our knowledge, this was the first study to evaluate the effect of template dilution on the representation of microbial communities from stool samples. Because dilution has different effects (depending on microbial abundance) (12), these results will allow an improvement in the interpretation of the variation in the microbial community of stool samples. Moreover, because all fecal sample collection methods have been demonstrated to be reproducible, stable, and accurate (15), our results are generalizable to all studies evaluating fecal samples, independently of the collection methods. Another of the strengths of the study is that we used samples from the same homogenate, which eliminated the subject-to-subject variability that occurs in a population-based study and that would markedly affect variability (16). The study was thus powered to detect even very small effects of the technical variables evaluated.

R1s and R2s were first demultiplexed by the use of Illumina BCL2Fastq software. Paired R1-R2 reads were analyzed using hybrid-denovo (18), which was specifically developed for nonoverlapping paired-end reads, with default parameter settings. Briefly, quality filtering was performed using Trimmomatic (19). Surviving read pairs were further trimmed, concatenated, and sorted by cluster size. Afterward, de novo operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking (97% similarity) was conducted via the use of the UPARSE algorithm (20). UCHIME was used to perform additional reference-based chimera removal against the gold database (21). High-quality single-end R1s were further mapped to the R1 end of the OTU representatives using USEARCH (22). The remaining unmapped R1s were clustered into new OTUs via the use of the UPARSE algorithm and added to the list of OTUs generated by the paired-end reads. Thus, the OTU representatives consisted of a mixture of single-end and paired-end reads. We then aligned all the OTU representatives using the structure alignment algorithm Infernal trained on the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database (23). OTU representatives that were not aligned or that had negative alignment scores were removed since they hypothetically represented nonbacteria. A phylogenetic tree was built from the aligned OTU representatives using FastTree (24). FastTree has a low penalty level with respect to end gaps, which is favorable when processing a mixture of single-end and paired-end reads. Finally, R1 and R2 reads were stitched together with ambiguous nucleotides between them and then assigned taxonomy data by the RDP classifier (25) trained on the Greengenes database v13.5 (26). OTUs not classified as Bacteria and singleton OTUs were removed as they were presumed to be contaminants. Samples with fewer than 2,000 reads were removed.",

We first summarized the microbiota data by using \u03b1-diversity and \u03b2-diversity measures. Three \u03b1-diversity metrics were used: the observed OTU number, the Shannon index, and the inverse Simpson index. The observed OTU number reflects species richness, whereas the Shannon and inverse Simpson index values take into account both species richness and species evenness. Inverse Simpson index values place more weight on dominant taxa than Shannon index values. \u03b2-Diversity values, in contrast, indicate the levels of diversity shared by bacterial populations in terms of ecological distance. Different distance metrics provide distinctive views of community structure. Three \u03b2-diversity measures, namely, Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac distances, were calculated by using the OTU table and a phylogenetic tree (\u201cvegdist\u201d and \u201cGUniFrac\u201d function in the R packages \u201cvegan\u201d and \u201cGUniFrac\u201d). Analyses that determine weighted UniFrac and unweighted UniFrac distance values are designed to detect phylogenetic signals, i.e., clusters of OTUs on the phylogenetic tree, while Bray-Curtis distance values are more efficient in catching scattered signals. Weighted UniFrac distance values place more weight on the significance of abundant lineages and are more efficient at detecting changes in abundant lineages, while unweighted UniFrac distance values use presence and absence information and are powerful for detecting community membership change or changes in abundance in rare lineages (if the abundance is below the detection limit, it will appear to represent absence) (13). Significant values achieved using any of the statistical metrics described above are reported in the manuscript. Sequencing data were rarefied to a common depth of 11,328 reads before \u03b1-diversity and \u03b2-diversity analyses were performed.",

To assess the association with \u03b2-diversity measures, we used permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA; \u201cAdonis\u201d function in the R \u201cvegan\u201d package). Significance was assessed with 1,000 permutations. A distance-based R2 value was used to quantify the percentage of variability of the microbiota that was explained by various technical factors (28). Ordination plots based on Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac distances were generated with principal-coordinate analysis as implemented in R (\u201ccmdscale\u201d function in the R \u201cstats\u201d package). To identify bacterial genera associated with gDNA concentration, we conducted differential abundance analysis at the genus level by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We filtered out genera with a prevalence of less than 10%. We normalized the count data into relative abundances (proportions) by dividing by the total read count. Taxa with a maximum proportion of less than 0.2% were excluded from testing to reduce the number of the tests. False-discovery-rate control (B-H procedure; \u201cpadjust\u201d in standard R packages) was used to correct for multiple testing, and false-discovery-rate-adjusted P\u00a0values (q values) of less than 0.01 were considered significant.",
