While new sequencing technologies have made it increasingly feasible to analyze large numbers of human-associated samples, the extraction of DNA from samples often remains a bottleneck in the process. Here we tested a direct PCR approach using the Extract-N-Amp Plant PCR Kit to accelerate the 16S rRNA gene-based analyses of human-associated bacterial communities, directly comparing this method to a more commonly-used approach whereby DNA is first extracted and purified from samples using a series of steps prior to PCR amplification. We used both approaches on replicate samples collected from each of five body habitats (tongue surface, feces, forehead skin, underarm skin, and forearm skin) from four individuals. With the exception of the tongue samples, there were few significant differences in the estimates of taxon richness or phylogenetic diversity obtained using the two approaches. Perhaps more importantly, there were no significant differences between the methods in their ability resolve body habitat differences or inter-individual differences in bacterial community composition and the estimates of the relative abundances of individual taxa were nearly identical with the two methods. Overall, the two methods gave very similar results and the direct PCR approach is clearly advantageous for many studies exploring the diversity and composition of human-associated bacterial communities given that large numbers of samples can be processed far more quickly and efficiently.",

Shifts in the composition of bacterial communities found within the mouth, skin, and the gut are often associated with intra- and inter-individual variation in immune system function, resistance to opportunistic pathogens, tissue development, and metabolism [4], [5]. Research into the human microbiome and its influence on human health has long been hindered by the difficulties associated with characterizing the composition and structure of the bacterial communities. Individual samples typically harbor highly diverse bacterial communities consisting of hundreds, if not thousands, of taxa, most of these taxa can only be identified via DNA or RNA analyses and the bacterial communities found within individual body habitats are highly variable between individuals and within individuals over time [6]\u2013[11]. Therefore, effectively quantifying the inter- and intra-individual variability in human-associated bacterial communities requires the analysis of a large number of samples using high-throughput molecular approaches.",

Large numbers of samples can now be analyzed in this manner given that PCR setup can readily be automated using liquid-handling robots and the increasing availability of next-generation DNA sequencing technologies [12], [13] that allow thousands of samples to be sequenced simultaneously at a very low per-sample cost [14]. Currently, the DNA extraction step is often the bottleneck in this process because most extraction protocols utilize different chemical and/or physical lysis procedures and DNA cleanup steps, many of which are very time consuming even when conducted with liquid-handling robots. Although several recent studies have evaluated a variety of DNA extraction methods to determine the most suitable for human microbiome studies [15]\u2013[17], these studies were primarily concerned with the impact of different DNA extractions methods on community structure representation and not with expediting the extraction process.",

                    "text": "DNA was extracted from 80 of the 160 swabs using the approach described in detail in [7] and [19]. This approach involves extracting and purifying DNA from the swabs using the commercially available MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA USA, catalog #12955), a kit that is widely used in human microbiome research [6], [7] as it consistently yields high quality, PCR-amplifiable DNA from even low biomass samples (like skin). Although numerous kits and extraction procedures have been used in human microbiome studies, all involve the basic steps of cell lysis and DNA purification prior to PCR amplification. Therefore, for the purpose of this study, we chose the MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit to represent a \u201cstandard extraction/purification approach,\u201d as this is what we commonly use in our laboratory and what has been adopted by such large-scale projects as The Earth Microbiome Project (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/). This extraction approach involves mechanical lysis, chemical lysis, and DNA purification in a series of 32 steps following the manufacturers' instructions. All 80 samples and 16 negative controls consisting of both reagent blanks and sterile swabs were extracted in a single 96-well plate which requires approximately 6\u20138 h to process a full plate. For the skin and tongue samples, DNA was extracted directly from individual swab tips placed into the respective wells. For the fecal samples, the four replicate swab tips per individual were placed into a sterile, DNA-free 50 mL conical tube with 2 mL of PCR-grade water (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA USA). The conical tube was vortexed for 30 s and the resulting fecal slurry was used to load four replicate wells in the 96-well plate with 25 \u00b5L of fecal slurry per well. The resulting DNA was then PCR amplified using a primer set (515f/806r) [20] that targets the hyper-variable V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. The 515f primer included the Roche 454-A FLX pyrosequencing adapter (Roche Applied Science, Branford, CT, USA) and a \u2018GT\u2019 linker sequence. The 806r primer incorporated a 12-bp error-correcting barcode sequence unique to each individual sample, the Roche 454-B FLX sequencing adapter and a \u2018GG\u2019 linker sequence. Samples were amplified in triplicate with 2 \u00b5L of forward and reverse primers (5 \u00b5M each), 10 \u00b5L of 5Prime MasterMix (5 PRIME Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA), 1 \u00b5L 5Prime magnesium solution and 1 \u00b5L of DNA in a total volume of 25 \u00b5L with the following cycling conditions: 35 cycles (95\u00b0C, 30 s; 50\u00b0C, 1 min; 72\u00b0C, 1 min) after an initial denaturation of 3 min. at 95\u00b0C. Amplicons from the triplicate reactions were pooled together, visualized on an agarose gel, and quantified using the PicoGreen dsDNA assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Amplicons from all samples were pooled in equimolar concentrations into a single composite sample that was then cleaned using a single-tube MoBio UltraClean PCR Clean-up Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA USA), and sequenced at Engencore (University of South Carolina) on a Roche GS-FLX 454 automated pyrosequencer running the Titanium chemistry.",

The Axygen plate was chosen for its separate well walls, which offered more uniform heating of samples as opposed to plates with shared well walls. The four replicate fecal samples from each individual were processed as described above with 25 \u00b5L of fecal slurry placed into each of four replicate wells in the 96-well plate. The plate was processed using the Extract-N-Amp Plant PCR kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) following the manufacturers' instructions except for adjusting the volume of reagents as detailed below. Wells containing fecal slurry received 100 \u00b5L of Extract-N-Amp Plant Extraction solution (catalog #E7526) and wells containing the swab tips (all negative controls, tongue, and skin samples) received 250 \u00b5L of this solution. The plate was then sealed securely with a 96 round well Impermamat Silicon Sealing Mat (Axygen Inc., Union City, CA, USA, catalog #AM-2ML-RD-IMP), heated in a water bath at 90\u201395\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 2500 xg. Extract-N-Amp Plant Dilution solution (catalog #D5688) was added to the wells at a 1\u22361 ratio to the extraction solution and mixed gently by pipetting. The plate was resealed with the mat and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight.

Briefly, alpha diversity is defined here as the number of taxa (OTU richness) or lineages (phylogenetic diversity, PD [27]) found in individual samples. Beta diversity is the net difference between any pair of communities: the number and abundances of taxa shared between samples (measured here using the Bray-Curtis distance metric) or the proportion of lineages shared between samples (unweighted Unifrac distance [28]). All metrics were calculated for 400 randomly selected sequences from each sample. For the alpha-diversity metrics, the average value for each sample was determined from 50 resampling events of 400 sequences per sample. Replicate samples were then averaged for each method and tested for differences between methods using a Student's t-test (within an individual) and a paired t-test (across individuals). For the beta-diversity metrics, the unweighted UniFrac distance matrix was exported from QIIME and imported into PRIMER v6 where principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) were used to visualize and statistically compare the communities observed with the different methods [29]. Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were calculated in PRIMER v6 using a normalized and square root transformed OTU table generated in QIIME. PCoA and ANOSIM were also performed on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. Pairwise UniFrac distances and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities values for replicate samples from each individual were averaged and tested for significance using a Student's t-test to evaluate the variability between replicates within a method. All statistical tests, except ANOSIM, were performed in the R software package [30].",

Here we focus on comparisons of the estimated alpha diversity levels between the two methods, the direct PCR approach and the DNA extraction/purification approach, to determine whether they yielded similar results. With the exception of the tongue samples, there were few significant differences in the estimates of either PD levels (Figure 2) or OTU richness (Figure S1) between the two approaches. Across the four individuals, bacterial diversity on the tongue was consistently underestimated using the direct PCR approach. For the other body habitats, the two approaches yielded no consistent differences in estimated diversity across individuals, but some estimates of diversity within body habitats of specific individuals were significantly different between the two approaches, with the direct PCR approach often yielding higher estimates of diversity on skin sites than the more traditional approach. Alpha diversity estimates do appear sensitive to the method used, but the patterns across body habitats and, in most cases, the relative differences in diversity levels across individuals for a given body habitat, were consistent regardless of the method employed. We do not know how the differences between the two approaches observed here compare to the magnitude of the differences in alpha diversity estimates that are known to arise when different PCR primers [14], [32], [33], DNA extraction techniques [15]\u2013[17], or data processing strategies [34]\u2013[36] are employed.

Within a given body habitat, communities clustered by individual (Figure 4, S3) regardless of the method employed, and there were no statistically significant differences between methods across individuals (p>0.01 for each body habitats; see Figures 4 and S3 for ANOSIM statistics of each body habitat). These patterns were evident when beta diversity was quantified using either a phylogenetic metric (Figure 4) or a taxonomic metric (Figure S3). These results highlight that the inter-individual differences in bacterial community composition are typically large regardless of the body habitat in question, a pattern that has been noted previously [7], [8], [19]. The differences in bacterial communities between body habitats and between individuals for a given body habitat were consistent across the two methods. If the goal of a project is to resolve inter-habitat or inter-individual differences in bacterial community composition, either method should suffice and mixing datasets obtained using the two different methods could be justified given that there were no statistically significant differences between the methods at this level of inquiry.",

Other studies have also observed beta diversity differences between replicate samples extracted with different DNA extraction protocols [15], [16]. The taxa driving the differences we observed between the methods are detailed in Table 1. In the gut samples, the direct PCR approach often underestimated the abundances of Ruminococcaceae and overestimated Veillonellaceae relative to the extraction/purification approach. Likewise, in the tongue samples the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae was, in some individuals, estimated to be higher with the direct PCR approach than the more traditional method. Although we do not know which approach is more accurate (i.e. which approach provides estimates of taxon abundances that more closely reflect true abundances), the two approaches do yield different estimates of some taxon abundances, differences that could be due to the direct PCR approach failing to release DNA from certain cell types. If the goal is to assess the intra-individual variability in bacterial communities within a given body habitat (e.g. time series studies), either method would suffice, but it is important not to mix the methods as the two methods do not yield identical estimates of taxon abundances, particularly in the fecal and tongue samples.",

Samples that are identical and are processed in an identical manner should yield very similar sequence data, but previous work has demonstrated that this is often not the case [38]. To quantify variability between replicate samples with each approach, pairwise phylogenetic distance (UniFrac) and taxonomic dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis) values were compared between replicate samples collected from the same body site and individual. With the unweighted UniFrac metric, the levels of variability between replicates were similar between the two methods with only a handful of replicate sample sets exhibiting significantly different levels of variability (Figure 5). Perhaps more importantly, one approach did not consistently yield higher variability between replicates than another, in some cases the DNA extraction/purification approach actually resulted in greater variability between replicate samples. Similar patterns were observed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities although the direct PCR communities from the fecal and tongue samples were more variable across individuals (Figure S4). Regardless of the approach used, replicate samples never yielded identical sequence data (a point that should be considered when designing studies) and this variability between replicates was not consistently higher with one approach than the other.",
