Several recent clinical studies have linked the microbiome with neuropsychiatric conditions, although the literature on schizophrenia is quite limited. This study investigated gut microbiome composition in 50 individuals, including 25 persons with chronic schizophrenia and 25 demographically-matched non-psychiatric comparison subjects (NCs). Stool samples were collected and assayed using 16S rRNA sequencing of the V4 region. Examination of unweighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities revealed significant community-level separation in microbiome composition between the two subject groups. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria were found to be relatively decreased in schizophrenia subjects compared to NCs. At the genus level, Anaerococcus was relatively increased in schizophrenia while Haemophilus, Sutterella, and Clostridium were decreased. Within individuals with schizophrenia, abundance of Ruminococcaceae was correlated with lower severity of negative symptoms; Bacteroides were associated with worse depressive symptoms; and Coprococcus was related to greater risk for developing coronary heart disease. Our findings provide evidence of altered gut microbial composition in persons with chronic schizophrenia and suggest a need for larger and longitudinal studies of microbiome in schizophrenia.",

The microbiome is a dynamic ecological community of microorganisms that inhabit the human body. The gut microbiome has a pivotal role in regulating inflammatory and metabolic pathways across a number of physical diseases, including gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Kostic et al., 2014), obesity and metabolic diseases (Bouter et al., 2017; Hartstra et al., 2015), cancer (Schwabe and Jobin, 2013), and chronic pulmonary diseases (Budden et al., 2017; O\u2019Dwyer et al., 2016). There is also an emerging body of empirical support for the view that the gut microbiome can impact brain and behavior (Collins et al., 2012; Cryan and Dinan, 2012; Mayer, 2011). A number of animal studies suggest that the alterations in gut microbiota can induce physiological and behavioral features that resemble psychiatric disorders (e.g., Sudo et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2016). However, human studies in this area have been few, particularly in schizophrenia (Nguyen et al., 2018).",

Some studies have found that schizophrenia is associated with elevated serological biomarkers of microbial translocation (Severance et al., 2012; Severance et al., 2016; Severance et al., 2013), suggesting increased permeability of the intestinal lumen, which may be a mechanism by which intestinal dysbiosis impacts systemic physiological functioning. Additionally, gut and digestive disturbances, including irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, and celiac disease, are highly prevalent comorbidities in persons with schizophrenia (Severance et al., 2015). Gastrointestinal diseases are the third leading cause of natural deaths in schizophrenia (Saha et al., 2007). Considering that microbial colonization of the gut is crucial for optimal function of the immune system (Kamada et al., 2013; Round and Mazmanian, 2009), inflammation, oxidative stress, and other physiological dysfunctions implicated in schizophrenia might be, at least in part, associated with changes in the microbiome.",

The four published studies of the gut microbiome in psychotic disorders include a study of individuals at high-risk and ultra-high-risk for schizophrenia (He et al., 2018), two investigations of patients with first-episode psychosis (Schwarz et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018), and a report on persons with schizophrenia of less than 10 years\u2019 duration (Shen et al., 2018). These studies revealed that the species composition within the gut microbiomes of individual with or at risk for psychotic disorders is different from that of non-psychiatric comparison subjects (NCs), with varying bacterial taxa driving community separation in each study. Only one of these studies investigated the relationship between gut bacteria and clinical characteristics; first-episode patients with the greatest abnormalities in microbiota composition had more severe psychotic symptoms and worse global functioning at hospitalization and a lower rate of disease remission at one-year follow-up (Schwarz et al., 2018).",

The output feature table was rarefied to 7,905 sequences per sample (the lowest value in the dataset). Microbial community structure was characterized using measures of alpha-diversity (within-sample) and beta-diversity (between-samples). Alpha-diversity represents the number (richness) and distribution (evenness) of taxa within a single sample. Metrics of alpha-diversity included number of observed features to represent species richness, Shannon diversity index to quantify species abundance and evenness (Shannon, 1948), and Faith\u2019s Phylogenetic Diversity which measures the total length of branches in a reference phylogenetic tree for all species in a given sample (Faith, 1992). Beta-diversity indicates differences in taxa composition between samples based on either presence-absence or quantitative species abundance data, and may be presented in a distance matrix. Beta-diversities were calculated using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (S\u00f8rensen, 1948) and unweighted UniFrac (Lozupone and Knight, 2005; Lozupone et al., 2007).

Pearson\u2019s correlations were then calculated between each sOTU (feature) and demographic and/or clinical characteristics within schizophrenia and NC groups separately; a t-statistic test using 1,000 permutations (where labels are randomly changed between samples) with discrete FDR correction was applied to determine the statistical significance of features (Jiang et al., 2017).",

To our knowledge, this investigation is the first to provide evidence for altered gut microbiota in a sample of chronically ill patients with schizophrenia living in the US. Notably, most of these differences remained significant after controlling for demographic and clinical factors that may influence microbial composition. A number of bacterial taxa were differentially abundant between groups, including decreased relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria and genera Haemophilus, Sutterella and Clostridium and increased relative abundance of genus Anaerococcus in schizophrenia compared to NCs. The finding of abnormal microbial composition in patients with schizophrenia is consistent with previous reports among other schizophrenia-spectrum (He et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2018) and first-episode psychotic (Yuan et al., 2018) disorders, although the specifics of the observed differences vary.",

We found that abundance of Proteobacteria and Clostridium was relatively lower in schizophrenia patients than NCs, which was opposite to findings reported by Shen and colleagues (2018). Inconsistencies across investigations may be attributable partly to heterogeneity in sample characteristics across studies. Each of the prior four studies focused on schizophrenia and psychotic disorders and different developmental stages (He et al., 2018; Schwarz et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2018). Furthermore, we did not exclude individuals with certain chronic diseases, as these bodily and physiological changes are inherent to the disorder and associated lifestyle. Similar to all previous studies, patients with schizophrenia and NCs did not differ in terms of within-sample (alpha) diversity, despite overall between-sample composition divergence between patients and NCs.",

Family Ruminococcaceae has been previously reported in the literature to be associated with major depressive disorder (Jiang et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2016) and bipolar disorder (Evans et al., 2016). Studies have generally found this family to be decreased in serious mental illnesses, including bipolar and major depression disorders (Evans et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2015), although it was reported to be overrepresented in one study (Zheng et al., 2016). Furthermore, higher levels of this taxon have been shown to be associated with decreased anxiety and depression and better sleep and physical well-being (Evans et al., 2016). The literature on the relationship between genus Bacteroides is mixed; it has been previously found to be relatively underrepresented in patients with active depression, yet overrepresented in patients with antidepressant-responsive depression (Jiang et al., 2015).",

To disentangle the effect of smoking from the effect of diagnosis in schizophrenia and NC groups, we examined patients who were smokers vs. non-smokers and found no differences in beta-diversity, suggesting that the microbial abnormalities in schizophrenia may not be primarily attributable to cigarette smoking. Increased number of years of smoking was associated with higher levels of Actinobacteria, consistent with previous studies showing Actinobacteria is relatively enriched in current smokers compared to never smokers (Wu et al., 2016). The abundance of this phylum has also been found to increase after smoking cessation (Biedermann et al., 2013). Lastly, we did not detect any significant association between specific taxa and daily dosages of antipsychotics. Prior studies have evaluated the effects of antipsychotic medications on the gut microbiome in serious mental illnesses. In drug-na\u00efve patients with first episode schizophrenia, 24-week risperidone treatment resulted in significant increases in the numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. and E. coli, and decreases in Clostridium coccoides group and Lactobacillus spp. (Yuan et al., 2018). Current atypical antipsychotic treatment was also associated with reduced gut alpha-diversity in women with bipolar disorder and significant beta-diversity separation (Flowers et al., 2016). Patients on atypical antipsychotic medications demonstrated relatively increased levels of Lachnospiraceae, while non-antipsychotic-treated individuals showed preferentially higher levels of Akkermansia.",

The sample size in this investigation was small, limiting the extent to which we could statistically explore potential confounds on gut microbial differences and the power of correlational analyses to assess the relationship of various clinical correlates and gut microbiome. Thus, these results should be considered preliminary. We were able to replicate community-level group differences found in other studies of the gut microbiome in populations with or at risk for serious mental illnesses (Evans et al., 2016; He et al., 2018; Schwarz et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2018), and we observed several intriguing relationships which should be further explored and replicated in future studies. Future investigations should aim to further assess the relationship of psychotropic medication use as well as disease severity, cognition, nutrition, and lifestyle behaviors to the gut microbiome. It is also a possibility that microbial differences between schizophrenia patients and NCs may be driven by the larger percentage of patients who have co-morbid medical illnesses (e.g., diabetes, hypertension). However, we did not find any beta-diversity differences between patients with and without these disorders, suggesting that these physical conditions did not significantly impact the differences observed between groups. Finally, the cross-sectional design restricts our ability to make causal inferences about the role of the gut microbiome in schizophrenia. Larger, prospective longitudinal studies of patients with varied duration of illness are required to determine whether intestinal dysbiosis is a key pathophysiological feature of schizophrenia and how it may impact aging in this disorder.",

We included a NC sample that was matched to the schizophrenia sample on demographics, sequencing plate, and other clinical factors known to have major influences on the gut microbiome. Our study is also the first to examine schizophrenia patients living in the US and those with very long durations of illness. These results represent a first step in understanding the gut microbial ecosystem in clinical populations of persons with schizophrenia. These findings lay the groundwork for future investigations in elucidating the role of the gut microbiome in the development, presentation, and progression of schizophrenia and how it may be associated with (or contribute to) other physiological abnormalities (e.g., chronic inflammation, oxidative stress) in this population. Microbiome research holds promise for predicting clinical prognosis, assessing risk for medical morbidity and mortality, and informing intervention development (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplantation) to improve patients\u2019 quality of life. Strategies for achieving and maintaining healthy microbiome may lead to numerous potential benefits, including improved physical and mental health, cognition, and consequently, everyday functioning.",
