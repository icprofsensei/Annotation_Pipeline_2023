Standard methods of microbiome analysis have relied upon identification of species as a basis for inferring characteristics of the microbiome that may be associated with disease. The interpersonal variability of bacterial species in the human gut microbiome suggests that the gene or functional complement of the microbial community may be more relevant than species alone when analyzing differences in the microbiome associated with disease[1]. In addition to identifying compositional patterns of microbial communities or the complement of metabolic functions to correlate characteristics of microbiomes with disease, there is also value in determining ecological resemblance through quantitative measures such as similarity or dissimilarity (\u03b2-diversity). Similarity or difference measures have been widely discussed in the fields of ecology, biology and biogeography[2] and are often derived from species counts or relative abundance[3, 4]. The UniFrac[5] distance is derived from phylogenetic tree branch lengths between species, sometimes weighted by species abundances, based on the concept that closely-related organisms may share functional characteristics in common. Because similarity and dissimilarity measures are typically calculated from species abundance estimates, they are biased by the methods used to identify species and estimate abundances.",

Benefits of this approach are that the 16S rRNA gene is universal in bacteria, representation of the 16S rRNA gene sequence in GenBank is extensive, sequencing a short (~1500 bp) region is relatively inexpensive, and common use of the same target gene across multiple studies increases accuracy in meta-analysis[8]. Although its variable regions can be used to distinguish taxa it provides uneven resolution of the taxonomic spectrum, and variation in copy number of this gene influences abundance estimates, among other limitations[9]. Microbial abundance profiles can also be generated from WGS metagenomic sequence by methods that include alignment, taxonomic classification, metagenomics assembly, binning and deconvolution. Relative abundances can be estimated by aligning WGS metagenomic sequence to taxon specific marker genes[10], unique genomic regions[11], complete genomes[12\u201314] and universal marker genes[15]. Homology-based methods have also been introduced to correct abundance estimates from alignment using a variety of modeling strategies[16\u201318]. Accuracy of the abundance estimates using alignment methods has improved with increasing representation of taxa in reference databases. However, this approach will always be limited by ability to identify microbial strains that are distant from the reference and those which are modified by gene acquisition or deletion as they adapt to new environments and compete for resources. Some of these adaptations may be associated with the particular human disease being investigated. Taxonomic classification of individual WGS metagenomic sequence reads to group them with the assistance of phylogenetic relatedness can improve identification of novel strains[19, 20]. Classification methods can be biased by uneven and limited representation of taxa and the scarcity of unculturable microbes in reference databases. These limitations can be overcome by metagenomic assembly[21\u201324], given sufficient read coverage, especially when combined with other methods of determining microbial abundances. Binning or partitioning of the sequence reads using frequency patterns of k-mers, short nucleotide (nt) sequences of length k, provides a means of clustering WGS metagenomic sequence that is independent of reference databases[25\u201328]. The use of subtle differences in frequency patterns for non-unique k-mers can help distinguish reads from different taxa but this method has relatively lower resolution, especially for closely related species. Deconvolution methods[29\u201331] invert high-dimensional matrices to resolve the relationship between gene content or function and taxonomic abundances. This is a multi-sample analysis method that is dependent on the number and content of the metagenomic samples for accuracy. At the current stage they are also dependent on reference databases and annotation, but are less sensitive to incompleteness of these resources.",

The advantage of alignment-free methods is that they avoid incomplete database bias, OTU identification error, inability to assemble low coverage (low abundance) OTUs and they are robust even for unculturable microbes. An efficient method of determining sample similarity in WGS metagenomic sequence is through the use of k-mers. By direct comparison of metagenomic sequence at the scale of shotgun sequence reads, similarity can be measured at a subspecies level. The dissimilarity or distance measures derived from them can be used for classification by clustering, construction of phylogenetic-like tree graphs, or ordination such as principal coordinates analysis[1, 35]. The disadvantage of these methods is that the derived scores are not standard ecological measures. Quantitative measures of ecological similarity or distance derived from species identification and abundance such as UNIFRAC[36\u201338], Jensen-Shannon[39, 40], Bray-Curtis (BC)[39, 41\u201344] and Morisita-Horn[45] are commonly used for microbiome analysis in clinical research studies. However, methods to calculate these measures from WGS metagenomic sequence using alignment-free algorithms are lacking.

For example, successful treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile[38\u201340, 42, 45, 46] induced colitis with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has stimulated research in evaluating the effectiveness of FMT as therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC)[37, 44], Crohn's disease (CD)[47] and other inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)[41, 43, 48, 49], which may have a microbial component to the disease. This therapy aims to replace the gut microbiota in a recipient by colonic or nasogastric administration of filtered and diluted stool obtained from a healthy donor. FMT is hypothesized to work by shifting the recipient's microbiota toward a community that resists inflammation induced by pathogens or an altered microbiota. Though case reports indicate episodic success of these therapies for IBD, there has been limited analysis of engraftment performed in these studies to assess the therapeutic potential of FMT to alter the microbiome in a sustained manner[36]. We sought to develop a method to measure the extent to which the donor's gut microbiota has been established in the recipient following transplantation based on similarity of the microbiomes of the patient and donor. In a recent pediatric study to treat Crohn's disease with FMT at Seattle Children's Hospital[47] we applied an alignment-free algorithm, Compareads[50], more recently released as Commet[51], to measure engraftment using WGS metagenomic sequence. Commet is a computationally efficient algorithm that calculates similarity on the basis of sequence identity, which is determined by mapping k-mers between samples. However, it is not a standard ecological measure and its estimate of similarity can be greatly inflated for samples with high asymmetry of abundance since it does not take relative sequence abundance into account.",

The k-mer length influences the ability to uniquely map WGS metagenomic sequence between samples. The percentage of unique k-mer sequences with length 11 to 35 bp for four bacterial species, Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia pseudomalleii are shown in S1 Fig. Spurious matches are more prevalent for k-mers shorter than about 17 to 20 nucleotides. At the sequence length (k = 31) used throughout this study k-mer uniqueness was greater than 99.3% for these bacterial species except for E. coli, which was 97.8%, presumably due to gene duplication. In the other extreme, opportunity for overlap of sequence reads diminishes with increasing k-mer length. For a range of k-mer lengths between these extremes, variation in the number of k-mers mapped between samples is only weakly dependent on k-mer length.",

Sequence reads were drawn from among the 59 sequenced genomes to match the abundance profiles (but not the original species).

Similarity scores calculated by GUTSS for two samples with 20 million Illumina reads took 180 minutes on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5420 @ 2.50GHz using 5 cores under KVM virtualization. Computation time increases approximately linearly with sample size because most of the computation time involves serially calculating differences in k-mers counts for each read, and this scales proportionally with the number of reads.

One way to measure how the gut microbiome of a young child progresses toward establishment of an adult-like microbiome is to compare with a pool of healthy adults. We applied GUTSS to compare longitudinal samples from five healthy young children[54] with twenty HMP adult gut microbiomes. The median similarity to adults was determined for each time point (age) of each child (Fig 2). The average similarity of 49 pairs of HMP adult gut microbiomes (solid horizontal line in Fig 2) was estimated by GUTSS to be 16.6\u00b17.5%, with values ranging from 4.8 to 33.6% (S2 Table). Similarity scores for young children ranged from 0.2 to 6% for the first samples taken. Four of the five children were within one standard deviation of the adult average by the time of the last sample. Similarity scores near the adult average were achieved at different timepoints between one and three years of life, suggesting that the establishment of an adult-like microbiome varies across individuals.",

Patients had clinical evaluations and stool collection prior to transplant and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks following FMT. Samples from donors, which were parents of the patients, were acquired on the day of transplant. Samples from eight patients and their respective donors in that study were analyzed using GUTSS. Patient microbiomes were compared with that of their respective donor (Fig 3a). The mean patient to donor similarity, pre-FMT was 25.6\u00b19.7%. Patient 18 had the highest similarity to donor pre-FMT at 40.2%, and Patient 1 had the lowest at 8.0%. The mean similarity to donor was more than one standard deviation above the mean of the adults in the HMP samples, and may be a consequence of relatedness, co-habitation or shared diet of the patients and their donors. Response to FMT therapy is indicated by change from baseline in the recipient's similarity to donor. The highest similarity to donor post-FMT was 47.5% for patient 6, a 19.6% increase from the pre-FMT sample, which is also the largest change observed in this study. Patient 7 had a 14.1% increase to 39.4% following transplant. In contrast, the highest similarity between adult samples in the 100 HMP samples (noted above) was 33.6%. The largest decrease in similarity to donor from baseline was observed for patient 2, from 32.5 to 25.6%. This kind of change can be accounted for by rapid expansion of species not found in the donor, for example.",

Our similarity score is modeled on the BC index, which is a commonly used ecological measure of community resemblance. By translating this index of similarity for species in two communities into a measure of DNA sequence overlap between two metagenomics samples, we derived an analogous measure that effectively compares microbiomes at the subspecies level. The advantage of measuring microbiome similarity by direct comparison of sequence reads over methods that require species or OTU identification is that it is not biased by incompleteness in our ability to identify microbial species, organism diversity within species, or our knowledge of their function in the human intestine (or other body site). It is robust even with samples containing unculturable microbes. Similarity scores based on species identification generally overestimate similarity where differences at the subspecies level in the actual microbiome communities are not detected. Even similar species can have widely different gene content. Although methods of detection of bacteria in metagenomic samples using marker genes or unique sequences have improved as the number and variety of completed genomes has grown in sequence databases, they will always be limited by incompleteness of the databases, and bacteria will continually adapt to the gut and other environments by gene transfer or deletion.",

Similarity of the young children to the adult average increased toward the adult during the first 18 to 36 months of life. Similar trends have also been previously observed using 16S sequencing and the UniFrac distance measure[59, 60]. We also applied our method to microbiome data in a pediatric study of FMT therapy for patients with CD. Exploratory studies of the potential therapeutic value of FMT in mitigating the effects of inflammatory bowel diseases are dependent upon accurate measures of change in the microbiome of transplant recipients in order to develop correlations with clinical measures of outcome. Recipient to donor similarity prior to transplantation of the microbiota may be an important quantity to track in FMT investigations owing to its potential as a determinant of transplant efficacy. We constructed a DSI score that measures relative change in similarity to donor as a metric for cross-comparison of FMT samples. Three basic responses of large, moderate and no response to transplant were observed (Fig 3b). The relatively larger changes in the microbiome between the pre-FMT and 2 week follow up samples compared with later time points was suggestive that the FMT procedure at least caused a perturbation to the microbiome. Some of this change could be due to effect on the microbiome of the \"clean out\" preparation prior to transplant. This effect was not controlled for by \"placebo\" transplants. Since these were not controlled trials, it is not known how the magnitude of these changes compares with normal fluctuations in the microbiome, or whether their cause can be definitively attributed to the transplant procedure. Other factors such as antibiotic therapy, diet or use of probiotics may contribute to observed changes. Even though small samples were used in this trial, it was possible to observe changes in the patients' microbiomes that were significantly increased in similarity to their relative donors compared to all other donors. This suggests that similarity comparison of the metagenomic data using GUTSS is a sensitive test of changes to the microbiome that is useful for clinical evaluation of engraftment.",
