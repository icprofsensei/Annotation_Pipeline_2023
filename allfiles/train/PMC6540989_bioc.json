As an example, genetic loci have been reported to be associated with the relative abundance (RA) of specific taxa of the gut microbiome based on linkage studies in mice [13, 14] and based on association studies in humans [15]. Interestingly, Knights et al. [16] reported that a risk single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for inflammatory bowel disease located in NOD2 was associated with the RA of Enterobacteriaceae in the human gut microbiome, providing an interesting hypothesis that the genetic locus affects the risk of inflammatory bowel disease by affecting the gut microbiome. Blekhman et al. [15] performed genetic studies across body sites in the Human Microbiome Project data and found that host genetic variants associated with microbiome composition were enriched in immunity-related pathways. In addition, a large-scale twin study suggested a strong genetic component for human gut microbiome [17]. These studies imply that identifying host genetic variants associated with microbiome composition has the potential to explain variability of human microbiome composition and to elucidate biological mechanisms for genetic associations with complex diseases.",

Because a microbiota functions as a community, one important analysis is testing genetic associations with beta diversity, that is, with a pairwise distance matrix defined based on 16S rRNA sequence data. At a truly associated SNP, microbiome distances are generally smaller for pairs of subjects with more similar genotypic values, i.e., the microbiome distance is positively associated with the genetic distance across subject pairs. Microbiome distances can be defined in different ways, based on phylogenetic tree information or on each taxon\u2019s abundance information. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity [18], Kullback-Leibler divergence, UniFrac [19\u201321], and generalized UniFrac (GUniFrac) distance [22] are widely used beta-diversity metrics.",

Previous reports and our empirical data [23] suggest that the power to identify associated genetic loci depends on which distance matrix is employed. As an example, based on a lung tissue microbiome GWAS study, a lung cancer risk SNP rs401681 located on chromosome 5p15.33 (CLPTM1L) was ambiguously associated with unweighted UniFrac distance matrix with p = 0.056 and more clearly with weighted UniFrac distance matrix with p = 0.005. This problem has been well realized in microbiome data analysis. Frequently, associations in nongenetic studies (e.g., case-control studies) are tested using multiple distance matrices, and the most significant association is reported without explicitly accounting for multiple testing, which obviously causes an inflated type-I error rate. MiRKAT [24], a recently developed method for testing associations between microbiome composition and a trait (quantitative or binary), has the option for testing many distance matrices. However, MiRKAT relies on permutations to evaluate significance and thus is not feasible for analyzing millions of SNPs in GWAS.",

We calculate the significance by correcting for the multiple testing imposed by testing many distance matrices. Importantly, we show that the skewness and kurtosis of each score statistic make the p-value approximation based on the asymptotic normal assumption too liberal, which is addressed by explicitly correcting for skewness and kurtosis of score statistics. The accuracy of the approximations is verified by extensive simulations. These theoretic investigations allow us to develop algorithms for efficiently analyzing genome-wide SNP markers in a GWAS study without relying on computationally intensive permutations. The algorithms are implemented in the software package microbiomeGWAS (https://github.com/lsncibb/microbiomeGWAS). The computational complexity depends on the number of subjects, the number of SNPs, and the number of micro-biome distance matrices.

It is computationally infeasible to perform permutations to derive significance for a large-scale GWAS. Thus, the primary challenge is to evaluate the significance. Our method for efficiently and accurately evaluating significance relies on two theoretical investigations. First, we corrected the score statistics for their skewness and kurtosis, and we found that the corrected score statistics follow a multivariate distribution under the null hypothesis. Second, we demonstrated that the correlation matrix of the score statistics is numerically constant for SNPs with different MAF; thus, we only need to calculate the correlation matrix once and use it for all SNPs.
