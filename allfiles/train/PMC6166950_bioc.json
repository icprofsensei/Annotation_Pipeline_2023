Furthermore, periodontal inflammation has been linked to various systemic diseases with high prevalence, incidence, morbidity, and mortality; for example type 2 diabetes mellitus [11] and obesity [12]. In both cases, the pro-inflammatory milieu associated with both obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus may play a key role in the mechanisms linking these two diseases with periodontal disease [13,14]. However, Shungin et al. argued that observational studies are sensitive to confounding, bias and reverse causality, and by employing Mendelian randomization causal analyses, concluded that total adiposity is unlikely to be causally related with periodontitis [15]. On the other hand, a 'two-way' interaction between type 2 diabetes mellitus and periodontitis is well-established [14], and implicates that not only is diabetes a risk factor for periodontitis, but periodontitis could have a negative effect on glycemic control.",

All analyses were run with LEfSe's \u03b1 parameter for pairwise tests set to 0.05 and the threshold of the logarithmic score for LDA analysis set to 2.0.",

Estimations of species richness and diversity in plaque and saliva by calculating alpha diversity metrics reported a statistically significant different distribution of species richness between plaque and saliva at baseline. On average, more OTUs were observed in saliva samples (Table 2). A difference in species diversity between plaque and saliva was found at least in trend (estimated by Shannon index and Simpson index, Table 2).

Interventional studies performed in the human and mouse model using fecal microbiota transplantation supported the causal effect of the gut microbiome on obesity [7\u20139]. The proposed pathophysiological mechanisms, with which the gut microbiota could contribute to the development of obesity, are not fully understood. Thus far, pathways describing (i) increased energy harvesting, (ii) the induction of inflammatory responses as well as (iii) a variety of metabolic and immune interactions by the gut microbiota have been of major interest. Bacteria specific pathways allow increased caloric uptake through microbial fermentation of otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides into absorbable monosaccharides [7,34]. Short chain fatty acids, specifically butyrate, acetate and propionate, are microbial-fermentation products directly involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis and cholesterol synthesis [35], and have also been shown to increase expression of the adipokine leptin [36,37]. Constant exposition to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of gram-negative intestinal bacteria triggers a chronic low-grade inflammation, which has been shown to trigger body weight gain and insulin resistance [38]. In severe periodontitis, gram-negative anaerobes tend to dominate in the periodontal pocket [39]. The ulceration of the epithelium lining of periodontal pockets resulting from periodontitis represents a direct entry point for periodontal pathogens and bacterial products (e.g. LPS) into the systemic circulation. Thus, the oral microbiota could, together with intestinal bacteria, play a role in systemic inflammation and be involved in the microbiota-obesity-axis. Indeed, accumulating epidemiologic evidence has revealed a significant association between periodontitis and obesity [12,40].",

Our LEfSe analyses revealed distinct significantly discriminative features between two conditions (obese and non-obese patients). In subgingival plaque, LEfSe revealed a dominance of Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes and Firmicutes in the population without obesity. In obese patients, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes were overrepresented, with the noted absence of representatives from the phylum Bacteroidetes. LEfSe analysis revealed a similar observation in saliva: in the control population, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, among others, were overly abundant. Notably, the phylum Firmicutes was identified in obese patients as an independent significantly discriminative feature with an abundance of over four orders of magnitude. These findings in the oral cavity mainly correspond to the hypothesis that the obesity-associated microbiota of the gut is characterized by reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes paralleled by an increased abundance of Firmicutes resulting in in lower ratios of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes [3,34]. Importantly, the model that the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio alone may be linked to obesity might in fact be incomplete, as other factors may also be involved in the aetiology of this multifactorial metabolic disease. The first reported gut metagenomic analysis characterizing type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with obesity before and three months after bariatric surgery showed dramatic changes in the individual composition of the gut microbiota [4]. In particular, a substantial shift at the phylum level towards Proteobacteria with simultaneous decreases of both Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes after surgery was found. This shift in the microbial ecology of the gut was accompanied by marked reduction of BMI, significant improvement of the metabolic state and reduced inflammatory activity.",

Studies mentioned above linking the microbiota of the gut and the upper digestive tract under non-diabetic conditions supports that hypothesis. In addition, the potential involvement of oral bacteria in obesity has also been investigated in healthy non-diabetes subjects. In saliva, Goodson et al. identified Selenomonas noxia, a representative of the Firmicutes phylum, to be a robust predictor of obesity [40]. The microbiotas of the oral cavity and the upper gastrointestinal tract are very similar [16], and oral pathogens may contribute to dysbiosis in the gut microbiota leading to impaired barrier function and systemic inflammation [17,18]. Obesity itself, is increasingly being associated with higher proportions of different periodontal pathogens [41,42].",

The majority of participants (94.4%) were diagnosed with moderate or severe forms of periodontitis. An important consideration at this point is the inclusion criterion for the study: participants were required to have at least ten teeth (wisdom teeth excluded). The exclusion of edentulous patients or patients not meeting the inclusion criterion could have skewed the periodontitis prevalence. Given that the study population did not include an age-matched healthy population, comparisons with similar studies which included healthy, prediabetic and diabetic populations show that the results of the given study are likely in keeping with this consensus [43].",

There exist numerous studies demonstrating contrary results regarding a possible association between altered glucose metabolism and changes in the periodontal microbiome [14,44]. Currently, there is no consistent evidence of causal relation between glycemic state and periodontal microbial dysbiosis [44]. We were unable to replicate any associations between the oral microbiome and glycemic level. In the studies demonstrating a microbial shift as a result of diabetes [45\u201347], it is important to note that none of the three studies adjusted for body weight as a potential confounding factor. This may explain the contrary results as our study also demonstrates that body weight is associated with changes in the composition and diversity of the oral microbiota.",

The first limitation was the lack of a lean control group. In this case, a healthy weight group (18.5\u201325.0 kg/m2) was not included due to the study design. Our two groups only had a resolving power to differentiate between obese patients (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2) and patients who were still overweight (BMI < 30 kg/m2). Secondly, the low resolving power as a result of the small sample size represents another potential limitation. It is well established that a reduction of HbA1c and blood pressure significantly reduces microvascular complications in patients with diabetes. A cross-sectional study from NHANES between 1988 and 2010 showed that while there appears to be a dramatic increase in patients with diabetes meeting the goals set by the ADA, there is still much room for improvement [48]. The authors also concluded that achieving the ADA recommendations may be biologically unattainable for some patients due to disease severity and other comorbidities. Glycemic control is also complicated in patients presenting with more severe \u00df-cell loss. Other factors including lack of management skills or lack of adherence to demanding self-care regiments, and an aversion to lifestyle changes are often attributed to complications of diabetes management. Given this, it was anticipated that only 4 of the 18 examined patients reached the ADA recommendation of HbA1c < 7.0%, despite many years of treatment with clinicians and diabetes educators. In the case of our study, only 6 participants demonstrated an improvement in glycemic control of at least of 0.5% HbA1c intensified diabetes treatment during the entire observation period of 3 months.",
