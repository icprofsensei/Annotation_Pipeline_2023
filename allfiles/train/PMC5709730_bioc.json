Triclosan and triclocarban (referred to as TCs) are the most common antimicrobials in household and personal care products, but the extent to which TC exposure perturbs microbial communities in humans, particularly during infant development, was unknown. We conducted a randomized intervention of TC\u2010containing household and personal care products during the first year following birth to characterize whether TC exposure from wash products perturbs microbial communities in mothers and their infants. Longitudinal survey of the gut microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing showed that TC exposure from wash products did not induce global reconstruction or loss of microbial diversity of either infant or maternal gut microbiotas. Broadly antibiotic\u2010resistant species from the phylum Proteobacteria, however, were enriched in stool samples from mothers in TC households after the introduction of triclosan\u2010containing toothpaste. When compared by urinary triclosan level, agnostic to treatment arm, infants with higher triclosan levels also showed an enrichment of Proteobacteria species. Despite the minimal effects of TC exposure from wash products on the gut microbial community of infants and adults, detected taxonomic differences highlight the need for consumer safety testing of antimicrobial self\u2010care products on the human microbiome and on antibiotic resistance.",

The microbes that occupy the human body in niches from the gut to the skin have diverse roles in human health, ranging from metabolic support to immunomodulation. Imbalances in these microbial communities are implicated in a wide variety of diseases (Cho & Blaser, 2012). The extent to which triclosan exposure may induce microbial perturbations has been studied in fish and rodent models with conflicting outcomes (reviewed in Yee et\u00a0al, 2016). Triclosan exposure restructures the juvenile fish microbiome (Narrowe et\u00a0al, 2015) but results in recoverable alterations following short\u2010term perturbation in adult fish (Gaulke et\u00a0al, 2016). Adolescent rats receiving oral triclosan at levels comparable to human exposures develop lower microbial diversity in the gut and more prominent changes in taxonomic composition than in adult rats (Hu et\u00a0al, 2016). While triclocarban exposures are less studied, in pregnant rats and their offspring <\u00a010\u00a0days old exposure leads to lowered phylogenetic diversity and revealed a dominance of the Proteobacteria phylum in the gut (Kennedy et\u00a0al, 2016). In a small, randomized, crossover human study, TC wash product exposure did not induce major perturbations of the oral and gut microbiomes (Poole et\u00a0al, 2016). This finding supports other studies that have shown minimal impact of triclosan on dental microbial ecology, despite slowing the progression of periodontitis (Seymour et\u00a0al, 2017).",

We identified differentially abundant taxa present in stool samples from TC vs. nTC infants and mothers by first pooling data from all three visits and separately for each of the three visits. A greater number of taxa were significantly differentially abundant in mothers vs. infants (29 in mothers, 17 in infants; Fig\u00a04A). Infants did not show an enrichment of specific phyla at any time point, but Bacteroides fragilis was persistently the most enriched species in nTC infants in combined and time\u2010point analyses at 6\u00a0months (Fig\u00a04A and B). Relative abundances of B.\u00a0fragilis at this visit were not associated with delivery method (Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test P\u00a0=\u00a00.85) or breast feeding (ANOVA P\u00a0=\u00a00.52) as previously reported (Martin et\u00a0al, 2016). Mothers showed a strong enrichment of Proteobacteria in the TC arm after the introduction of triclosan\u2010containing toothpaste at the 2\u2010month visit (toothpaste was not provided prior to the infants\u2019 births) (Fig\u00a04C). We additionally compared differential taxa in the upper and lower tertiles of urinary triclosan levels at the 6\u2010month visits, agnostic to treatment assignment. In the mothers, the taxon with the highest enrichment in the higher triclosan levels is a member of the Proteobacteria phylum. Infants with higher triclosan levels showed a statistically significant enrichment of the Proteobacteria phylum in their stools samples; conversely, B. fragilis was enriched in infants with lower triclosan levels (FDR\u2010adjusted P\u2010value <\u00a00.1, Appendix\u00a0Table\u00a0S1).",

This suggests Proteobacteria species may not harbor antibiotic resistance genes in the gut microbiome, but expansion may serve as marker for increased antibiotic resistance in a community. A preliminary, unbiased quantification of community triclosan resistance in the mothers was conducted using whole shotgun sequencing of stool samples for a subset of 12 mothers in each intervention arm at 6\u00a0months. This resulted in low coverage of triclosan resistance genes with only 0.03% of sequenced reads mapping to triclosan antibiotic resistance genes in the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). Unsupervised clustering by triclosan resistance gene counts was not sufficient to cluster maternal samples by intervention arm, and this may have been impacted by the limited power to detect differences between groups due to low coverage (Fig\u00a0EV5). Differential gene analysis from CARD showed an enrichment of one beta\u2010lactamase antibiotic resistance gene, CfxA6, in TC households at a FDR\u2010adjusted P\u2010value <\u00a00.1 threshold.",

To test the hypothesis that exposure to TC\u2010containing wash products induces a measurable impact on the gut microbiota of adults and growing infants, we assessed the stool microbiome from mothers and infants in households that had been randomized to TC or nTC wash products during the first year of the infant's life. We observed that ongoing TC exposure from household products does not contribute to major reconstruction of either infant or adult intestinal microbiomes after approximately 10\u00a0months. TC exposure did not reduce overall gut microbial diversity in infants or mothers at any visit. However, there are some notable trends in differential taxa with potential health implications. The most enriched species in the nTC randomized infants, B.\u00a0fragilis, has been shown to direct maturation of the immune system (Mazmanian et\u00a0al, 2005) and produce anti\u2010inflammatory polysaccharides (Mazmanian et\u00a0al, 2008). The most enriched organisms in the TC households at the 10\u2010month visit were Bacteroides caccae in infants and Escherichia coli in mothers. Strain\u2010specific triclosan resistance in E.\u00a0coli has been described (Braoudaki & Hilton, 2004) and may explain its enrichment in TC households at the late time point. Given that B.\u00a0caccae was extensively enriched in the infants at the 10\u2010month visit, it is possible that this organism also harbors interesting strategies for acquired or innate antimicrobial resistance.",

The Proteobacteria phylum contains both pathogenic and nonpathogenic species, which makes it difficult to ascribe a clinical or public health relevance to our results. While a selective expansion of Proteobacteria is not known to cause disease, Proteobacteria expansion has been proposed as a potential diagnostic signature of dysbiosis linked to diabetes, colitis, and malnutrition (Shin et\u00a0al, 2015). Future studies may illuminate the impact of these shifts on health\u2010related outcomes. Proteobacteria enrichment has been associated, but is not directly correlated, with increased antibiotic resistance genes in the human gut microbiota, and perhaps can be used as a marker for community antibiotic resistance (Bengtsson\u2010Palme et\u00a0al, 2015). Potential antibiotic\u2010resistant strains identified in this study may not be pathogenic, but the possibility for horizontal gene transfer with pathogenic strains between people and the environment may severely exacerbate problems with population and clinical resistance. Evidence that antibiotic resistance develops in diverse bacterial taxa following prolonged triclosan exposure suggests that triclosan resistance may be mediated by specific genes (Forbes et\u00a0al, 2016; Hartmann et\u00a0al, 2016; Khan et\u00a0al, 2016) and that these genes may be horizontally transferred (Ciusa et\u00a0al, 2012). Although we only identified one significantly enriched antibiotic resistance gene in the TC\u2010exposed mothers, point mutations in the candidate, CfxA6, have led to antibiotic resistance in the gut following antibiotic exposure (Raymond et\u00a0al, 2016). Future in\u00a0vitro and potentially in\u00a0vivo studies will be required to more thoroughly characterize the impact of TCs on antibiotic resistance in the gut microbiota. The finding that Proteobacteria were enriched in the gut microbiota is consistent with observations in fish following triclosan exposure (Narrowe et\u00a0al, 2015). The emergence of Proteobacteria was only observed after the introduction of triclosan\u2010containing toothpaste at the 2\u2010month visit. This suggests that the major intestinal exposure to triclosan is through toothpaste rather than wash products and that personal care products not covered by the FDA ban may play a role in the expansion of antibiotic resistance in the intestine.",

Although mothers in the TC arm had higher levels of triclosan detected in urine than those in nTC households, the median triclosan level we detected in urine of nTC households was higher than those reported in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) cohort from 2003 to 2012 (geometric mean concentration of 13.0\u00a0pg/\u03bcl, 95th percentile concentration of 459.0\u00a0pg/\u03bcl) (Han et\u00a0al, 2016). In addition, the urinary triclosan levels of mothers in TC households were lower than might have been anticipated\u2014approximately half of the levels following a 4\u2010month randomization to household TC\u2010containing products in a previously published crossover study (Poole et\u00a0al, 2016). Some of the differences may be due to methodological variations in the protocols used for triclosan detection or differences in exposure due to geography and inconsistent product usage. Infants in TC households and nTC households often had low triclosan levels with no statistically significant difference observed between groups. Low levels are unsurprising, as infants are not using triclosan\u2010containing toothpaste in the first year of life.",

It remains possible that the dearth of taxonomic differences in the infant samples was caused by antibiotic perturbations that overwhelmed the TC effects.

While the impact appears to be small, we do identify specific taxa previously associated with anti\u2010inflammatory properties that are enriched in infants of nTC households, as well as other taxa previously associated with broad\u2010spectrum antibiotic resistance that are enriched in mothers of TC households. The measurable shift in the gut microbiome that occurs in mothers between the first and second visits of this study, which corresponds to the introduction of triclosan through toothpaste, suggests that toothpaste exposure places more selective pressure on the gut microbiome than wash products. Triclosan exposure is known to play a role in allergen and food sensitization (Hampton, 2011; Savage et\u00a0al, 2012); topical skin application of triclosan is sufficient to induce peanut sensitivity in mice (Tobar et\u00a0al, 2016). Given the high prevalence of TC exposure on the skin in this study, it will be interesting to study the impact of these wash products on the skin microbiota and related health outcomes. Despite the minimal effects of TC exposure from wash products on the gut microbial community of infants and adults, detected Proteobacteria enrichment highlights the need for consumer safety testing of consumer antimicrobial products on the human microbiome and antibiotic resistance.",

The large disparity of reads retained between the two methods can be explained by the sensitive sample inference algorithm to infer sequence uniqueness by DADA2, which leads to fewer reads per amplicon sequence considered a unique taxonomic unit. Our strict filtering of \u201ccore taxonomy\u201d described in the main text penalizes taxa with fewer reads, leading to a large loss of taxa when compared to BaseSpace RDP. A PCoA was performed to compare the BaseSpace RDP and DADA2 taxonomic classifications on identifying variability between the samples. BaseSpace RDP and DADA2 methods are comparable on the first two principal components, separating infants and mothers despite fewer unique taxa in the DADA2 set compared to BaseSpace RDP (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2). This similarity suggests variability in the study is driven by a low number of large effect taxa.

Levels of triclosan in household products are intended to inhibit bacterial growth rather than kill bacteria (Suller & Russell, 2000). We hypothesized that the suppression of growth would alter taxa abundances rather than the presence/absence of taxa. Therefore, Bray\u2013Curtis, a non\u2010phylogeny\u2010based method that takes abundance into account was chosen for PCoA. Sample distances for maternal\u2010only analyses (Fig EV2) were calculated using the Canberra distance, which is best used for centroid\u2010type patterns since maternal points on the overall PCA were centralized (Fig\u00a01).",
