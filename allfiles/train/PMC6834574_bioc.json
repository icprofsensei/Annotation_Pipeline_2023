However, when collecting from a large number of participants such as a large-scale cohort study, the time it takes to collect saliva can be a problem. Mouth-rinsed water, which is water that has been used to rinse the oral cavity, can be used as an alternative method for collecting saliva for oral microbiome analysis because it can be collected in a shorter time than saliva. The purpose of this study was to verify whether mouth-rinsed water is a suitable saliva substitute for analyzing the oral microbiome. We collected samples of mouth-rinsed water, stimulated saliva, unstimulated saliva, and tongue coating from 10 systemic healthy participants, and compared the microbial diversity and composition of the samples using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA-encoding genes. The results showed that the microbial diversity of mouth-rinsed water was similar to that of unstimulated and stimulated saliva, and significantly higher than that of tongue-coating samples. The microbial composition at the species level of mouth-rinsed water also showed a very high correlation with the composition of unstimulated and stimulated saliva. These results suggest that the mouth-rinsed water is a suitable collection method instead of saliva for oral microbiome analysis.",

Even in the oral cavity, it has become clear that an imbalanced microbiota can contribute to various oral diseases, such as periodontal disease, dental caries, and halitosis1\u20135. The microbial composition of saliva has also been reported to be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and many other systemic diseases6\u20138. Therefore, the microbial composition of saliva has been proposed for use as a risk assessment measure for many oral and systemic diseases. Saliva collection usually takes about 1 to 5\u2009minutes per person. Therefore, when collecting\u00a0samples from a large number of participants such as large-scale cohort studies, a simpler alternative method that shortens the collection time is required. As an alternative to saliva collection, a solution obtained by mouth washing using a commercially available mouth rinse (containing 15% ethanol) can be used9,10, but since it contains ethanol, this may also cause problems such as irritation to the oral mucosa or acute alcohol intoxication due to accidental ingestion of child. The turbidity of mouth-rinsed water, which is a liquid obtained by rinsing the oral cavity with water, is reported to reflect both oral health state and malodor11,12. The microbiome of mouth-rinsed water is expected to be influenced by that of the saliva and the tongue; however, the similarity of these microbial profiles has not yet been investigated.",

The correlation coefficient between SS and US was also high (r\u2009=\u20090.846\u2009\u00b1\u20090.033). Similar results were obtained when using weighted or unweighted UniFrac distances (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1).

Regardless of the status of dental caries or periodontal disease, MW, SS, and US were collected for all participants.

As a result, no genera were found to show significantly different relative abundances among the three sampling methods (Friedman test q\u2009<\u20090.10), whereas at the species level, eight species showed significant differences among the three sampling methods, and these species also showed significant differences between MW and US or SS (Table\u00a01, Nemenyi post-hoc test p\u2009<\u20090.05).",

PCR amplicons were purified using AMPure XP magnetic purification beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies Japan).

To ensure the quality of the processing reads, fragments with an average Phred quality score of less than 25 were removed using an in-house script. From the filter-passed fragments, 10,000 fragments were randomly subsampled from each sample to remove the effect of sequence-depth bias and then used for the following analysis. The selected fragments were primary dereplicated to remove redundancy, then the dereplicated fragments were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using VSEARCH (version: 2.9.1, options:\u2013id 0.99\u2013strand plus).

For the comparison of relative abundance in terms of genera and species, the Friedman test (a non-parametric test for multiple comparisons) and the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (FDR-BH) for posterior correction were adopted.
