However, the impact of the intestinal microbiome before treatment initiation on the risk of subsequent BSI remains unclear. Our objective was to characterize the fecal microbiome collected before treatment to identify microbes that predict the risk of BSI.",

Bacteremia, or bloodstream infection (BSI), remains a common life-threatening complication with well-documented morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer [5]. In a recent study, the overall rate was 9.1 BSIs per 1000 patient-days with a 28-day case mortality rate of 10 % and 34 % in case of P. aeruginosa. [6]. Another study reported that the overall incidence of BSI was 7.48 episodes per 1000 hospital stays for neutropenic hematological patients, with 11 % of the patients requiring intensive care unit admission and resulting in an overall case-fatality rate at 30 days of 12 % [7]. Furthermore, BSI is particularly frequent during the early transplant period due to the intensive chemotherapy regimen administered prior to HSCT [8], but there is currently no way to predict or prevent it.",

We computed alpha diversity metrics, using both non-phylogeny and phylogeny-based metrics, and tested differences in alpha diversity with a Monte Carlo permuted t-test. We performed a non-parametric t-test with 1000 permutations to calculate the p values for differences among patients with different BSI status.

In detail, we included in the BSI risk index all the taxa with a false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p value less than 0.15. FDR was applied at each taxonomy level separately. For the predictive panel, the primary assessment of the relevance of the taxa is the accuracy of the predictions rather than the significance of the individual features, although the FDR threshold used still has the standard interpretation for statistical significance. The BSI risk was calculated using the sum of relative abundances of the taxa that were significantly associated with BSI minus the sum of the relative abundances of the taxa that were associated with protection from BSI (Additional file 1). Importantly, we assessed the accuracy of predictions by predicting the risk index for a given patient using predictive taxa identified using only other patients, in order to avoid information leak. The leave-one-out procedure consisted of holding a single patient out from the entire analysis at each iteration, in which the held-out sample represented a novel patient from the same population. This assessed the ability of the classifier to predict BSI risk for one patient based on their pre-chemotherapy microbiome, using a model trained only on the pre-chemotherapy microbiomes of other patients. We then retrained the model one last time on the entire dataset to report the taxa included in the predictive panel. To assess variability in the predictive strength of the model depending on training data selection, we plotted receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and computed the area under the curve (AUC) values on ten sets of predictions obtained from tenfold cross-validation using ROCR package in R. In parallel to the BSI risk index analysis, we also performed Random Forest (RF) classification with 500 trees and tenfold cross-validation [16].",

Differences were not significant when using weighted UniFrac. In our previously published studies we have found consistently that at the level of OTUs, unweighted UniFrac provides better power than weighted UniFrac for discriminating experimental groups. We also used a standard machine-learning method to verify the robustness of discriminating fecal samples from patients who did or did not develop BSI. Supervised learning using Random Forests accurately assigned samples to their source population based on taxonomic profiles at the family level (82.1 % accuracy or number of correct classifications divided by total number of classifications, 2.6 times better than the baseline error rate for random guessing). However, this was outperformed by the risk index approach according to leave-one-out cross-validation.",

Therefore, we do not expect sequencing depths to influence our results. We also subsampled the input sequences to achieve even depth per sample prior to performing OTU picking and then re-picked OTUs to determine whether differences in sequencing depth were affecting our OTU diversity. We did this at 1000, 2000, and 3000 sequences per sample. In each case, the groups remained significantly different (p <0.01, Mann\u2013Whitney U test), with the BSI patients having lower diversity microbiomes in their pretreatment samples (Additional file 4).",

The predicted risk indices were highly differentiated between patients who did and did not develop BSI (Mann\u2013Whitney U p value\u2009=\u20090.008). Median BSI risk index was \u22120.01 (IQR\u2009=\u20090.02) in patients who develop subsequent bacteremia and median BSI risk index was \u22120.05 (IQR\u2009=\u20090.02) in patients who did not develop BSI (Mann\u2013Whitney U test, two-sided p value <0.001) (Fig.\u00a04a). A negative risk index simply means that the protection-associated taxa were more abundant than the risk-associated bacteria, but not necessarily that the patient\u2019s risk score was sufficiently low to be classified as low risk. ROC curve analysis showed that the BSI risk index was a strong predictor of the onset of subsequent BSI, with an AUC of 0.94 (Fig.\u00a04b). In the leave-one-out classification, we determined that a BSI risk index classification threshold of \u22120.02 best predicts BSI in a new patient, yielding a sensitivity of 90 % at a specificity of 90 %. Importantly, the risk values shown in Fig.\u00a04a are entirely predicted for each participant using a panel of microbes retrained from scratch only on the other participants. We then retrained the model one last time on the entire dataset to report the taxa included in the final predictive panel (Fig.\u00a03).",

PICRUSt predictions in the human gut microbiome are expected to be 80\u201385 % correlated with the true metabolic pathway abundances. Therefore, the PICRUSt results should be considered suggestive only. We used LEfSe to identify significant differences in microbial genes (level 2 and level 3 KEGG Orthology groups, Linear Discriminant Analysis score (log10) >2) in the samples collected prior to treatment from patients who developed and did not develop subsequent BSI [18]. The fecal microbiome of patients that developed subsequent BSI were enriched in functional categories associated with xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism and depleted in categories associated with transcription machinery, histidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, lipid biosynthesis proteins and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (Additional file 10). Many of these alterations in the metabolic capacity were previously reported to compromise the intestinal epithelial barrier function, therefore potentially enabling bacterial translocation [19\u201322].",

Another recent study reported that reduced diversity, measured the day of the transplant, predicted the patients that will die during the HSCT procedure [23]. Reduced diversity of fecal microbiota in inflammatory states is well documented [24]. In a murine model of ileal Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), induction of inflammation was associated with reduced microbial diversity and mucosal invasion by opportunistic pathogen [25]. Our findings provide further evidence that a diverse microbiome is associated with protection from BSI [26]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that decreases in gut microbial diversity are observed before patients even begin treatment. This suggests that certain patients may be predisposed to infection prior to entering the hospital and that we can identify these patients using their microbiota.",

Moreover, in patients undergoing HSCT, intestinal colonization with Barnesiella was associated with resistance to Enterococcal domination, a risk factor for subsequent VRE BSI [10, 27]. Our findings support that this taxon is required to prevent expansion of oxygen-tolerant bacteria, such as Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae, the most frequent bloodstream pathogens in patients undergoing HSCT [28]. Barnesiellaceae was also decreased in patients with HIV compared to a healthy control group [29]. Barnesiella was found to be negatively correlated to TNF-\u03b1, markers of systemic inflammation in HIV patients [19]. Furthermore, Barnesiella was decreased in case of severe colitis in IL-22\u2013deficient and co-housed wild-type mice, suggesting its protective role against inflammation [20]. In our findings, Barnesiella is an important member of the BSI protection-associated taxa, although there are several other taxa that are strongly associated with protection or risk of BSI.",

A recent study of cirrhotic patients showed that patients who presented a bacterial translocation had a lower ratio of F. prausnitzii/E. coli as compared to patients who did not have sepsis [21]. Additionally, Oscillospira was increased in microbiomes amended with Christensenella minuta for prevention of adiposity [30]. Oscillospira has also been reported to directly regulate components involved in the maintenance of gut barrier integrity [22]. Ruminococceae-modulated microbes were butyrate-producing bacteria. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid that has a key function in intestinal epithelium development [31]. Butyrate was previously reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties by reducing permeability of the intestinal epithelium. In addition, it has been proposed that butyrate can reinforce colonic defense barriers by increasing antimicrobial peptide levels and mucin production [9].",

In microbiome data, this is a hard problem from a statistical perspective because the classifier must determine which taxa to include in the model and how much weight to assign to each taxon. Choosing which predictors to include from a large set of features is called feature selection. The problem becomes even more complicated when there are non-linear relationships between the taxa and the outcome, and when there are statistical dependencies between the taxa. Different types of classifiers have different levels of flexibility for incorporating these types of relationships. In general, the more parameters or degrees of freedom available to the classifier, the more flexible it is, but the larger the training set it requires to avoid over-fitting. Therefore, it is common to choose classifiers that have built-in constraints that keep them from being too flexible.",

On the other hand, if we only based our model on the single most discriminative genus, then we would fail to account for inter-individual variation in genus membership and the potential for convergent evolution to allow different taxa to perform the same functions in different people, and again we would not expect good predictive performance. The goal is to find a good method that is neither too flexible (too many degrees of freedom) nor too constrained (too few degrees of freedom). A common solution to the problem of over-fitting is to force most of the regression coefficients to be very small by constraining their sum-of-squares or their sum-of-absolute-values to be less than a particular threshold. However, determining the correct threshold requires the use of a nested cross-validation procedure. In this and other recent analyses, we have found that a simple approach to feature selection using the univariate Mann\u2013Whitney U test does a good job of identifying useful predictors without the need for nested cross-validation to tune model parameters.",

Instead, we reasoned that in the absence of sufficient data for determining proper regression coefficients, a good proxy for the strength of an association between a taxon and a clinical phenotype of the host is simply its relative abundance. Therefore, we chose to use the additive risk index as our predictive model, which is equivalent to a linear model in which all of the regression coefficients are 1 (for risk-associated taxa), \u22121 (for protection-associated taxa), or 0 (for taxa not identified as significant using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test). This approach is consistent with the theory of convergent evolution, in which multiple different species may be occupying the same ecological niche in different human individuals, under the assumption that the niche population sizes are relatively consistent across species. Another benefit is that, in contrast to a ratio-based risk index, the additive index can easily produce meaningful scores when a patient is completely lacking either the protection-associated taxa or the risk-associated taxa. It is important to note that the larger the microbiome dataset, the more likely it is that a more complex classifier will provide better predictive accuracy on held-out data. However, many clinical microbiome datasets are still limited in size due to limitations of patient recruitment and funding, in which case the additive risk index may be a useful alternative to more complex and more flexible supervised learning models.",

To the extent that gut microbiome does contribute to BSI risk, future management of patients submitted to HSCT procedure may include administration of microbiome-targeting therapeutics to decrease risk of infectious complications. One obvious strategy would be fecal microbiota transplantation from a healthy donor or even from preserved donation of the patient\u2019s own microbiota. However, this therapeutic approach may lead to exposure to unknown pathogens and/or potential transfer of a risk-associated microbiota, not to mention microbiota that may predispose the recipient to various microbiome-linked diseases [39]. Therefore, we proposed an alternative strategy: to select a consortium of OTUs expected have protective and beneficial effects on the host that could be administered to the patients during the HSCT procedure. A clear next step is to evaluate a consortium of microbial taxa for its ability to prevent or decrease risk of BSI.",

Thus, our BSI risk index prediction may not be generalizable to other chemotherapy regimens, other hematological malignancies, and other immunocompromised patients, although it is suggestive that similar approaches could apply in those populations. The next step will be to validate the performance of the BSI risk index presented here in a larger cohort of patients with other hematological malignancies and receiving different types of chemotherapy regimen. Second, patients received various cancer-specific treatments before HSCT procedure that may affect pre-HSCT microbiome composition, although we did not find an association between clinical history and BSI risk. Third, sequence coverage per sample was somewhat low for one sample (3041 sequences), although a previous study showed that large effects can be recovered with as few as 100 or even 10 sequences per sample [40]. Here we showed that alpha- and beta-diversity findings were retained even when subsampling data were down to very shallow depths of 500 sequences per sample. To avoid throwing out data contained in the higher depth samples for the taxon association and risk index analyses, we used the normalized relative abundances from full-depth samples in place of rarefied data.",
