Here, we show that exposure of affected animals to the whipworm Trichuris trichiura led to clinical improvement in fecal consistency, accompanied by weight gain, in four out of the five treated monkeys. By flow cytometry analysis of pinch biopsies collected during colonoscopies before and after treatment, we found an induction of a mucosal TH2 response following helminth treatment that was associated with a decrease in activated CD4+ Ki67+ cells. In parallel, expression profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays and real-time PCR analysis revealed reductions in TH1-type inflammatory gene expression and increased expression of genes associated with IgE signaling, mast cell activation, eosinophil recruitment, alternative activation of macrophages, and worm expulsion. By quantifying bacterial 16S rRNA in pinch biopsies using real-time PCR analysis, we found reduced bacterial attachment to the intestinal mucosa post-treatment. Finally, deep sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA revealed changes to the composition of microbial communities attached to the intestinal mucosa following helminth treatment. Thus, the genus Streptophyta of the phylum Cyanobacteria was vastly increased in abundance in three out of five ICD monkeys relative to healthy controls, but was reduced to control levels post-treatment; by contrast, the phylum Tenericutes was expanded post-treatment. These findings suggest that helminth treatment in primates can ameliorate colitis by restoring mucosal barrier functions and reducing overall bacterial attachment, and also by altering the communities of attached bacteria. These results also define ICD in monkeys as a tractable preclinical model for ulcerative colitis in which these effects can be further investigated.",

This disease shares many features with ulcerative colitis, which is an autoimmune disease affecting the intestinal tract of humans. Recently, parasitic worms have been used in clinical trials to treat inflammatory bowel diseases in humans with positive results, but very little is known about how worms can improve symptoms. We performed a trial where we treated macaques suffering from chronic diarrhea with human whipworms, collecting gut biopsies before and after treatment. We found that 4 out of the 5 treated macaques improved their symptoms and studied the changes in their gut immune responses, as they got better. We found that after treatment with worms, the monkeys had less bacteria attached to their intestinal wall and a reduced inflammatory response to the gut bacteria. Additionally, the composition of gut bacteria was altered in the sick macaques and was restored close to normal after treatment with whipworms. These results provide a potential mechanism by which parasitic worms may improve the symptoms of intestinal inflammation, by reducing the immune response against intestinal bacteria.",

These studies led to the proposal that the TH2 immune response activated for parasite clearance, as well as the induction of IL-22 expression, may promote mucosal healing in UC patients by increasing mucus production and turnover of intestinal epithelial cells [11]. In a different study, the mucosal responses of celiac disease patients were examined in detail after experimental treatment with human hookworm infection, showing a suppression of TH17 responses and upregulation of IL-22 [13], [14], [15]. This growing body of clinical evidence suggests that a better understanding of mucosal responses activated by helminth infections may contribute to new IBD therapies. Non-rodent, preclinical models of IBD are lacking, and would greatly benefit the development of such novel therapeutics.",

Intestinal inflammatory pathology during ICD can be similar to that found in UC and it has been suggested that ICD may be an informative model for UC [17], [18]. As in the case of UC, inflammation is more severe in the colon than in the jejunum and it has been shown that dysregulation of IL-6-STAT3 activation may be an important inflammatory mediator [19]. In this study, we sought to characterize the mucosal inflammatory response driving ICD in the rhesus monkey, and to determine whether helminth exposure can modulate this inflammatory response and lead to clinical improvement.",

Changes to the intestinal mucosa by helminth infection [21] are likely to have a major impact on the gut microbial environment [11]. H. polygyrus infection has been shown to have major effects on the microbiota of mice, especially increasing the abundance of the Lactobacillaceae family [20]. Colonization of the colon with T. muris has been shown to be dependent on the gut microbiota [22]. Uncultured bacterial communities can now be analyzed using DNA barcoding and deep sequencing approaches to investigate how interactions between communities can influence disease pathogenesis [23], [24]. In a previous cross-sectional study, McKenna et al. investigated the microbiome of healthy macaques in comparison to macaques with chronic diarrhea and after SIV infection [25], finding that bacterial diversity was significantly lower and the family Campylobacteraceae was more common in monkeys with colitis. In this study, we have measured the quantity of attached bacteria to the intestinal mucosa pre-and post-helminth treatment, and further characterized the composition of bacterial communities by deep sequencing in order to determine whether helminth treatment alters the communities of attached bacteria within the intestinal tract of macaques with ICD.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) harvested from colon biopsies were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis (FACS). The proportion of colonic CD4+ T cells producing IL-4, but not those producing IFN\u03b3, was significantly higher (p<0.001) following T. trichiura treatment (Figure 2A), revealing a localized TH2 response. In PBMCs, we did not detect more CD4+ T cells producing IL-4 after treatment (data not shown). All five ICD subjects demonstrated this response, indicating that the lack of clinical improvement in subject TC05 was not due to the absence of a TH2 response. The colonic mucosa of ICD subjects also showed a higher proportion of Ki67+ CD4+ T cells (Figure 2B), indicative of ongoing inflammation. The four clinical responders showed a diminished fraction of such cells following T. trichiura treatment, while their proportion actually increased in subject TC05. The proportion of FoxP3+ CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells was greater in the colonic mucosa of the ICD subjects compared to healthy controls and was markedly reduced in three out of four clinical responders following T. trichiura treatment (Figure 2C). This observation suggests that the local expansion of Tregs in these subjects was reflective of active ongoing inflammation.",

The genes upregulated in ICD samples included classical TH1-type inflammatory mediators such as inducible nitic oxide synthase (NOS2), chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11), and serum amyloid A (SAA1, SAA3, SAA4). IBD-associated genes implicated in mucosal injury and defense [including regenerative factors (REG1, REG3), trefoil peptides (TFF1), and defensins (MNP2, ROAD1, ROAD2)] were also upregulated in ICD samples. This transcriptional signature is consistent with previous studies on UC patients [12], [26] and could be driven by attached mucosal microbiota [26].

Biopsies from each ICD subject demonstrated a higher abundance of multiple taxa compared to healthy controls, revealing a broad increase in bacterial attachment (Figure 5A). Bacterial attachment was reduced following T. trichiura treatment, suggesting that the defective mucosal barrier was partially restored. Surprisingly, the bacterial loads in biopsies from TC05 were only slightly higher than those found in control biopsies and only slightly reduced post treatment, suggesting that increased bacterial attachment may not have driven colitis in this subject. One possibility would be that subject TC05 is more sensitive to bacterial translocation even with small quantities of attached bacteria because of an inherently leaky mucosal barrier. Consistent with this possibility, only TC05 showed an increase in serum soluble CD14 (a correlate of microbial product translocation across the mucosal barrier [30]) following T. trichiura treatment (Figure 5B).",

To investigate the composition of microbial communities attached to the intestinal mucosa through culture-independent methods, deep sequencing analysis was performed on the variable region 4 (V4) region of bacterial 16S rRNA [31]. On average, 8439\u00b11373 (SD) sequences were obtained per sample. The microbial diversity within each sample (\u03b1-diversity) was compared between biopsies taken from control macaques and from macaques pre-treatment and post-treatment by measuring the Shannon index and phylogenetic diversity (PD) through rarefaction curves (Figure 6A and S5). Shannon diversity was higher in samples post-treatment compared to pre-treatment samples [although not statistically significant (P\u200a=\u200a0.0752)] and similar to control samples, suggesting that helminth treatment promoted the restoration of the diversity of mucosal microbial communities.",

We observed clustering of control samples with post-treatment samples and the separation of these samples with pre-treatment samples along the PC2 axis (Figure 6C). Clustering patterns generated with Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) trees were consistent with the PCoA plot (Figure S5). Interestingly, the non-responder TC05 was found to cluster separately from the other macaques both pre- and post-treatment. By overlaying taxonomic information onto the PCoA plot, we could illustrate that the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Tenericutes contribute towards the clustering of control and post-treatment samples, whereas Cyanobacteria contributes towards the clustering of the pre-treatment samples (Figure 6C). Indeed, it was striking to find that in three out of the five macaques pre-treatment samples, the bacterial phylum Cyanobacteria was vastly increased in abundance, representing between 10.8\u201332.9% of total sequences (Figure 6B). Importantly, this taxon is no longer a prominent population post T. trichiura treatment. A single operational taxonomic unit (OTU), most closely related to plastids from plant organisms (Chloroplast: Streptophyta), constituted 99.2\u201399.6% of sequences from the Cyanobacteria phyla. BLASTN analysis of the sequence against the nr (NCBI) nucleotide database confirmed sequence identity with Pinus chloroplast.",

This study revealed that T. trichiura treatment induces a TH2-type immune response in the intestinal mucosa of ICD subjects that was associated with symptomatic improvement. This positive clinical response was inversely correlated with cellular markers of mucosal T cell inflammation, such as Ki67+ T cells. In contrast to the TH2-type response, Treg expansion was noted under conditions of mucosal inflammation and was reduced by T. trichiura treatment, suggesting that the presence of Tregs in the intestinal tract is more indicative of ongoing intestinal inflammation than of helminth exposure. Based on these results, we speculate that T. trichiura promotes mucosal healing in the setting of ICD by activating mucus production and epithelial cell turnover, aspects of TH2-type immunity aimed at expelling the parasite [9], [11], [21], thereby reducing the attachment of immunostimulatory bacteria to the colonic epithelium and restoring diversity to the mucosal micobiota (Figure 8). However, additional studies are needed to determine the mechanism of action for Trichuris-mediated amelioration of colitis, and functional studies to establish causation would have to be performed in a suitable mouse model to confirm these hypotheses.",

Future studies to confirm the findings presented here should have a sham-treated control arm, which would also enable a blinded assessment of stool frequency. The association of clinical improvement with weight gains, which is an objective measure, supports the observation that T. trichiura treatment did lead to improvement in symptoms. Additionally, our transcriptional profiling experiments clearly show that clinical improvement is associated with dramatic changes in mucosal gene expression patterns. The number of biopsies that could be collected from these juvenile macaques also limited our study. Histopathological observations that could be correlated with gene expression patterns would have provided additional insights into the relationship between cellular infiltrates and mucosal responses. While ICD shares some similar features with UC, inflammation is typically microscopic and cannot be determined objectively by visual inspection during endoscopy.",

Importantly, differences in gene expression patterns were apparent between the four clinical responders and the single non-responder in this study. Of note, the non-responder showed lower expression of immunoglobulin-related genes (Figure S4), suggesting that the etiology of disease in this animal may have stemmed from a defect in the mucosal B cell compartment, as has been shown previously to precipitate colitis through the absence of regulatory B cells [37]. Recently, MyD88 signaling in B cells was found to prevent the lethal dissemination of intestinal bacteria after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment in mice [38].",

Unfortunately, our efforts to stain for IL-17- and IL-22-producing CD4+ cells from the macaque pinch biopsies were unsuccessful (data not shown). When we investigated the expression levels of the cytokines in these pathways pre- and post-T. trichiura treatment, we found no significant trends (Figure S7).

Ova were never detected in fecal samples from any of the macaques, indicating the lack of a patent infection, and adult worms were not seen during the post-treatment colonoscopy. The lack of patency is most likely due to a species barrier, since the T. trichiura ova used for inoculation were from a human subject [12]. Notably, this parallels the use of T. suis ova (TSO) as a therapeutic intervention in human subjects with autoimmune diseases, which is dependent on a species barrier to eliminate the parasites after dosing. After hatching, Trichuris larvae molt several times in the intestines before maturing into adult worms. Thus, the larval stages could have elicited a mucosal response leading to a positive clinical outcome. The absence of egg production does not preclude the presence of adult forms or mature larval forms, although none were observed during the endoscopies. Despite the absence of adult forms in humans, TSO clearly induces a strong TH2 response in treated subjects, as indicated by increased serum IL-4, eosinophilia, and IgE antibodies [40], [41]. Although we did not detect more IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells by intracellular cytokine staining in post-treatment PBMCs, this is not indicative that a systemic Th2 response was absent in the macaques. In our previous study [12], responses in PBMCs could only be detected after antigen-specific expansion of CD4+ cells with T. trichiura antigen. We propose that the treatment of colitis (but not necessarily other autoimmune diseases) with Trichuris sp. may be more dependent on a TH2 response than immunoregulation. Since we did not detect ova in the feces of the treated macaques, it is also possible that the clinical improvements were spontaneous and not related to T. trichiura treatment. However, we find this unlikely since the TH2 response in the intestinal mucosa at a cellular and molecular level is remarkably consistent among all of the treated macaques.",

This expansion may reflect a unique environment on the intestinal mucosa of juvenile rhesus monkeys with chronic diarrhea. Notably, a recent publication (including data from the Human Microbiome Project) indicated that, in healthy human beings, the taxon Cyanobacteria\u2236Chloroplast\u2236Streptophyta was enriched in non-mucosal sites relative to mucosal body sites and also enriched under conditions with high oxygen availability [32]. Like Salmonella typhimurium\n[43], perhaps the activation of neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen species favors the expansion of a Cyanobacterium more adapted to an aerobic environment or to alterations in redox conditions. It is also quite possible that these sequences are merely a representation of plant organisms in poorly digested food, which could be more abundantly attached to the mucosa of monkeys suffering from diarrhea.",

Indeed, quantification of absolute Bacteroidetes abundance by RT-PCR clearly shows a reduction post-treatment. These results reflect a typical problem for this type of 16S compositional data of microbial communities. What is more interesting is the unexpected expansion of Tenericutes after helminth exposure, even relative to control macaques, indicating that bacteria of this phylum could be preferentially expanded in a TH2-type mucosal environment. Little is known about the role of Tenericutes in the intestinal tract. In one previous study with mice, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-driven colitis was shown to decrease the abundance of this phylum [44]. Further studies on the relationship between intestinal helminths and Tenericutes are warranted.",

Given the prevalence of ICD at primate research centers, this could be an important resource to develop new therapeutics for IBD in humans, especially when addressing the need of a non-rodent model during preclinical testing. However, the costs and ethical issues of using non-human primates may limit the usefulness of this animal model for IBD research towards very specific circumstances when an outbred non-rodent model is required. While very similar, there are also distinct differences between the macaque immune system and the human immune system [45], [46] that may limit the use of ICD afflicted rhesus macaques as a model for IBD research.",

The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with region specific barcoded primers [51] and sequenced on a MiSeq sequencer [31] along with other barcoded samples. Reads shorter than 140 bp were discarded. The QIIME suite of analysis tools was used to filter and analyze the sequence data [52]. Sequences were assigned to OTUs with a threshold of 97% pair-wise identity and then classified taxonomically using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier. A representative sequence for each OTU was aligned using PyNAST and used to build a phylogenetic tree for \u03b1-diversity and \u03b2-diversity measurements. Alpha rarefaction was performed using the Shannon index and phylogenetic diversity. Beta diversity was calculated in QIIME, using default metrics of weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances between samples, and visualized using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plots and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) trees. Relative abundance of microbial phyla was determined in QIIME by grouping OTUs by macaque sample. To identify significant differences in bacterial taxa between groups, we utilized the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm [32] through the Galaxy Framework [53], [54] online. LEfSe uses the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) sum-rank test to detect features with significantly different abundances between classes, and performs LDA to estimate the effect size of each differentially abundant feature. So that we could recover all features detected by the KW test, we did not set a threshold for LDA in the analysis.",
