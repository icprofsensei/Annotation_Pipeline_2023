A total of 22 Japanese subjects were recruited from our outpatient clinic in an observational study. Fecal samples were obtained from 12 control and 10 type 2 diabetic subjects. 16S rRNA metagenomic data were generated and functional profiles predicted using \u201cPhylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States\u201d software. We measured the parameters of glucose metabolism, gut bacterial taxonomy and functional profile, and examined the associations in a cross-sectional manner. Eleven of 288 \u201cKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes\u201d pathways were significantly enriched in diabetic patients compared with control subjects (p<0.05, q<0.1). The relative abundance of almost all pathways, including the Insulin signaling pathway and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, showed strong, positive correlations with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels. Bacterial taxonomic analysis showed that genus Blautia significantly differed between groups and had negative correlations with HbA1c and FPG levels. Our findings suggest a novel pathophysiological relationship between gut microbial communities and diabetes, further highlighting the significance and utility of combining prediction of functional profiles with ordinal bacterial taxonomic analysis (UMIN Clinical Trails Registry number: UMIN000026592).",

To that end, we assessed the taxonomic and the functional profiles of gut microbiota and evaluated for the first time the correlations between these profiles and glucose metabolism in Japanese diabetic patients, using the recently developed computational prediction from 16S rRNA datasets.",

The genus Blautia is the most major bacterial group in Clostridium coccoides-group that was also found to decrease in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes than control subjects.(9) Accordingly, in Japanese diabetic patients, Blautia may be the genus of which the abundance and/or the number decrease. Further, we found that Insulin signaling pathway and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis, which were upregulated in diabetic patients, showed significantly strong positive correlations with HbA1c. Some of the genes residing in these pathways comprised the enzymes involved in degradation of carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as hexokinase [EC: 2.7.1.1] (K00844),(10) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [EC: 4.1.1.32] (K01596)(11) and acetyl-CoA synthetase [EC: 6.2.1.1] (K01895).(11) Thus, these findings may imply pathophysiological alterations of SCFAs profiles in the gut of diabetic patients, as previously suggested.(1) Regarding other 10 significantly different pathways, the relation with type 2 diabetes is not simply interpreted. Some of them such as Oxidative phosphorylation, Tyrosine metabolism and Drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 suggest the alterations of bacterial metabolism. However, they are still vague to connect with type 2 diabetes. Further studies are needed to clarify the involvement of these pathways in type 2 diabetes.",

In this regard, a recently developed, cost-effective computational prediction from 16S rRNA datasets would be helpful for a combinational evaluation of the functional and taxonomic properties of gut microbiota. Such integrated analysis of ecological and functional dynamics of microbiota would provide valuable insight into preemptive microbiome-based medicine, by identifying the intervention targets for regulating microbial function.",
