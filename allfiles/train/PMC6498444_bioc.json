Although the microbiome plays a role in metabolic disease, there have been no studies measuring the effects of U.S. immigration on the gut microbiome. We collected stool, dietary recalls, and anthropometrics from 514 Hmong and Karen individuals living in Thailand and the U.S., including first- and second-generation immigrants and 19 Karen individuals sampled before and after immigration, as well as from 36 U.S.-born European American individuals. Using 16S and deep shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing, we found that migration from a non-Western country to the U.S. is associated with immediate loss of gut microbiome diversity and function, in which U.S.-associated strains and functions displace native strains and functions. These effects increase with duration of U.S. residence, and are compounded by obesity and across generations.",

Epidemiological evidence has shown that residency in the U.S. increases the risk of obesity and other chronic diseases among immigrants relative to individuals of the same ethnicity that continue to reside in their country of birth, with some groups experiencing up to a four-fold increase in obesity after 15 years (Goel et al., 2004; Lauderdale and Rathouz, 2000). Refugees, in particular, appear to be more vulnerable to rapid weight gain (Heney et al., 2014; Hervey et al., 2009), with Southeast Asian refugees exhibiting the highest average increases in body mass index (BMI) after relocation to the U.S. (Careyva et al., 2015). The Hmong, a minority ethnic group from China who also reside in Southeast Asia, make up the largest refugee group in Minnesota (22,033 total refugees as of 2014) (Minnesota Department of Health; Pfeifer and Thao, 2013). The Karen, an ethnic minority from Burma, have been arriving in large numbers in more recent years (Minnesota Department of Health). Overweight status and obesity rates are highest among Hmong and Karen compared to other Asian ethnic groups in Minnesota (Arcan et al., 2014; Franzen and Smith, 2009; Mulasi-Pokhriyal et al., 2012; Dawson-Hahn et al., 2016). Western diet acculturation, previous exposure to food insecurity, and physical inactivity have been identified as contributing factors (Franzen and Smith, 2009; Mulasi-Pokhriyal et al., 2012) although they do not fully explain risk of obesity.",

Hence, the gut microbiome offers an important window into the consequences of diet and lifestyle changes associated with human migration. To study the short- and long-term impact of migration on the microbiome, we measured gut microbiomes and dietary intake from Hmong and Karen immigrants and refugees (henceforth referred to as immigrants) in cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts undergoing relocation to the U.S., stratified by BMI (high, \u226525 and low, <25). A first-generation immigrant group (foreign-born U.S. residents) included individuals with duration of U.S. residence ranging from a few days to more than 40 years., allowing us to test for changes in the gut microbiome associated with long-term U.S. residence. We included second-generation Hmong immigrants (born in the U.S. to first-generation immigrants) to determine whether the effects of U.S. immigration were compounded across generations by birth in the U.S. Finally, we followed a unique longitudinal cohort of 19 Karen refugees for up to 9 months beginning immediately before or after arrival in the U.S to measure the short-term effects of U.S. immigration.",

We utilized the hierarchical format of food codes derived from the USDA\u2019s Food Nutrient and Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to categorize foods into a tree structure where more closely related foods were grouped together (Figure 1C). These groupings allowed us to share statistical strength across closely related foods to complement dietary analysis of macronutrients, much in the way that phylogenetic beta-diversity analysis complements taxonomy-based profiles of microbiomes. Foods reported by participants that were not found in any USDA database (n = 72, Table S3) were manually inserted into the hierarchical food tree, allowing us to account for all foods reported by all participants. We confirmed our ability to discriminate between the Karen1st, Hmong1st, and Hmong2nd group diets using tree-based distances (Figure S1B), identifying a stark increase in the variety of foods eaten by second-generation Hmong relative to Hmong in Thailand (Figure 1C) (t-test of phylogenetic diversity P = 4.828e-10).",

We aligned shotgun metagenomic sequences against all 256 Bacteroides genomes and 153 Prevotella genomes in RefSeq version 87 (O\u2019Leary et al., 2016), retaining any strains with at least 50% genome coverage in at least one sample. We found that U.S. Controls had varied Bacteroides strain profiles, while those with Prevotella had only a single strain of P. copri (Figure 3B). Conversely, Thailand-based individuals carried up to 4 strains of Prevotella, with low abundance and generally low genomic coverage of Bacteroides strains, possibly due to lack of related strains in the database. Long-term U.S.-resident Hmong displayed an intermediate profile, carrying a variety of Bacteroides strains and, in several individuals, multiple Prevotella strains. Prevalence-abundance curves for the Bacteroides and Prevotella strains with the largest change in overall prevalence between HmongThai and Hmong1st showed marked loss of Prevotella strains accompanied by an expansion of pre-existing low-abundance Bacteroides strains following U.S. immigration (Figure S2B).",

First-generation Hmong harbored microbiomes with increased capacity for sucrose degradation, glycerol degradation, glucose/xylose degradation, and glucose fermentation to lactate, potentially related to increased consumption of more sugary foods, although most sucrose and glucose would not be expected to reach the lower GI tract (Dahlqvist and Thomson, 1963). In HmongThai, we found an enrichment of pathways relating to the degradation of complex carbohydrates, including \u03b2-(1,4)-mannan degradation and starch degradation (Flint et al., 2012). In order to better understand the substrates degraded by these pathways that either are lost or below the detection limit in U.S. immigrants, we assembled the shotgun data into scaffolds and annotated carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CAZymes) (Lombard et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2012). We found significant shifts in abundance of 58 CAZymes across the HmongThai, Hmong1st, and Control groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, FDR-corrected q < 0.05, Figure 3C), including three beta-glucan-targeting glycoside hydrolases (GH17, GH64, GH87) that were highly abundant in the Thailand group but almost entirely unobserved in the U.S. groups. Loss of these glycoside hydrolases may be associated with loss of dietary fiber sources that promote persistence of the organisms that harbor these enzymes, reducing the ability of the microbiota to degrade these dietary fibers.",

We also observed a loss of GH5 and GH26 glycoside hydrolases from HmongThai to Hmong1st and U.S. controls, which indicates a loss of cellulose, beta-mannan and possible xyloglucan degradative potential. Beta-mannans are present in seeds, kernels, and corms, such as palm (Subrahmanyan et al., 1956), coconut (Kooiman, 1971), and konjac (Pangsri et al., 2015), and xyloglucan is found most abundantly in tamarind (Mishra and Malhotra, 2009), which, interestingly, are food ingredients prevalent in Southeast Asia. The loss of glycoside hydrolases for degrading cellulose, a plant cell-wall component, ws another indication that the microbiota of post-immigration individuals had lost some of their ability to degrade plant-derived fibers (El Kaoutari et al., 2013). These findings parallel previous findings in a mouse model demonstrating that the microbiomes of mice deprived of dietary fiber lost the capability to produce certain glycoside hydrolases (Sonnenburg et al., 2016).",

PCoA of diet-based unweighted UniFrac (Lozupone et al., 2011) revealed distinct separation by sample group (ANOSIM R=0.29, P=0.001, Figure 4B) and a gradient of dietary acculturation along PC1 (Table S6). First- and second-generation Hmong had similar food choice profiles (Figure 4B), while U.S. controls shared few foods with other groups and consumed almost tenfold less white rice than other groups (Figure S5).

Thus, we found that diet was likely not the sole contributor to the observed gut microbiome changes in our cohort, although it is possible that dietary variation explains substantially more microbiome variation in this cohort than we are able to determine due to our limited knowledge of precise polysaccharide and other nutrient content of the foods, and due to complex individualized diet-microbiome interactions.",

Conversely, gut biodiversity, as measured by Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity, was negatively correlated with PC1 (\u2374 = \u22120.34, p < 3.19e-09, Figure 5B), even while controlling for BMI in the Hmong (multiple linear regression, Years in US \u03b2 = \u22120.18, P = 0.0275, Figure 5C). We note that age was highly correlated with years in the U.S. in the Hmong1st group (Pearson correlation \u03c1 = .444, P = 4.5e\u22129), and therefore age is also strongly correlated with loss of diversity (multiple linear regression, Age \u03b2 = \u2212.38, P = 2.2e\u22126). Age was not significantly correlated with diversity in any of the other groups (Pearson correlation HmongThai P = .065, Hmong2nd P = .79, Control P = .37). Thus, we found evidence that increased duration of U.S. residence is associated with decreased microbiome diversity, but that further study is needed to separate the effects of age and duration of U.S. residence.",

However, we used the European American group as a control group to test for association of age with similarity to the HmongThai reference group and found no association (P = 0.57) (Figure S6A), and the B:P ratio in first-generation immigrants was significantly associated with years in the U.S. regardless of age (multiple linear regression, Years in US \u03b2 = 0.096, P = 0.0094; Age \u03b2 = 0.039, P = 0.0065) (Figure S6B).

This is in contrast to the Hmong1st group whose diet diversity tended to increase following U.S. immigration (Figure S7B). Hmong participants\u2019 diets may be more acculturated due to the longer duration of residence of the Hmong community (mean time U.S. residence 20.2 years among study participants) when compared to the Karen community (mean time U.S. residence 1.9 years among study participants). Hmong1st diets tend to be more similar on average than the Karen1st diets to the European American diets (t-test of mean tree-based diet distance to European American group P = 0.028). We again observed the displacement of Prevotella by Bacteroides (paired t-test, P=0.0013, Figure 7D) within this longitudinal cohort, in many cases involving a ten-fold increase in the Bacteroides-Prevotella ratio, indicating that microbiome westernization begins immediately after arrival to the U.S.",

In multi-ethnic, multi-generational cohorts of immigrants and refugees, we observed that gut microbiome diversity, function, and strain composition are strongly impacted by U.S. immigration and that both short-term and long-term U.S. residence as well as being born in the U.S. shift an individual\u2019s microbiome along an axis toward a more Westernized state. Even a short period of residence in the U.S. was sufficient to induce pronounced increases, in some cases over ten-fold, in the ratio of Bacteroides to Prevotella. Metagenome assembly showed that the observed loss of Prevotella strains was associated with loss of carbohydrate-active enzymes dominant in the gut microbiota, including a near-complete loss of certain beta-glucanases and other glycoside hydrolases that break down specific dietary fibers. Previous studies have demonstrated intergenerational effects of microbiome perturbations in animal models. These include loss of microbiota carbohydrate degradation function following removal of dietary fiber (Sonnenburg et al., 2016) and intergenerational loss of diversity following antibiotic perturbation (Schulfer et al., 2018). The data presented here extend these findings to humans by providing evidence that compounded intergenerational loss of taxonomic and functional diversity is occurring in U.S. immigrant populations, supporting the model of disappearing human microbiota proposed by Blaser and Falkow (Blaser and Falkow, 2009).",

Although we observed clear patterns of dietary acculturation associated with U.S. residence, dietary variation only partly explained microbiome variation across individuals. Interestingly, the diets of second-generation immigrants remained quite distinct from the Controls, while their microbiomes do not. It is possible that different diets are driving the microbiome toward a similar state; an alternative explanation is that a limited set of metabolic capabilities in the microbiome are transmitted from one generation to the next, resulting in decreased overall functionality with each successive generation, consistent with the \u201cdisappearing microbiota\u201d model.",

Our inclusion criteria for controls included European American females at least 18 years of age who were born in the U.S. and whose parents and grandparents were also born in the U.S. Our exclusion criteria consisted of use of any antibiotics in the previous 6 months, current use of probiotic supplements, known presence of gastrointestinal, cancer, immunodeficiency or autoimmune disorders, adults lacking capacity to consent, or pregnancy. Additionally, control subjects could not have traveled outside of the U.S. within the last 12 months. We recruited using multiple methods which included flyers, emails, social media, oral presentations, tabling, letters followed by phone calls to West Side Community Health Services (West Side) patients who met criteria, and by word of mouth. We recruited throughout the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area at local community centers, faith-based organizations, adult education centers, health care centers, and health fairs. We recruited in Thailand at Khun Chang Khian (KCK), a rural Hmong village located one hour from Chiang Mai city, as well as from Mae La (ML) Camp, a Burmese refugee camp in Tak province located on the Myanmar-Thailand border (Figure S1).

SoLaHmo is a multi-ethnic, community-driven CBPAR program of West Side Community Health Services, Inc., whose mission is to build upon the unique cultural strengths of ethnic communities to promote health and wellness through research, education and policy. All SoLaHmo members are trained in qualitative research processes using a previously developed training curriculum (Allen et al., 2011). In addition, all phases of our project were further guided by community advisory boards (CABs) composed of Hmong and Karen health professionals and community experts. The study design, recruitment methods and strategies, and dissemination of results were developed in partnership with both academic and community researchers, and through multiple discussions with the CABs. As noted in Results, we learned from the Hmong CAB and research team members that substantially more Hmong women than men were relocating to U.S. in recent years. Thus, to ensure feasibility of recruitment for this study we limited our population to women. In Thailand, we used a modified CPBAR approach in that Thai community researchers were members of the communities that we worked with, and were trained with qualitative research methods, recruitment, and sample and data collection, but were not directly involved with study design. We note that Hmong refugee camps have long been closed (Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, 2004), hence Hmong in Khun Chang Khian are not refugees but serve as acceptable pre-immigration representatives available for US-based Hmong.",

We first filtered for reads with at least 100 exact duplicates as representative sequences, and assigned taxonomy by alignment at 0% to the NCBI RefSeq 16s reference database (O\u2019Leary et al., 2016) using the BURST (Al-Ghalith and Knights, 2017) OTU-picking algorithm in CAPITALIST mode, which ensures optimal alignment of sequences and minimizes the set of aligned reference genomes. All original sequences were then re-aligned with BURST (Al-Ghalith and Knights, 2017) in CAPITALIST mode at 98% identity against this representative set, resulting in 93.54% of all available sequences aligned. Singleton OTUs and samples with depth less than 2,143 were removed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software package (Caporaso et al., 2010). Using QIIME, we measured within-sample biodiversity (alpha diversity) with rarefied OTU tables (at 2,143 sequences/sample) using whole-tree phylogenetic diversity (Faith, 1992) and a custom generated phylogeny constructed with the representative sequences using aKronyMer (Al-Ghalith and Knights, 2018). To quantify differences in composition between subjects, we calculated the phylogeny-based UniFrac distance (Lozupone et al., 2011) between all pairs of samples. To visualize between-subject differences (beta diversity) and to obtain principal components for subsequent statistical testing, we performed dimensionality reduction using principal coordinates analysis (Caporaso et al., 2010). Aitchison\u2019s distances were calculated by first imputing zeros from an abundance OTU table, then applying a centered log ratio transform using the robCompositions R package (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Buccianti, 2011). To enable tests for shifts in the relative abundances of Bacteroides and Prevotella, we collapsed the reference-based OTUs according to taxonomy at the genus level. P-values, sample numbers, and names of statistical tests are provided in the main text and figure legends for Figures 2A, 2B, 3A, 3C, 4A, 4B, 5A-C, 6A-C, 7A-D.",
