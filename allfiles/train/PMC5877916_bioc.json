Patients who met criteria for highest level critical trauma activation were eligible for inclusion in the study. For injured patients who required admission to the ICU (n=12), additional stool samples were collected at 24\u2009hours and/or 72\u2009hours, with informed consent obtained from the patient or their medical decision maker in accordance with the CHR-approved protocol. All samples had to yield visible amounts of stool to be included; if no visible stool was present at the time of presentation (0\u2009hour), patients were not included in the study. If patients were transferred out of the ICU to lower acuity units prior to 72\u2009hours after admission, they were excluded from analysis. Thus, patients who were injured but not admitted to the ICU for at least 72\u2009hours were excluded from analysis. Patients with isolated traumatic brain injury were excluded. Patients with activated trauma found to be uninjured, with Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 0 or 1 and length of stay less than 1\u2009day, served as controls (n=10). Comprehensive demographic, injury, clinical and outcomes data were prospectively collected on all included patients.",

This understanding has led to promising diagnostic and even therapeutic modalities; perhaps the most widely recognized application is that of fecal transplant in colitis due to Clostridium difficile.19 Still, our understanding of such processes remains in its incipient stages, and has yet to be thoroughly examined in trauma populations. Culture-based studies have indicated that critical illness may correlate to significant alterations in microbial populations,13 a view that has been supported by increasing numbers of culture-independent investigations.14 20 One recent study of burn injury in both animal models and humans suggests that significant restructuring of the microbiome occurs after burn, and may contribute to increased rates of clinical sepsis.21 A recent case series demonstrated that in severe burn victims, initially pathogenic changes in the gut microbiota were reversed in survivors, indicating an association between regeneration of \u2018healthy\u2019 microbial communities with survival.22 Another animal investigation demonstrated that altering the gut microbiome led to significant changes in inflammatory responses to remote organ injury (specifically, ischemia reperfusion in lung), thus implicating intestinal microbiota as critical in the response to sterile inflammatory injury.23 Fecal transplant in murine mouse model has been shown to restore mucosal integrity,24 which has been posited by others as a possible strategy for preventing gut translocation and associated sepsis in surgical patients who are critically ill.25 The emerging understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and inflammation26\u201328 represents an area of clear relevance and critical importance to trauma and critical care. To date, however, no dedicated study has prospectively investigated changes in the microbiome in a critically injured trauma population.",

As a pilot investigation, this study has limitations, the most critical of which is sample size. Though all critical trauma activation patients were initially eligible for inclusion, the number who had visible stool on initial digital rectal examination and who remained in the ICU for 72\u2009hours constituted a small subset. Our findings here present the initial analysis of a growing cohort, and must be interpreted with the number of included patients in mind. Several critical questions, especially those regarding our initial secondary hypotheses as to clinical course and outcomes, will require significantly more patients before any definitive conclusions can be drawn. In particular, the known influence of antibiotics on diversity changes should be analyzed given our initial findings in this cohort, and should be extrapolated from the influence of injury independent of antimicrobial administration. This represents an area of ongoing investigation in our group. Also, though data in this study were collected prospectively, the findings in this cohort should be interpreted as correlative and not necessarily causal. In addition, the finding of significant beta-diversity differences was identified by one analytic approach (weighted UniFrac) but not others; future studies would of course be strengthened if multiple analyses yielded statistically significant results.",
