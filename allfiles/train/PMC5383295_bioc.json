Laboratory simulations also provide evidence that many microorganisms can survive on office paper [22], coins [23] and banknotes of various materials [19, 24].

As such, $1 bills can be considered a highly trafficked surface that experiences frequent human contact, and were chosen for this study on this basis. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we characterized and compared the diversity found on $1 bills obtained from a bank in the heart of Manhattan, and tested whether viable microbes could be cultured from them in vitro.

In part two, we collected $1 bills from the same bank six months later to compare the monetary microbial communities over time.

Human sequences were the most abundant, representing about half of the high-quality reads in each method (Fig 2A). Of the non-human reads nearly three quarters (73.9%) of the unassembled ones had no match in GenBank; bacterial reads were next most abundant (16.8%), followed by non-human eukaryotes (7.1%), viruses, and archaea (both < 1%) (Fig 2B). In the assembled data, eukaryotes represented the largest nonhuman category (41.2%), followed by unclassified reads (32%), bacteria (29%), viruses, and archaea (both again <1%) (Fig 2B). The assembled data identified far fewer bacterial taxa at the species level (2,115 unique species with at least one hit) than the unassembled data (7,580 unique species with at least one hit); however, the difference shrinks (385 vs. 512) after abundance filtering to \u2265 0.005% (~81% of total bacterial reads in each method), with 270 species (43.1%) overlapping (Fig 2C). As the de novo metagenomic assembly approach provides longer sequences for more robust classification, and read abundance in the contigs can be used to properly weight proportions, our subsequent analyses focused on results obtained with this method.",

DNA from these bills was pooled into one sample for library preparation and subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing, generating 476,898,204 reads. Both the February and June 2013 read sets (referred to henceforth as Winter and Summer) contain matches to prokaryotes, eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses. In both sets the number of archaeal and viral sequences detected was low (< 1%), and were not analyzed further. Human sequences were the most abundant in the Winter data (56.4%), but were much less abundant in the Summer data (39%) (Fig 3A). At both time points eukaryotes represent the largest portion of non-human reads, albeit much smaller in Winter (41.2%) than Summer (67.4%; Fig 3B). Metazoan BLAST matches were the dominant group in Summer, with top hits to Equus caballus (horse, 49%), followed by Sus scrofa (wild boar, 6%), and Canus lupis (grey wolf, 2%). Although these are the top-ranking BLAST hits, Sus scrofa and Canus lupis are likely artifacts of Genbank and represent the presence of other eukaryotic genomes that are more prevalent in an urban environment (e.g. dogs and domestic pigs). Equus caballus was also the most abundant taxon in Winter (3.5%) followed two fungal species Aspergillus niger (1%) and Wallemia sebi (1%), both of which are commonly found in indoor environments, and associated with contaminated food [28\u201330]. For bacterial reads the opposite was true, with Winter bills yielding a higher proportion than Summer (Fig 3B).",

As expected based on the distribution of the BLAST results (Fig 3B), many more bacterial taxa were present in Winter (385 species total) than in Summer (149 species total), with 137 found in both.",

The most abundant bacterial species in both datasets was Propionibacterium acnes, one of the most common among the skin microbial community; however, it was much more abundant in Summer (83%) than in Winter (51%). Other human-associated taxa among the most abundant species at both time points include a common skin bacterium, Staphylococcus epidermis; several oral taxa such as Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus oralis and Rothia (R. mucilaginosa, dentocariosa) [32]; gut and oral commensal Veillonella parvula [33]; vaginally associated Corynebacterium aurimucosum [34]; and Acinetobacter baumannii, an opportunistic human pathogen [35]. Highly abundant taxa in both time points not directly associated with humans include Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, microbes typically associated with dairy production and fermentation [36]. The majority of the other abundant bacteria at both time points are common skin and oral flora. Exceptions to this include Gardnerella vaginalis, found only in the most abundant taxa of Winter (Fig 4A), and Xanthomonas campestris, a bacterial plant pathogen that is also used to produce xanthan gum, found only in Summer [37] (Fig 4B).",

To determine whether viable microbes could be isolated from money, we collected two additional sets of 20 $1 bills in September and October of 2013 (referred to henceforth as Culture 1 and Culture 2), swabbed the bills, plated the swab eluent on agar plates under sterile conditions, and incubated them at 37\u00b0C. Colonies appeared on all plates after 24 hours, and DNA was extracted and pooled into one sample per set of 20 bills after three days. We characterized the colonies by DNA sequencing and annotation, using the same quality control and assembly analysis methods described above (Fig 1). After abundance filtering we identified 102 bacterial species in Culture 1 and 212 species in Culture 2, far less than the Winter sequence-based characterization (385 species). The Summer sequence-based characterization identified more bacterial species (149) than Culture 1 but less than Culture 2, likely due to the significantly lower proportion of bacterial reads observed in the Summer dataset (Fig 3B). Of the 549 unique bacterial species identified in this study only 18 were observed in all four datasets, and only one, Micrococcus luteus, had a relative abundance above 1% (mean 2.3%) in all four experiments (Fig 5, S1 Table). Other taxa common to all four experiments include human-associated Staphylococcus (mean 3.95%), along with taxa not associated with humans, including soil taxon Kocuria rhizophila (mean 0.60%) (S1 Table).",

Eighteen of the 20 bacteria taxa cultured in these studies were also found in our study, representing between 11\u201372% of the total bacterial reads for each time point. The majority of these taxa were identified at low levels in our dataset, particularly in our cultures where less than ten would have survived the abundance filtering step, but this could be due to the differences in culturing techniques, composition, and age of the bills used, or the use of sequence versus. morphological identification [41, 42].",

We expected to detect high levels of human DNA on currency; however, we found much less than might be expected, particularly in the Summer bills. However, these bills also had a much higher proportion of non-human eukaryotic DNA, with high incidences of E. caballus (horse), S. scrofa (wild boar), and C. lupis (grey wolf). Although these are the top-ranking matches for these reads it is highly unlikely that wild boars and wolves are present in New York City. More likely, these are false positives generated by best-hit analysis and represent the presence of other mammalian species that are more prevalent in urban environments. This DNA may be left on bills through skin-mediated contact or environmental exposure during activities such as visiting parks, paying for meals or having pets at home. The higher occurrence of these species on money in Summer could reflect a seasonal increase in these activities, many of which take place outdoors during warmer months, while bills collected in Winter show higher levels of common indoor fungi.",

In agreement with previous studies, the most abundant taxon was P. acnes, which is commonly found on sebaceous (oily) areas of the skin, such as the face [45, 46]. The prevalence of human-associated taxa on paper money is unsurprising, as many previous studies have shown that the microbial communities of common surfaces closely resemble those of the human body parts that contact them [13, 47, 48]. We also observed high abundances of oral- and food-associated bacterial taxa on bills at both time points, further suggesting that actions performed before and during handling, such as face-touching, eating, or finger-licking prior to counting may influence community composition.",

However, we detected some taxa with potential implications for human health. Most were present at very low abundance, except G. vaginalis, which is associated with disruption of the vaginal flora/vaginosis, and A. baumannii, an opportunistic pathogen with a high incidence of multidrug resistant strains [35]. These taxa were more abundant in the Winter bills than the Summer ones, which could reflect biogeographic and/or seasonal patterns in the health of the individuals who handled the bills, highlighting the potential use of money as a fomite to map public health trends.",

DNA from the ten swabs was concentrated post-extraction using a SpeedVac (Savant) and subsequently pooled for optimal biomass recovery.
