However, for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u2013infected women, breast milk is a vehicle for transmission of HIV. It is estimated that 14% of HIV-exposed, breastfed infants acquire HIV through this route, in the absence of antiretroviral prophylaxis [2]. Although, maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) and infant prophylaxis have dramatically decreased mother-to-child transmission, around 160,000 infants still acquired HIV in 2016 [3]. However, since nonexclusive breastfeeding increases mortality and morbidity, counteracting the decrease in HIV transmission [4], current guidelines advise breastfeeding during maternal ART in developing settings.",

This is somewhat counterintuitive, since infants fed supplemental foods likely consume lower volumes of HIV-containing breast milk than EBF infants. Previous studies have reported lower cell-free viral loads in breast milk of mothers who EBF compared to NEBF [6] and possibly decreased risk of mastitis with EBF [7]. Breast milk immunoglobulins capable of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity may assist in prevention of HIV transmission [8]. An alternative hypothesis that nonexclusive breastfeeding increases translocation of microbes across the gastrointestinal mucosa into systemic circulation has shown conflicting results [9, 10]. Recently, NEBF infants in Uganda had higher levels of gut-homing T cells, although the cause of this increase was not identified [11]. To date, no study has systematically examined infant factors that influence susceptibility to HIV.",

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare bacterial relative abundance agglomerated at a specified taxonomic rank and test for significance of \u03b1-diversity comparisons. For \u03b2-diversity comparison, we used ADONIS on community distance matrices (Weighted Unifrac and Jensen-Shannon) to compare intra- vs inter-category distance. A permutational analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare nested models of constrained combinations of principal components. Mantel and partial Mantel tests were conducted using the vegan package within R by measuring Pearson correlations between community distance matrices (weighted Unifrac and Jensen-Shannon) against a distance matrix of expression frequencies of cellular markers. A third distance matrix of infant ages was used to remove spurious correlations that arose from ontogeny. In all cases, weighted UniFrac distance matrices were permuted to maintain correlation structure between that matrix and the second matrix. A total of 999 permutations were used to calculate the P values with an alpha of .05. Differentially abundant taxa were determined using the DESeq2 package [27].",

Therefore, buccal mucosal barrier integrity is likely crucial in prevention of oral HIV transmission. In HIV-exposed women, the presence of elevated genital inflammation, the site of viral exposure, increases the risk of HIV acquisition [31]. The mechanism by which inflammation mediates increased HIV risk is likely complex but is thought to be mediated by recruitment and/or activation of HIV target cells, paired with compromise of mucosal barrier function, thus allowing ready access of virions to target cells [32]. In the genital tract of women at high risk for HIV with elevated mucosal cytokine levels, Arnold et al found significantly elevated cytoskeletal proteins, suggesting epithelial barrier compromise as a potential mechanism for cytokine-associated increased mucosal HIV risk [33]. Here, we observed increases in chemokines and chemokine receptors as well as cytoskeletal proteins in the buccal mucosa of NEBF infants, suggesting analogous mechanisms are at play.",

Immune quiescence in systemic circulation confers protection from HIV transmission [34]. While immune activation is important in protection against most pathogens, HIV preferentially infects activated CD4+ T cells [35]. In highly HIV-exposed adults, differences in circulating activated CD4+ T-cell frequencies of under 1% were associated with protection from HIV infection [34]. Here, we found 12% fewer HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells in EBF infants compared to NEBF infants. Whether T-cell activation measured in blood indicates similar activation at the mucosa or whether it is an independent risk factor for HIV transmission remains to be determined. Although we did not measure HIV target cells at the mucosa, higher buccal mucosal transcript levels of chemokines capable of attracting T cells in NEBF infants suggest that these cells are likely homing to this site. Consistent with this, increased CD4+CCR5+ cells expressing the mucosal homing marker \u03b27 were present in Ugandan NEBF infants, providing evidence that nonexclusive breastfeeding increases HIV target cells at mucosal sites [11].",

The gut microbiota is known to drive immune development in animal models [38, 39], and alterations in early infant gut microbiota have profound, lasting effects on T-cell development in mice [40]. Here, in human infants, we demonstrate that exclusive breastfeeding is associated with lower activation of CD4+ T cells and that the level of T-cell activation correlates with shifts in gut microbiota. The relative abundance of a few key taxa was strongly correlated with CD4+HLA-DR+ T-cell frequency, further implicating the gut microbiota in mediating the observed changes in T-cell activation. Relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin-loving bacterium that is believed to be a healthy commensal in the adult gut but has been found more frequently in the gut of formula-fed infants [41], was strongly positively associated with levels of T-cell activation. Conceivably, its mucin-degrading properties could allow dysbiotic bacteria to encounter host cells more readily due to a compromised mucous layer, thereby causing inflammation in the NEBF infant gut. On the other hand, certain taxa were strongly related to relative immune quiescence, which may have potential as therapeutic interventions. These bacteria include P. agglomerans, a gram-negative symbiont that supports Lactobacilli [42] and is currently under study as an immune modulator for various indications [43], and Bifidobacterium bifidum, which, in combination with other bacteria, shifted the \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity closer, albeit not completely, toward that of EBF infants in a recent randomized control trial [44]. Finally, high relative abundance of S. lactarius was significantly associated with both exclusive breastfeeding and immune quiescence, further confirming the relationships between gut microbiota, peripheral immune activation, and feeding practices.",

Indeed, our findings support a model in which breast milk, when given exclusively, may regulate the composition of gut microbiota, stimulating growth of bacteria that support the development of T-cell subsets that are antiinflammatory. Exclusive breastfeeding may also maintain an intact epithelial barrier with low levels of chemokine and chemokine receptor expression and cellular turnover, thus avoiding recruitment of activated HIV target cells to the oral mucosa. In turn, EBF infants have fewer circulating, and likely mucosal, activated HIV target cells, which reduces their susceptibility to HIV infection. Future interventions to mitigate the risks of nonexclusive breastfeeding could include manipulation of microbial communities through anti-, pre-, or probiotics. Given the relationships between P. agglomerans, S. lactarius, and B. bifidusand T-cell quiescence, one potential intervention could be to trial these as biotherapeutics to mitigate T-cell activation during mixed feeding.",
