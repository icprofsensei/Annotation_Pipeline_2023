However, there are insufficient data on the use of microbial signatures as prognostic biomarkers to predict respiratory disease outcomes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether specific bacterial community compositions in the nasopharynx of children at the time of hospitalization are associated with different influenza clinical outcomes. We utilized retrospective nasopharyngeal (NP) samples (n=36) collected at the time of hospital arrival from children who were infected with influenza virus and had been symptomatic for less than 2 days. Based on their clinical course, children were classified into two groups: patients with mild influenza, and patients with severe respiratory or neurological complications. We implemented custom 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic sequencing and computational analysis workflows to classify the bacteria present in NP specimens at the species level. We found that increased bacterial diversity in the nasopharynx of children was strongly associated with influenza severity. In addition, patients with severe influenza had decreased relative abundance of Staphylococcus aureus and increased abundance of Prevotella (including P. melaninogenica), Streptobacillus, Porphyromonas, Granulicatella (including G. elegans), Veillonella (including V. dispar), Fusobacterium and Haemophilus in their nasopharynx. This pilot study provides proof-of-concept data for the use of microbial signatures as prognostic biomarkers of influenza outcomes. Further large prospective cohort studies are needed to refine and validate the performance of such microbial signatures in clinical settings.",

While most of the children develop uncomplicated influenza illness, between 1.5 to 4\u200a% of infected children are hospitalized for influenza complications [1] including pneumonia, asthma exacerbations, neurological complications and death [2]. Risk factors for hospital admission in children include age <2\u2009years and having underlying medical conditions (such as neurological disorders, prematurity, immunosuppression, diabetes, or sickle cell disease) [3]. However, about half of paediatric hospitalizations from seasonal influenza occur in children without a high-risk medical condition [4].",

As a proof-of-concept, we utilized NP specimens from a retrospective collection of influenza-positive samples from children infected with influenza virus with different disease outcomes, mild or severe, and tested whether specific bacterial species in the nasopharynx of patients at the time of hospitalization correlated with influenza disease severity. We determined a differential microbial signature discriminating patients with severe and mild influenza. Such a signature could be used as a prognostic biomarker for early diagnosis of severe influenza.",

Patients had been symptomatic for less than 2\u2009days before hospital admission. None of the patients received antibiotics for up to 3 weeks before sample collection. After sampling, severe patients were treated pre-emptively. The demographics and clinical parameters of the 36 patients are summarized in Table 1 (baseline characteristics for Table 1a and follow-up characteristics for Table 1b). Among the patients who developed severe influenza, 4 patients had severe respiratory complications requiring ventilatory support and hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU), and 10 patients had neurological complications requiring hospitalization in the ICU (n=6 from 10; 60\u200a%) or in other units. The most common neurological complications were coma (n=4 from 10; 40\u200a%) and epilepsy (n=5 from 10; 50\u200a%). The average time of hospitalization was similar among the two severe groups (7.4 and 9.8\u2009days for the patients with neurological and respiratory complications, respectively). Patients with mild influenza were either discharged or hospitalized in emergency short-stay units. Their median time of hospitalization of 1 day corresponds to a monitoring of more than 6\u2009h in emergency service, which is considered in France to be a hospitalization. Because of the insufficiently large number of patients included, no age- and sex-matched analyses could be performed on this cohort with adequate power. As the respiratory microbiome changes with age and sex [18], our results have been adjusted for these parameters in the rest of the study using multivariate analysis (see the Methods section). Finally, cycle threshold (Ct) values from influenza real-time RT-PCR, as described in the Methods section, were used as a proxy measure of viral load and were not significantly different between the groups, suggesting that there is no relationship between initial viral load and disease outcome, as previously described [6].",

All OTUs were classified up to the genus level and 49\u200a% were classified up to the species level. The relative abundance is given for all 300 OTUs in each sample (Fig. 1a). Five OTUs dominated the NP bacterial profiles (defined as a relative abundance >50\u200a% in at least one sample). Among these five OTUs, the genera were Moraxella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Haemophilus (Fig. 1b). Moraxella catharrhalis was found as the dominant species in 11 out of 36 samples (30\u200a%). Moraxella nonliquefaciens was also detected and was the dominant species in four samples. Staphylococcus aureus was the dominant species in two samples. OTU_4 was only classified to the genus level \u2013 Streptococcus \u2013 and was the dominant species in five samples. Finally, OTU_5 (Haemophilus) was the dominant OTU in four samples. In the remaining 10 (28\u200a%) samples, there was more than one dominant OTU: for three samples, there were two major OTUs (with a relative abundance of between 25 and 50\u200a%), and for seven samples the bacterial profiles were more complex. Importantly, the presence of a dominant OTU was not significantly associated with influenza outcomes after adjustment with covariates (Table S1). To validate the bacteria taxonomy classifications inferred from the 16S ribosomal profiling, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on a subset of NP specimens obtained from patients with mild (n=10) and severe (n=10) influenza. Comparable bacterial compositions were found in the 16S targeted sequencing and shotgun metagenomic datasets (Fig. S2).",

This analysis revealed that differences in NP microbiota composition were strongly associated with influenza outcomes (P-value=0.00025) (Fig. 2 and Table S2). Similarly, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the samples based on whole-microbiota profiles, was able to segregate mild and severe cases, with all but one patient with mild influenza belonging in the first cluster, and all but four patients with severe influenza belonged in the second cluster (Fig. S3). The age of the patients was also associated with NP microbiota composition in PerMANOVA analysis (P-value=0.03450), but less strongly than influenza outcome. There was no evidence of significant interaction between age and clinical outcome in terms of an effect on NP microbiota composition (Table S2). Finally, we tested whether there was a difference in microbiota composition between patients with respiratory or neurological complications. After adjusting for covariates, the type of severe influenza complication was not significantly associated with whole-microbiota profiles (Table S3).",

Using multiway ANOVA, we found that NP microbiota diversity, as estimated by the Shannon diversity index (H), ACE, Chao1, Fisher and Simpson indices, was strongly associated with influenza outcome (Table S4). Simpson\u2019s reciprocal index was the only one that was not significantly associated with influenza outcome (Table S4). This observation could be linked to the size of the cohort, with this index being the most sensitive to a lack of power. Patients with mild influenza had significantly lower bacterial diversity (average H=0.57) than patients with severe influenza (average H=2.03). The NP microbiota diversity was weakly associated with patient age (Table S4). There was no evidence of significant interaction between age and clinical outcome, in terms of an effect on NP microbiota diversity (Table S4). In addition, there was no significant difference in microbiota diversity between patients with neurological and respiratory complications (Table S5). Overall, we found that increased bacterial diversity in the upper respiratory tract was associated with influenza severity.",

Twelve OTUs were found to be differentially abundant between the two groups of patients (Fig. 4a). The average abundance in each group for the 12 differential OTUs is given Table 2. Among the differential OTUs, one was among the five most abundant OTUs detected in the respiratory microbiome profiles: Staphylococcus aureus was more abundant in patients with mild influenza than in patients with severe influenza (Table 2). The remaining 11 differential OTUs had limited abundance (<3\u200a% on average) and were all more abundant in patients with severe influenza. The genera of these 11 OTUs were: Prevotella for two of them, Streptobacillus, Porphyromonas and Veillonella for three of them, and Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Lachnospiracea incertae sedis and Granulicatella. Some of these OTUs were detected almost exclusively in patients with severe influenza, for example Porphyromonas (OTU_31) was detected in 11 (76\u200a%) patients with severe influenza, but only 2 (9\u200a%) patients with mild influenza.",

Seven OTUs (Moraxella catarrhalis, Actinomyces, Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum pigrum, Chryseobacterium, Prevotella and Parvimonas micra) were found to be differentially abundant (Fig. 4b and Table 3). Except for Moraxella catarrhalis and Parvimonas micra, these OTUs were significantly more abundant in neurological severe forms than in respiratory severe forms. As already described, Moraxella catarrhalis remain abundant in both severe forms (17.39\u200a% vs 29.89\u200a%), unlike all other OTUs, with limited abundance in both groups (<1\u200a% in average).",

To test the signatures\u2019 predictive performance, we used the trained rules to determine the influenza disease severity of patients excluded from the training set [leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)]. In addition, only rules that were found in all cross-validation instances were considered to be robust. This analysis revealed 5 robust association rules comprising two to three OTUs able to classify mild versus severe patients with cross-validated sensitivity of up to 93\u200a% and specificity of up to 100\u200a% (Table 4). For instance, the quantification of OTU_22 (Streptobacillus) at a relative abundance higher than 8.8e-06 and the quantification of OTU_85 (Haemophilus) at a relative abundance higher than 4.8e-05 predict that the patient will develop a severe influenza with a sensitivity of 92.86\u200a% and a specificity of 90.91\u200a%.

By comparing the relative abundance and diversity of microbial populations in the upper respiratory tract of children at the time of hospitalization, we identified bacterial profiles that differentiated children that developed severe disease versus non-progressive mild influenza infection using five different diversity indexes. All but one showed statistical differences between these two groups. This difference was not significant for Simpson\u2019s reciprocal index, the most dependent on cohort size (as reviewed in [19]).

Based on their clinical course after sample collection, patients were classified into two groups: patients with mild influenza or patients with respiratory or neurological complications (the severe influenza group). The criteria used for classifying children in the severe influenza group with respiratory complications were: utilization of invasive or non-invasive ventilation, blood gas alteration (hypoxemia <95\u200a% in arterial sample) and hospitalization in the ICU for respiratory complications. Neurological complications were defined as symptoms that affected the central or peripheral nervous system, including seizures, encephalopathy, encephalitis, or any focal neurological symptom [34]. Patients with neurological complications were hospitalized either in the ICU or in neurology units specializing in the management of encephalitis or epilepsy. We excluded patients with incomplete clinical files, as well as patients who had received antibiotics prior to respiratory sample collection, as this treatment likely perturbs the microbiome. Other exclusion criteria included known risk factors for severe influenza (defined as chronic respiratory diseases, cardiac diseases, metabolic diseases, immunosuppression, etc.) and known chronic disease associated with respiratory microbiota dysbiosis (such as severe asthma, etc.) [3]. Note that two patients had Down\u2019s syndrome, one in the mild influenza group and one in the severe influenza group. In addition, in the respiratory group one patient presented with Prader\u2013Willi syndrome and another presented with an uncategorized myopathy. While individuals with Down's syndrome, Prader\u2013Willi syndrome and myopathy are known to be at risk of respiratory problems, these comorbidities have not been associated with modifications in the NP microbiome, and so we did not exclude these patients. In total, 72 patients were selected, including 42 patients with mild influenza, 11 patients with respiratory distress symptoms and 19 patients with neurological complications. We extracted DNA and RNA using Nuclisens EasyMag. Only 36 patients had samples with sufficient quantity and quality of DNA for sequencing, including 22 patients with mild influenza, 4 patients with respiratory distress symptoms and 10 patients with neurological complications.",

Briefly, 5\u2009ng of genomic DNA from each sample was used as a starting template to generate the V1\u2013V3 amplicon libraries. All genomic DNA was subjected to 20 cycles of PCR (Failsafe, Epicentre) and the 16S amplicons were cleaned using 0.8X AMPure XP beads (Beckman Couter, Inc.) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Nextera dual index adaptors (Nextera XT adaptors, Illumina, Inc.) were incorporated by performing 10 PCR cycles (Failsafe, Epicentre), cleaned using 1.1X AMPure XP beads (Beckman Couter, Inc,), quantified using a qubit (DNA high sensitivity, Life Technologies) and multiplexed using equal molar ratios of DNA for each sample. The final 16S libraries were loaded on a MiSeq sequencer at 2 pM with 5\u200a% PhiX control and sequenced using custom Illumina read primers to eliminate the V1\u2013V3 16S primer sequences (Table S6). Each sample had an average of 150K read depth (300\u2009bp, paired end) and all 16S ribosomal sequences were classified using the UPARSE metagenomic pipeline [35]. Briefly, this pipeline removed low-quality reads, merged the paired reads to generate ~430\u2009bp fragments, removed sequence artifacts (chimaeric sequences and sequence errors), mapped full-length reads to a highly curated 16S ribosomal database derived from the RDP 16S training set (v14), identified sequence reads to genus/species level with a 97\u200a% cut-off based on OTU classification and generated summary tables for downstream statistical analyses. In total, all samples passed our cut-off of at least 50\u200a000 high-quality 16S DNA sequence reads per sample and all OTUs were classified to the genus level (Fig. S1). Rarefaction curves were performed to verify that sampling had exhausted the diversity at the sequence read depth cut-off of 50\u200a000 reads per sample (Fig. S1c). For classification to the species level, we blasted the OTU representative sequences against the silva Ref NR99 database (release 119), from which uncultured species were removed. We used blastn with the following parameters: \u2018-evalue 1e-50 -perc_identity 99. The blast results were further filtered to only keep results that were identical (up to the genus level) to the UPARSE classification.",

Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) was performed using the adonis function in the R \u2018vegan\u2019 package [37] to test the ability of variables (patient group, sex and age, nature of sample, days since onset of symptoms) to account for the observed variance in microbial profiles. Finally, statistical analyses for the differential abundance of mapped OTU reads were conducted using the ALDEx2 R package with a generalized linear model (GLM) using the aldex.glm function [38]. We modified the aldex.glm function to enable the effect of several variables in the glm model to be tested, rather than only testing one variable, as in the default aldex.glm function.
