We characterized HIV-1 diversity in the blood and female genital tract (FGT) within 2 weeks after detection of infection in three women enrolled in a unique prospective cohort in South Africa. We assembled full-length HIV-1 genomes from matched cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples and plasma. Deep sequencing allowed us to identify intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) and to characterize within-sample HIV-1 diversity. Our results demonstrated very little HIV-1 diversity in the FGT and plasma by the time viremia was detectable. Within each subject, the consensus HIV-1 sequences were identical in plasma and CVL fluid. No iSNV was present at >6% frequency. One subject had 77 low-frequency iSNVs across both CVL fluid and plasma, another subject had 14 iSNVs in only CVL fluid from the earliest time point, and the third subject had no iSNVs in CVL fluid or plasma. Overall, the small amount of diversity that we detected was greater in the FGT than in plasma and declined over the first 2 weeks after viremia was detectable, compatible with a very early HIV-1 transmission bottleneck. To our knowledge, our study represents the earliest genomic analysis of HIV-1 in the FGT after transmission. Further, the use of metagenomic sequencing allowed us to characterize other organisms in the FGT, including commensal bacteria and sexually transmitted infections, highlighting the utility of the method to sequence both HIV-1 and its metagenomic environment.",

When HIV-1 is transmitted to a new individual, one or a few viruses establish the new infection, leading to a genetic bottleneck in the virus population. Understanding the timing and nature of this bottleneck may provide insight into HIV-1 vaccine design and other preventative strategies. We examined the HIV-1 population in three women enrolled in a unique prospective cohort in South Africa who were followed closely during the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. We found very little HIV-1 diversity in the blood and female genital tract during the first 2 weeks after virus was detected in the bloodstream. These results are compatible with a very early HIV-1 population bottleneck, suggesting the need to study the HIV-1 population in the female genital tract before virus is detectable in the bloodstream.",

Typically, a transmitting partner with chronic HIV-1 infection harbors a diverse viral quasispecies, which is reduced to only one or a few viral variants after transmission to the recipient partner. Prior studies investigating the HIV-1 transmission bottleneck, which mostly examined HIV-1 in the plasma 1 to 3\u2009months after infection, have demonstrated that sexually acquired infection with HIV-1 is established by a single transmitted/founder (T/F) virus in approximately 60% to 80% of individuals (1,\u20137). However, some women acquire a more heterogeneous viral population in the plasma (8) and in the female genital tract (FGT) (9), and a recent study demonstrated greater HIV-1 env diversity in the FGT than in blood within the first 3 months after infection (10). Understanding the timing and location of the HIV-1 transmission bottleneck, as well as factors that contribute to it, may provide critical insight into the design of an HIV-1 vaccine and other preventative strategies.",

When these factors are disrupted by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or hormonal contraceptive use, women can acquire a more diverse HIV-1 population (12, 13). The FGT has also been described as supporting compartmentalized evolution of the HIV-1 population throughout infection (14,\u201316).

Twenty-nine (38%) of the iSNVs were synonymous, and 48 (62%) were nonsynonymous. Fifteen (19%) were G-to-A changes in a dinucleotide context compatible with hypermutation by APOBEC3, a family of human proteins that play a role in antiviral innate immunity. The day 4 CVL sample had the highest number of iSNVs (n = 55) and the greatest average Shannon entropy (Fig. 6a); fewer iSNVs were present in day 4 plasma (n = 24) and even fewer at day 11 in CVL fluid (n = 5) and plasma (n = 6). These differences are unlikely to reflect iSNVs lost to low sequencing depth: all the samples had good depth of coverage (192\u00d7 to 2,735\u00d7), and the sample with the lowest depth of coverage (day 4 CVL fluid) had the greatest number of iSNVs. Overall HIV-1 diversity therefore decreased between CVL fluid and plasma and between day 4 and day 11.",

Most of the iSNVs that were present in day 4 CVL fluid (52 out of 55) were at lower frequency or absent in day 4 plasma and were absent in both compartments by day 11. Most of these \u201cbottlenecked\u201d iSNVs were linked with at least one other iSNV within a 100-bp sequencing read at similar frequency (Table S2), suggesting that they might have been acquired from the transmitting partner. We also observed 17 iSNVs that were present only in the plasma at day 4 and in no other samples, including day 4 CVL fluid. Most of these were not linked with other iSNVs (n = 13; 76%), suggesting that they could have arisen during viral replication in either the plasma or regional lymph nodes prior to the development of viremia. The disappearance of all 69 of these iSNVs by day 11 in plasma suggests the presence of a bottleneck that restricted most of the HIV-1 quasispecies variants that were both transmitted and generated very early during infection.",

In subject B, there were 14 iSNVs in the day 1 CVL sample (Fig. 6b; see Table S2), 9 (64%) of which were G-to-A changes compatible with hypermutation by APOBEC3. No iSNVs were identified in any other sample from this subject, which could in part be attributable to lower sequencing depth (due to low input levels of HIV-1 RNA), but also likely reflects some true loss of diversity. We used a binomial distribution to estimate the probability that iSNVs detected in CVL fluid on day 1 would not be detected in CVL fluid on day 7 (depth of coverage, 206\u00d7) due to chance. We found there would be a 0.05% probability of not detecting an iSNV with a frequency of 3.7% (the highest-frequency iSNV in day 1 CVL fluid) and a 16% probability of not detecting an iSNV with a frequency of 0.9% (the median frequency of iSNVs in day 1 CVL fluid, with 10 iSNVs in day 1 CVL fluid detected at this frequency or higher). It therefore seems unlikely that sequencing depth alone accounted for the lack of iSNVs in day 7 CVL fluid compared to day 1 CVL fluid, supporting a biological decrease in HIV-1 diversity between day 1 and day 7 in the FGT. We did not perform a similar comparison for plasma samples, because the sequencing depth was too low to make meaningful comparisons (mean depths of coverage, 37\u00d7 for day 1 plasma and 50\u00d7 for day 7 plasma).",

The gag variant, a 36-bp in-frame deletion (Fig. 7a), was detected in both plasma and CVL fluid at both time points and in both independent sequencing libraries from each sample, arguing against its being a PCR artifact. Its frequency, based on unique reads, was higher in CVL fluid than plasma at both time points (Fig. 7b, left). This deletion was found in the PTAP region of gag, which is known to harbor duplications, particularly in HIV-1 subtype C viruses (23). PTAP duplication has been associated with increased compensatory fitness in the setting of protease inhibitor resistance (24), which was likely not a contributing factor in this subject, because protease inhibitors are not commonly used in South Africa.",

Using BLAST (NCBI), we found that the sequence was most similar (86% identity) to a subtype C HIV-1 isolate from South Africa (GenBank accession number AY463226.1). This was unlikely to be a contaminant, because we identified reads bridging this env variant with the consensus backbone on both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, and other HIV-1 subtype C samples have not been previously sequenced in our laboratory.

In addition to using water controls, we analyzed each CVL sample using its paired plasma sample as an internal control. CVL samples had overall increased microbial diversity compared to plasma, including a number of unique taxa that are commonly associated with the FGT environment (Fig. 8). These taxa, which were not detected in water controls, include commensal organisms, such as Porphyromonas and Prevotella, as well as organisms that may be commensal or associated with the disease state, such as Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma. Of note, our methods were not optimized to detect all bacterial species because we used CVL supernatants rather than cell pellets and we did not perform stringent lysis procedures, such as bead beating, that are necessary for some bacteria. Perhaps for these reasons, we did not detect high abundances of the genera Prevotella, Gardnerella, and Gemella, as had previously been detected in this cohort by 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing (18). Interestingly, the CVL sample from subject C on day 11 did not have high abundances of CVL fluid-associated taxa, and the sample clustered between plasma and CVL samples on principal-component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 8). The observed reduction in CVL fluid-associated taxa may be the result of administration of antibiotics (which was not noted at the study visit) or other interventions that would drastically reduce the microbial diversity in the FGT.",

We detected Chlamydia trachomatis in subjects A and C, which had not been detected by clinical screening using nucleic acid amplification. Subject A was clinically diagnosed with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection; although we detected reads from Neisseria, we were not able to definitively classify these as N. gonorrhoeae due to high rRNA sequence similarity among nonpathogenic species within the genus Neisseria. Furthermore, we consistently observed low levels of background reads from the genus Neisseria in water controls, as well as CVL and plasma samples from all three subjects (Fig. 8a). Therefore, our classification methods are not specific enough to confidently identify N. gonorrhoeae.",

Our findings are compatible with a very early HIV-1 transmission bottleneck, which was mostly complete by the time viremia was detectable in these three individuals. Because our study design did not include samples from the transmitting partners, we cannot exclude the possibility that the subjects were exposed to a relatively homogeneous viral population (e.g., if the transmitting partners had acute infections themselves). We also were not able to assess contributions to the HIV-1 transmission bottleneck prior to the FGT or assess features of transmitted viruses compared to nontransmitted viruses, as in prior studies that included transmission pairs (1, 3).",

This was most evident in subject A, who had clearly demonstrable low-frequency HIV-1 quasispecies diversity in the FGT sampled 4 days after detection of viremia, including multiple sets of iSNVs linked on 100-bp sequencing reads and a complex 300-bp env variant. Because it would be unlikely for multiple mutations to occur so closely together on the same HIV-1 template this early in infection, many of these variants were likely acquired from the transmitting partner. The complex env variant was quite divergent from the consensus env sequence, but reads were present that bridged it to the consensus backbone on both sides, arguing against contamination. We cannot exclude the possibility that this variant was transmitted by a different partner in close temporal proximity and subsequently recombined with the consensus variant. The disappearance of the env variant and other sets of linked iSNVs in the plasma by day 11 supports the presence of a bottleneck between the FGT and blood at this very early time in infection. However, the bottleneck was not absolute; in subject A, three unlinked iSNVs and a gag deletion persisted at a frequency of 1% to 5% of the HIV-1 population in both compartments through day 11. We therefore characterize subject A as having multiple transmitted viruses (detected in day 4 CVL fluid) and a smaller number of founder viruses (detected in day 11 CVL fluid and plasma). It remains unclear whether the low-frequency founder viruses, which contained unlinked iSNVs, were transmitted or arose through replication in the FGT during the eclipse phase prior to the development of viremia.",

Notably, however, the FRESH study design uniquely enabled us to investigate samples from the blood and FGT within the first 2 weeks after viremia was detectable. Prior studies of the HIV-1 transmission bottleneck have examined samples several months after infection, mostly from blood. Recently, Klein et al. observed a greater number of distinct HIV-1 env C2-V3-C3 clones present in the FGT than in blood in 12 women with matched cervical and plasma samples collected between 0 and 3\u2009months after infection (10). Similarly, we found greater HIV-1 diversity in FGT than in blood in two out of three subjects for at least one time point. Interestingly, however, Klein et al. reported that the predominant HIV-1 clone in the FGT was most often different from the predominant HIV-1 clone in blood, whereas we found the same HIV-1 consensus sequence in FGT and blood in all three subjects and at all the time points examined. It is possible that by chance we investigated three subjects who did not acquire as diverse an HIV-1 population as the subjects in the earlier study. The difference could also be explained by compartmentalized evolution between the time of infection and sampling, with a shorter period available for compartmentalized evolution in our study.",

Given the challenge of capturing similarly early time points in human studies, our study represents the earliest examination of HIV-1 quasispecies in the human FGT, to our knowledge. Our results suggest that future work is needed to investigate viral diversity within the FGT even earlier in infection, ideally including FGT samples collected prior to peak viral load in the FGT and prior to the development of viremia, with comparison to the transmitting partner samples.",

Metagenomic sequencing has previously been employed to assemble consensus HIV-1 genomes (28, 29), and here, we expand the use of this technique to quantify iSNVs from high-depth next-generation sequencing (NGS) in HIV-1 infection. Historically, HIV-1 quasispecies diversity has been assessed by endpoint dilution to single-genome templates, which limits the number of templates that can be assessed, or, alternatively, by PCR amplification followed by NGS, which can be limited by amplification bias, recombination, and resampling. Our sequencing libraries are randomly generated so that each read that is derived from a unique template has a unique start position and end position, allowing removal of the duplicates that are generated by limited-cycle PCR. This approach is conceptually similar to primer ID (30) but allows identification of unique reads based on characteristics of the starting and ending positions of the reads themselves.",

A more comprehensive evaluation of bacterial species could be achieved with the addition of upstream processing steps, e.g., bead beating for bacterial lysis.

Briefly, carrier RNA [poly(rA)] that had been introduced during the RNA extraction process was depleted using 40-nucleotide (nt) oligo(dT) probes and Hybridase thermostable RNase H (Epicentre), followed by RNase-free DNase treatment (Qiagen). cDNA was constructed using random-hexamer primers and SuperScript III (Invitrogen) for first-strand synthesis, followed by second-strand synthesis (NEB). There is no amplification during this step. Sequencing libraries were generated using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina), which uses transposases to randomly fragment the cDNA, resulting in unique start and end positions of the cDNA fragments prior to any amplification steps. Sequencing adapters including dual indexes were added, and the cDNA fragments underwent amplification with 16 cycles of PCR. The libraries were quantified using a KAPA universal complete kit (Roche), pooled to equal concentration with 4 to 10 samples per lane, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq using paired-end 101-bp reads. As a negative control, a water sample was included with each batch of library construction and sequencing. Duplicate independent sequencing libraries were made from each RNA sample. Reads from duplicate libraries were merged and analyzed together to assemble consensus HIV-1 genome sequences.

PCR and optical duplicates were removed via Picard MarkDuplicates v2.6.0. The remaining reads were further classified with DIAMOND v0.8.18.80 on NCBI\u2019s nr database. Lastly, reads were classified using Kraken v0.10.6 on a custom database built on the default \u201cfull\u201d database containing all RefSeq whole genomes of bacteria and viruses as of October 2015. All Kraken classified reads were additionally subjected to a kraken-filter step with a threshold of 0.05 to reduce false-positive hits. Sequences added to the \u201cfull\u201d Kraken database include all whole chromosomes from PlasmoDB (47) and RefSeq (48) whole genomes of fungi, protozoa, and plasmids (October 2015). Reads that had hits to multiple taxa were assigned to the hits\u2019 lowest common ancestor taxon. Taxa that had <0.01% cumulative read abundance had their reads pushed up the taxonomy tree until all nodes contained at least 0.01% read abundance.",

For this study, we addressed the presence of background microbial reads in two ways. First, we included a water sample as a negative control with each sequencing batch, which went through the entire library construction and sequencing process. Microbial species that we commonly detect in water controls include the genera Burkholderia, Ralstonia, Cupriavidus, and Pseudomonas. Second, we analyzed each CVL sample using its paired plasma sample as an internal control.",

For each sample, reads from duplicate independent sequencing libraries were combined. The consensus HIV-1 genome sequence of the viral population from each sample was constructed by de novo assembly using reads that matched a database of HIV-1 reference genomes (GenBank accession numbers are provided in File S1 in the supplemental material). Assemblies were completed by scaffolding de novo contigs against a subtype C reference genome (GenBank accession no. AF286227), followed by two rounds of refinement with the unfiltered reads.

We also restricted our analysis to iSNVs present at 0.5% frequency or greater, since lower-frequency iSNVs could not be confidently identified with the above-mentioned criteria and the sequencing depth achieved for these samples. Sites meeting these criteria were manually inspected and removed from the final iSNV list if their positions in reads did not appear to be evenly distributed across the read length (40). For each sample, Shannon entropy was calculated as the sum across all iSNVs of negative ln(frequency) times frequency and then was divided by the total sequence length to yield the average Shannon entropy.",

SGA and metagenomic sequencing results were both modeled as binomial random variates, based on allele frequency. A set of 49 samples was simulated, with coverage and allele frequencies taken from the observed data (the allele frequency was estimated as the mean of those measured by the two methods); the coverage for the two metagenomic libraries was also taken from the data. Metagenomic sequencing had two filters imposed: both alleles had to be seen in two libraries, and both had to be seen on at least one forward and one reverse read.
