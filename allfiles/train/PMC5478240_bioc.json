However, administration of Bifidobacterium breve strain BBG-001 to preterm infants did not affect NEC incidence in a multicenter randomised controlled phase 3 trial (PiPS trial). Using a subset of these subjects we compared the fecal microbiome of probiotic and placebo groups and assessed the impact of early antibiotic treatment. Extracted DNA from 103 fecal samples collected at 36\u00a0weeks post-menstrual age underwent PCR amplification of a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. Heatmaps were constructed showing the proportions of sequences from bacterial families present at >\u00a01% of the community. Stepwise logistic regression assessed the association between early antibiotic exposure and microbiome group. There was no difference in the microbial richness and diversity of the microbiome of preterm infants following treatment with probiotic or a placebo. Conversely, early antimicrobial exposure was associated with different patterns of colonisation, specifically a relative abundance of Proteobacteria.",

Consequently the administration of \u2018beneficial\u2019 live bacteria in the form of probiotics could help prevent NEC. The demonstration that probiotics reduce the risk of severe NEC in preterm infants supports this view, although such a reduction appears dependent on the infant's birthweight and the bacterial strain used (Aceti et al., 2015, AlFaleh and Anabrees, 2014). Mechanisms by which probiotics might prevent NEC include the possibility that they modify the composition, and increase the stability and diversity of gastrointestinal microbial populations (AlFaleh and Anabrees, 2014). However, the results of studies exploring the role of probiotics on the preterm gut and NEC incidence are confounded by small sample numbers and methodological inconsistencies (Aceti et al., 2015). Additionally, placebo controlled probiotic trials in infants have often omitted a comparison between the microbial composition of the two groups and subsequently do not allow a full understanding of the impact, if any, of probiotic administration on the developing microbiome.",

A fragment of the 16S rRNA gene, encompassing the V1\u2013V3 hypervariable regions, was amplified by PCR using the broad-range primers 27F-YM (Frank et al., 2008) and 519R (Lane et al., 1985). The Roche GS-FLX Titanium Series adapter sequence A and previously described unique 12-base error-correcting Golay barcodes (Fierer et al., 2008) were incorporated into the forward primers (5\u2032-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNAGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG-3\u2032) to enable multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The reverse primer (5\u2032-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGGWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG-3\u2032) contained adapter sequence B at the 5\u2032 end. PCR was performed using Extensor Hi-Fidelity PCR mastermix (Thermo-Scientific Abgene, UK) with the following conditions: 5 mins at 95\u00a0\u00b0C followed by 25\u00a0cycles of 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 45\u00a0s, 50\u00a0\u00b0C for 45\u00a0s, 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 90\u00a0s and a final extension of 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 5 mins. The amplicons were purified by means of a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. The size and purity of the amplicons was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Wokingham, UK), and quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Life Technologies, UK). The amplicons were then pooled together at equimolar concentrations (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0molecules/\u03bcl). Emulsion-PCR and unidirectional sequencing of the samples was performed using the Lib-L kit and the Roche 454 GS-FLX\u00a0+\u00a0Titanium series sequencer by the Department of Biochemistry, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK. The primers used in this study had known mismatches with members of the family Bifidobacteriaceae (see Sim et al., 2012). We chose 16S rRNA primers consistent with previous published microbiome studies. For the PiPS study we included a specific PCR and cultured the intervention strain Bifidobacterium breve (strain BBG-001). The results of PCR analysis of the two week postnatal age samples, and of the 2\u00a0week postnatal age and the 36\u00a0week post menstrual age culture are shown in the original trial report (Costeloe et al., 2016). The Heatmap Fig. 2 shows the patterns of colonisation in infants by Bificobacterium breve colonisation status determined by culture. Specific PCR was not performed on the 36\u00a0week post-menstrual age samples.",

Using Stata SE for Windows (version 13.1) the likelihood-ratio test was used to decide which variables to enter into the model as it is more reliable for small sample sizes (Agresti, 1996). Correlation between independent variables was considered to determine if there were highly correlated variables which could be dropped before the model selection procedure. Adjusted logistic regression models were fitted to determine if there was a significant difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the total number of days on antibiotics between day 0 to day 14 between the microbiome groups. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.",

These differences probably reflect the influence of a number of factors such as mode of delivery and postnatal exposures including the administration of antimicrobials (Mai et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2009). The use of probiotics has been postulated to represent a means by which the microbiome of the preterm infant may be altered such that it confers a protective effect against NEC. This study found no evidence of a difference in the patterns of colonisation or microbial diversity in the probiotic compared with placebo group by the end of the intervention period (36\u00a0weeks post-menstrual age), contrary to previous study findings (Ishizeki et al., 2013).

Use of antibiotics early in life has been associated both with increased levels of Enterobacteriaceae and an increased risk of NEC (Pammi et al., 2017, Greenwood et al., 2014). Warner et al. (2016) reported a relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and relative paucity of Negativicutes (includes Veillonella spp) preceding NEC in very low birthweight infants. Mai et al. (2011) and Morrow et al. (2013) reported that Proteobacteria were relatively dominant components of the microbiome (especially Enterobacteriaceae) preceding the onset of NEC in preterm infants in cases of NEC compared with controls. In addition to reduced microbial diversity, early antimicrobial administration may induce the development of a resistant population of intestinal bacteria harbouring antimicrobial resistant (AMR) genes (the resistome - Penders et al., 2013). The demonstration of increased levels of AMR genes in preterm infants receiving antibiotics (Gibson et al., 2016) supports this supposition. However, the detection of AMR genes in the preterm healthy gut (Rose et al., 2017) suggests that, even in the absence of antibiotics, AMR genes may be present perhaps reflecting the impact of gestational factors such as perinatal maternal antibiotics on the foetal microbiome (Francino, 2015). Large scale studies are required in this area to further characterise the evolution of the resistome.",

However, the low sample number may prevent the detection of any small yet potentially important differences in the microbiomes of the probiotic and placebo groups. In addition only one sample from each infant was analysed at a single time point and yet the microbiome of the infant is in a constant state of flux especially during the early stages. For example, very low birthweight preterm infants have been shown to have a preponderance of Firmicutes at two days postpartum followed by Proteobacteria at 30\u00a0days (Arboleya et al., 2016). Consequently, determination of the microbiome at an isolated time point may fail to identify any differences that occur between the probiotic and placebo groups at an earlier or later date. Another weakness of this study is that the primers chosen (although consistent with those reported in previous relevant publications) were not optimised to detect Bifidobacteriaceae (Sim et al., 2012). The PiPS study included both a specific PCR for the intervention strain and culture and these results have already been reported (Costeloe et al., 2016). Differences in patterns of microbial colonisation have been ascribed to differences in the PCR primers used to target the 16S rRNA gene (Pammi et al., 2017).",
