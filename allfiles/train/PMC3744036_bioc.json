Conventional microbiological methods have limited scope to capture the full spectrum of urinary bacterial species. We studied the urinary microbiota from a population of healthy individuals, ranging from 26 to 90 years of age, by amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, with resulting amplicons analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing. Mid-stream urine (MSU) was collected by the \u201cclean-catch\u201d method. Quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA genes in urine samples, allowed relative enumeration of the bacterial loads. Analysis of the samples indicates that females had a more heterogeneous mix of bacterial genera compared to the male samples and generally had representative members of the phyla Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Analysis of the data leads us to conclude that a \u201ccore\u201d urinary microbiome could potentially exist, when samples are grouped by age with fluctuation in abundance between age groups. The study also revealed age-specific genera Jonquetella, Parvimonas, Proteiniphilum, and Saccharofermentans. In conclusion, conventional microbiological methods are inadequate to fully identify around two-thirds of the bacteria identified in this study. Whilst this proof-of-principle study has limitations due to the sample size, the discoveries evident in this sample data are strongly suggestive that a larger study on the urinary microbiome should be encouraged and that the identification of specific genera at particular ages may be relevant to pathogenesis of clinical conditions.",

With molecular tools now developed to assess the composition and diversity of particular microbiomes far more accurately, and independently of culture methods, potential insights into the affiliation between humans and their associated microbiota in healthy and disease can be obtained. Bacteria constitute 90% of all cells in the human body, and this symbiotic relationship is crucial in maintaining health and for proper development of the host (Proctor, 2011). For example, maintaining a vaginal environment that is dominated by Lactobacillus species is associated with healthy pregnancy outcomes, lack of vaginal symptoms and reduced risk for acquiring several sexually transmitted pathogens (Marrazzo, 2011). In addition, studies of the gut have demonstrated a variety of functions for the resident microbiota in maintaining the host's health, including metabolic and trophic functions, as well as providing a protective barrier against pathogens (Guarner and Malagelada, 2003; Chervonsky, 2012).",

Yet with aging, physiological changes (e.g., changes in diet, lifestyle, immune system function) induced by the ageing process will likely affect the abundance of an individual's bacteria at every bodily niche (Biagi et al., 2012). Therefore, as for the intestinal microbiota, it is important to understand how the ageing process shapes the microbiota within the healthy, ageing bladder as a platform for future studies (O'Toole, 2012).",

While bladder biopsies or suprapubic aspirates would provide the best quality material for capturing the bladder microbiota, this was not feasible for a pragmatic study in a healthy population (Wolfe et al., 2012). Accordingly, clean-catch mid-stream urine (MSU) samples were employed to characterize the urinary microbiota, as a reflection of the bladder microbiota. To enumerate the amount of bacteria within each sample and to discriminate contaminants as those that fall below a certain level in a comparable manner to standard urine microbiology tests, DNA within each sample was quantified by qPCR and compared to a known number of operon copies/ml of a urine sample spiked with Escherichia coli also quantified by qPCR. This strategy allowed us to relate the relative abundance of bacteria between donated samples and provide more informative data.",

The kit reagent was supplied as a 2.5 \u00d7 mastermix which contained dNTPs, primers (343F 5\u2032 TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT 3\u2032 and 809R 5\u2032 GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT 3\u2032), Taq polymerase and SYBR fluorescent dye in a PCR buffer (exact content is proprietary). A volume of 15 \u03bcl of this secondary mix was then added to 10 \u03bcl of a 1/10 dilution of respective urine DNA extract/E. coli DNA calibrator. The supplied Taq was non hot-start; this necessitated assay set-up on ice, and the use of the PCR cycler plate to be preheated (95\u00b0C) in order to minimize primer-dimer formation (verified by melt curve analysis). The amount of urine extract DNA template was 20 to <1 ng/reaction (it was not possible to accurately quantify the amount of DNA in all extracts since some concentrations were <1 ng/\u03bcl). The total urine DNA extract volume was 50 \u03bcl which originated from 2 ml urine, and 10 \u03bcl of a 1/10 dilution of extract was added. The qPCR was calibrated using DNA obtained from an enumerated E. coli liquid culture (OD 600 nm of 1.5) extracted by the urine DNA protocol.",

Once the reads were transferred they were analyzed by means of the bioinformatic software Mothur (http://www.mothur.org: version 1.28.1) using absolute numbers in each sample to minimize any artifacts which might be introduced due to re-sampling (Schloss et al., 2009). The reads were mapped to the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) taxonomy by Mothur using a dissimilarity cutoff value of 0.03 and only operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a minimum of 10 reads in any sample were used. The unique OTUs from this pipeline were used in the R statistical environment to determine clusters and heatmaps. The number of clusters was determined using partitioning around medoids (PAMK) in the package FPC in R.

The average total operons/ml for all bacteria for the females within the age group 20\u201349 (n = 3) was 1.3 \u00d7 105. For females within the age group 50 to 69+ (n = 3) the number of genera present was 36. It was not however possible to predict operons/ml within this group for any of the samples, as the readings were below the detection limit of the qPCR method. Nonetheless, it does suggest that the bacterial counts were much lower than the other two groups who reached at least the detection limit. In the 70+ age group the number of different genera identified was 43 (n = 4). The average total operons/ml for all bacteria for the females in this age group (70+) was 3.3 \u00d7 104. Therefore in the 70+ female age group, there were approximately 75% fewer bacteria (operons/ml) than in the age group 20\u201349. Notably, the age groups 20\u201349 and 70+ had in common 17 genera that were present in both groups at numbers greater than the predicted 7 \u00d7 103 operons/ml (Table \u200b(Table2).2). A further 6 genera were common within these groups but detectable in greater numbers (>7 \u00d7 103 operons/ml) in the age group 20\u201349, than in the 70+ (Table \u200b(Table22).",

Physiological changes that are induced by the ageing process, age-related events (for example morbidity, medication and lifestyle) and the reduction of functionality of the immune system or immunosenescence will inevitably modify the composition of the microbiota throughout the human body (Gruver et al., 2007). This change has been clearly demonstrated in the gut microbiota, sampling faeces, and the evidence provided here suggests it is likely an analogous situation occurs in the bladder and sampling urine (Tiihonen et al., 2010; Jalanka-Tuovinen et al., 2011; Biagi et al., 2012; O'Toole, 2012; Yatsunenko et al., 2012).",

The difficulties in getting a genuine \u201cclean-catch\u201d MSU sample representative of only organisms originating from the bladder is well-recognized and especially so for females, in which the urine has to pass through the distal urethra and/or for the elderly (both male and female), who have physical or other impairments (Franz and H\u00f6rl, 1999; Lifshitz and Kramer, 2000; Wilson and Gaido, 2004). Nonetheless, it is less intrusive than alternative approaches, such as bladder tissue biopsy or catheterization, and hence the most pragmatic and ethical approach for larger, longitudinal studies and clinical application and it was therefore our positive intention to collect samples in this way (Wolfe et al., 2012). However this is not withstanding potential urethral or perineal contamination which in a larger study could be considered by determining thresholds (operons/ml) in which to disregard bacteria that fall below this as potential contaminants. Further work could also include taking a urethral swab for comparison to the urine sample to identify with greater clarity what most likely resides truly in the urethra and has simply contaminated the urine sample.",

Whilst these participants had no lower urinary tract symptoms and no history of urinary tract infection in the preceding year it is worth noting that the participants were visiting the hospital as an out-patient for other unspecified treatments and may not therefore be considered representative of the primary care population. Samples were also only included if antibiotics had not been taken for any indication in the preceding month. However a study by Dethlefsen and Relman (2011) suggests it may take greater than 2 months to return to a baseline microbiota or at least an altered stable composition. We also acknowledge that certain groups, for example the elderly are likely to have had repeated antibiotic exposure which will result in the possibility of greater dynamic change to the bladder microbiota in comparison to a different age group. Therefore the comparison of samples within age groups in a larger study will be essential.",

The remaining 63 are either not routinely cultivated or would not be reported individually by routine urine investigations in an NHS microbiology laboratory (Health Protection Agency, 2012).

We acknowledge this method has limitations, for example the assumption that all bacteria have the same copy number for the 16S rRNA gene leading to an over- or under-estimation for many bacteria. It does, however, allow us to directly compare the abundance of the different genera between samples and give us an indication at the very least of the number of colony forming units per ml of urine of bacteria.",

The general lack of representatives from the phyla Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the male samples within this study also seems typical in comparison to other studies (Nelson et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2011). The current study also describes the first observation of the genera Soehngenia detected within a sample originating from a human, in this instance urine, seen in four of the subjects, male (n = 1) and female (n = 3). The fastidious anaerobic bacteria from this genus would not be detected by standard methods (Parshina et al., 2003).",

Semeniuk and Church (1999) reported that approximately 20% of samples by urinary dipstick analysis would have been sent to the laboratory for microbiology testing and therefore not screened for bacteriuria. In this study, eight out of 16 samples could potentially have been misclassified by urinary dipstick analysis, either being called \u201cnegative\u201d when actually positive on qPCR (n = 6), or \u201cpositive\u201d when actually negative (n = 2). Additionally, by quantifying the total number of bacteria by qPCR methods, we have shown that the numbers of bacteria that are routinely cultivated are comparable in amount to the numbers not routinely cultivated and/or identified individually. This raises questions on the precision of methods used in routine microbiological investigation for reporting a total bacterial count. By inaccurately informing clinicians of the presence/absence and quantity of bacteria, there may be serious implications in any treatment plan of patients.",

                    "text": "It is clear that the bacterial composition in the urine collected within this study is highly variable regardless of sex or age. This makes it unlikely that a comparable bacterial community between individuals of the same age or gender exists, just as Siddiqui et al. (2011) suggest. Nevertheless, quantifying the samples by qPCR has allowed us directly to compare one sample to another, and thus group samples together according to their age and sex for collated comparisons. Dividing into arbitrary age groups, the data is suggestive of the existence of a \u201ccore\u201d bladder microbiome, with variability in the amount of the \u201ccore\u201d bacteria and flux of other bacteria with ageing, much like the gut microbiome (Arumugam et al., 2011; Jalanka-Tuovinen et al., 2011). The female samples perhaps best demonstrate this. Across all three age groups, the female samples have in common 23 genera, the \u201ccore\u201d microbiome, with each age group additionally having their own distinct subset of genera. There are also a number of genera that occur within two age groups, suggesting a transitional period may occur. Unfortunately the qPCR method for enumerating/predicting bacterial counts was not valid for the samples within the 50\u201369 age group, as the samples were below the detection limit of the method. However, it is interesting that the age groups 20\u201349 and the 70+ have 32 genera in common; 17 were present at greater than 103 \u201cE. coli equivalent\u201d cfu/ml as determined by qPCR, so highly unlikely to be contaminants. Six of these genera were found in higher numbers in the age group 20\u201349 than the age group 70+, suggesting that these bacteria may remain present throughout life, but their quantity could be indicative of the age group.",

Confirmation of this observation, and mechanisms responsible, would need to be addressed in a more substantial study but one possible reason is varying bacteria load according to sexual activity and therefore contamination of the urine from the urethra (Dong et al., 2011). However, for both the male and female samples within the age group 70+, four different genera unique to this age category were identified, namely bacteria of the genera Jonquetella, Parvimonas, Proteiniphilum, and Saccharofermentans. These bacteria are strict anaerobes and not routinely cultured, suggesting the possibility of specific bacteria more likely affecting the elderly age-groups but will need to be further explored in a wider study with greater numbers.",

The microbiological methods in current routine urine assessment are unlikely to identify many of these bacteria and certainly not accurately able to enumerate them, necessitating the need for alternative testing systems to be explored in due course. By quantifying the MSU sample with qPCR against an enumerated E. coli sample it has been possible to postulate \u201ccontaminant\u201d bacteria as those with very few numbers (<103 cfu/ml or <7 \u00d7 103 operons/ml \u201cE. coli equivalent\u201d).",
