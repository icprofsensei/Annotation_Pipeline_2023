Current sampling methods to obtain microbial specimens, such as feces and mucosal biopsies, are inconvenient and unappealing to patients. Obtaining samples through rectal swabs could prove to be a quicker and relatively easier method, but it is unclear if swabs are an adequate substitute. We compared bacterial diversity and composition from rectal swabs and rectal mucosal biopsies in order to examine the viability of rectal swabs as an alternative to biopsies. Paired rectal swabs and mucosal biopsy samples were collected in un-prepped participants (n = 11) and microbial diversity was characterized by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbial community composition from swab samples was different from rectal mucosal biopsies (p = 0.001). Overall the bacterial diversity was higher in swab samples than in biopsies as assessed by diversity indexes such as: richness (p = 0.01), evenness (p = 0.06) and Shannon\u2019s diversity (p = 0.04). Analysis of specific bacterial groups by qPCR showed higher copy number of Lactobacillus (p < 0.0001) and Eubacteria (p = 0.0003) in swab samples compared with biopsies. Our findings suggest that rectal swabs and rectal mucosal samples provide different views of the microbiota in the large intestine.",

A simple, standardized, risk-free and inexpensive method to assess bacterial community composition of the gut could lower the risks and inconvenience associated with collection of these samples. In the present study, we systematically compared the bacterial composition of rectal swabs and rectal mucosal biopsies collected during an un-prepped sigmoidoscopy from 11 participants.

Another source of swab contamination may have been from local skin flora due to inadvertent swab contact with adjacent skin prior to insertion through the anus. We selected Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a predominant skin microbe,22 to assess the level of contamination of skin bacteria in swabs and biopsies. S. aureus was considerably more abundant in swabs (3.2 \u00b1 0.192) than biopsies (1.6 \u00b1 0.075) suggesting a potential contamination of swab samples with skin flora. In future studies, collecting samples through a sheath might reduce contamination by skin microbes. Finally, future studies should include a larger study population that samples several sites such as luminal, rectal swabs and biopsies in order to get a better picture of the microbial populations in the large intestine.",

While differences in bacterial community composition can be attributed to a whole array of factors, including host genetics and the environment, our sampling scheme enabled us to observe the diversity associated with two different sampling locations. Our results suggest potential differences in the niches within the human large intestine in relation to bacterial communities. Moreover, the differences in bacterial community composition that we observed suggest that both, swab sampling and biopsy collection, may be needed in order to get the full spectrum of the microbial community composition of the gut. Characterizing these unique bacterial communities of the large intestine is a first step toward understanding the complex association between bacterial diversity in the gut and intestine and disease development.",

Eligibility criteria included: good general health, age 40\u201380 y, willingness to follow the study protocol and provision of informed consent. As part of the study protocol, two swab samples were collected for each participant prior to sigmoidoscopy. Swab specimens were collected by inserting a sterile cotton-tipped swab (Cat. #14\u2013959\u201382, Fisher Scientific) 1\u20132 cm beyond the anus and rotating for several seconds. Swabs were then placed into sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), vortexed for at least 2 min to ensure release of bacteria and stored at -80\u00b0C until further processing. Rectal mucosal biopsies were obtained through a rigid disposable sigmoidoscope (Welch Allyn KleenSpec Disposable Sigmoidoscope with Obturator) coated with gel and inserted to approximately 10 cm with the participant in the left lateral position. Disposable flexible biopsy forceps (Olympus EndoJaw Alligator Jaw-Step, Shinjuku) were used to obtain single mucosal pinches (3\u201310 mg) from two separate sites. Biopsy samples were rinsed in sterile PBS as previously described,2,13 snap-frozen, and then stored at -80\u00b0C until further processing. All samples for this study were collected prior to initiating treatment for all participants. Swab samples for two participants were excluded from qPCR analysis because of insufficient DNA. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine (Protocol #10-1524)",

Finally, the copy number for group-specific bacterial 16S rRNA gene was calculated based on a standard curve, which was adjusted to a starting DNA concentration of 50 ng/\u00b5L using the following formula to the unadjusted values: [50 ng/(A/B)] X unadjusted copy#",

For our analysis, we used these proportions rather than absolute numbers. The data matrix was used to generate Bray-Curtis similarities, a pairwise index of the degree of similarity, where values range from 0\u2013100%. The generated values were then used to construct hierarchical clusters to observe grouping of samples base TRF abundance. We compared the similarities between groups (rectal swab/biopsy) by analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), a non-parametric test, were the significance is computed by permutation of group membership with 999 replicates. The test statistic R, which measures the strength of the correlations ranges from -1 to 1. An R value of 1 signifies differences between groups while an R value of 0 signifies that the groups are identical.",
