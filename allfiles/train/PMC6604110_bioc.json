Membrane lipids distinguished the cancer group from the HPV negative group and were highly associated with genital inflammation. In low-grade and principally high-grade dysplasia groups, we observed polymicrobial communities perturb amino acid and nucleotide metabolism in a similar manner to bacterial vaginosis. Our integrative and comprehensive bioinformatic approach pinpointed the microbial or host origin of specific amino acid metabolites and nucleotides. In addition, a novel aspect of our multi-omic analyses was to reveal the level to which specific metabolites were associated with Lactobacillus abundance as well as genital inflammation. An increase in the Lactobacillus abundance was positively associated with the levels of anti-inflammatory nucleotides. Collectively, we revealed that features of the cervicovaginal microenvironment (HPV, genital inflammation and vaginal microbiota) profoundly impact cervicovaginal metabolomes.",

Even though screening and HPV vaccination have significantly reduced the number of cases in developed countries, cervical cancer is still the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer globally among females [3]. After HPV infection, carcinogenesis does not progress uniformly; precancerous dysplasia may regress without treatment for reasons that are uncertain [4]. Regardless, persistent HPV infection initiates a chain of reactions that suppresses the cell-mediated immune response and hinders clearance of the infection and destruction of abnormal cells [5]. Additionally, in spite of the rapidly accumulating data on host immune responses and vaginal microbiome in patients across cervical carcinogenesis [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]], our understanding of the molecular and metabolic changes in the cervicovaginal microenvironment relevant to microbiome has only recently begun to be elucidated [12,13].",

Early studies have shown that cervical cancer patients harbour a unique collection of molecules ranging from amino acids to nucleic acids in the serum [15], tumour tissues [16], and faeces [17]. Moreover, research on cancer sniffing dogs indicated that there are cancer-specific volatile organic compounds being released in cervical cancer [18]. In comparison to serum or faeces, metabolomes of the cervicovaginal microenvironment have the added benefit of reflecting the metabolic processes occurring in the mucosal environment instead of metabolic outcomes of the entire body or other systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, metabolomes of the local microenvironment in patients with HPV, cervical dysplasia, or invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC), have not been previously reported.",

                    "text": "Cervicovaginal metabolomes throughout cervical carcinogenesis can be influenced by several factors that are host-, microbiome-, and environment-associated. For example, HPV suppresses cytokine production [19], which alters the microbial dynamics in the cervical microenvironment. Our group and others have shown a strong association between genital immune mediators and a decrease in Lactobacillus abundance in cervical carcinogenesis [6,8]. Shifts in cervicovaginal microbial communities due to dysbiosis or environmental factors can alter the cervicovaginal metabolome. For instance, a shift from health-associated Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota towards complex anaerobic and microaerophilic communities in bacterial vaginosis (BV) is highly correlated with an increase in amino acid catabolites and polyamines [12,13]. A similar metabolic shift was also observed in smokers in comparison to non-smokers in connection to imbalances in the vaginal microbiota [20]. Additionally, alterations in cell physiology caused by HPV infection and neoplastic disease could transform the dynamics of the cervicovaginal microenvironment. For example, cancer cells with a drastically increased glucose demand ferment glucose into lactate instead of carbon dioxide, in contrast to healthy differentiated cells [21]. As such, secretions from cancer cells, as well as microbial fermentation products, could ultimately modulate the microenvironment and affect both host and microbial metabolism. In the context of HPV infection and cervical carcinogenesis, these metabolic shifts in the cervical microenvironment warrant further investigation. We hypothesized that cervicovaginal metabolic profiling would reveal HPV, inflammation, host and microbe driven metabolic signatures across cervical carcinogenesis.",

Genital inflammation, mainly in the ICC group was highly associated with various groups of lipids. Nucleotides with anti-inflammatory properties positively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance and negatively correlated with genital inflammation.

Vaginal pH measurements, HPV genotyping, and microbiome analysis from vaginal swabs were described previously [6]. Briefly, CVLs were collected by the clinicians using 10\u202fmL of sterile 0.9% saline solution (Teknova, Hollister, CA), immediately placed on ice and frozen at \u221280\u202f\u00b0C. The CVLs were thawed on ice and clarified by centrifugation (700\u202f\u00d7g for 10\u202fmin at 4\u202f\u00b0C) prior to aliquoting and aliquots were sent to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for global metabolomics identification and quantification. Samples were randomized across the extraction and instrumentation platforms. Briefly, upon receipt, samples were inventoried, and each sample identifier was accessioned into the Metabolon LIMS system and assigned a unique identifier. Sample preparation was achieved using the MicroLab STAR\u00ae system from Hamilton company. Aliquots of 100\u202f\u03bcL were mixed with ethanol and vigorously shaken for 2\u202fmin (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 200) to precipitate the proteins and dissociate the small molecules bound to proteins. The metabolome extract was divided into five aliquots and four of them were analysed. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap\u00ae (Zymark) to remove organic solvent. The extracts were stored overnight under nitrogen before preparation for analysis. The sample's extract was dried then reconstituted in solvents compatible to each of the four methods described below.",

The second extracts were evaluated for more hydrophobic compounds by eluting the sample with methanol, acetonitrile, water, 0.05 PFPA, and 0.1% FA. The third aliquots were analysed using basic negative ion conditions by conditioning the sample with 6.5\u202fmM ammonium bicarbonate at pH\u202f8.0 and eluting with methanol and water through a dedicated separate C18 column.

OTUs that were normalized based on gene copy numbers using QIIME v1.9 [24] were used for prediction of the metagenomes using the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) [27]. Relative contribution of the human and microbial genomes to the expression of metabolites detected were calculated using Annotation of Metabolite Origins via Networks (AMON) [28]. Briefly, using the cervicovaginal metabolome datasets, host genome and microbial genomes downloaded from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/), and PICRUSt predicted metagenomes, we revealed microbial and host contribution to the metabolites. Homo sapiens (has) was used for the host genome and Sneathia amnii (sns), Prevotella denticola (dns), Gardnerella vaginalis ATCC 1409 (gdv), Atopobium parvulum (apv), Streptococcus sanguinis (sng), Lactobacillus crispatus (lcr) were used for the microbial genomes to represent the six most abundant bacteria observed in our dataset. Model-based Integration of Metabolite Observations and Species Abundances (MIMOSA) [29] was used to reveal the potential contribution of microbial taxa to the expression of metabolites that distinguish groups. For the MIMOSA analysis, PICRUSt-predicted metagenomes and the metabolome datasets were used. MIMOSA utilizes a predicted relative metabolic turnover (PRMT) model to estimate gene abundances from PICRUSt-predicted metagenome data to produce community-wide metabolic potential (CMP) scores for each metabolite and sample using metabolites observed, predicted metagenomes and datasets from KEGG database including genomes, reactions, and pathways. Comparing CMP scores to metabolite variations, the metabolites were classified as well predicted by certain taxa or anti-predicted.

The patient characteristics and demographic information are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Participants were assigned to the patient groups based on histology of colposcopy-directed biopsy samples that were evaluated by a pathologist. If histology was not available, cytology results were evaluated. As described in our previous publication [6], a two-tiered system of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was used: CIN1 and CIN2/3 were categorized as LSIL and HSIL, respectively. Our participant group consisted of 37 Hispanic and 41 non-Hispanic women and there was no significant difference in race/ethnicity among the patient groups (Fisher's exact test, p\u202f=\u202f.15). Sixty-eight percent of the participants had body mass index (BMI) >25, however BMI did not significantly differ among the groups (ANOVA, p\u202f=\u202f.47). The mean age across the groups was 38\u202f\u00b1\u202f8\u202fyears and age distribution among the groups was not significantly different (ANOVA, p\u202f=\u202f.46).

Principal component analysis (PCA) of cervicovaginal lavages (CVLs) illustrated that global metabolomic profiles of ICC patients compared to other patient groups were distinct on principal component 1 (PC1) and PC2, which explained 46.57% of variation in the dataset (Fig. 1A; MANOVA, Wilk's Lambda test, p\u202f=\u202f.006; Mann-Whitney U test, p\u202f=\u202f.0009 and p\u202f=\u202f.0225, for PC1 and PC2, respectively). Due to the complex nature of the cervicovaginal lavages, the unexplained variation (53.43%) can be accounted for by the heterogeneity in participant genetic background, diet, lifestyle, etc. However, other collected participant metadata, for example, age, ethnicity, and BMI did not have a statistically significant effect on clustering (MANOVA p\u202f\u2265\u202f.05, Wilk's Lambda test, Supplementary Fig. 1). Samples from the HSIL group also formed a cluster that was significantly distinct from the Ctrl HPV (\u2212) group samples, but only on PC1 (Mann-Whitney U test, p\u202f=\u202f.046). As shown in Fig. 1B, differences in the metabolic profiles were driven by the number of different metabolites observed in the groups (Mann-Whitney U test, p\u202f=\u202f.001). ICC patients had a significantly greater number of metabolites (378\u202f\u00b1\u202f36) than the Ctrl HPV (+) (326\u202f\u00b1\u202f33, p\u202f=\u202f.037), LSIL (324\u202f\u00b1\u202f45, p\u202f=\u202f.022), and HSIL (316\u202f\u00b1\u202f43, p\u202f=\u202f.0009) groups, but not the Ctrl HPV (\u2212) group (348\u202f\u00b1\u202f36, p\u202f=\u202f.363). Overall, Ctrl HPV (+), LSIL, and HSIL groups had a lower number of metabolites in the CVLs compared to Ctrl HPV (\u2212) group; however, this finding did not reach significance possibly due to the limited number of samples per group. However, when we performed a trend analysis, we found that due to a reduction in the number of metabolites present in samples from HPV positive participants with and without cervical dysplasia [Ctrl HPV (+), LSIL, and HSIL], and an increase in the number of metabolites in ICC, the trend was significantly non-linear (p\u202f=\u202f.0004).

Patient groups shared 86% of the identified metabolites (426/475), and the ICC group had the greatest number of unique metabolites (n\u202f=\u202f12) (Fig. 1C). The unique metabolites from ICC belonged to lipid and xenobiotic super-pathways, especially from xenobiotic/drug metabolism (See Supplementary Table 2). When we visualized significantly enriched or depleted metabolites on Cytoscape networks and performed pairwise comparisons, we observed a significant enrichment of metabolites in lipid, xenobiotics, and carbohydrate super-pathways in the ICC group compared to Ctrl HPV (\u2212), Ctrl HPV (+), LSIL, and HSIL groups. Additionally, the ICC group had an enrichment of amino acid metabolites in comparison to other groups that were HPV positive with and without cervical dysplasia [Ctrl HPV (+), LSIL, and HSIL] (Fig. 1D). Compared to the Ctrl HPV (\u2212) group, Ctrl HPV (+), LSIL, and HSIL groups showed a depletion in metabolites mainly in the amino acid super-pathway. Interestingly, the sub-pathways under the amino acid super-pathway and the level of depletion was different for Ctrl HPV (+), LSIL, and HSIL groups when compared to the Ctrl HPV (\u2212) group. For example, Ctrl HPV (+) participants had metabolites mainly depleted in lysine, polyamine, and phenylalanine metabolism, while LSIL participants had metabolites depleted in histidine and the urea cycle. The HSIL group had depletions in many amino acid metabolites; however, the depletions were at a lower magnitude. Additionally, all the dipeptide metabolites were depleted in the HSIL group, which might explain the differences observed on PCA (Fig. 1A). This comparative analysis revealed that HPV infection, cervical dysplasia, and ICC had a divergent impact on cervicovaginal metabolomes.",

The analysis did not reveal metabolites that discriminate Ctrl HPV (+) samples from the Ctrl HPV (\u2212) samples (AUC\u202f<\u202f0.8). However, when Ctrl HPV (\u2212) samples were compared to Ctrl HPV (+) samples, we observed three amino acids (N-acetyltaurine, N6-acetyllysine, C-glycosyltryptophan), two nucleotides (guanine and urate), phosphate and deoxycarnitine had discriminatory ability with AUC values >0.8 as shown in Fig. 2A, suggesting a significant depletion of these metabolites in the Ctrl HPV (+) group. Indeed, the concentrations of these metabolites were significantly lower in the Ctrl HPV (+) group compared to Ctrl HPV (\u2212) and ICC groups (Supplementary Table 3). When we performed ROC analysis to identify metabolites that discriminate Ctrl HPV (\u2212) from LSIL, we found three amino acid metabolism products (pentose acid, 1-methyl-4-imidazoleacetate, pyroglutamine), one nucleotide product (1-methylhypoxanthine), and a xenobiotic (tartrate) as discriminators, as shown in Fig. 2B. Interestingly, the discriminators of Ctrl HPV (\u2212) from HSIL were not the same metabolites as identified for LSIL. Only a phospholipid (phosphoethanolamine) and amino acid (glutamine) had >0.8 AUC (Fig. 2C). In summary, HPV infection and cervical dysplasia led to depletion of metabolites from certain amino acid and nucleotide metabolisms.

When ICC was compared to Ctrl HPV (+), most of the metabolites were similar to those that discriminated ICC from Ctrl HPV (\u2212). Interestingly, many of the metabolites discriminated ICC group from the Ctrl HPV (\u2212) group belonged to the lipid super-pathway (Fig. 2D). These metabolites were mainly long chain fatty acids, ketone bodies, steroids, ceramides, and plasmalogens. Among the detected molecules as discriminators of ICC, oleate/vaccinate, eicosenoate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate had AUC values >0.9, which provided more accurate discriminator and better predictive estimates than any other metabolite that was detected. As visualized in Fig. 2D, the abundance of these metabolites in the ICC group was not only significantly greater than the Ctrl HPV (\u2212) and Ctrl HPV (+) groups, but also from the LSIL and HSIL groups (q\u202f<\u202f0.05). When we calculated the AUC based on ICC compared to HSIL group, 71 metabolites had AUC >0.80 that distinguished ICC from HSIL. Similar to ICC and HPV comparisons, the majority of the metabolites were long chain saturated fatty acids, ketone bodies, plasmalogens, ceramides, and sphingomyelins (See Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Overall, ROC analysis showed that ICC patients harbour elevated levels of lipid metabolites from different subclasses that can accurately distinguish them from all the other groups. Furthermore, those signature molecules did not show any gradation among the Ctrl HPV (+) and dysplasia groups when compared to Ctrl HPV (\u2212) group (See Supplementary Table 3).",

Therefore, we investigated whether differences in the vaginal microbiota, in connection to the severity of cervical neoplasm, explain variations observed in the metabolome dataset. When we colour coded samples on PCA plots based on microbiota composition, metabolomes from patients with Lactobacillus-dominated (LD) vaginal microbiota formed a cluster significantly different than the metabolomes from patients with non-Lactobacillus dominance (NLD) (Fig. 3A). In accordance with the Lactobacillus dominance, vaginal pH revealed a similar clustering pattern on PCA (MANOVA, Wilk's Lambda test, p\u202f<\u202f.001, Supplementary Fig. 2). Grouping based on Lactobacillus dominance showed significance when PC1 and PC2 were analysed together (MANOVA, Wilk's Lambda test, p\u202f<\u202f.001). The difference was more apparent on PC2 (Mann-Whitney U test, p\u202f=\u202f.002), which explained 17% of the variation in the dataset. This observation provided further proof that vaginal microbiomes significantly modulate cervicovaginal metabolomes.",

Based on PICRUSt metagenome predictions and quantified metabolites in our dataset that have Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) identifiers, 48% of the identified metabolites were predicted to be produced by the cervicovaginal microorganisms, which is slightly less than the metabolites that can be produced by the human metabolism (54.4%) (Fig. 3C). We found that 39.1% of the metabolites could not be explained by the host or the vaginal microbiota. We did not observe any differences in number of only microbially-produced metabolites among Ctrl HPV (\u2212), Ctrl HPV (+), LSIL, HSIL, and ICC groups, since this analysis strictly depends on presence or absence of microbial phylotypes rather than their abundances. We also investigated the individual contribution of the most abundant microbial genera detected in our dataset: Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Sneathia, Atopobium, Streptococcus, and Gardnerella [6]. Microbial genomes downloaded from KEGG showed that Prevotella was the genus capable of producing most of the metabolites in our dataset (Fig. 3D) (n\u202f=\u202f60; 23% of metabolites detected and exist in the KEGG database) and Gardnerella was the genus capable of producing the least number of metabolites (n\u202f=\u202f38; 14% of metabolites detected and exist in the KEGG database) compared to the other genera tested. The metabolites predicted to be produced by the most abundant bacteria were mainly amino acids, nucleic acids, or their metabolic end-products (Fig. 3D). Microbial contribution analysis did not explain the differences observed in lipid metabolism when LD and NLD groups were compared. Samples that belong to the NLD group are composed of mainly cervical dysplasia and ICC patients, hence enrichments in the lipid metabolism in NLD could be coincidental.",

Correlation analysis between microbial taxa and host-associated metabolomes were found to lead to a poor explanation of the interactions and inaccurate interpretations [30]. Based on MIMOSA analyses, illustrated in Fig. 3E, of 127 metabolites that were predicted to be produced by the microbiota, 36 of them were significantly consistent with the metabolic potential (FDR\u202f<\u202f0.1). As expected, mainly amino acids and amino acid degradation products, such as polyamines, were well-predicted to be modulated by the microorganisms. This model revealed that amino acids and their degradation products were well-predicted, and there were shifts in the products that can be produced by BV-associated microorganisms in comparison to Lactobacillus species. Lactobacillus species were the sole predictors of a secondary bile acid (glycochenodeoxycholate), amino acid (L-proline), and an amino acid product (glutathione disulphide), molecules that exert beneficial effects on the host based on metabolite fluxes. On the other hand, BV-associated bacteria explained the metabolism of specific metabolites. Atopobium contributed to the metabolism of L-threonine, adenosine, imidazole-4 acetate, glutathione disulphide, orthophosphate, l-lysine, 4-acetamidobutanoate, methylmalonate, and succinate. Gardnerella was the main contributor to the hippurate metabolism. NAD+ flux was mainly explained by the presence of Sneathia in our data set. Streptococcus contributed to 2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutanoate, a secondary metabolite in leucine, isoleucine, and valine metabolism, alpha-isopropylmalate, and cytosine. Interestingly, non-abundant genera including Dialister, Roseomonas, Staphylococcus, and Shuttleworthia were predicted to contribute to metabolism of a diverse set of metabolites such as orthophosphate, adenosine, l-lysine, succinate, methylmalonate, and imidazole-4 acetate (Fig. 3E). Overall, our comprehensive analysis of microbiome-metabolome relationships indicated that displacement of LD with NLD potentially induced various shifts in the amino acid metabolism that can be mostly explained by six most abundant genera detected in our dataset.",

                    "text": "Since inflammation is a critical component of tumour progression, we investigated the link between cervicovaginal metabolomes and genital inflammation. Genital inflammation scoring strategy was previously reported [6,9,31,32]. Briefly, expression levels of seven cytokines (IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, MIP-1\u03b2, CCL20, RANTES, and TNF\u03b1) were evaluated in CVLs and the patients were assigned a cumulative score based on whether the level of each cytokine was in the upper quartile. Patients that scored five to seven were considered to have high genital inflammation, whereas one to five was assigned low genital inflammation and patients with a score of 0 were categorized as no inflammation. We overlaid genital inflammation scores on metabolomes and visualized on PCA as shown in Fig. 4A. Based on distances visualized on PCA, samples showed a gradation based on the genital inflammation category. Patients in the high genital inflammation category formed a cluster significantly distant from the none and low genital inflammation groups on both PC1 (Mann-Whitney U test, p values 0.0004 and 0.0143, respectively) and PC2 (p\u202f<\u202f.0001 and p\u202f=\u202f.0016, respectively). Based on MANOVA results, genital inflammation led to significant grouping on PCA (Wilk's Lambda p\u202f<\u202f.001). The difference between the low and no genital inflammation groups on PC2 was also significant (Mann-Whitney U test, p\u202f=\u202f.0228). Additionally, as indicated in Fig. 4A, the samples with high genital inflammation were mainly ICC patients (6/10). When we performed correlation analysis, 32% (187/575) of the metabolites significantly correlated with genital inflammation scores with Spearman's rho greater than the critical value (0.23 for n\u202f=\u202f78, and bootstrapped p\u202f<\u202f.05). About 29% (168/575) and 3% (19/575) of the metabolites showed positive and negative correlation with genital inflammation, respectively (Fig. 4B). Metabolites that positively correlated with genital inflammation were mainly from lipids (n\u202f=\u202f99) followed by amino acids (n\u202f=\u202f23), nucleotides (n\u202f=\u202f14) and xenobiotics (n\u202f=\u202f11). Lipids that positively correlated (\u03c1\u202f>\u202f0.68, p\u202f<\u202f.05) with genital inflammation were sphingolipids, plasmalogens, phosphatidylcholines, phospatidylethanolamines and long-chain-poly-unsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Table 4), which are essential components of host and bacterial cellular membranes. The relative concentrations of the metabolites from these five lipid sub-families were significantly higher in the ICC group compared to other groups as shown in Fig. 4C. These data strengthen the link between genital inflammation, cancer, and lipids. The correlation between genital inflammation and lipids was stronger (\u03c1\u202f>\u202f0. 74 for the first 20 highest ranked correlations) than the correlation between other metabolites and genital inflammation (Supplementary Table 4). Most metabolites that negatively correlated with genital inflammation were xenobiotics (n\u202f=\u202f11), amino acids (n\u202f=\u202f4), and nucleotides (n\u202f=\u202f2).",

                    "text": "Since genital inflammation is linked to vaginal microbial community composition, we investigated the relationship between the metabolites that correlated with genital inflammation and Lactobacillus abundance. Fig. 5A illustrates Spearman's rho coefficients between the metabolites and genital inflammation versus metabolites and Lactobacillus abundance. Many of the lipids that highly correlated with genital inflammation did not correlate with Lactobacillus abundance. However, one of the sphingomyelins, linoleate, glycochenodeoxycholate and deoxycarnitine were negatively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance. Glutathione synthesis intermediate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, branched chain amino acid metabolism product, alpha-hydroxy-isovalerate, and L-isoleucine metabolism product, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-valerate moderately and positively correlated with genital inflammation and negatively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance. These amino acid metabolites were significantly higher in the ICC group compared to other groups (Welch's two-sided t-test, q\u202f<\u202f0.05, Fig. 5B). Metabolites that discriminated ICC from the Ctrl HPV (\u2212), eicosenoate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and oleate/vaccinate highly correlated with genital inflammation (Fig. 5A). Metabolites that positively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance and genital inflammation included amino acids/products such as arginine and betaine, a polyamine, N(1)-acetylspermine, and lipids mainly involved in carnitine metabolism such as decanoylcarnitine, hexanoylcarnitine, and acetylcarnitine. The levels of these metabolites were depleted in the Ctrl HPV (+), LSIL, and HSIL groups compared to Ctrl HPV (\u2212) and ICC groups as shown in Fig. 5C and E. There were only a few metabolites that negatively correlated with genital inflammation but positively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance. These metabolites included nucleotides adenosine and cytosine and xenobiotics such as 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate and 1,2,3-benzenetriol. The relative levels of these nucleotides or xenobiotics were lower in the ICC group compared to other groups and the difference in cytosine levels between Ctrl HPV (\u2212) and ICC group and 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate between HSIL and ICC were statistically significant (Welch's two-sided t-test, q\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. 5D).",

In general, levels of the biogenic amines did not significantly differ among the groups (See Supplementary Fig. 3). Additionally, lactate levels strongly and positively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance. Interestingly, non-Lactobacillus dominated HSIL group had significantly lower levels of lactate compared to Ctrl HPV (\u2212) and ICC groups. A major Gardnerella associated metabolite, hippurate, did not correlate with either genital inflammation or Lactobacillus abundance. A metabolite that was mainly predicted to be modulated by Sneathia was NAD+ based on MIMOSA analysis. Additionally, NAD+ levels positively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance. Interestingly, NAD+ levels were significantly lower in HSIL compared to Ctrl HPV (\u2212). To better understand the associations independent from cancer, we performed the correlation analysis by excluding all ICC samples. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, we observed the same trend between metabolites that were associated with inflammation and Lactobacillus when the ICC samples were excluded. However, we observed minor differences in correlation coefficients of key metabolites, for example, \u03c1 for lactate and Lactobacillus abundance was greater (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.65 versus \u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.69) whereas \u03c1 for alpha-hydroxy-isovalerate and Lactobacillus abundance was slightly smaller (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f\u22120.59 versus \u03c1\u202f=\u202f\u22120.58) when the ICC samples were excluded.",

We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering using all identified metabolites to reveal whether any of these covariates drive the similarities between the metabolomes. Based on Euclidean distances among the metabolomes, samples were assembled into three clusters as shown in Fig. 6A. Cluster 1 (n\u202f=\u202f4) composed of only ICC patients, whereas Clusters 2 (n\u202f=\u202f29) and Cluster 3 (n\u202f=\u202f45) were not dominated by any particular participant group. The participant group composition of Cluster 1 was significantly different than Cluster 2 (Chi-Square test, p\u202f=\u202f.002) or Cluster 3 (chi-square test, p\u202f<\u202f.0001) (Fig. 6B). As ICC explained only Cluster 1, we evaluated other factors that might be defining Cluster 2 and 3. The genital inflammation score was greater in Cluster 1 compared to Clusters 2 and 3 as shown in Fig. 6C, which did not distinguish Cluster 2 from Cluster 3. Next, we evaluated Lactobacillus dominance. As in depicted in Fig. 6D, clusters had significantly different vaginal microbiota composition. Cluster 1 was solely dominated by NLD microbiota, whereas Cluster 2 was mainly consisted of participants with LD microbiota. Similar to Cluster 1, Cluster 3 mainly consisted of patients with NLD microbiota as well. Cluster 2 was dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners. On the other hand, Cluster 3 was dominated by polymicrobial communities followed by L. iners. Since vaginal pH and microbial composition are linked [6], as expected, vaginal pH of the patients in each cluster differed significantly as well. Individuals in Cluster 1, that was dominated by multiple non-Lactobacillus genera, had significantly higher vaginal pH compared to the individuals in Clusters 2 and 3. Cluster 2 was composed of participants with significantly lower vaginal pH (Fig. 6E) in accordance with Lactobacillus dominance, when compared to Cluster 1 (Mann-Whitney U test, p\u202f=\u202f.002) or Cluster 3 (Mann-Whitney U test, p\u202f=\u202f.046). Consistent with our previous observations, Lactobacillus dominance and vaginal pH better explained the clustering than the other variables. In summary, these results indicate that cancer, vaginal microbiota, and genital inflammation are robust drivers of cervicovaginal metabolomes.",

In addition, dysregulation of metabolism is an emerging hallmark of cancer [33]. A number of studies conducted on humans have shown a distinct metabolic fingerprint of cervical cancer in plasma [15], tumour tissues [16], faeces [17], and urine [34]. However, the impacts of HPV infection, cervical dysplasia and cancer on the metabolic profiles of the cervicovaginal microenvironment, a unique ecosystem where host epithelial and immune cells directly interact with viruses, bacteria and other environmental factors, have not been previously addressed. Unquestionably, metabolic fingerprinting of cervicovaginal lavages more accurately reflects the interactions between host and the microorganisms within the local microenvironment. Additionally, metabolic fingerprinting can provide insights into the interplay between persistent HPV infection, cervical neoplasm, and other features of the cervicovaginal microenvironment (i.e., genital inflammation, vaginal microbiome and vaginal pH) in the development of cervical dysplasia and progression to ICC. Here, we evaluated these metabolic interactions and characteristics of the cervicovaginal microenvironment (vaginal pH, vaginal microbiome, genital inflammation) in Ctrl HPV (\u2212), Ctrl HPV (+), LSIL, HSIL, and newly diagnosed ICC patient groups. We show that unique metabolic profiles, impacted by genital inflammation, vaginal pH, and the vaginal microbiome, predict patient groups and reflect profound differences in the host and microbe co-metabolism during HPV infection, cervical dysplasia, and ICC.",

A depletion of amino acid metabolites in HPV-positive and cervical dysplasia groups (LSIL and HSIL), and depletion of dipeptides in the HSIL group was replaced in ICC by enrichment of xenobiotics and lipids from plasmalogens, sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholines, and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Observation of xenobiotics, mainly anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, nafloxin, and their metabolites in the CVLs of ICC patients indicated a possible translocation of these drugs from blood to the cervix and vagina. A higher abundance of lipid metabolites in ICC patients compared to healthy individuals can be explained by an increase in cell proliferation and cell membrane synthesis through activation of oncogenic pathways in the tumour microenvironment [35]. Hence, enrichment of lipids in the cervicovaginal microenvironment relevant to nutrient acquisition validated one of the emerging hallmarks of cancer metabolism [33].",

A ketone body, 3-hydroxybutyrate, was elevated in ovarian cancer and was associated with invasion and migration of cancer cells [37,38]. Additionally, 3-hydroxybutyrate augments tumour growth in-vitro epithelial cell models [39]. A systematic review of 23 metabolome studies in ovarian cancer highlighted abnormally high levels of lipids including, oleate/vaccenate and eicosenoate in the serum [40], an observation consistent with the metabolic profiles we observed in the CVLs of ICC patients. In addition, elevated levels of oleic acid have been previously observed in cervical cancer biopsies [41] and oleic acid has been shown to promote cervical cancer cell growth in-vitro [42], thus validating our findings. Interestingly, these markers are not only specific to cancer, but also linked to inflammation and obesity, two comorbidities related to cancer [43]. Genital inflammation and high BMI are also characteristics of our patients although BMI did not significantly differ among the patient groups.",

Depletion of metabolites from taurine, glutamine and lysine metabolism, key amino acids that are involved in cellular growth [44], in HPV-positive women and cervical dysplasia patients indicates disruption of healthy cell metabolism as a functional consequence of potential HPV-mediated dysbiosis. Glutamine, a critical amino acid for tumour cell growth [33], and phosphoethanolamine, a well-established anti-tumour agent [45], were found to be strong discriminators of healthy patients vs. the HSIL patients.

However, the biological mechanisms and host-microbe interactions that drive persistence and carcinogenesis have not been elucidated. Thus, we integrated microbiome and metabolome data sets using the state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools (MIMOSA and AMON) to reveal a functional impact of microbiomes on metabolic fingerprints. Using a predicted relative metabolic turnover model on our measured community metabolome, we provide unique insights into the microbial contribution to observed metabolomes beyond correlations between microbial genera and metabolites. Our analysis based on microbial genomes indicated that differences in non-Lactobacillus dominated (NLD) communities compared to Lactobacillus-dominated (LD) communities specifically affect the flux of dipeptides, amino acid and nucleotide metabolites, which was consistent with a previous report that employed the same modelling technique on metabolomes in bacterial vaginosis (BV) [29]. Our NLD communities were enriched in multiple microbial genera including Gardnerella, Prevotella, Streptococcus and Atopobium, that were typically found in BV patients [13,[49], [50], [51]]. A decrease in the abundance of vaginal Lactobacillus species in BV patients was previously associated with an increase in the biogenic amine levels, amino acid degradation products and depletion of dipeptides [12,13,51,52]. Hence our findings agree with the observation that microbial diversity in the vaginal milieu alters amino acid metabolism.",

                    "text": "Our study design excluded symptomatic BV patients, however we observed several metabolic signatures of BV in our dataset. For example, deoxycarnitine [12] and alpha-hydroxyisovalerate [52], previously identified as signatures of BV, were negatively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance. Interestingly, other acylcarnitines that are known pro-inflammatory cytokine inducers [53] were significantly associated with genital inflammation and Lactobacillus abundance. We also observed BV-associated Gardnerella was the main contributor to hippurate metabolism. Hippurate degradation is not only used as a test for Gardnerella identification [54], but also used in pathogen detection. Another important metabolic signature of BV is presence of biogenic amines. Three out of ten polyamines were significantly enriched in the NLD metabolomes and five BV-associated biogenic amines (cadaverine, putrescine, tyramine, tryptamine, and agmatine) [13,55] negatively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance, however their levels were not significantly different between LD and NLD communities. Notably, none of these biogenic amines were positively or negatively associated with genital inflammation. Arginine and its polyamine product N(1)-acetylspermine are indicative of rapidly proliferating cells [56] and positively correlated with Lactobacillus abundance and genital inflammation. Previously, arginine metabolism was previously highlighted as an emerging hallmark of cancer [33]. Interestingly, N(1)-acetylspermine levels are increased in severely inflamed sites in colorectal cancer patients [57], indicating a potential role of this polyamine in severe inflammation in accordance with our genital inflammation findings. However, other BV-associated biogenic amines did not correlate with genital inflammation. Metabolites that are precursors of biogenic amines including choline and betaine have anti-inflammatory properties [58,59]. Betaine enhances survival and provides protection to Lactobacillus species facing osmotic stress [60]. Future comparative studies that incorporate microbiomes to metabolomes in symptomatic and asymptomatic BV patients will further enhance the understanding of the role of microbes and microbe-host interactions in the context of vaginal dysbiosis and BV.",

GCDC, a key metabolic product of host-microbe co-metabolism [61], can inhibit several pathogens that are also observed in vaginal dysbiosis and BV [62]. Similar to other bile acids, GCDC induces inflammatory and toxic responses and exhibits carcinogenic effects on host epithelial cells [63]. Our observation of negative correlation with Lactobacillus abundance and positive correlation with genital inflammation further strengthened the link between GCDC, inflammation, and Lactobacillus abundance. As such, future studies are needed to investigate the role of GCDC in maintaining Lactobacillus-mediated homeostasis, as well as pathogen exclusion in the lower reproductive tract.",

Microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions through metabolic networks can shape the local tumour environment [64], hence dysbiotic vaginal microbiome-mediated metabolome has the potential to become a hallmark of cervical cancer. Additionally, the metabolites produced by the cancer microenvironment itself, including lipids, can enhance the crosstalk between microbiota and the host, and therefore the pro-carcinogenic activities of the microbiota.",

Notably, the lipids that discriminated the ICC group from the healthy group showed a strong positive correlation to genital inflammation. However, our additional analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4) excluding ICC patients showed that lipids remained associated with genital inflammation independent from cancer. An increase in lipid metabolites from plasmalogens and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in ICC, not only indicate abnormality in cellular metabolism, but also highlight the significance of lipids in cancer development, due to their roles as precursors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inducers of abnormal gene expression and ability to dysregulate cytokine production [65]. Interestingly, phosphatidylcholines, another group of lipids that positively correlated with genital inflammation, are typically known for their anti-inflammatory properties [66], but also contribute to cellular proliferation and programmed cell death [67].",

When the correlation analysis was performed without the ICC patients included, the correlation between lactate and Lactobacillus was stronger and there was a trend towards negative correlation with genital inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 4). Lactic acid is the main end-product of Lactobacillus-mediated fermentation [72], and is a critical metabolite to maintain low vaginal pH (<4.5) and homeostasis in the vaginal microenvironment [73]. Higher levels of lactate and lower vaginal pH observed in Lactobacillus dominated communities compared to non-Lactobacillus-dominated communities are in agreement with other studies relating this molecule to vaginal health and homeostasis [12,73,74]. In a murine model, lactate was shown to inhibit the pro-inflammatory response of macrophages [75], hence our data highlight a potential anti-inflammatory role of lactate in the lower reproductive tract. Additionally, lactic acid can induce secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10, reduce the production of proinflammatory IL-12 in dendritic cells, and diminish the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells [76]. On the other hand, lactate is also one of the main cellular respiration products of cancer cells, previously established as a biomarker of cervical cancer tumours [77] and is associated with angiogenesis and immunotolerance [76]. Therefore, the dual role of lactate in health and disease, its origin, and relationship to genital inflammation in the context of gynaecologic cancer warrants further investigation.",

First, it provides a snapshot of metabolic communications between the host, microbiome, and HPV. Correspondingly, metabolic profiling is the first step to understand host-microbiota interplay in modulating the hallmarks of cancer in the context of HPV. Second, CVL collection is non-invasive method that may provide more biological insights into the mechanisms of viral persistence and disease progression. Finally, the limitations and challenges in murine and non-human primate models are avoided since these models do not faithfully recapitulate the composition of vaginal microbiota in humans [78]. A limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size and future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate and extend our findings. However, the results presented herein generate additional questions on virus-host epithelia and immune system interactions that can be addressed by metabolic profiling in future clinical studies. In addition, studies employing physiologically relevant 3-dimensional human FRT models [[78], [79], [80], [81]] could reveal biological mechanisms into how these microbes are dysregulating host metabolism and contributing to the hallmarks of cancer.",

Our observations on genital inflammation- and microbiota-associated metabolic signatures connect the microbiome to inflammation, dysplasia, and cancer. Collectively, our analysis revealed that cancer had the greatest impact on metabolic profiles and genital inflammation, and vaginal microbiota had a secondary impact that explained metabolic profiles of healthy HPV-negative, HPV-positive individuals, and cervical dysplasia patients. Our analysis clearly demonstrated that metabolic fingerprinting of the cervicovaginal microenvironment is an excellent approach to discriminate between individuals with HPV infection, cervical dysplasia and ICC, which may facilitate future discoveries of new therapeutic and prevention avenues for patients. This integrative analysis of the cervicovaginal metabolome, microbiome and immunoproteome revealed multiple emerging hallmarks of cancer in cervical carcinogenesis, including abnormalities in nitrogen and energy metabolism, increased cellular proliferation due to changes in amino acid and carbohydrate fluxes, and dysbiotic microbiota and host-microbe co-metabolism [33,82]. In conclusion, the complex virus-host-microbe interplay within the cervicovaginal microenvironment lead to unique metabolic fingerprints that may be exploited for future development of diagnostics, preventatives or therapeutics to positively impact women's health outcomes.",
