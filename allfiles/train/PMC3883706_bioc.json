In order to elucidate the contribution of the gut metagenome to the complex mosaic of human longevity, we applied shotgun sequencing to total fecal bacterial DNA in a selection of samples belonging to a well-characterized human ageing cohort. The age-related trajectory of the human gut microbiome was characterized by loss of genes for shortchain fatty acid production and an overall decrease in the saccharolytic potential, while proteolytic functions were more abundant than in the intestinal metagenome of younger adults. This altered functional profile was associated with a relevant enrichment in \u201cpathobionts\u201d, i.e. opportunistic pro-inflammatory bacteria generally present in the adult gut ecosystem in low numbers. Finally, as a signature for long life we identified 116 microbial genes that significantly correlated with ageing. Collectively, our data emphasize the relationship between intestinal bacteria and human metabolism, by detailing the modifications in the gut microbiota as a consequence of and/or promoter of the physiological changes occurring in the human host upon ageing.",

The ageing process seriously affects the human gut microbiota in particular, because it is accompanied by changes in the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract and associated immune system, as well as by changes in diet and lifestyle [2,3]. The adult-like profile of the human intestinal microbiota is stably maintained over time in healthy adults [4,5], defining an essentially mutualistic scenario whereby, in return for a guaranteed nutrient supply, the gut microbiota provides numerous fundamental functions to the host, including vitamin and metabolite supply and colonization resistance against pathogens [6]. The pathophysiology of the ageing process can ultimately compromise this homeostasis with a subject-specific timing, depending on the individual physiological status, diet, lifestyle and frailty [7-13].",

An important factor which affects the gut microbiota in ageing is diet [18]. A very recent study highlighted the impact of the habitual diet on the gut microbiota of elderly people, demonstrating diet-driven alterations in varying rates of health decline upon ageing [19]. In that study, a reduced coding capacity for producing short-chain fatty acids in frail subjects correlated with lower levels of butyrate, acetate and propionate in the fecal metabolome. However, the functional aspects of the intestinal microbial community and their relation with the ageing process are not frequently investigated. Indeed, the majority of recent studies focussing on the relationship between ageing and the gut microbiota used a 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing approach, which reflects the phylogenetic structure of the microbiota but does not provide information pertaining to function. Even if microbiota compositional information allows a large number of deductions to be inferred, a metagenomics approach is ultimately required, because it provides a view of community structure in terms of species richness and distribution, as well as the functional (metabolic) potential of the community metagenome [20].",

We hypothesized that centenarians represent a valuable opportunity for increasing the temporal resolution of microbiota-ageing interactions. The particular physiology and the general inflammatory status of centenarians make these individuals very different from the rest of the population, including in terms of gut microbiota composition [8]. In a very recent study, the metabolomic profile of centenarians was also characterized, allowing the identification of some urine metabotypes which were strongly connected with extreme ageing and some intestinal microbiota elements [22]. In the present pilot work, by determining the centenarian gut microbiome we propose a wide functional description of the human gut microbiota upon ageing.",

By using the genus coordinates of the taxonomic PCoA and their mean contribution in the groups, two node graphs, respectively for centenarians and 70-year-old subjects, were obtained. Figure \u200bFigure22 thus shows the gut microbiota fingerprints at the genus level in centenarians and elderly. In the center of the resulting graphs were positioned the genus-nodes that were equally abundant in all the samples while the other areas of the graph contained genus-nodes present at different relative abundance across the subjects.

Alpha-diversity was computed at KO level using the Simpson index and was not significantly different between the age groups (centenarians, 0.904 \u00b1 0.010; the elderly, 0.892 \u00b1 0.061). PCoA based on Euclidean distances of functional gene profiles at KO level showed an age-related resolution (Figure \u200b(Figure4a).4a). In particular, the first axis, which represented 82.5% of the data variability, described most of the ageing-related differences (Kendall's tau coefficient = \u22120.778, p value = 0.002, Figure \u200bFigure4b).4b). For this reason, we used PCo1 to assess the functional potential of the gut microbiome upon ageing. In particular, we focused our attention on the genes involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolisms, core genes in metabolism, in order to obtain an ordination of the pathways along PCo1. Each point of the resulting graph corresponded to the average of the coordinates of the KO genes involved in the same KEGG pathway, and the intervals coincided with the standard error of the mean (SEM; Figure \u200bFigure4c).4c). In this way, we built a sort of ranking of KEGG pathways, where negative values of PCo1 coordinates were related with ageing. We observed a polarization of the pathways related to amino acid metabolism in the extremities of the axis, and a more dense localization at positive values of PCo1 coordinates for the pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. In particular, the metabolism of two aromatic amino acids, tryptophan and phenylalanine, was closely associated with ageing, followed by the metabolism of other amino acids, such as tyrosine, valine and lysine. Conversely, the metabolism of other amino acids and several carbohydrates, such as glucose, galactose, histidine, pyruvate and butanoate was related to high positive values of PCo1. Notably, the last two pathways are strictly connected with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production.",

Here we focused on the functional aspects of the gut microbiota, in order to investigate ageing-related changes of the microbiome structure and function. Confirming Biagi et al. (2010) [8], multivariate analysis of the taxonomic dataset showed an overall increase in Proteobacteria and a re-arrangement in Firmicutes in centenarians, whereas 70-year-old elderly people maintained a gut microbiota profile very similar to the one shown by the young adult. The Procrustes analysis highlighted the relationships between taxonomic and functional datasets, showing a clear separation between centenarians and younger subjects with respect to both microbiome structure and functionality. Shotgun sequencing analysis revealed important modifications in microbiota functions in centenarians, allowing us to define an aged-type microbiome characterized by a specific functional complement different from the one present in younger subjects. As a result of taxonomic rearrangements in the gut microbiota composition, the changes in microbiome structure we detected as a function of aging allowed us to shed some light on the mechanisms associated with bacterial community change accompanying the overall ageing process.",

                    "text": "Examining the KO gene abundance we identified a cluster including all the centenarian subjects, separated from the clustered younger subjects. While at high level of KEGG assignments the functional structure of the microbiota was present in both clusters without significant differences, the distribution of genes at KO levels followed an age-related tendency. Among these, we observed an age-related increased abundance of genes involved in the tryptophan metabolism pathway (ko00380). This evidence is in agreement with the reduction of tryptophan found in serum of centenarians [22], although we cannot directly infer causality. Linking together the two observations, we advance the hypothesis that the potential increase of consumption of tryptophan by the gut microbiota affects its bioavailability within the host. A recent study showed patients with inflammatory diseases to have a significant depletion of serum levels of tryptophan compared to control population [23] and Huang et al. demonstrated a clear relationship between reduced serum tryptophan levels and an increase of immune activation [24]. In addition, the decrease of the serum level of tryptophan was associated with cognitive deficit in senile dementias [25-27], and Noristani et al. demonstrated that high triptophan diet lead to a reduction of the plaque pathology in Alzheimer's disease in mouse [28]. It is thus tempting to speculate that a microbiota-dependent reduction of tryptophan can nurture inflammaging in centenarians and could worsen the conditions of the patients affected by cognitive deficit. Furthermore, our study revealed that the altered abundance of genes involved in phenylalanine metabolism (ko00360) and tyrosine metabolism (ko00350) was related with ageing. This evidence supports the proposal of two metabolites (phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) and p-cresol-sulfate (PCS)), as markers in urine of extreme ageing [22]. Indeed, it has been extensively demonstrated that PAG and PCS derive from microbial metabolism of aromatic amino acids, including tyrosine and phenylalanine [29]. Short-chain fatty acids \u2013 mainly acetate, butyrate and proprionate \u2013 are microbiota-derived metabolites that are fundamental for the human health and wellbeing. They represent a source of energy for the gastrointestinal epithelium, stimulators for the release of mucins, immune modulators, and promoters of the integrity of the epithelial barrier [30,31]. Primarily, SCFAs are produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary polysaccharides which reach the colon undigested. This process relies on the presence of a glycophilic bacterial community in the colon, and also on other bacterial groups acting in concert with these primary degraders [19,32,33]. It has been demonstrated that a reduced dietary intake of carbohydrates causes decreased numbers of butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria such as Roseburia and Eubacterium [34], highlighting the importance of carbohydrate availability in the large intestine for the maintenance of a fibrolytic SCFA-producing microbial community. In relation to this, our data showed a loss of genes involved in SCFA production and an overall decrease in the saccharolytic potential as a function of aging. In particular, in the extremely aged-type microbiome we observed a decrease in starch and sucrose metabolism (ko00500), pyruvate metabolism (ko00620), galactose metabolism (ko00052) and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (ko00010), accompanied by a concomitant loss of fibrolytic microorganisms belonging to the Eubacterium, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium genera. Notably, pyruvate and butanoate metabolism, which showed an inverse association with aging, are described in KEGG database as pathways containing genes involved in SCFA production. Our data showed an overall rearrangement in the aged-type microbiome of the pathways involved in the production of SCFA via proteolytic fermentation. In particular, genes involved in lysine degradation (ko00310), implicated in butyrate and acetate production, were more abundant in centenarians, while elderly and adults were enriched in genes responsible for the metabolism of glutamate, aspartate and alanine (ko00250), which in turn are involved in the production of acetate, butyrate and propionate, respectively [35]. Nevertheless, the aged-type microbiome was characterized by an overall increase in proteolytic functions, as suggested also by the degradation of the branched-chain amino acids, valine, leucine and isoleucine (ko00280), which was strictly connected with the microbial metagenome of centenarians. Notably, the first catabolic intermediates of valine, isoleucine and leucine are the precursors of the branched-chain fatty acids that are involved in the cell membrane biosynthesis of inflammation-promoting Gram-negative bacteria [36,37]. Interestingly, the increased abundance of proteolytic functions in the aged-type microbiome is accompanied by lower lysine, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthetic capability (ko00290; ko00300). All these molecules are essential amino acids, with the respective biosynthetic pathways completely lacking in mammals. In particular, lysine plays an essential role in many cellular process, including the functionality of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex [38,39]. Reduction in the microbiota production of essential amino acids as part of aging could thus have a primary role in compromising the overall nutritional state of elderly subjects, leading to sarcopenia.",

Furthermore, we found an age-related reduction of the abundance of genes in pathways involved in SCFA production. Based on differential abundance, the aged-type microbiota is structurally and functionally compromised, moving from a saccharolytic to a putrefactive metabolism. It is noteworthy that these microbiome alterations concord with the enrichment of genes belonging to pathobionts. Pathobionts are minor microbiota opportunists able to thrive in inflamed conditions, sustaining and nurturing the physiological inflammation [14]. We therefore postulate that pathobiont overgrowth can nurture a sort of pro-inflammatory loop which could worsen the health status of aged people. We can also hypothesize that in centenarians \u2013the extreme limit of human life span \u2013 some readjustments take place within the core mutualistic microbiome functions that serve to offset detrimental activities associated with pathobiont overgrowth. In order to shed some light on this, we focused our analysis on the core microbiome changes occurring in centenarians. According to our findings, 116 genes usually present in different metagenome project databases [40-43], reflect the rearrangement of the core metabolic potential of the centenarian intestinal microbial ecosystem. This raises the question of whether these specific changes in the structure of the mutualistic counterpart of the gut microbiome reflect a new mutualistic configuration, responding to a microbiota-host adaptation process co-evolved to support the extreme limits of human lifespan.",

Furthermore, since the subjects belong to a limited geographic area (Emilia Romagna region), and are thus similar in lifestyle and habitual dietary patterns, these data also need confirmation across populations with different environmental conditions and genetic background. Nevertheless, our microbiome study of extreme ageing contributes to assess a more inclusive portrayal of the role of the intestinal bacterial counterpart in the pathophysiology of the ageing process. An ongoing project (www.nu-age.eu) will also include analysis of different dietary regimes in the ageing human population, to allow searching for correlations between gut microbiota composition and functionality, physiological and immunological parameters, metabonomic profiles and diet.",
