Sex is a key biologic variable for several disorders. Our aim was to determine sex-based differences in response to perturbation and subsequent recovery of intestinal barrier function and microbiota in healthy humans. Twenty-three volunteers underwent duodenal biopsies, mucosal impedance, and in vivo permeability measurement. Permeability testing was repeated after administration of indomethacin, then 4 to 6 wk after its discontinuation. Duodenal and fecal microbiota composition was determined using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Healthy women had lower intestinal permeability and higher duodenal and fecal microbial diversity than healthy men. Intestinal permeability increases after indomethacin administration in both sexes. However, only women demonstrated decreased fecal microbial diversity, including an increase in Prevotella abundance, after indomethacin administration. Duodenal microbiota composition did not show sex-specific changes. The increase in permeability and microbiota changes normalized after discontinuation of indomethacin. In summary, women have lower intestinal permeability and higher microbial diversity. Intestinal permeability is sensitive to perturbation but recovers to baseline. Gut microbiota in women is sensitive to perturbation but appears to be more stable in men. Sex-based differences in intestinal barrier function and microbiome should be considered in future studies.\u2014Edogawa, S., Peters, S. A., Jenkins, G. D., Gurunathan, S. V., Sundt, W.

It is a selectively permeable barrier restricting the passage of pathogens, toxins, and intraluminal antigens while allowing passage of nutrients, electrolytes, and water (1). Intestinal microbiota is integral to cross-talk with the intestinal epithelium. Changes in intestinal mucosal barrier function or microbiota can influence each other bidirectionally. Barrier function can be assessed ex vivo by measuring transmucosal resistance (TMR) and flux of macromolecules across tissues in an Ussing chamber (2). For in vivo assessment, urinary excretion of orally ingested substances such as lactulose, mannitol, sucrose, sucralose, rhamnose, polymers of polyethylene glycol, 51Cr-EDTA, and 99mTc-DTPA can be used (3). Lactulose and mannitol are among the most commonly used molecules, in tandem, for assessing intestinal permeability. Lactulose is a disaccharide with a molecular diameter of 9.5 \u00c5, which can only move across larger spaces or defects of tight junctions at the crypt, providing a primary parameter for paracellular permeability (4).",

However, it is not known whether there are baseline sex differences in intestinal permeability in healthy humans. Microbiota differences have been reported between healthy women and men (8, 9). In human studies, up to 75% of individuals demonstrate an increase in intestinal permeability after NSAIDs, making it a model for studying dynamics of intestinal barrier function and effect of variables like sex (10\u201313). Sex was not associated with intestinal inflammation in arthritis patients who received chronic therapy with NSAIDs; however, the effect on intestinal permeability was not studied (14).

Germ-free and antibiotic-treated rats do not develop small intestinal ulcers upon treatment with indomethacin, suggesting that microbiota are essential in mediating NSAID-induced intestinal injury (16, 17). Indomethacin-induced enteropathy in mice has been associated with changes in microbiota composition (18, 19). In a study involving detailed regional profiling of different luminal and mucosal segments of the intestine, indomethacin resulted in microbiota changes across colon and feces but not small bowel (20). Human studies have shown mixed results, including differences in fecal bacterial profiles among chronic NSAID recipients (21), whereas there was no differences after acute administration (22).

Lactulose (1000 mg), 12C mannitol (100 mg), and 13C mannitol (100 mg) were dissolved in 250 ml of water and were orally administered to volunteers.

HPLC\u2013mass spectrometry was used to measure saccharide concentrations in urine samples. Cumulative concentration of each saccharide was calculated for each time interval. Because 13C makes up 1% of naturally occurring carbon, concentrations of 13C mannitol were corrected for the percentage of 13C in 12C mannitol, as previously described (2). Cumulative lactulose concentrations at 0 to 2 h and 2 to 24 h were used to report proximal small intestinal and distal small intestinal/colonic permeability, respectively (24).

A 2-step PCR protocol was used to amplify the V3 to V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene and then add Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) flow cell adaptors containing indices (amplicon size 694 nt). Modified primers were used: V3_341F_Nextera: 5\u2032-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3\u2032 and V5_926R_Nextera: 5\u2032-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT-3\u2032. The PCR products were diluted, cleaned, quantified, and normalized using a Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The 16S amplicon pools were quantified using the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) and sequenced using the MiSeq 600 Cycle v.3 Kit (Illumina) and MCS v.2.6.1 (paired reads 2 \u00d7 300 bp). DNA extraction from duodenal aspirates was performed using the phenol chloroform method. The V4 region was amplified and barcoded, followed by sequencing with the MiSeq 600 Cycle v.3 Kit (Illumina).",

Four \u03b1-diversity indices (within-sample diversity) were calculated: observed number of OTUs, Chao1 estimator, Shannon, and inverse Simpson index on the rarefied microbiome data (rarefied to 20,000 reads). A linear mixed-effects model was used for testing the covariate effects (i.e., sex, treatment, and sex\u2013treatment interaction) on \u03b1 diversity, accounting for correlation within subject with different intercepts per subject (random effect for subject). For independent samples, a linear regression model was used. A Wald-type test was used for assessing statistical significance. \u03b2 diversity reflects the shared diversity between bacterial populations in terms of ecological distance; pairwise distance metrics allow quantification of differences between samples (27). Four \u03b2-diversity measures [unweighted, generalized (\u03b1 = 0.5), weighted UniFrac distances, and Bray-Curtis distance] were calculated using a rarefied OTU table and a phylogenetic tree. To test the association between the covariates and \u03b2-diversity measures, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) tests were used. Ordination plots were generated using principal coordinate analysis as implemented in R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://www.r-project.org/) for association of covariates with the \u03b2 diversities.",

To identify differentially abundant taxa associated with covariates and to account for the nonnormality of the count data, a permutation-based approach was used based on the F statistics of a linear model (square root\u2013transformed taxa relative abundance as the response variable) and within-subject permutation to account for within-subject correlation. Additionally, nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests between pairs of study visits were conducted. False discovery rate (FDR) control (B-H procedure from \u201cP.adjust\u201d in the R stats package) was used to correct for multiple testing of the permutation based tests, and FDR-adjusted values of P < 0.05 or q < 0.05 were considered significant (pairwise visit tests were not corrected for multiple testing).",

At the species level, the OTU10 of Prevotella, which had 99% sequence homology with Prevotella copri, increased in abundance in women (baseline: 0.027, after indomethacin administration: 0.04, P = 0.01), whereas it remained unchanged in men (baseline: 0.1, after indomethacin administration: 0.07, P = 0.4) (Fig. 6). The \u03b1 and \u03b2 microbiota diversity 4 to 6 wk after discontinuation of indomethacin was similar to baseline (data not shown).",

                    "text": "This study makes several important observations about intestinal barrier function and microbiota in healthy humans with an emphasis on sex-based differences at baseline and in response to perturbation using NSAIDs. First, in vivo small intestinal and colonic permeability is lower in healthy women than healthy men. Women also had higher in vivo duodenal impedance and ex vivo duodenal TMR. These findings suggest the presence of a stronger intestinal barrier in healthy women. Second, healthy women have greater fecal and duodenal microbial diversity compared to healthy men. Third, the NSAID indomethacin increases both duodenal and colonic permeability, which returns to baseline 4 to 6 wk after discontinuation of indomethacin, thus suggesting resilience in intestinal barrier function. Fourth, indomethacin administration is associated with decrease in microbial diversity in duodenal and fecal contents, especially in women, which recovers 4 to 6 wk later.",

Another study based on gas chromatography showed no effect of sex on the measurement of intestinal permeability using lactulose and mannitol excretion (30). A number of animal studies have reflected sex difference in intestinal barrier function. Estrogen receptor knockout mice displayed disruptions in tight junctions and desmosome (31). Macromolecular flux was found to be higher in male Sprague Dawley rat ileum than female (32). Colonic permeability increased in ovariectomized rats, and estradiol decreased colonic permeability by up-regulating occludin and junctional adhesion molecule A in epithelial cells (33). Oral treatment with a soy germ\u2013fermented ingredient rich in phytoestrogen reduced stress-induced intestinal permeability and visceral hypersensitivity in female rats (34). Estrogen has also been found to increase production and viscosity of mucin, which can also reinforce intestinal barrier (35). Our data convincingly suggest lower intestinal permeability or a stronger mucosal barrier in women, which is in concordance with work in animal models. The putative mechanisms for sex-based differences in barrier include a protective role of estrogens in maintenance of barrier function in the female sex, either by direct effects on tight junctions or mucus, or through neuroimmune interactions, which can also affect the intestinal barrier in a sex-dependent manner (36, 37).",

Decreased microbial diversity has been described in conditions with increased intestinal permeability, like irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease (38, 39). Hence, it is plausible that a greater microbial diversity is another possible mechanism for a stronger intestinal barrier in women. Our results showed greater abundance of Actinobacteria phylum but lower abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in women compared to men. The class Bacteroidia and order Bacteroidales both had lower abundance in women than men in our study. A study from Europe has shown greater abundance of genus Bacteroides in healthy females compared to healthy males (9). In another study, at the species level, Bacteroides caccae was higher in females, whereas Bacteroides plebeius and Coprococcus catus were higher in males (8). However, our study did not find genus- or species-level differences between female and male subjects. This study also found that females had higher abundance of genus Bilophila, whereas males had higher abundance of Veillonella and Methanobrevibacter genera (8). Duodenal microbiome composition of healthy female and male subjects has not been reported previously. Although we found changes in \u03b1 diversity, likely as a result of the small sample size, we did not detect differences at FDR <0.05 in taxonomic representation. Future studies in a larger cohort of patients will have to replicate these findings, especially sex-based differences in the duodenal microbiome. The duodenal aspirates were collected 24 h after a single administration of lactulose, and it would be unlikely to observe major shifts in the duodenal microbiome. Moreover, because the procedure was exactly the same at both visits, we expect any variability due to lactulose to be similar at the two time points.",

Observations that germ-free mice are protected against NSAID-induced intestinal injury have demonstrated an important role of intestinal microbiota in this process (16, 17). Acute administration of indomethacin can induce intestinal injury and changes in small bowel and colonic microbiota (18, 40). These effects on the microbiota can also be seen upon chronic administration (20). Outside of direct and local effects on the epithelium, the microbiota can influence NSAID-induced intestinal injury through changes in bile acid milieu (41), drug metabolism, and enterohepatic circulation (42, 43). In general, NSAID enteropathy is characterized by increased abundance of gram-negative bacteria (40, 44\u201346), plausibly inducing injury through bacterial LPS in a Toll-like receptor 4-dependent manner (47). Antibiotics against gram-negative flora have been shown to be effective against prevention of NSAID enteropathy both in animal models (16, 40, 48, 49) and in humans (50\u201352). Conversely, vancomycin, an agent that targets gram-positive bacteria, was associated with relative increase in abundance of gram-negative bacteria and worsening of NSAID-induced intestinal injury (19). Additionally, Bifidobacterium (44, 45)- and Lactobacillus (53\u201355)-based probiotics have been found to be protective against NSAID enteropathy.",

                    "text": "Our study showed that women demonstrated a decrease in microbiota diversity and an associated increase in fecal Bacteroidetes; Prevotellaceae, a gram-negative family, and decrease in Firmicutes; Ruminococcus, a gram-positive genus, after indomethacin administration. At the species level, OTU10, which shares a 99% sequence homology with Prevotella copri, was significantly increased after indomethacin administration in women but remained unchanged in men. Women had lower abundance of Prevotella than men before indomethacin administration (baseline visit). This plausibly suggests that permeability increase after NSAIDs is microbiome dependent in women but not in men. Additionally, changes in the duodenal microbiota did not reveal any sex-specific differences, and in fact showed a decrease in Proteobacteria, a gram-negative phylum, providing observations contrary to findings from animal studies. The relative contribution of duodenal and colonic microbiota in the pathophysiology of NSAID enteropathy needs to be further clarified. Interestingly, although the use of proton pump inhibitors has helped reduce upper gastrointestinal complications from NSAID use, the incidence of lower gastrointestinal bleeding increased, suggesting a compounding role of dysbiosis induced by proton pump inhibitors in NSAID enteropathy (56). A limitation of the study is that microbiota changes are associations with NSAID administration rather than clarifying the contribution of small bowel and colon microbiota on NSAID enteropathy, which can be hard to study in humans. Additionally, the sample size is relatively small. Regardless, our findings provide insight into shifts in microbiota composition after acute administration of NSAIDs in an otherwise healthy population, as well as insight into the association of microbiota changes with changes in intestinal permeability.",

A significant variation in permeability measurement was observed over repeated measurements in a group of patients with celiac disease treated with placebo (57). This raised the question of temporal stability and resilience of intestinal permeability measurement that had not been examined previously. A longitudinal cohort study of African adults showed significant longitudinal and seasonal variability in villous height, xylose excretion, and LMR; however, a significant proportion of these were HIV positive and had undiagnosed intestinal infections (58). To study this, we used a rigorous protocol of measuring in vivo intestinal barrier function longitudinally and assessing response to perturbation using NSAID challenge and subsequent recovery. This demonstrated that the measurements made by saccharide excretion are temporally stable in healthy individuals, considering their complete recovery to baseline values 4 to 6 wk after acute perturbation. Changes in permeability over the course of stable or fluctuating disease activity in nonhealth states (celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome) remain to be further studied.",

The intestinal barrier function is sensitive to perturbation with indomethacin but recovers after discontinuation of indomethacin. Finally, gut microbiota composition and diversity among women and men is also different at baseline and is more affected by NSAIDs in women. Future studies will need to confirm these findings in a larger cohort and examine whether specific microbial signatures can predict vulnerability to NSAID-induced intestinal injury. However, sex-based differences in baseline intestinal permeability and microbiome should be considered in future studies.",
