The study of the effects of probiotic Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 (CBM588) on intestine transplantees indicated an increased percentage of the \u201cother glycan degradation\u201d pathway in 16S-rRNA-inferred metagenomes. To verify the prediction, a scoring system of carbohydrate metabolisms derived from shotgun metagenomes was developed using hidden Markov models. A significant correlation (R\u2009=\u20090.9, p\u2009<\u20090.015) between both modalities was demonstrated. An independent validation revealed a strong complementarity (R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.97, p\u2009<\u20090.002) between the scores and the abundance of \u201cglycogen degradation\u201d in bacteria communities. On applying the system to bacteria genomes, CBM588 had only 1 match and ranked higher than the other 8 bacteria evaluated. The gram-stain properties were significantly correlated to the scores (p\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124). The distributions of the scored protein domains indicated that CBM588 had a considerably higher (p\u2009<\u200910\u22125) proportion of carbohydrate-binding modules than other bacteria, which suggested the superior ability of CBM588 to access carbohydrates as a metabolic driver to the bowel microbiome. These results demonstrated the use of integrated counts of protein domains as a feasible readout for metabolic potential within bacteria genomes and human metagenomes.",

Alternatively, bioinformatic pipelines can directly interpret shotgun metagenomes11. However most of these pipelines require specialized programs or a series of tools to yield results that are difficult to interpret for individuals without specialized knowledge such as patients.

Although the survival rate of patients after SBT is now 70%12 with the assistance of optimized immunosuppressants, further improvements could be made. Studies have found that bacteria diversities in bowels can confer a favorable prognosis factor in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation13. Patients who do and do not reject SBTs do have different compositions of ileal microbiota14. A proactive measure to control gut microbiota could be a valuable addition to the care of SBT patients. Probiotics could be a promising option in suitable candidates. Based on these considerations and the results of 16S-based taxonomic and functional analyses, we successfully developed a scoring system that not only had favorable correlations with 16S-based reports but also offered mechanistic insights into how CBM588 drives the evolution of fecal bacteria communities in SBT recipients. The scores were based on integrated counts of carbohydrate-active protein domains after probability analyses were conducted using hidden Markov models. This system indicates the potential of protein domain\u2013based scoring of focused metabolisms as readouts for understanding probiotic characteristics and their effects on fecal metagenomes.",

Stool samples were collected before, 1 week after, and 1 month after CBM588 ingestion. Microbiota were profiled by sequencing 16S rRNA-based amplicons8 with a paired-end approach (raw read numbers are presented in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1A). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined using a USEARCH-based pipeline15. Rarefaction curves of distinct OTUs were constructed by administering 10 random samplings for each patient (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1B). At each depth, the averages of unique OTUs were plotted. All rarefaction curves showed saturating behaviors with an increase in read depths. To compensate for uneven read numbers among different samples, 10 randomly rarefied data sets with normalized reads in mapped OTU format were prepared from the original data sets before downstream analyses were conducted (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2A).

There were 69 to 74 SILVA-mapped families among the 10 rarefied data sets. Only those that satisfied both SVC and LR models among at least half of the rarefied data sets were selected. We identified Bacteroidaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Veillonellaceae among all rarefactions, and Clostridiaceae was observed in half of the data sets (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3D and Fig.\u00a01E). At 1 month, the abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Veillonellaceae increased from 4.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02% to 21.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06% and 10.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03% to 11.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04% (SD), respectively (Fig.\u00a01E). By contrast, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae decreased from 41.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04% to 34.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04% and 6.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01% to 2.66\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02% (SD), respectively.

Variations in associated KEGG pathways were further analyzed using PCA. All rarefied data sets yielded similar plots (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S6), with the 1-month administration of CBM588 causing significant shifts in the plots for most patients (Fig.\u00a02A, triangles vs. circles of the same color). The first 2 components explained 63.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10% and 22.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10% (SD) of total variances, respectively. To select feature pathways that were most associated with the 1-month ingestion of CBM588, SVC20 and LR21 models were tested against all rarefied data sets. Only those pathways chosen by both models would be accepted. In each rarefaction, 297 to 301 KEGG pathways were observed; however, only 1 pathway, ko00511 or \u201cother glycan degradation,\u201d was constantly distinct from the others. Figure\u00a01B shows radar plots with model coefficients as pointing hands toward 301 KEGG pathways. The only selected pathway was ko00511 with coefficients of 9.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 (SD) and 20.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 (SD) for SVD and LR models, respectively. The corresponding percentages of ko00511 among the samples of all rarefied data sets are displayed in Fig.\u00a02C. Most patients exhibited an upward trend for this \u201cother glycan degradation\u201d pathway with CBM588 ingestion.",

Numbers of raw reads for each sample are listed in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1C. We assumed that the quantities of protein domains involved in carbohydrate processing could serve as indicators of metabolic potential in fecal metagenomes. We employed the dbCAN database23 to analyze 585 hidden Markov models (HMMs) of carbohydrate-active domains. Reads from shotgun sequencing were routed to a pipeline to define domain fractions per million amino acids per 250 nucleotides (DFPMAA250) for every dbCAN-defined HMM (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2B). The total number of identified domain fractions on a given HMM after normalizations are conducted is DFPMAA250 of the given domain. The addition of DFPMAA250 across all HMMs was used to estimate overall carbohydrate processing capabilities, (i.e., \u2211DFPMAA250). Ten rarefied data sets at depths across 3 logs were tested for the robustness of \u2211DFPMAA250 (Fig.\u00a03A), which revealed a stable trend, especially among depths with read numbers above or equal to 62,367.",

The underlying assumption is the enzyme amount is the key determinant of chemical reactions within a complex system such as human bowels regardless of the availability of reactants. A system based on a similar logic can successfully predict metabolomic turnover in oceans29. With the increasing number of interventions into bowel microbiota for medical benefits, a quantitative base would be required to make logical decisions and predictions for this metaorgan. Our study demonstrates a potential framework for this purpose. Other metabolisms could be formatted similarly. A set of essential scores would provide a valuable reference for clinicians to assess and evaluate bowel microbiomes in the same manner as creatinine for the kidney and transaminases for the liver. Scored summaries would also be easy for non-experts like patients to follow.",

One category of approaches is \u201ctop-down\u201d to find correlations among metabolites by statistical analyses. The other category is \u201cbottom-up\u201d to build metabolic networks with units and coefficients of known pathways plus functional annotations from reference genomes. Designs of \u201ctop-down\u201d could help identify novel correlations but often lack mechanistic insights; approaches of \u201cbottom-up\u201d would provide astonishing precision but often take tons of time to calculate. Instead our design can be considered as a middle stop between both ends. Scientists can use domain-based scores as correlation targets to make hypotheses of mechanisms and to design experiments with known properties of the given domains. Involved proteins can be even cloned from nucleotide sequences as mapped to the given HMMs in the data sets. Pathways can be constructed accordingly. These are all advantages not readily available from previous approaches.",

This was likely due to an inherent criterion set by dbCAN23, which requires covered fractions of HMMs by aligned reads to be higher than 0.3. With 90% of the known protein domains smaller than 200 amino acids31, mean read lengths at 187.6\u2009bp would likely be sufficient for calculating DFPMAA250 values. Although this would set a limit on available choices of sequencing platforms, the demonstrated insensitivity to sequencing depths (Fig.\u00a03A) could adequately compensate for this disadvantage. With rapid improvements on read lengths from the platform manufacturers, more sequence sets ready for the DFPMAA250 pipeline would be expected.",

These results are compatible with previous findings that Clostridia is associated with glycan degradation potential32. Because the abundance of the Clostridiaceae family decreased in our study (Fig.\u00a01E), CBM588 had a low likelihood of having a direct contribution by mass effect. Instead, we observed that CBM588 not only carried a higher overall value of \u2211DFPMAA250 than other bacteria (Fig.\u00a04A) but also had a significant proportion of carbohydrate-active protein domains in the carbohydrate-binding module category (Fig.\u00a04C). It is likely that CBM588 indirectly diversifies the microbe community by offering access to more glycan varieties. In addition, the increased Bacteroidetes abundance (Fig.\u00a01D) could positively reinforce the glycan-metabolizing potential of the microbiome33,34. Independent validation with HUMAnN224 and MetaCyc25 identified a negative correlation (Fig.\u00a03F) between pathway abundance of \u201cglycogen degradation I\u201d and \u2211DFPMAA250 scores. This finding suggests that microbiomes carrying higher values of \u2211DFPMAA250 can compensate the requirements of \u201cglycogen degradation\u201d in the microbe community. In other words, with diversified availability of carbons via enhanced metabolic potentials as implied by high \u2211DFPMAA250 scores, bacteria can thrive with less dependence upon glycogen degradation. It would be interesting to determine if simultaneous additions of glycan-rich foods with CBM588 could elicit any synergistic effects.",

                    "text": "In this study, we used CBM588 instead of the more common Lactobacilli-based probiotics because its safety is well established35. Reports of its efficacy against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H736 and Clostridium difficile37 also increased our confidence in its use in immunocompromised patients. In a rat model following SBT, Price et al. found that rejection and graft-versus-host disease are associated with shifts in gut microbiota toward potentially pathogenic organisms38, which can be ameliorated using probiotics39. In humans, Oh et al. indicated that the presence of the Enterobacteriaceae family significantly increases during episodes of rejection after SBT14. Bacterial compositions could also be affected by the presence of ileostomy and the availability of oxygen after a transplantation40. In our study, the most notable alterations were decreases in Enterobacteriaceae and increases in Bacteroidaceae after the 1-month ingestion of CBM588 in patients (Fig.\u00a01E). With the known association between the Enterobacteriaceae family and graft rejection14, our results would support the use of CBM588 to improve the survival of small intestine allografts. The decrease in Enterobacteriaceae per se would in addition imply a lower likelihood of infection by potential pathogens in the family. Risks of rejection and infection might accordingly be minimized from the use of CBM588. Although number of patients in our cohort was limited, our data did reveal the time-dependent divergence of microbiota and concordant change of carbohydrate metabolism after CBM588 ingestion. Further large-scale investigations are warranted. The developed scoring system detailed herein could readily provide objective and quantitative readouts to facilitate the establishment of clinical reasoning behind adopting probiotics in the care of SBT recipients.",
