The purpose of this study was to investigate: (1) the stability of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiota from early (8\u201314 weeks) through later (24\u201330 weeks) pregnancy among African American women according to measures of socioeconomic status, accounting for prenatal antibiotic use; (2) whether measures of socioeconomic status are associated with changes in microbiota composition over pregnancy; and (3) whether exposure to prenatal antibiotics mediate any observed associations between measures of socioeconomic status and stability of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiota across pregnancy.",

The human microbiota is increasingly recognized to contribute to biological functions that are important across the lifespan\u00a0(Cho & Blaser, 2012). Research supports the role of the microbiota in digestion and metabolism\u00a0(Aziz et al., 2013; Bouter et al., 2017; Nieuwdorp et al., 2014), protection against infection and programming of the immune system\u00a0(Rooks & Garrett, 2016; G\u00fcnther, Josenhans & Wehkamp, 2016; McKenney & Kendall, 2016; Round & Mazmanian, 2009; Khosravi & Mazmanian, 2013), production of neurotransmitters \u00a0(Yano et al., 2015; Strandwitz, 2018), breakdown of xenobiotics\u00a0(Patterson & Turnbaugh, 2014; Koppel, Rekdal & Balskus, 2017), mediation of the physical and emotional response to stress\u00a0(Sudo, 2014; Bailey et al., 2011; Foster, Rinaman & Cryan, 2017), and many other functions. A growing body of research has investigated the human microbiota and pregnancy outcomes, especially preterm birth. Most studies of the prenatal microbiota have focused on the vagina, given the potential for vaginal microorganisms to ascend to the uterus and the known relationship between intrauterine infection and preterm birth \u00a0(Agrawal & Hirsch, 2012; Mendz, Kaakoush & Quinlivan, 2013; Goldenberg et al., 2008). Comparatively fewer studies have investigated the microbiota of other body sites during pregnancy \u00a0(Barak et al., 2003; Madianos, Bobetsis & Offenbacher, 2013; Eke et al., 2012; Han et al., 2010; Han et al., 2006; Le\u00f3n et al., 2007; Bearfield et al., 2002; Fujiwara et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Collado et al., 2016; Koren et al., 2012; Collado et al., 2008). Although pregnancy involves profound hormonal, immunological and metabolic changes to support the fetoplacental unit\u00a0(Newbern & Freemark, 2011), there have been few studies investigating either shifts in microbiota composition across pregnancy at these different sites, or variation in composition at any site that may be explained by maternal characteristics and exposures other than race \u00a0(Stout et al., 2017; Hyman et al., 2014).",

                    "text": "16S rRNA gene sequencing has been used extensively to study the vaginal microbiota in non-pregnant and pregnant women, finding that a reduction in richness (number of taxa) and evenness (distribution of taxa)\u00a0(Aagaard et al., 2011) and an increase in stability (resistance to change) accompany the transition from the non-pregnant to the pregnant state\u00a0(Romero et al., 2014). Most 16S rRNA gene sequencing surveys characterize the vaginal microbiota into community state types (CSTs) defined via hierarchical clustering and consideration of predominant taxa, with communities clustering into five CST: four dominated by Lactobacillus iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri or L. jensenii, and a fifth with lower proportion of lactic acid producing bacteria and higher proportions of anerobes\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2007; Ravel et al., 2011; MacIntyre et al., 2015). A consistent finding is that the proportion of women in different CSTs vary by race, with women of African ancestry significantly more likely to have a vaginal CST not dominated by Lactobacillus\u00a0(Zhou et al., 2007; Ravel et al., 2011; MacIntyre et al., 2015). Among women whose vaginal microbiota is dominated by Lactobacillus, the predominant species also varies by race, with L.\u00a0crispatus more frequently predominating among Caucasian women and L. iners, a species that produces less acid than other Lactobacillus species, more commonly predominating among African American women\u00a0(Hyman et al., 2014). Because L.\u00a0iners produces less acid than other Lactobacillus spp., it is less effective at maintaining the low pH that usually characterizes vaginal eubiosis\u00a0(Amabebe & Anumba, 2018). Notably, little has been published evaluating the factors that contribute to differences in microbiome composition by race/ethnicity, and these publications have focused on the gut microbiota\u00a0(Deschasaux et al., 2018; Brooks et al., 2018).",

A study of mostly Caucasian women found no association between change in vaginal microbiota composition across trimesters and birth outcome\u00a0(Hyman et al., 2014). In contrast, a mostly African American cohort study found that microbial richness, diversity, and evenness decreased from the first to second trimester for women with preterm birth but remained stable for women with term birth\u00a0(Stout et al., 2017). The discordance in findings may reflect differences in study sample (most are small in size, lack racial and socioeconomic diversity, and are heterogeneous in birth outcome definitions) and methods across studies. The confounding of population and methodological differences across studies makes it difficult to discern whether observed differences in the microbiome by race/ethnicity are real or primarily attributable to differences in confounders such as socioeconomic status by race/ethnicity, which might influence nutrition and stress exposures that themselves affect microbiota composition.",

Another study using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of supragingival samples from pregnant and non-pregnant women finding the Shannon diversity of pregnant women to be significantly higher than that of non-pregnant women with Neisseria, Porphyromonas, and Treponema more abundant in the pregnant group, while Streptococcus and Veillonella were more abundant in the non-pregnant group\u00a0(Lin et al., 2018). Few studies have examined shifts in the oral microbiota over the course of pregnancy. One study using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of microbial samples collected weekly from the saliva and the gum in 49 pregnant women, identified high cross-gestational stability, with no significant change in alpha-diversity or beta-diversity across gestation, and no link between specific organisms and adverse outcomes \u00a0(DiGiulio et al., 2015).",

One study involving repeated longitudinal sampling across gestational weeks identified high cross-gestational stability, with no significant change in alpha-diversity or beta-diversity over gestational weeks of the pregnancy\u00a0(DiGiulio et al., 2015). Another that involved sampling in the first and third trimesters found an expansion of diversity, with an overall increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and reduced richness from the first to the third trimesters; however, microbiome gene composition was constant between trimesters\u00a0(Koren et al., 2012). A third study compared the gut microbiota in overweight and normal weight women in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), finding increasing microbial counts from the first to the third trimester overall and increasing abundance of Bacteroides and Staphyloccoccus among women who were overweight compared to normal weight\u00a0(Collado et al., 2008). This same study noted that the prenatal gut microbiota may be influenced by pre-pregnancy weight as well as weight gain over the course of the pregnancy\u00a0(Collado et al., 2008). In a murine model, pregnancy-related changes in the maternal gut microbiota were found to depend upon the mother\u2019s periconceptional diet \u00a0(Gohir et al., 2015).",

The extent to which socioeconomic status plays a role in microbiota composition and stability, particularly within pregnancy, has been relatively unexplored.

Few published studies have, however, evaluated the effects of prenatal antibiotics on the maternal or fetal microbiome\u00a0(Mueller et al., 2015; Stokholm et al., 2014). It has been demonstrated that prenatal antibiotics alter the vaginal microbiota, which may have later effects on the colonization of the newborn\u00a0(Stokholm et al., 2014) and childhood obesity\u00a0(Mueller et al., 2015). Most of the common conditions that result in antibiotic use in pregnancy include genitourinary infections, such as bacterial vaginosis, which occur at higher rates among African American women compared to women of other race/ethnicity \u00a0(Chesson et al., 2012).

The rationale for restricting the study to African American women is based on a health disparity research framework that recommends that researchers, as a first step to understanding health disparities, look within the high burden group to identify intra-group risk and protective factors\u00a0(Rowley et al., 1993), and the observation that existing studies of the microbiota composition in pregnancy do not consider socioeconomic status and hence are not able to parse the possibly competing effects of race and socioeconomic status.",

Inclusion criteria for enrollment into the cohort included: (1) being African American, defined for purposes of this study as being of self-reported Black/African American race and born in the United States; (2) presenting between 8 and 14 weeks gestation (verified by clinical record and/or ultrasound) with a singleton pregnancy; (3) ability to comprehend written and spoken English; (4) age between 18\u201340\u00a0years; (5) absence of a chronic medical condition, as well as absence of chronic use of prescription medication (verified by prenatal record). Women who developed health conditions or pregnancy complications, including those that required prescription medications were retained in the study and these exposures and their gestational age of occurrence were recorded.

Participant samples with DNA visible on the gel were sequenced as were no-template controls that contained all assay components except for DNA, which were used to verify the lack of contamination across reagents and samples. Microbial diversity was characterized by DNA sequence variation of the 16S rRNA gene.

For each body site, we also compared women providing paired samples to women not providing paired samples to ensure that the subset of women providing paired samples for a given body site was not a biased set of the participating women. Shannon and Chao1 measures of alpha-diversity were calculated for each body site for both sample collection time points (Visit 1 and Visit 2). Diversity measures were based on the average of 1,000 rarefactions to the minimum library size of 2,027. ASVs that were unassigned at the genus level were excluded from diversity calculations. We calculated the change in Shannon and Chao1 diversities by subtracting the calculated measure for Visit 2 data from the calculated measure for Visit 1 data. The Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index, a measure of beta-diversity used to quantify the compositional dissimilarity between two sites based on counts, was calculated for paired Visit 1 and Visit 2 samples from the same body site for each woman based on ASV frequencies. The Bray\u2013Curtis Dissimilarity index was selected for its ease of interpretability (it is bounded by 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that the two samples have the same composition and 1 indicating that the two samples do not share any taxa) and its avoidance in making assumptions about evolutionary relationships\u00a0(Lucas et al., 2017). We generated box plots to compare the distribution of the change in measures of alpha- and beta-diversity from Visit 1 to Visit 2, and compared these distributions across body sites. Because samples from both time points were run on the same plate for each body site for data from all women included in the analyses reported here, no adjustment for batch or plate was required.",

We then performed a PERMANOVA (between-woman analysis) to assess the extent to which compositional shifts between Visit 1 and Visit 2, as captured by the Manhattan distance, were associated with measures of socioeconomic status and/or antibiotic exposure. The Manhattan distance was chosen for this aspect of our analysis as it is proportional to the Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity index when ASV frequencies are used, but the Manhattan distance allows for non-negative values (unlike the Bray\u2013Curtis), which occur when considering differences in ASV frequencies\u00a0(Lucas et al., 2017).",

Approximately 15% of the sample had received antibiotics within four weeks prior to Visit 1 and approximately 22% received antibiotics between Visit 1 and Visit 2.

First and foremost, as with any study involving 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the taxonomic assignment of sequences was limited in resolution by the short read length (250 bp paired ends). Also, as with other 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies, the taxonomic assignment and resolution is influenced by the particular primer set selected for amplifying the variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, which may limit comparability with studies based on other primer sets\u00a0(Bukin et al., 2019). Second, although 110 women is a relatively large cohort compared to many earlier studies, it is not large enough to detect small effect sizes. Nor was this sample size adequate for us to evaluate whether other health exposures and behaviors that associate with measures of socioeconomic status affect the stability of the microbiota in pregnancy. Furthermore, the analyses presented in this exploratory study should be interpreted with caution given that analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons\u00a0(Althouse, 2016). Third, the assessment of socioeconomic status by level of education and prenatal health insurance type (Medicaid, private) is somewhat limited and does not fully capture dimensions of socioeconomic status such as employment status and type, family structure or size, that likely influence access to relevant resources and health behaviors (such as dietary patterns, housing conditions) that may influence microbiota composition. This is especially important considering that approximately 75% of the cohort was covered by Medicaid, which could limit our ability to assess the true effect of health insurance type, and the mean age of our cohort was approximately 24 years, which might limit the possible effect of education.",

In contrast, for the oral and gut sites, level of education and prenatal insurance type were not associated with change in measures of alpha-diversity over pregnancy; however, a low level of education and prenatal antibiotic use did affect longitudinal stability of the oral and gut microbiota while only prenatal insurance status was associated with the direction of change in the composition of the oral and gut microbiome. Thus, prenatal antibiotics resulted in lower stability in the composition of the oral and gut microbiota across pregnancy compared to women who did not receive prenatal antibiotics, but the receipt of prenatal antibiotics did not predict the direction of change in microbiota composition across pregnancy, whereas having prenatal Medicaid compared to private insurance did. In conclusion, our findings in this exploratory analysis of relatively small sample size support that measures of socioeconomic status, including level of education and prenatal insurance type, are variably associated with changes in microbiota alpha- and beta-diversity across pregnancy for the vaginal, oral, and gut body sites. Additional dedicated studies on a larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.",
