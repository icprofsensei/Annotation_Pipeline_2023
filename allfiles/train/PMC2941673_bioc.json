From each individual, 26 specimens, each from different oral sites at a single point in time, were collected and pooled. An eleventh pool was constructed using portions of the subgingival specimens from all 10 individuals. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using broad-range bacterial primers, and clone libraries from the individual and subgingival pools were constructed. From a total of 11 368 high-quality, non-chimeric, near full-length sequences, 247 species-level phylotypes (using a 99% sequence identity threshold) and 9 bacteria phyla were identified. At least 15 bacterial genera were conserved among all 10 individuals, with significant interindividual differences at the species and strain level. Comparisons of these oral bacterial sequences to near full-length sequences found previously in the large intestines and feces of other healthy individuals suggest that the mouth and intestinal tract harbor distinct sets of bacteria. Co-occurrence analysis demonstrated significant segregation of taxa when community membership was examined at the level of genus, but not at the level of species, suggesting that ecologically-significant, competitive interactions are more apparent at a broader taxonomic level than species. This study is one of the more comprehensive, high-resolution analyses of bacterial diversity within the healthy human mouth to date, and highlights the value of tools from macroecology for enhancing our understanding of bacterial ecology in human health.",

Most of these molecular studies are based on the small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene because of its universal presence in cellular organisms, the presence of conserved regions, and its reliability for phylogenetic analysis (Woese and Fox, 1977). Recent molecular surveys of the human distal gut microbiota have shown that each individual gut is home to 500 \u2013 3000 bacterial species, with a large degree of interindividual variation (Eckburg et al., 2005; Dethlefsen et al., 2007; Dethlefsen et al., 2008). Using rRNA gene-based techniques, it is estimated that the human oral cavity harbors 500\u2013700 different bacterial species (Kroes et al., 1999; Paster et al., 2001; Kazor et al., 2003; Aas et al., 2005; Dewhirst, 2008). A recent study based on 14 115 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences from saliva specimens from 120 healthy individuals from 12 different geographic locations around the world found 101 different bacterial genera, with a high level of interindividual variation (Nasidze et al., 2009). Two recent 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing-based studies have suggested that there are approximately 250\u2013300 species-level phylotypes in the mouth of any given individual, and that they segregate based on mucosal versus dental surfaces (Keijser et al., 2008; Zaura et al., 2009). All three of these recent studies are limited by their dependence on relatively short (<500 nucleotides) sequences, and hence, by limited phylogenetic resolution.",

Oral health status of all individuals was determined by a dentist who performed a full-mouth clinical examination that included inspection of the teeth, oral mucosa, and periodontal tissues. All participants had normal oral mucous membranes and were free from non-restored carious lesions. At most sites, periodontal tissues showed no clinical signs of inflammation such as redness, swelling, or bleeding on probing (BOP) and were judged to be free of gingivitis or periodontitis. Details of the periodontal data from sites from which plaque specimens were taken are provided in Table 1 and Supplemental Methods. From each individual, 26 oral specimens were collected. Separate dental plaque specimens were taken with sterile curets from supragingival and subgingival surfaces of 7 target teeth (#3, 9, 12, 19, 25, 28, and 30). The 26th sample consisted of whole saliva that was expectorated into a test tube. Healthy human mouths have relatively little bacterial biomass compared to the gastrointestinal tract; therefore, because the ultimate purpose of this project was to obtain community-wide shotgun sequence data, specimens were pooled in order to ensure sufficient DNA. One-third of each of the 26 specimens obtained from each individual was combined to obtain ten \u201cindividual-specific\u201d pools, while a separate third of each of the subgingival specimens from all 10 individuals (7 specimens per subject) was pooled to create a single \u201csubgingival pool\u201d. To study the influence of DNA isolation method in the UniFrac analysis (see below), specimens were also collected from three additional healthy individuals.

The alignment was further perfected by manual optimization. Seventy-nine chimeras (0.7%) were manually identified and removed from the analysis, so that 11 368 sequences were included in the final analysis. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs; phylotypes) were defined using a 99% sequence similarity cutoff, by using similarity matrices and a filter of 1253 nucleotide positions, masking out the hypervariable regions. The 99% cutoff in this setting roughly corresponds to species-level groupings. One representative for each of the 247 OTUs found in this study was deposited in GenBank (accession numbers FJ976202 to FJ976448) (Table S1). Sequences with less than 99% similarity to sequences in public databases were considered novel (Table S2). Genus names were assigned based on placement of sequences within defined groups, or on a cutoff of 95% sequence identity in the case of unclassifiable sequences.

This particular test can only be used to examine similarity between two communities at a time. The Chao-Jaccard similarity index was calculated using EstimateS (Colwell, 2005) for all possible pair-wise comparisons of the communities from the ten mouths.

This measure of community structure calculates the number of checkerboard units (specimens in which two taxa are not found together) between all possible taxon pairs in a matrix, and calculates a single score for the entire dataset. The C-score is the average for all of the possible pairs in the matrix. This measure is compared to a null distribution of random matrices of the same size. If the observed C-score is larger than the score for the null hypothesis, it suggests significant segregation between taxa, and if the observed C-score is smaller than the score for the null hypothesis, it suggests significant aggregation between taxa. In this case, we calculated C-scores using an abundance matrix of all taxa, organized by mouth (Table S1), which was then converted to a presence/absence matrix. The subgingival pool was not included in this analysis. These scores were compared to those generated from a null model based on 500 randomly generated matrices of the same size using the program EcoSim (Gotelli and Entsminger, 2004). Co-occurrence patterns were examined at three separate taxonomic levels\u2014 OTU level (n=247, approximately species level), genus level (n=53), and phylum level (n=9).",

Portions of the specimens were pooled per individual and an 11th pool was constructed with portions of each subgingival specimen from all 10 individuals. Ribosomal RNA gene sequences were amplified using broad-range bacterial primers, cloned and sequenced. The 11 368 near full-length, non-chimeric sequences of the combined dataset were manually assigned to 247 OTUs (phylotypes) using a cutoff of 99% sequence identity (Table S1). DOTUR and mothur analyses revealed a total of 228 OTUs at this cutoff level, with an expected OTU richness of 236 (Figure S1, which also shows the rarefaction curves of each of the 11 clone libraries). A graph displaying the DOTUR-determined number of phylotypes versus the phylogenetic distance displayed the typical \u201chockey stick shape\u201d that is found in most animal-associated bacterial communities, with an enriched representation of diversity at the tip (Figure S2). Nine bacterial phyla were identified within the combined dataset (Figure 1). Of these, Firmicutes (33.2% of all sequences; mean abundance in 11 pools 32.2 +/\u2212 8.1%), Proteobacteria (27.5% in combined set; mean 24.6 +/\u2212 8.1%), Bacteroidetes (16.6%; mean 14.6 +/\u2212 8.4%) and Actinobacteria (14.5%; mean 11.9 +/\u2212 10.3%) were the most abundant. Less abundant phyla included Fusobacteria (6.7%; mean 5.6 +/\u2212 4.1), TM7 (1.3%; 0.52 +/\u2212 1.3%), as well as Spirochaetes, OD2, and Synergistes (all <1%). Figure 2 displays a phylogenetic tree and relative abundance of all genera found in this study. In the combined dataset, the genus Streptococcus was the most abundant genus (2180 sequences, 19.2% of total). Other abundant genera include Haemophilus (1325; 11.7%), Neisseria (1042; 9.2%), Prevotella (974; 8.6%), Veillonella (973, 8.6%), and Rothia (820; 7.2%).

Every individual also contained TM7 sequences. All of these bacterial taxa were also present in the pooled subgingival library.

Several different patterns of genus dominance were found in the ten healthy mouths. Five of the ten mouths were dominated by Streptococcus species (#2, 5, 7, 9, 10). Two mouths were dominated by Prevotella (#1, 4), and one each was dominated by Neisseria (#3), Haemophilus (#8) and Veillonella (#6) (Figure S3). In addition, even among the genera present in all 10 healthy individuals, the presence of particular species within that genus was variable between individuals. For example, although every subject had sequences belonging to the genus Neisseria, no single Neisseria species was shared across all subjects. The same was true for species in the genera Fusobacterium and Corynebacterium.",

This method calculates the checkerboard units for each taxon pair (how often those two taxa are found together). When analyzed at the level of OTU, the observed C-score was not significantly different from the null hypothesis (random distribution). When the same data were analyzed at the genus level, the C-score indicated that the communities display co-occurrence patterns significantly different from the null hypothesis (observed C = 0.99184, expected C = 0.95366, p =0.02860). These scores (higher than expected) suggested segregation or competition among taxa. Examination of the matrix of checkerboard units between each taxon pair can pinpoint taxa that are more or less likely to be found together. Figure 4 displays the taxa pairs as a matrix of C-scores. Taxa with low C-scores (found together frequently) are colored white, whereas those with high C-scores (rarely or never found together) are colored black. Genus pairs in which both genera are found in all mouths, such as Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Haemophilus have zero checkerboard units, as expected. When examining the genus pairs with high checkerboard units, the genus Abiotrophia was identified as unlikely to be found together with the genera Dialister, Oribacterium, Eubacterium, and Treponema. In addition, the genus Scardovia was unlikely to be found with Eikenella or Dialister. Because it may be inappropriate to compare this broad range of bacterial taxa in a single analysis (due to the fact that members of different phyla may not be in competition), we re-analyzed the OTU-level data, but in this case, comparing the patterns only within a given phyla. In this case, we also calculated the C-scores based on presence/absence for all OTUs (but only within a given phylum). This was repeated for each phylum, except for OD2 and Synergistes, due to the few observations in each of those two groups. This OTU-level, within-phylum analysis revealed that only the taxa within Firmicutes demonstrated a C-score significantly different from the null hypothesis (Obs = 2.1370, Exp = 2.08243, p = 0.03460), suggesting segregation of species, and evidence of possible competitive species interactions.",

Inter-individual variation has been demonstrated in a variety of studies for the healthy intestinal tract (Eckburg et al., 2005; Dethlefsen et al., 2006; Ley et al., 2006; Palmer et al., 2007). In contrast, knowledge about the inter-individual differences in the healthy human mouth microbiota and the uniqueness of the oral microbiota compared to other microbial communities in our bodies is still somewhat sparse. Several molecular studies have been conducted regarding the composition of the oral microbiota, but these studies used limited numbers of sequences per individual, or only looked at short regions of the 16S rRNA gene (Kroes et al., 1999; Paster et al., 2001; Kazor et al., 2003; Aas et al., 2005). A study by Diaz et al. in three individuals showed that early colonization of enamel is subject-specific (Diaz et al., 2006). The distinctness of the phylogenetic structure of the human oral microbiota in relation to the microbiota of the skin and feces in nine individuals was revealed in a recent study (Costello et al., 2009). While other studies have considered the oral microbiota of a larger number of individuals, our study was based on one of the largest sets of near full-length sequences per individual to date for the human oral cavity. The most important contributions of this work are the combination of depth of coverage and degree of phylogenetic resolution for the human mouth, the features of a human oral core microbiota, and previously-unrecognized patterns of taxon co-occurrence.",

The advantage of near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences in providing greater phylogenetic resolution than hypervariable region \u201ctag\u201d sequences was highlighted in a comparative analysis of these two types of sequence data (Huse et al., 2008). In this dataset, we identified a total of 247 different OTUs at the level of species, of which 24 were less than 99% identical than previously published sequences.

                    "text": "The abundant bacterial groups found in our study are similar to those found in most other studies. For example, 20% of our sequences belonged to the genus Streptococcus, confirming the preponderance of Streptococcus species within the healthy mouth by microscopy and culture (Socransky, 1963) and by molecular methods (Kroes et al., 1999). In a recent molecular study, the most predominant bacterial genera in the oral cavity were Streptococcus, Gemella, Abiotrophia, Granulicatella, Rothia, Neisseria, and Prevotella (Aas et al., 2005). We found those same groups to be prevalent as well, but, in addition, we found many Proteobacteria (e.g., Haemophilus, Lautropia) to be abundant. This difference may be the result of a deeper sequencing effort per individual in the current study (average 57.5 clones per subject in the Aas et al. study for a total of 2,589 clones, in contrast to an average 1029 clones per individual in this study). In addition, different DNA extraction methods and different broad-range PCR primers could also explain the divergent results.",

Our study confirms results by Nasidze et al. suggesting high variability in the oral microbiome between individuals, although in the latter study, saliva was the only specimen type examined (Nasidze et al., 2009). In addition to Streptococcus, which was the most abundant genus in the combined dataset and in three of the individual mouths, we identified four additional genera that may dominate the oral ecosystem of a healthy subject. Our data indicate that there is a variety of alternative oral bacterial community structures, and a greater degree of variation in patterns of diversity, associated with oral health than previously thought. It remains to be seen what factors, e.g., human genetics or lifestyle, correlate with oral bacterial community structure. Clearly, the concept of a core oral microbiome may be better defined with measurements of community function, rather than community membership. Such analyses will need to include community-wide assessments of gene content, gene transcript abundance, and protein products.",

                    "text": "The role of bacteria in periodontal disease is complex, and likely involves polymicrobial consortia (Lepp et al., 2004). Socransky and Haffajee have proposed that the presence of a high proportion of so-called \u201cred complex\u201d bacteria, i.e., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, is associated with periodontal disease (Haffajee et al., 2008; Socransky et al., 1998). In a survey of five healthy mouths, Aas et al. (Aas et al., 2005) did not find any representatives of the \u201cred complex\u201d. Other studies have, however, identified members of this complex in healthy mouths (Ximenez-Fyvie et al., 2000). In our study, all three species were found in subjects with healthy gingival tissues, albeit in low numbers, and limited to subjects 1, 4, and 9. Taken together with previous studies, this study confirms that the \u2018red complex\u2019 group may be found in small numbers in healthy individuals. Other bacterial species such as Filifactor alocis, Selenomonas species, and Dialister species have been associated with a worsening periodontal status (Kumar et al., 2005). A bacterial species previously shown to be associated with periodontal health (Veillonella parvula, Veillonella X042, Genbank accession number AF287781) (Kumar et al., 2005) was found in all specimens in this study, and was the third most abundant OTU in our combined sequence dataset.",

This may be indicative of the fact that (1) despite the many different habitats in the human mouth, many bacterial species are shared among those habitats, or (2) that the individual pools are dominated by the subgingival specimens. However, the number of subjects in this study was relatively small, and inter-individual differences associated with gender, age, or ethnicity might become apparent when larger numbers of subjects are studied.

C-scores higher than expected are consistent with inter-species competition, as well as with habitat differences that cross over the sampling scheme, and historical processes. We feel that habitat differences (other than host genotype) were minimized in our study due to the fact that the pools presumably represented multiple intra-oral sites in a consistent manner across individuals. However, successional or early historical differences between subjects cannot be eliminated as a possible explanation of the observed segregation patterns. It has been previously suggested that as taxonomic level is refined, C-scores become more statistically significant (Horner-Devine et al., 2007). The fact that significant segregation was found at the genus level in our study but not at a level equivalent to species has several possible interpretations. One possibility is that taxonomic levels are not the relevant biological units of measure. Another possibility is that the level of ecological interest and interaction in the mouth is the level that humans have chosen to label as genus, rather than species.",

For instance, in this study, Abiotrophia was found to have a high number of checkerboard units with the genera Dialister, Oribacterium, Eubacterium and Treponema, and the genus Scardovia had a high number of checkerboard units with Eikenella and Dialister. Interactions among these genera have not been the focus of research so far, but such research may lead us to understand whether and why these taxa compete. Each of these genera (except Treponema) is represented in this dataset by a single species, each of which has been implicated in human disease; recognition of competitive partners may prove useful in preventive medicine. For instance, it has been suggested that known competitive interactions between Streptococcus mutans and other species may be exploited in order to develop preventive treatments for dental caries, by encouraging growth of species with lower cariogenicity (Kreth et al., 2005).",

The total number of Sobs was 228 using the 99% cutoff, 172 (98%), 144 (97%), 114 (95%), and 69 (90%), respectively. Data were grouped per library, showing that the addition of each library causes a new increase (\u201cbump\u201d) in the number observed OTUs, except at the 99% cutoff threshold*, which shows the data in randomized order. In addition, the Chao1 estimator (estimating the total bacterial diversity) is plotted, with the grey bars showing the standard deviation. B.
