Collection techniques have been developed and tested to overcome these challenges, but previous studies investigating these techniques have demonstrated a highly variable capacity for sample preservation. Furthermore, these studies typically only examine either preservation of genetic content or metabolites, not both. This study investigated the Stool Nucleic Acid Collection and Preservation Tube (Norgen BioTek Corp) for the preservation of both microbial DNA and microbial organic acid metabolites in human faecal samples when compared to frozen samples. Twenty six healthy adult participants were instructed to collect a bowel movement, subsample into collection tubes and immediately transfer the remaining bulk to \u221220\u2009\u00b0C storage. Resulting organic acid concentrations remained comparable across methods when the preservation tubes were used correctly. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing data revealed twenty significantly different bacterial genera between the two collection methods. Ten Gram-negative genera were more abundant in the collection tubes, and ten Gram-positive genera were more abundant in the fresh frozen samples. This study has illustrated that faecal collection methods bias the microbial community profile according to Gram status and this should be considered when designing studies that collect and store human faecal samples.",

Although there are many available options, large clinical trials present faecal collection challenges through large sample size, geographical spread, and self-collected samples from inexperienced participants. Previous methods used by our research laboratories include the use of transportable freezers and bulk sample collections. This method can be very laborious, time consuming and consequently, costly. Commercially available preservation tubes represent a simple approach that have previously shown promise for the preservation of microbial DNA. A recent study explored preservation capacity of the commercially available OMNIgene.GUT (DNA Genotek) collection tubes and used 16S rRNA sequencing to demonstrate minimal divergence from \u221280\u2009\u00b0C frozen samples7. Another group also confirmed these findings when comparing \u221220\u2009\u00b0C frozen and collection tube samples8, and a different study found no significant differences between the 16S rRNA sequencing profiles produced from the collection tube and fresh samples9.",

All methods used were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and regulations outlined by the ethics approval.

Participants were asked to collect their entire bowel motion into a plastic toilet liner collection bag and then subsample into two collection tubes from different locations on the faecal sample. Participants were also asked to complete a Bristol Stool Scale questionnaire once they had completed their sampling. The remaining bulk sample in the liner bag was immediately transferred to \u221220\u2009\u00b0C storage (fresh frozen), with cold chain storage of samples maintained at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C using transportable freezers until received at the analytical laboratory. The tubes were sent at ambient temperature through standard Australian Post mailing system to our analytical laboratory. This study aimed to recreate a clinical trial setting and so depending on participant geographical location the tubes spent varying times in transit. However, all tubes were received at the analytical laboratory within six days post collection. When received at the laboratory, the fresh frozen and collection tube samples were transferred to \u221280\u2009\u00b0C storage.

This compromised sample quality and these samples were excluded from the analyses. In total, twenty-six participants completed the study and supplied samples for analysis. The feedback received for the sampling process was positive and the majority of participants found it easy to complete a collection using the tubes. However, the amount of faecal sample transferred to the collection tubes varied widely amongst the participants with only five of the twenty-six participants successfully adhering to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations by transferring 2 grams or less to each tube. There was a large variation across the amounts of extra sample added to each tube. Seven participants added 0 to 1 gram extra to each tube, five added between 1 and 2 grams and nine participants added more than 2 grams extra to each tube.",

Conversely, Gram-negative bacteria were higher in the collection tubes compared to the fresh frozen samples. Only six taxa were exceptions to this trend (Faecalibacterium, Clostridium cluster XIVb, Gemmiger, Dialister, Methanomassiliicoccus and Akkermansia) where the greatest percent difference between the two methods was less than 0.63%.",

It has endorsed the possible use of collection tubes for faecal organic acid investigations and highlighted a trend which allows us to better understand collection method bias. For metabolomic applications it has been shown that effective methods are immediate transfer to 4\u2009\u00b0C storage and extracting within one hour after collection25, immersion in 95% ethanol26, and using Cary-Blair faecal swabs which have been demonstrated to preserve content for metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomic applications27. Studies investigating the preservation of DNA support the use of faecal occult blood test (FOBT) cards28, faecal desiccation29 and RNA later30. The available literature reports a wide range of preferences for methodologies across these studies, with ambiguous results. For example, while one study supports the use of RNA later, others found that RNA later decreases the DNA yield, therefore impacting upon microbial population analysis28,31. However, despite incongruity between these studies, it is widely accepted that freezing (either at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C or \u221280\u2009\u00b0C) achieves optimal sample preservation31 and many studies use this approach as the best practice comparison when assessing the validity of other faecal preservation techniques.",

The design of our study was tailored to examine the use of collection tubes in a clinical trial setting. As such, participants were asked to send their tubes through the Australian postal system. Even though no tube samples persisted for more than six days in the post, it cannot be determined what environmental stresses the samples were exposed to during this time. Product specificities suggest that the tubes can be stored at room temperature for up to two years and still maintain quality DNA content. Therefore, it is assumed that the sample integrity should have been maintained under our test conditions.",

While cryo-preservation is considered best practice for SCFA, it can be complex and costly to implement across large clinical trials utilising field collections. This study has investigated the capacity of commercially available stool preservation tubes to also preserve faecal SCFA metabolites. Results demonstrate a significant difference in acetic acid concentrations between the fresh frozen and collection tube samples. However, when grouped into complaint vs non-compliant samples it was evident that the 2-gram capacity of the tube is an important factor for determining acetic acid content. Unfortunately, with only five compliant subjects in the present study, this matter requires greater sample numbers to clearly define the impact of sample overloading on SCFAs. A previous review of faecal collection methods suggested that ambient temperature collection tubes were unsuitable for metabolic content preservation27. However, the current study has shown that the Stool Nucleic Acid Collection and Preservation Tubes, when used to manufacturers specifications, may be suitable for faecal sample SCFA preservation.",

                    "text": "Our objectives were to confirm the microbiome preservation capacity of stool collection tubes and investigate their suitability for preserving SCFA metabolites. Unexpectedly this study has illustrated a distinct shift in microbial community structure that is linked with cellular wall/membrane structure. At phylum and genus level the data suggested that the collection methods significantly bias microbiome profiles. It was apparent that the fresh frozen samples favoured an increased proportion of Gram-positive representatives and a decreased proportion of Gram-negative genera. Conversely, the collection tubes had a lower proportion of Gram-positive genera and a relative higher abundance of Gram-negative genera. Previous studies have theorised a freezing bias being attributed to the cellular wall structure of the microbial population33,34 but not illustrated the clear trend evident in our study. Furthermore, several other studies have reported results that are consistent with the collection method bias illustrated in our study. For example, a recent investigation reported a decrease in the Gram-positive Actinobacteria phylum in OMNIgene.GUT tubes when compared to frozen samples35. Another study reported an increase in Gram-negative Sutterella in the OMNIgene.GUT tube when compared to fresh frozen7. Although not significant, our results follow the same trend for the Sutterella genus. An additional study investigated the OMNIgene.GUT preservation tube in a clinical setting which highlighted differences at phylum level but attributed it to the method used for DNA extraction. However, their results are congruent with ours in that the Bacteroidetes were measured in higher abundance in the collection tubes and the Actinobacteria were measured in lower abundance in the collection tubes36. Many studies report that a difference in individual microbiome profiles is the principal driver of beta diversity variation, exceeding differences caused by collection method, storage conditions or nucleic acid extraction techniques28,34,35. However, we have demonstrated that collection method is the principal driver of variation between samples in our study.",

Our results indicate that it may be dictated by bacterial cell wall/membrane structure however, it is unclear whether the bias was due to a sensitivity of Gram-negative bacteria to freezing or whether the preservative buffer in the collection tubes is adversely affecting Gram-positive bacteria. The exact composition of these preservation solutions are proprietary, but likely contain anionic detergents, buffers and/or salts that are not only bacteriostatic, but potentially bactericidal, to arrest any further microbial growth33. Bacterial cell wall structure may also influence DNA extraction efficiency as shown in a study where a higher abundance of Gram-positive genera were detected in samples stored under frozen conditions33. In order to better understand the collection method bias observed in the current study, each method could be compared with freshly voided and extracted faecal samples, prior to freezing. This will help determine whether the source of the bias is due to freezing, preservation buffer or a combination of the two.",
