An emerging body of literature in adults has begun to establish clear relationships between gut microbiome composition and a wide range of health outcomes 1\u20136. In contrast, comparatively little is known about the gut microbiome in infants and children, the exposures that shape it, and its lifelong health impacts 7. Although limited in their size and scope, a number of studies have established relationships between intestinal microbiome profiles in infants, delivery mode and/or breastmilk exposure 8\u201315. These factors both have long-term health consequences. Cesarean delivery has been associated with an increased risk of obesity, asthma, celiac disease and type 1 diabetes 16\u201319, whereas breastfeeding has been related to decreased risks of asthma, obesity, infection, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, among other illnesses compared with formula feeding (reviewed in 20). The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, but there is growing evidence linking exposure to microflora that is present during vaginal delivery with the patterns of the microbiome that become established in infants 21. In addition, following delivery, the feeding of human milk primes and matures the infant gastrointestinal system, and is believed to promote a unique microbial colonization profile that has yet to be clearly defined in healthy populations 22. The acquisition of specific microbes in succession, as the core microbiome of the gut is created, may be permanently affected by exposure to maternal vaginal microflora and/or to breastmilk and could represent a key mechanism underlying differences in immune development that influence lifelong disease risk.",

The potential short and long term effects of perturbations of the gut microbiome of infancy as influenced by operative delivery or formula feeding are beginning to be examined. The contribution of mode of delivery to the infant microbiome has been evaluated 13,15,24. However, no study has examined the effects of delivery mode and breastfeeding following adjustment for the other, and there is little data on the effects of combination feeding\u2014feeding breastmilk and formula together. Determining the associations between mode of delivery and breastmilk versus formula feeding and microbiome development in infants is critical to informing delivery and feeding decisions or interventions to alter the microbiome for improved health. Our objective was to evaluate the relative effects of delivery and feeding modes on the composition of the intestinal microbiota at approximately six weeks of age in 102 infants from a US pregnancy cohort study. The observed differences due to delivery and feeding modes highlight their importance in shaping the early intestinal microbiome and point to possible explanations for some of the risks and benefits associated with infant delivery and feeding practices.",

Six weeks was chosen as it is likely that exclusive breastmilk or formula feeding would be well established at this age, and six weeks corresponded to routine maternal postpartum visits, a time that allowed for optimal sample collection with minimal particpant burden. We evaluated infant diet from birth until the time of stool collection by telephone questionnaires that included questions regarding the duration of breastfeeding and the timing of formula introduction, if any. Infants who were fed breastmilk and who had never been given formula prior to the time of stool collection were given the status of exclusive breastmilk feeding; infants who had not been breastfed and who had been fed formula only prior to their stool collection were assigned the status exclusively formula-fed; and infants who had received both breastmilk and formula prior to their stool collection were identified as having a diet of both breastmilk and formula.

In fact, of subjects who were combination fed in our study, all but two were fed breastmilk for at least the first two weeks of life. To test the robustness of this finding in light of the possible effect of these two subjects, we repeated the UniFrac analysis after reassigning those two infants from the mixed feeding group to the exclusively formula fed group, and no qualitative differences in the results were observed (data not shown).",

In healthy infants, the process of delivery is the initial encounter with microorganisms capable of colonizing the intestinal tract. In a previous study of 24 healthy women, vaginal microbiome composition became less diverse between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and just before delivery was enriched with Lactobacillus species, likely contributing to vertical transmission of these bacteria during vaginal birth 21. In a study of 10 newborns in Venezuela, within hours of delivery, the intestinal tracts of infants born vaginally were colonized by Lactobacillus and Prevotella, whereas infants delivered operatively acquired bacteria present on the mother\u2019s skin and the hospital environment, such as Staphylococcus, Proprionibacterium and Corynebacterium\n15. Our findings, based on a large group of six week old infants, indicate that Lactobacillus also contributes to the microbial environment of the gut, but to a lesser extent than Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides and Streptococcus.",

Though a few previous studies have found associations between infant feeding and intestinal microbiome composition 9\u201312,14, none has examined the relative contribution of combination feeding (breastmilk and formula) alongside exclusive formula or breastfeeding to overall microbial community composition. This is an important group to consider because combination feeding is common, for example, in the first few days in the hospital when lactogenesis II is delayed while mother\u2019s breastmilk is becoming established, among mothers who have difficulty producing adequate milk and supplement their own milk with infant formula, or among mothers who are unable or choose not to pump breastmilk when separated from their babies. We found that the distinction between the microbial communities according to feeding method was largest between infants fed exclusively breastmilk and those fed either combination diets or exclusively formula. Infants fed both breastmilk and formula had intestinal microbial communities that were similar to those fed exclusively formula, and relatively distinct from those fed exclusively breastmilk. This finding offers new evidence to support the tenets of the World Health Organization\u2019s Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, which promotes exclusive breastmilk feeding beginning at birth in hospitals and birthing centers and the avoidance of formula supplementation unless deemed medically necessary (http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/bfhi/en/). The findings in this study also provide new evidence for pediatricians as they provide guidance to breastfeeding mothers who may be considering incorporating formula into their infant\u2019s diet, and may have implications for decisions around the use of donor human milk in cases when supplementation is needed.",

Digestion and metabolism of nutrients are likely influenced by the intestinal microbiome 33, and there is a well-established connection between breastfeeding and lower risk of childhood and adult onset obesity likely mediated in part by the microbiome in early life (reviewed in 34). Oligosaccharides in breastmilk are thought to promote Bifidobacterium growth 35, and decreased Bifidobacterium in infancy has been related to an increased risk of being overweight at age 10 36. Many formulas are supplemented with prebiotics such as short chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long chain fructo-oligosaccharides that increase the overall representation of Bifidobacterium in the microbiome of formula fed infants, and similar to breastmilk, promote lactate and short chain fatty acid prevalence in the infant gut (reviewed in 37). Although we did not observe a significant association between increased abundance of Bifidobacterium and breastfeeding in our study, Bifidobacterium was present at greater abundance in exclusively breastfed infants compared with others; compared with combination fed subjects, this enrichment approached statistical significance before correction for multiple comparisons.",

While ours is one of the largest studies examining the factors that shape the infant microbiome, our sample size of 102 subjects limited our statistical power which precluded stratified analyses for identifying any interactions between delivery mode and feeding method. In addition, while we were able to categorize feeding practices, the exact proportion of the diet that was made up of either breastmilk or formula and the exact timing of formula supplementation (e.g. in hospital after delivery versus beginning just prior to six weeks) was not considered. It is possible that infants who received formula supplementation only at birth were able to recover a microbiome that resembles that of an exclusively breast fed infant. A recent study highlighted infant nutrition as a major contributor to the early microbiota composition and function, with cessation of breastfeeding contributing the most fundamental shift in the composition of bacteria 8. A longitudinal study with more subjects would allow us to determine the temporal dynamics of the effects of feeding practices and changes therein, as well as the persistence of the effects of both feeding and delivery mode later in infancy. Additionally, exposures such as postnatal antibiotics were rare in this cohort and therefore subjects with antibiotic exposure were eliminated from analysis; in the future the evaluation of prenatal, peripartum, and postpartum antibiotic exposure and their role in the trajectory of microbiome development, and interrelationship with delivery mode and dietary exposures, will be important. Thus, our results will need to be replicated in larger, multi-center studies and in prospective analyses. While the UniFrac analyses we performed suggest independent associations between microbiome composition and both delivery mode and feeding method, the substantial overlap between the communities defined by both factors suggests that there are other important drivers of microbiome community composition that remain to be identified in future analyses.",
