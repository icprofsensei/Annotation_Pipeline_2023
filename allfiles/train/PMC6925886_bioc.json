The reasons for this are currently unknown. The aim of the current study was to characterise the faecal microbiota of horses with colic signs associated with primary large colon lesions treated surgically and to compare the composition of their faecal microbiota to that of a control group of horses undergoing emergency orthopaedic treatment. Faecal samples were collected from horses in both groups on admission to hospital, during hospitalisation and following discharge from hospital for a total duration of 12\u2009weeks. Additionally, colonic content samples were collected from surgical colic patients if pelvic flexure enterotomy was performed during laparotomy. A total of 12 samples were collected per horse. DNA was extracted from samples using a commercial kit. Amplicon mixtures were created by PCR amplification of the V1 \u2013 V2 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes and submitted for sequencing using the Ion Torrent PGM next-generation sequencing system. Multivariate data analysis was used to characterise the faecal microbiota and to investigate differences between groups.",

Left dorsal displacement of the large colon has also been associated with an 8.1\u201320% recurrence rate following surgical or non-surgical treatment [2, 3] and right dorsal displacement has also been associated with increased likelihood of colic recurrence [4]. Previously, intra-abdominal adhesions have been proposed as a potential reason for increased likelihood of colic recurrence following correction of strangulating LCV [1].

Clear evidence of clustering between faecal and colonic content samples collected from colic patients on admission and during laparotomy, respectively was identified (Fig.\u00a08). PERMANOVA results showed that 16% of variation in this data could be explained by the sample type and this was statistically significant (p-value\u2009=\u20090.008). Faecal samples collected over time from case and control horses showed a small amount of clustering on PCoA plots (Fig.\u00a09). The latter figure shows that faecal samples collected on admission from surgical colic horses were clustered together with samples collected towards the end of the study. PERMANOVA analysis of these data showed that time relative to surgery in days was responsible for 4.6% of variation in data collected from the case group (p-value\u2009=\u20090.001) and 3.7% of variation in data collected from the control group (p-value\u2009=\u20090.001).\n\n\n",

A previous study that compared microbiota data generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism from the caecum, right dorsal colon and faeces of normal horses showed similarity between the faecal and the colonic content microbiota [8]. Similar findings were also reported by Costa et al. [9] who used next-generation sequencing to compare the microbial profiles of 9 different locations of the horse gastrointestinal tract (stomach, duodenum, ileum, caecum, pelvic flexure, pelvic flexure mucosa, small colon, rectum and faeces). The latter study also found similarity between the faecal microbial profile and that of the pelvic flexure and small colon. Hastie et al. [10] also inferred that the faecal microbiota could reflect the microbial composition of the colon following quantification of three bacterial species including Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Streptococcus bovis in the luminal contents of caecum, dorsal colon, ventral colon and rectum of freshly slaughtered horses using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The current study suggests that instead of seeing a gradual shift in the gut microbial communities prior to the development of colic related to large colon disorders, that this occurs suddenly in microbial communities within the large colon, prior to changes being detectable in the faeces. It is not possible to determine if this change in the microbial colon population was a cause of altered large colon function (e.g. motility), a consequence of this, or due to colic management prior to referral to the hospital. Further research is required to investigate these hypotheses further.",

However, this study included horses diagnosed with different types of colic, some of which had been treated medically, making direct comparison with the current study difficult. The findings from the present study would suggest that the use of faecal samples collected at hospital admission from surgical colic patients may not be suitable to accurately study changes in gut microbiota associated with large colon disease and that these should not be used to compare between colic groups nor to act as a \u2018baseline\u2019 to study subsequent changes. This is supported by the finding that retention times of ingesta in the caecum and large colon are estimated to be 35\u2009h [12], making it important to obtain serial faecal samples to study the microbiota of colic cases of large intestinal origin as colonic contents move through into the rectum.",

We hypothesised that faecal samples collected from the orthopaedic control patients on admission would represent horses with a normal gut microbiota and that these would cluster clearly from those obtained from the surgical colic patients. However, the differences identified were not as great as anticipated. This may have been due to the small sample sizes and low statistical power to detect significant differences. However, based on the differences between colonic and faecal microbiota in the colic group, this may also have been due to delays in microbiota changes being detected in the faecal samples of the colic group, supporting our theory that microbiota changes occur more acutely in horses with specific lesions of the large colon. Ideally, we would additionally have studied a group of small intestinal colic cases as an additional non-large colon colic control group, but we were constrained by funding to a relatively small number of horses. In addition, recurrence of colic in this group is complicated by the increased likelihood of mechanical obstruction due to adhesion formation, which is difficult to confirm ante mortem or at repeat laparotomy [13]. Monitoring any longitudinal changes in microbiota in this group of horses however is warranted in future studies.",

We hypothesise that this was consistent with \u2018recovery\u2019 of faecal microbiota of colic horses compared with orthopaedic controls. Additional administration of oral TMPS in the orthopaedic control group was less than ideal for comparison with the colic group and we acknowledge the limitations of this, but it would have been unethical to change the standard management regimen in the control group. There was no significant reduction in alpha diversity measures over time in orthopaedic control horses. Costa et al. [14] reported that treatment with oral TMPS had the greatest impact on faecal microbiota composition and diversity compared with other antimicrobial classes. Increase in relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes phyla overtime were the most prominent changes in faecal microbiota of orthopaedic control horses in the current study. This contradicts the findings by Costa et al. [14] who reported a significant reduction in relative abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia, non-significant trends of reduced relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria and increased relative abundance of the phylum Firmicutes in response to oral TMPS. Differences in results of microbiota studies due to the use of differing sequencing technologies or laboratory techniques are widely acknowledged and could explain discrepancies between studies including the current study [15\u201318].",

Each horse may have had different management regimens such as stabling and type of feed received at the time of admission. To try to control for this effect, colic and control horses were matched as closely as possible to the time of the year of admission. Some of the horses recruited onto the study experienced complications following laparotomy and some received additional antimicrobial treatment. Similarly, some of the orthopaedic control horses were transported or underwent further medical treatment during the postoperative period. All these factors may have a potential effect on the equine gut microbiota (and representative faecal microbiota) and as this was a small study, these effects were difficult to control. It was impractical for the study investigators to collect faecal samples from the premises of each horse following hospital discharge. Samples collected during hospitalisation were frozen immediately following collection, whilst those collected by horse owners following hospital discharge were in the postal system for almost 36\u2009h before arrival and freezing. However, a number of studies in people have reported that robust results can be obtained following various stool sample storage protocols [19\u201322], and so it is possible that the differences in initial storage of the samples may have had little effect. These issues demonstrate the challenges in utilising client owned horses to study changes in the faecal microbiota. The number of horses studied was small but costs associated with microbiota studies also limits numbers of samples that can be investigated in many veterinary funded projects and use of other techniques such as metabolomics which have been shown to correlate with changes in the faecal microbiota [23] may provide a more cost effective alternative.",

This provides further support of acute change in colonic microbiota occurring in specific large intestinal forms of colic. Whether this is a cause of colic or effect e.g. due to altered colonic motility is not possible to determine. Further studies with larger numbers of horses being studied over a longer time are required to investigate the faecal microbiota of horses that have developed colic due to large intestinal disease, to determine if subsequent changes in the faecal microbiota can identify horses at greater risk of postoperative colic.",

The study was approved by the University of Liverpool Veterinary Research Ethics Committee (VREC207) and informed owner consent was obtained. For the colic group, large colon disease was confirmed to be the primary cause of colic signs at laparotomy. Orthopaedic controls were required to have undergone general anaesthesia for inclusion in the study and to have received the same initial antimicrobial and analgesic protocol. In the colic group, faecal samples were collected on admission to the hospital during rectal examination as part of routine assessment of colic. Samples of colonic contents were also collected if pelvic flexure enterotomy (PFE) was performed during laparotomy as part of routine surgical management. Spontaneously voided faecal samples were also collected from the orthopaedic control group at or immediately following admission. Faecal samples obtained at or immediately after admission were considered the baseline samples (T0). Postoperative samples of spontaneously voided faecal samples were collected every 2\u20133\u2009days during hospitalisation (T1-T3), weekly during the first month after hospital discharge and then every 2\u2009weeks for a further 2\u2009months (T4\u2013T11). Samples were collected from the centre of the faecal piles to avoid environmental contamination. Horse owners were provided with freepost return envelopes and sampling containers to collect and post samples following hospital discharge. They were asked to obtain freshly voided samples, and to post them on the day of collection. All samples were stored in a\u2009\u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C freezer after receipt and until processing.

The V1\u2013V2 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified in triplicates using a barcoded primer set. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were subjected to gel electrophoreses and were quantified by comparison of fluorescence intensities to those of known molecular weight standards (HyperLadder 1\u2009kb marker; Bioline, London, UK) using the GeneTools analysis software (Syngene, Cambridge UK). Three amplicon mixtures were created from equimolar ratios of the PCR products. Amplicon mixtures were then purified using the E.ZNA\u00ae Cycle-Pure Kit (OMEGA bio-tek, GA USA) as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Purified amplicon mixtures were then resolved on 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and the desired bands were excised on a blue-light transilluminator. DNA was extracted from the gel matrix and purified with E.Z.N.A\u00ae Cycle-Pure Kit. Amplicon libraries were then subjected to a final quality control check on the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyser (Agilent Technologies, CA USA) as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and were submitted for sequencing using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) sequencing technology.",

From a total of 13,028,651 input sequences, this filtration step resulted in 4,135,586 quality sequences (31.7% of the initial sequence count). Chimeric sequences were then identified and filtered from the data using the UCHIME algorithm [27], informed with the Greengenes (version 13.8) reference database [28]. Sequences were then clustered open-reference into OTUs at 97% identity threshold using the USEARCH algorithm (version 6.1.544) [29]. A representative sequence of each OTU cluster was aligned to the Greengenes core set (version 13.8) [28] using PyNast [30]. Taxonomic assignments of OTU representatives were made using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier (version 2.2) [31] informed with the Greengenes reference database at the QIIME default settings. Representative sequences were then filtered to remove gaps and hypervariable regions using the Lane mask followed by creating an approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using FastTree [32].",

This was performed to examine clustering of faecal samples collected on admission from the case and control horses, and clustering of faecal and colonic content samples collected on admission and during laparotomy, respectively from the case group. Furthermore, PCoA was performed to examine clustering of faecal samples over time in both case and control groups. In the latter analysis, samples were arbitrary grouped as admission (T0), within hospital (T1\u2013T3), early post-discharge (T4\u2013T7) and late post-discharge (T8\u2013T11) samples for better visualisation. Furthermore, only horses that contributed samples at all sampling occasions were included in this analysis to avoid inflation of beta diversity results. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to estimate the amount of variation in the data (in case and control groups separately) that could be explained by the time relative to surgery using the vegan::adonis function in R. PERMANOVA was also used to compare samples collected on admission from case and control horses and faecal and colonic content samples in the case group.",

The models were fitted using the DESeq2::DESeq function in R. Before fitting the models, the data were further filtered to remove OTUs that were present in less than 25% of the samples, as this would increase the statistical power of the model to identify significantly differentially abundant OTUs by reducing the number of pairwise comparisons [33]. Variance stabilising transformation of the data was executed as a part of model fitting and therefore the data were not rarefied in advance. p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using a false discovery rate method [37]. OTUs that had adjusted p-values of <\u20090.1 were considered significantly differentially abundant.",
