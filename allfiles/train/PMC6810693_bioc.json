At the time of suspicion (V1), at the end of therapy (V2) and then 2 weeks after stopping therapy (V3), blood and fecal samples were collected. Extracted DNA from stool was sequenced using shotgun metagenomic sequencing based on illumina library and Iseq instrumentation. Data run through a dedicated pipeline in order to produce microbiome indexes such as Sympson or Shannon diversities indexes. Gut microbiome and inflammation markers were analyzed including fecal neopterin, a maker of gut inflammation.",

The most frequently prescribed drug was a fluoroquinolone, followed by a third-generation cephalosporin and vancomycin. Stools from 42 of them were analyzed as per protocol. Overall, the mean Shannon richness index decreased from 0.904 at V1 to 0.845 at V2; the Bray-Curtis index underlined the difference in microbiome reconstitution at V3 in comparison with V1. We report significant microbiome loss of diversity at V2, that was reversible at V3 in patients with native BJI and osteosynthesis-related BJI, but not in patients with PJI (figure). Fecal neopterin increased between V1 and V2 (mean 221.6 and 698.1 pmol/g of feces, respectively) and then decreased at V3 (422.5 pmol/g), and could be a potential surrogate marker of gut dysbiosis. Of note, patients with abnormal CRP at the end of antibiotics had high neopterin values, that raises the hypothesis that abnormal CRP at the end of antibiotics could be in relation with gut dysbiosis rather than uncured BJI.",
