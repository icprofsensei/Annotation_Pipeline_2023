Samples collected from six individuals on three consecutive days were placed in commercial collection tubes (OMNIgeneGut OMR-200) or in sterile screw-top tubes in a home fridge or home freezer for 6\u201324\u2009h, before transfer and storage at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Replicate samples were shipped to centers in Australia and the USA for DNA extraction and sequencing by their respective PCR protocols, and analysed with the same bioinformatic pipeline. Variation in gut microbiome was dominated by differences between individuals. Minor differences in the abundance of taxa were found between collection-processing methods and day of collection, and between the two centers. We conclude that collection with storage and transport at 4\u2009\u00b0C within 24\u2009h is adequate for 16S rRNA analysis of the gut microbiome. Other factors including differences in PCR and sequencing methods account for relatively minor variation compared to differences between individuals.",

Storage at different temperatures for varying times has been compared with immediate freezing and storage at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. One study5 reported a decrease in Bacteroidetes and an increase in Firmicutes phyla after 30\u2009minutes at room temperature, but the majority4,6\u201311 have found that storage at room temperature for at least a day, or at 4, \u221220 or \u221280\u2009\u00b0C for up to 14 days, had little effect on the relative abundance of taxa. Moreover, microbial composition was not significantly altered in DNA extracted from fecal occult blood test cards that had been at room temperature for three days12. Recent studies have also evaluated the OMNIgene\u00ae\u2022GUT (OMR-200) collection and liquid storage tube, which is reported to stabilize DNA at room temperature for 14 days13. Samples immediately collected into these tubes and stored for three days at room temperature showed little difference in microbial composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing compared with samples immediately frozen at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C7. A similar result was obtained when samples in OMR-200tubes stored for 1\u201328 days at room temperature were compared with samples from which DNA was freshly extracted14,15. However, the relative abundance of Bacteroides increased after seven days and in infants (who had lower microbial diversity than adults) significant differences from fresh samples were observed after 14 days storage.",

Primary 16S rRNA gene PCR amplification was performed in duplicate with the following conditions: 94\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009minutes followed by 20 cycles at 94\u2009\u00b0C for 45\u2009seconds each, 55\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009minute, and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009minute 30\u2009seconds and a final extension step at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009minutes. Successful amplification was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplicons from the primary amplification were diluted 1/10 and used as template for the secondary amplification. In the secondary amplification, the overhang sequences were used to introduce Illumina sequencing adaptors and dual index barcodes to the amplicon target. Individual amplicons were identified using 8 base index sequences from the Illumina Nextera design. Sixteen forward index primers and 24 reverse index primers were designed for a 96-well plate format with the potential to generate a maximum of 384 dual index amplicons. PCR conditions were as for the primary amplification, except for an increase to 25 cycles. Reactions were performed in triplicate in separate plates, with extra wells added, up to a maximum of 9 wells, if PCR product appeared low. Amplicon size distribution was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. One sample failed to yield sufficient product in any well. Reactions from the three replicate plates were pooled and the PCR amplicons purified with 1.0\u00d7\u2009NGS Beads (Macherey-Nagel). Each dual indexed library plate pool was quantified with the Agilent Tapestation and the Qubit\u2122 DNR BR assay kit for Qubit 3.0\u00ae Fluorometer (Life Technologies). The indexed pool was diluted to 12pM and sequenced with the paired end 600-cycle (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009311) kit on a MiSeq instrument. After quality filtering, 702 technical replicate samples comprising 215 biological samples from the 6 individuals were obtained.",

Samples showed a considerable spread of \u03b1 diversity (Fig.\u00a02B,E). Samples from individual 66 had the lowest observed richness (number of OTUs per sample) and the lowest Inverse-Simpson diversity index, the latter indicating dominance by a smaller number of OTUs. This is reflected in the genera plots (Fig.\u00a02A,D). In contrast, samples from individual 11 had a high observed richness but a comparatively low Inverse-Simpson index, consistent with the presence of a few high-abundance and multiple low-abundance genera.",

In the BCM data set Method A using the OMNIgeneGut OMR-200 device exhibited differences in phyla Actinobacteria and Lentisphaerae proportions compared with the methods that involved either immediate freezing or refrigeration. In the WEHI data set, no method was associated with significantly more distance between samples at the OTU level. However, in the BCM data set beta diversity was reduced between Method A samples compared to the other methods, possibly reflecting mitigation of storage and transport effects by the OMR-200 device. In WEHI data set, the log-values of proportions of the four dominant phyla had lower variance within samples from the same individual, but greater deviation from the mean, for samples collected with Method A.",
