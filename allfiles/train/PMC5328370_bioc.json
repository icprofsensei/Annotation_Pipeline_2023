Experiences half a century ago far exceeded these frequencies, with 80\u201390% of children and adolescents having treatment requiring caries [3]. Since up to 90% of the population can develop caries, caries seems to be a common condition among humans. While ancient frequencies show that poor oral hygiene alone cannot account for caries, nowadays a huge intake of sucrose combined with poor oral hygiene can result in catastrophic caries development requiring extensive dental restoration. Meticulous oral hygiene, refraining from sucrose, and daily exposure to fluoride have reduced caries effectively in most of the developed world during the past decades [4]. Today, the severe and rampant caries of times past is mainly seen in selected patient groups, and it is evident that subnormal saliva flow rates accelerate the progression of dental caries considerably [5]. However, an interesting phenomenon is the very few percent of a population who do not develop caries, most likely amounting to some 10% given the past frequencies on dental caries [3].",

Subsequently, the participant was instructed to chew and spit continuously for 3\u00a0min into a sterile plastic cup, after which time the collected saliva from the cup was stored at \u201380\u00b0C.

HOMINGS is a next-generation sequencing (Illumina)\u2013based molecular technique, which in combination with a customized BLAST program (ProbeSeq for HOMINGS, Forsyth Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA) enables simultaneous identification of around 600 oral taxa [18]. The Probeseq database contains sequences of custom-made 16S rDNA probes (17\u201340 bases long) based on the HOMD database [19]. Specifically, bacterial identification is based on 598 species-specific probes and 94 genus-specific probes (probes targeting two or more closely related taxa within the same genus) present in the Probeseq database. A complete list of probes present in the Probeseq database is presented in the Supplementary Material (S1). The laboratory procedures of HOMINGS was performed according to a protocol modified from Caporaso et al. [20], as 10\u201350\u00a0ng of DNA was initially polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified using primers targeting the V3\u2013V4 region (341\u00a0F and 806\u00a0R) of the 16S rRNA gene. Subsequently, AMPure beads were employed for purification of PCR amplicons, and 100\u00a0ng of each library was pooled and gel purified. Finally, qPCR was used for quantification, followed by MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) sequencing of 12\u00a0pM of the library mixture and 20% Phix. In this study, an average of 91,531 (range 38,086\u2013146,049) sequences (441\u00a0bp long) was obtained after bad reads sequences had been removed from analyses, out of which 78% (range 46\u201390%) and 36.0% (range 16\u201357%) were identified at species level and genus level, respectively. A total of 618 probe-targets were observed, with a mean number of 240 (range 137\u2013341) per sample. A complete list of all identified probe-targets is presented in the Supplementary Material (S2).",

These data showed that low levels of caries experience were associated with a more favorable physicochemical saliva composition, especially in terms of its remineralizing potential, due to higher calcium and phosphorous levels [15]. Thus, the findings of the present study support the concept that dental caries is a multifactorial disease where salivary physicochemical properties and the composition of the oral and salivary microbiota, among other factors, play a role in the presence or absence of disease [23]. Accordingly, samples from healthy individuals with low caries experience were associated with higher abundance of the genera of Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Fusobacterium, of which most species in these genera only slightly ferment sugar, whereas saliva from individuals with high caries experience was associated with higher salivary abundance of Streptococcus, which includes species that heavily degrades sugars and forms extracellular and impermeable polysaccharides as well as utilizes lactate (Figure 1(a)) [24].",

In fact, it has previously been reported that salivary bacterial composition in patients with dental caries differentiates from healthy controls [12], and that higher salivary abundance of specific oral bacteria such as S. mutans and L. salivarius can be identified in saliva samples from patients with dental caries [13]. It is therefore noteworthy that the majority of bacterial species, which in this study was identified with significantly higher relative abundance in samples from the caries group, constituted <0.01% of the salivary microbiota identified (Table 3). Accordingly, these bacteria were most likely shed from caries lesions and then dispersed into whole saliva, which emphasizes the potential of using salivary presence of specific oral bacteria such as S. mutans as a biomarker of dental caries.",

On the other hand, even more pronounced differences in bacterial diversity (Figure 2(b); p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and microbial community profiling (CoA analysis; Figure 2(c)) were evident when limiting the analysis to caries-free individuals.",
