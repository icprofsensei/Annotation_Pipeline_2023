We thus aimed to understand the interaction of viral infections and the nasal microbiota in early life to appraise their roles in disease development. Thirty-two healthy, unselected infants were included in this prospective longitudinal cohort study within the first year of life. Biweekly nasal swabs (n = 559) were taken, and the microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, and 10 different viruses and 2 atypical bacteria were characterized by real-time PCR (combination of seven duplex samples). In contrast to asymptomatic human rhinovirus (HRV) colonization, symptomatic HRV infections were associated with lower alpha diversity (Shannon diversity index [SDI]), higher bacterial density (PCR concentration), and a difference in beta diversities (Jaccard and Bray-Curtis index) of the microbiota. In addition, infants with more frequent HRV infections had a lower SDI at the end of the study period. Overall, changes in the microbiota associated with symptomatic HRV infections were characterized by a loss of microbial diversity. The interaction between HRV infections and the nasal microbiota in early life might be of importance for later disease development and indicate a potential approach for future interventions.",

Infections with human rhinovirus (HRV) are, e.g., associated with the later development of asthma. We found that only symptomatic HRV infections were associated with acute changes in the nasal microbiota, mainly characterized by a loss of microbial diversity. Infants with more frequent symptomatic HRV infections had a lower bacterial diversity at the end of the first year of life. Whether the interaction between viruses and the microbiota is one pathway contributing to asthma development will be assessed in the follow-ups of these children. Independent of that, measurements of microbial diversity might represent a potential marker for risk of later lung disease or monitoring of early life interventions.",

Furthermore, respiratory viral infections play an important role in morbidity and early immune development during the first year of life in otherwise healthy infants (12,\u201316). Despite recent data on the association between viral infections and changes in the microbiota in adults, data for young children are scarce (17,\u201322). Due to several risk factors triggering both viral and bacterial infections, it is difficult to draw causal associations between those early infections and later disease development.

A virus was detected in 241 samples (43%); of those, 123 (51%) were accompanied by respiratory symptoms and 11 (5%) samples were taken during periods with more severe respiratory symptoms (lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]). The most frequent virus was HRV (147 samples [26%]); all of the other viruses analyzed were detected in 39 (7%) samples or less; RSV was found only in 11 samples (2%) (for complete viral colonization, see Table\u00a02).

The weekly monitoring of respiratory symptoms enabled us to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of viral colonization. Analyzing 559 biweekly nasal samples, we found a strong and robust association between HRV colonization and changes in the microbiota. During symptomatic HRV colonization, a lower alpha diversity (SDI), a higher bacterial density (PCRconcn), and a difference in beta diversity (Jaccard and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities) of the microbiota were found. In contrast, during asymptomatic HRV colonization, no changes in the microbiota were detected. Results remained stable if distinguishing between symptomatic and asymptomatic samples free of virus, indicating that changes in the microbiota are not driven by symptoms per se but by HRV infection. Furthermore, in addition to the short-term changes, more frequent symptomatic HRV infections had a sustained impact upon the composition of the microbiota.",

In our study, only symptomatic HRV infections were associated with changes in the microbiota. Importantly, we could also show that respiratory symptoms alone did not have the effect on the composition of the microbiota, indicating that a certain immune response of the individual subject driven by viruses is needed to result in changes of the microbiota (30).",

In addition, although the difference in alpha diversity was highly significant, rather high inter- and intraindividual standard deviations have to be kept in mind before considering it as potential clinical marker.

If future studies including sampling of local or systemic inflammatory processes (35, 36) can show that those mechanisms play an important role in viral colonization during infancy and in shaping the microbiota-immune balance, preventative measures, such as vaccination or application of probiotics, could be directed against those processes. Although further studies are clearly needed to confirm this hypothesis, the first studies have already shown a possibly preventive effect of probiotics on respiratory infection in general and HRV infection in particular (37, 38).",

In brief, V3 to V5 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the primer pair 341F/907R. The following primers were used: 341F (5\u2032-CGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGXXXXXXXXXXACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3\u2032) and 907R (5\u2032-CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGXXXXXXXXXXCCGTCAATTCMTTTGAGTTT-3\u2032). The template-specific sequences are in boldface, adaptor sequences are italicized, and the XXXXXXXXXX sequences describe the sample-specific multiplex identifier (MID) tag barcode. PCR mixtures were eluted in 40\u00a0\u00b5l of double-distilled water, after purification with the Wizard SV PCR cleanup system (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR products with a concentration of less than 1.0\u00a0ng/\u00b5l were excluded from the study, corresponding to less than 1\u00a0pg/\u00b5l bacterial DNA (10), which was recently recommended as a reliable threshold (41). For further quality control, we excluded samples with less than 70 reads and sequenced two negative-control samples. Samples displaying greater than 5% sequence reads identical to the negative controls were excluded. In addition, we did not identify taxa that have recently been identified to be contaminations (42). A 40-ng/\u00b5l concentration of each PCR product was pooled, and every MID was used once. The 8 resulting amplicon pools were sequenced with the 454 sequencing platform, and the reads were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive. Analysis of sequencing products was performed using PyroTagger pipeline (43), which comprises the definition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97% sequencing identity, estimation of chimeras, and taxonomic assignments. Pipeline settings were described in detail before (40). As an additional quality cutoff, samples with less than 70 sequence reads were excluded from the study (n = 13), resulting in a minimum number of reads of 77. The mean number of sequence reads was, however, much higher (1,469 [SD, 1,083] reads per sample).",
