Consequently, DNA sequencing of a microbiome sample frequently yields reads originating from the microbe(s) of interest, but with a vast excess of host genome-derived reads. In this study, we used a methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) to separate methylated host DNA from microbial DNA based on differences in CpG methylation density. MBD fused to the Fc region of a human antibody (MBD-Fc) binds strongly to protein A paramagnetic beads, forming an effective one-step enrichment complex that was used to remove human or fish host DNA from bacterial and protistan DNA for subsequent sequencing and analysis. We report enrichment of DNA samples from human saliva, human blood, a mock malaria-infected blood sample and a black molly fish. When reads were mapped to reference genomes, sequence reads aligning to host genomes decreased 50-fold, while bacterial and Plasmodium DNA sequences reads increased 8\u201311.5-fold. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was calculated for 149 bacterial species in saliva before and after enrichment. Unenriched saliva had an index of 4.72, while the enriched sample had an index of 4.80. The similarity of these indices demonstrates that bacterial species diversity and relative phylotype abundance remain conserved in enriched samples. Enrichment using the MBD-Fc method holds promise for targeted microbiome sequence analysis across a broad range of sample types.",

Indeed, the number of microorganisms living in a human body is about 10-fold greater than the number of human cells [1]. Human-associated microbial communities affect diverse processes including digestion, immune system maturation, polysaccharide production, toxin degradation and pathogen defense [2]. Not all results of human-microbial interactions are positive; microbiota have been implicated as contributors to metabolic diseases through the modulation of host metabolism and inflammation. For example, bacteria have been implicated as a causative agent of atherosclerosis, which is associated with lipid accumulation and inflammation in the arterial wall [3]. Similarly, bacterial species are responsible for the two most common oral diseases in humans: dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal (gum) disease [4]. Therefore, identification and characterization of complex microbial communities associated with humans is of increasing interest to the research community, medicine and public health.",

Libraries prepared from many biological samples represent DNA from a mixture of bacteria, fungi (mainly yeasts), viruses, protists and an overwhelming amount of host genomic DNA. Nucleic-acid based techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR) and massively parallel sequencing offer rapid and highly sensitive options for detecting microbial species in collected specimens. As many microorganisms are difficult to grow or are unculturable [7], nucleic acid techniques offer significant advantages in breadth and depth of coverage. Currently, 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based sequencing can detect both abundant and rare members of a microbial community [8]; however, 16S rRNA gene approaches are not fully adequate for epidemiological studies or virulence factor identification. To circumvent the limitations of gene-based amplicon (e.g. 16S rRNA gene) sequencing, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) has emerged as an alternative strategy for assessing microbial diversity [9]. One limitation of species identification by this method is the presence of large amounts of host genomic DNA in addition to microbial DNA. Metagenomics of clinical samples by direct sequencing or PCR can be inefficient and time consuming since most reads are derived from the host. Of particular relevance are clinical samples containing the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, which often contain greater than 90% human DNA.",

Each mixture contained 10% 3H labeled E. coli DNA and 90% mammalian DNA (weight:weight). We first prebound the MBD-Fc protein with paramagnetic Protein A beads, then incubated increasing amounts of MBD-Fc bound Protein A with 500 ng of input DNA, and separated bead-bound from unbound DNA fractions using a magnetic field as outlined in Figure 1. Subsequently, we analyzed the amount of E. coli DNA in bound and unbound fractions with a scintillation counter, and mammalian DNA by gel densitometry measurements. We observed that mammalian DNA was efficiently depleted from the supernatant fraction after MBD-Fc enrichment. For the enrichment experiment in which we used 40 \u00b5L MBD protein, 1\u20134% of mammalian DNA remained in the supernatant for the IMR-90+E. coli, NIH 3T3+E. coli, and HeLa+E. coli mixed samples.

We calculated the percentage of reads mapping to the E. coli genome vs. human chromosomes from an unenriched control sample, the enriched supernatant fraction and DNA eluted from the fraction bound to the magnetic beads. The starting unenriched DNA mixtures varied from 2.5\u201310% E. coli DNA. After the enrichment, 65\u201385% of the reads mapped to the E. coli reference genome with only a small percentage (15\u201335%) of reads mapping to the human reference (Figure 3). We also detected increased numbers of sequences mapping to the human mitochondrial genome in the supernatant fraction. While mitochondrial reads in the unenriched sample made up only 0.3% of human reads, mapped mitochondrial reads in the enriched sample made up 40% of human reads (Figure S1). As a further control, we eluted and sequenced DNA that remained bound to the beads after enrichment. Analysis of reads from these samples showed 97\u201399% aligned to human chromosomes, and 1\u20133% aligned to the E. coli genome. The small number of E. coli reads from the bead-bound samples was evenly distributed across the genome (data not shown).",

BstEII cuts T7 once, forming two \u223c20 kb fragments; XbaI cuts lambda once, forming two \u223c24 kb fragments. The T7 and lambda DNA fragments were then methylated with M.HhaI (GmCGC), M.Hpa II (CmCGG) or both methyltransferases. The resulting pool of six DNA fragments had methylation densities ranging from 1.5 to 14 methyl-CpG residues per kilobase (Figure 4A). From each pool, 250 ng of DNA was added to 40 \u00b5L of MBD-Fc-protein A beads, and the supernatant containing the unbound DNA was quantified using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel densitometry. Plotting the percentage of bound DNA vs. the number of methyl-CpG sites in these fragments reveals a threshold for efficient binding between 2 and 3 methyl-CpG per kilobase (Figure 4B). Lister et al.\n[17] report between 45 and 62 million methyl-CpG sites in IMR90 and H1 cell lines. Assuming that these cell lines reflect typical human methylation density and assuming even distribution, we can estimate \u223c15\u201320 methyl-CpGs per kilobase of human DNA. Bacterial genomes generally do not contain sufficient CpG methylation density to efficiently bind MBD-Fc [18], [19].",

We produced libraries from enriched and unenriched samples, as well as from DNA that remained bound to the bead complex. All libraries were sequenced on the SOLiD\u00ae 4 platform, acquiring 174\u2013346 million reads per blood sample and 501\u2013537 million reads per saliva sample. Reads from the enriched library (unbound supernatant fraction) were compared with reads from the unenriched DNA library. Reads were aligned to the hg19 human reference genome [14], the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) [20], and the PhageSeed database of phage genomes (http://phantome.org). After enrichment, we observed a dramatic increase in reads mapping to the HOMD database (Figure 5A) and the PhageSeed database (Figure 5B). 94\u201396% of reads aligning to the human reference genome in the unenriched experiment were depleted after enrichment, corresponding to an 8-fold increase in reads mapping to the HOMD database. We also sequenced libraries prepared from the DNA that remained bound to the paramagnetic bead pellet. As expected, the vast majority of mapped reads from the bound fraction (99.3%) aligned to the human reference genome (Figure 5A). Plotting the abundance of known oral microbes observed by analysis with MetaPhlAn 1.7.1 [21] reveals high concordance between enriched and unenriched libraries for the most abundant species (Figure 6). Good concordance was maintained even as the limit of detection for low abundance population members was approached (Figure 6, inset). The predominant genera in saliva-extracted DNA were Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Neisseria and Veillonella (Table S1). In the commercial blood-derived DNA samples, Pseudomonas, Escherichia and Acinetobactor genera were predominant (Table S2). We also observed several common genera of bacteria in both saliva and blood microbiota including Klebsiella, Haemophilus and Escherichia. An analysis of phage sequences before and after enrichment in the saliva sample showed strong enrichment of many phage found in bacterial genera including Streptococcus, Enterobacteria and Haemophilus (Table S3).",

                    "text": "The high abundance microorganisms from the saliva microbiome were very similar between the unenriched and MBD-Fc enriched samples. For example, the percentage of the total sequence reads matching microbial genomes in unenriched vs. enriched samples, respectively, were, 33% vs. 34% for Streptococcus, 19% vs. 16% for Neisseria, 12% vs. 12% for Veillonella and 10% vs. 10% for Haemophilus (Table S1). A Shannon-Wiener diversity index was calculated for 147 bacterial species in saliva that were observed in the unenriched (H\u2032\u200a=\u200a4.72) and enriched (H\u2032\u200a=\u200a4.80) datasets, indicating our enrichment method preserves diversity of the microbiome sample. We observed one abundant species, Niesseria flavescens, which was anomalous in the saliva enrichment. This organism may exhibit an unusual methylation density [22], allowing it to bind the enriching beads at a low level. Other Niesseria species (N. mucosa, N. sicca and N. elognata) are represented, but did not exhibit this anomalous enrichment. These data demonstrate relatively unbiased enrichment of microbial genomes after MBD-Fc enrichment. A strong correlation between the low-abundance microbial species in the unenriched and enriched samples is further evidence of unbiased enrichment. Additionally, we observed low abundance microbes that would have been difficult to detect without enrichment. Deinococcus, Treponema and Bulleidia sequence reads cumulatively represented less than 0.003% of the population after enrichment and were not detected by MetaPhlAn analysis in the unenriched samples (Figure 7A vs. 7B). Species reported at extremely low abundance (less than 0.01%) are derived from very few sequence reads and may represent false positives resulting from imperfect sequence data used to construct or query the MetaPhlAn database.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that Plasmodium falciparum DNA could also be enriched from human host genomic DNA. To test this, a mock sample (containing 90% human and 10% P. falciparum DNA) was used in our MBD-Fc enrichment workflow (Figure 1), and samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq instruments. Analysis of reads from enriched and unenriched samples indicated an 8-fold increase in the number of reads from the enriched Plasmodium DNA (Figure 8A). Further analysis of the sequence reads obtained from the enriched sample showed no significant bias in either overall genome-wide coverage (Figure 8B) or GC content (Figure 8C).",

We enriched DNA derived from an entire black molly fish (Poecilia cf. sphenops), prepared libraries, and sequenced them on Illumina GAIIx and MiSeq sequencers. We analyzed the microbiome of the black molly using the MG-RAST [23] server and compared relative abundance of microbes between unenriched and enriched samples and observed an even enrichment, as demonstrated by the concordance plot (Figure 9). The most abundant genera of bacteria reported were Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, and Shewanella. Reads were also analyzed by MetaPhlAn, which reported the most abundant genera in the same order as MG-RAST (Table S4).",

Our 50-bp single end metagenomic reads were assembled using the CLC de novo assembler [24] and yielded fungal, viral and bacterial contigs greater than 4000 bp, often with upwards of 20 fold coverage. Analysis of protein predictions using the MG-RAST server [23] yielded 198 contigs with more than 10 fold coverage matching bacterial derived drug resistance genes. More than 15 drug resistant genes derived from each of Aeromonas hydrophila, A. salmonicida, Vibrio cholerae and E. coli were also detected. These species are all known fish pathogens, and are likely targeted by antibiotic treatment as regular practice in the ornamental fish industry [25]\u2013[27]. The most abundant drug resistance related protein had 49\u00d7 coverage over a 1,390 bp contig and was annotated as the quinolone resistance protein QnrS2, derived from another the fish pathogen A. caviae. Quinolones are powerful broad-spectrum antibiotics with known usage in aquaculture, and QnrS2 has been previously implicated in antibiotic resistance in ornamental fish [25].",

This protein is known to specifically interact with 5-methyl CpG motifs found in vertebrate DNA but largely absent from microbial and mitochondrial DNA [28], [29]. DNA fragments having sufficient CpG methylation (greater than \u223c3 sites/kilobase) efficiently bind MBD-Fc conjugated magnetic beads and can be quickly separated from less methylated DNA, which remains in the supernatant. We have demonstrated the utility of this method in a series of experiments of varied complexity. We began with experiments on DNA fragments of controlled methylation, providing evidence of the mechanism and capabilities of the MDB-Fc enrichment method. Next, mixtures of 3H-labeled E. coli DNA with mammalian DNA were examined and showed that this technique is effective in a variety of cell types. Sequencing and analysis of experiments on defined mixtures of human and microbe DNA characterized the specificity of this method. Finally, we report experiments on a variety of real samples including human blood, human saliva, and fish, showing unbiased and robust enrichment.",

The MolYsis\u00ae (Molzym GmbH & Co. KG, Bremen, Germany) strategy takes advantage of differential lysis of human and microbial cells. In short, human cells are lysed under chaotropic conditions, human DNA is removed by enzymatic digestion, the enzyme is then removed from the sample, and finally microbial cells are lysed and microbial DNA is purified. The MolYsis method could introduce bias in selection of microbial DNA since some bacteria are likely to lyse under the same conditions as human host cells, changing the apparent microbial composition [30]. Another method, Pureprover\u00ae (previously available from SIRS-Lab GmbH, Jena, Germany), uses conventionally extracted microbiome/host DNA, and a protein to bind non-methylated CpG motifs in bacterial genomes [30]. Since microbes have a range of density of CpG motifs, capture efficiency of microbial DNA may vary, changing the microbiome species distribution in the analyzed sample.",

A method utilizing a methyl-cytosine dependent restriction enzyme (e.g. MspJI) to enrich Plasmodium DNA in malarial DNA samples was recently reported [33]. This approach uses a restriction enzyme requiring a methylated recognition sequence to selectively digest host DNA contamination in malarial samples. The method depletes 80% of the host DNA and enriches the Plasmodium DNA 9-fold but requires a 16 hour incubation at 37\u00b0C. Since malaria is often found in regions where sample collection, storage and processing is difficult, a more desirable approach would involve blood collection followed by DNA extraction of the clinical sample in the field for subsequent enrichment and analysis in a laboratory.",

However, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing only provides information about identity and abundance of community members without considering the substantial additional information available in the bacterial genomes. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene methods cannot be used to simultaneously detect both bacteria and the non-bacterial microbes containing 18S rRNA genes [34], [35]. Other culture independent techniques such as whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) are being used more frequently to identify organisms, provide insights into gene function and allow for inference of the functional potential of a microbial population. The presence of host DNA in such samples can result in a significant number of sequencing reads that must be discarded since they do not contain information about the microbial community. In the absence of an enrichment step, extensive sequence data must be obtained in order to achieve sufficient coverage of the sample of interest. In a recent report, analysis of the human salivary microbiome using WGS sequencing revealed a large fraction of the BLASTN [36] hits matched to human DNA, and only a small fraction represented bacterial and viral sequences amounting to 0.73% and 0.0036%, respectively [37]. Additionally, in 2012, the Human Microbiome Project Consortium [38] reported especially high levels of human DNA in soft tissue samples such as mid-vagina, anterior nares and throat; as well as high levels from DNA extracted from saliva. In our study of saliva-associated microbes, we observed low abundance of host sequences and high abundance of bacterial genera including Rothia, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Veillonella, and Neisseria, among more than 100 total observed species.",

Mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA have been previously reported to have very low abundance of CpG methylation [28], [29], [39], [40]. Although recent literature suggests that some CpG methylation is present in mitochondrial DNA [41], [42], our observation of strong enrichment of mitochondrial DNA leads us to believe that the level of CpG methylation in the samples we have studied (blood, saliva, and cell lines) cannot be sufficient to promote efficient binding of the MBD-Fc beads. Similarly, we have observed strong enrichment of chloroplast DNA in plant samples using MBD-Fc based enrichment steps (data not shown). Furthermore, analysis of phage sequences before and after enrichment revealed increases in sequence reads from many species of phage with Streptococcus, Enterobacteria and Haemophilus phage being the major species.",

We have demonstrated that this method can be used to separate host DNA from microbial DNA in a variety of contexts (human saliva, human blood, black molly fish, and artificial mixtures of human and E. coli). In addition, we have successfully enriched P. falciparum DNA from a prepared mixture of human and P. falciparum DNA, demonstrating its practicality for improving the laborious enrichment of Plasmodium DNA in patient blood samples. We have observed efficient separation of low-methylation density DNA from DNA with higher 5-methyl CpG content in varied contexts. We expect the MBD-Fc bead method to be a robust method of separating microbial DNA from plant, animal, or any host organism DNA containing sufficient CpG methylation. Finally, through sequencing data analysis, we have shown that this enrichment method evenly enriches microbial DNA, accurately reflecting the diversity of microbial species in the original sample.",
