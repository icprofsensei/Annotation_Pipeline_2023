IBD is a heterogenous disease ith respect to disease location, disease course, occurrence of extra-intestinal manifestations and therapeutic response. The disease course is characterized by exacerbations and remissions. IBD is generally considered to arise from the interaction between host genetics, environmental factors, dysregulated immune responses and alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition [1]. IBD, especially active disease, is associated with a decreased quality of life and high health care costs, [2], [3] especially due to the use of medication [2], [4]. Treatment is mainly based on symptom reduction by nonspecific immune-modulating drugs and can be associated with serious side effects [5]. Further insight in causative factors associated with the development of exacerbations (i.e. active mucosal inflammation) may contribute to new specific treatment options for IBD.",

The gut microbiota of healthy individuals is dominated by the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and to a lesser extent by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia [10]. In IBD patients, members of the Firmicutes phylum appear to be reduced, [9], [11], [12] whereas members of Gammaproteobacteria seem to bloom [13]\u2013[16]. In CD patients the Clostridia cluster IV group, in particular Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, has shown to be decreased [15], [17]. Members of Clostridia group XIVa, belonging to the Roseburia genus, also seem to be decreased in all IBD patients [17]\u2013[19]. Data on Bacteroidetes are more ambiguous; inconsistent findings have been reported for their presence in IBD compared to controls [20]\u2013[25]. In addition to these differences in relative abundances of specific phylotypes, there appears to be a general decrease in biodiversity in IBD patients [25], [26].",

Only a few studies, however, investigated the intestinal microbiota in relation to disease activity. Differences in bacterial species or groups (e.g. F. prausnitzii, Clostridia, E. coli and Fusobacterium varium) were found, when comparing active with inactive UC and CD patients,[7], [9], [20], [27]\u2013[29] but could not always be confirmed [17]. These studies are prone to confounding effects due to their cross-sectional designs and differences in medication use. Studies monitoring the microbiota composition within patients with changing disease activity over time and controlling for medication use are currently lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to prospectively monitor the microbial composition in UC and CD patients during remission and subsequent exacerbation by means of 16S rDNA pyrosequencing.",

Furthermore, a decrease in the Clostridium family was found in active UC and inactive and active CD compared to inactive UC and healthy controls [20]. A decrease of C. coccoides, C. leptum subgroup, Atophium cluster and B. ovatus was reported in feces of active compared to inactive UC, [8] while increased counts of bifidobacteria, E. coli and Clostridia were found in tissue specimens of active compared to inactive UC by others [27].",

None of these studies did match patients with quiescent disease to patients with active disease based on characteristics such as disease location, medication, diet and other possible confounders, nor did they adjust for these factors in their statistical analyses. In contrast, two more recent studies that used pyrosequencing did not show clustering based on disease status. A study by Willing et al. used a multivariate statistical approach (partial least-squares discriminant analysis) to distinguish disease phenotypes based on microbial composition in 40 twin pairs [17]. Six patients had active disease based on clinical scores, which could not be distinguished from 34 patients with inactive disease. In the second study, analyzing 231 biopsies and stool samples of IBD patients and healthy subjects, disease activity was not associated with specific shifts in the microbiome composition even after adjusting for other factors such as sample type (i.e. stool or biopsy), IBD type, age, smoking and medication [29].",

Although we included only CD patients with colonic disease and excluded IBD patients with changes in medication over time, some heterogeneity in the study population cannot be excluded. IBD can be considered a set of diseases with overlapping phenotypes rather than a single disease [46], [47]. This may contribute to the patient-specific microbial composition shifts, and lack thereof at group level. The fact that from a large cohort of 323 subjects, only 19 fulfilled our selection criteria, illustrates that it is very difficult to include a rather large homogenous subpopulation.",

                    "text": "The main strength of the present study is the prospective design comparing the microbiota in association to disease activity within the same patients followed over time, particularly considering the interindividual differences in microbiota composition. Clear subject-specific changes have been observed. As modifications of medication use over time were not allowed, these changes were most likely associated with the changing disease activity. Major increases (up to 81.9%) in specific bacterial subspecies were observed in five patients, being Lactobacillus spp. (in one UC patient), B. dorei (in one UC patient), A. muciniphila (in one CD patient), and B. fragilis (in two CD patients (#10 and #11)). These two latter patients were both non-smoking females (age 35 and 50 years respectively) using a combination of thiopurines and TNF-inhibitors continuously during the period of interest. Apart from developing an exacerbation, no major changes in clinical or environmental factors did occur during the follow-up period in any of these patients that could have contributed to the observed findings. Although larger patient numbers need to be studied before final conclusions can be drawn on the role of the individual commensal in the pathogenesis of IBD, the potential importance of B. fragilis is supported by findings from others. B. fragilis was found to be significantly more abundant in biopsies from CD patients compared to UC patients and healthy subjects [23]. In another study, the mucosal biofilm mass in IBD patients appeared to be dominated by B. fragilis\n[24]. Some strains of B. fragilis are enterotoxigenic by producing a zinc-dependent metalloprotease toxin, and appear to be more prevalent in active IBD patients as compared to inactive patients and control subjects [48]. Animal models have confirmed that enterotoxigenic B. fragilis alone is sufficient to induce colitis [49]. Furthermore, a potential role for the eukaryotic-like ubiquitin gene in B. fragilis in the pathophysiology of CD has recently been postulated [50].",

(2010) found different microbial profiles between CD and controls but not between UC and controls based on 454 sequencing [17]. In addition, Andoh et al. found inactive UC patients to cluster with healthy controls, while inactive and active CD clustered separately together with active UC [20].",

It has previously been found that the thiopurines 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and azathioprine inhibit growth of M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis in vitro\n[51], [52]. We could not demonstrate an antimicrobial effect of 6-MP in vitro as tested on Bacillus subtilis by disc diffusion test (test range 1\u201364 \u00b5g, data not shown). This does however not exclude the possibility of an (indirect) effect of 6-MP or one of its metabolites on the intestinal microbiota in vivo.",
