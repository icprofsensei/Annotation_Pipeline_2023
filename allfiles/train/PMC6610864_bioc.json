The main pathogenic mechanism of UC is thought to be aberrant activation of the immune system in response to a change in the gut environment [1\u20134]. However, the cause of this pathological immune system activation is not fully understood. In recent years, a growing body of evidence suggests that intestinal microorganisms may play an important role in UC pathogenesis. The species diversity of intestinal flora in patients with UC differs from that of healthy subjects. For example, patients with UC exhibit decreased intestinal populations of members of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and increased populations of Lactobacillus [5]. In particular, the Desulfovibrio and Clostridium genera have been closely linked to UC [6]. Thus, the development of UC is closely related to changes in the intestinal flora [7\u201311].",

                    "text": "Although no significant differences in gut microbiota composition were found at the phylum level, a significant change in the composition of the flora was detected in patients with UC compared to healthy donors. We analyzed the composition of intestinal flora before treatment (d0) and after the first (d1) and second (d2) treatments, and found that at the level of the phylum, the proportion of Firmicutes in the d0 stage was higher, accounting for 54.0% of the total sequence reads, which was similar to the proportion of the donor group. The proportion of Firmicutes showed a downward trend after treatment in the group of patients with UC. Bacteroidetes in the donor group accounted for 41.8% in the healthy donor group, and accounted for 30.5, 33.4, and 37.8% in the d0, d1, and d2 groups, respectively. This gradual upward trend indicates that the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes gradually approached that of the donor group after treatment. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Proteus in the d0, d1, and d2 groups was significantly higher than that of the healthy donor group, accounting for 13.5, 15.3, and 16.0%, respectively (as shown in Fig.\u00a02c). At the genus level, the proportion of Bacteroides in the d0, d1, and d2 groups was 18.9, 15.6, and 20.2%, respectively; being lower than in the healthy donor group. Prevotella proportions in d0, d1, and d2 groups was lower than that of donor group and accounted for 8.6, 14.2, and 14.5% of sequence reads, respectively. Klebsiella abundance in the d0, d1, and d2 groups was 5.6, 5.9, and 1.2%, respectively, while that of the donor group was only 0.2%. In the d0, d1, and d2 groups, Streptococcus accounted for 1.8, 2.4, and 0.4%, respectively, compared to that of the donor group, which was 0.3%. The relative abundance of Streptococcus before treatment was significantly higher than that of the healthy donor group and decreased significantly in the d2 group (as shown in Fig.\u00a02d).",

Alpha diversity accounts for the following factors: observed species index, the Chao I index, and the Shannon index. A dilution curve of goods-coverage reflects whether the sequencing results are an accurate representation of the sample. Figure\u00a04 shows the alpha diversity dilution curve of each sample. The dilution curve of goods-coverage is close to the plateau stage, indicating that the sequencing amount of this test is close to saturation. This indicates that the number of sequencing reads closely reflects the diversity composition of the fecal flora of each sample in this experiment. The sequencing depth is sufficient. Judging by the OTU number, the Shannon index and the Chao I index, the bacterial diversity in the stool samples of patients with UC decreased with the number of treatments. However, this decrease was not statistically significant. The change in the bacterial composition of the stool samples was related to altered bacterial colonization of the intestine (Fig.\u00a04). Beta diversity reflects the similarity of microbial communities. The bacterial community clustering remained unchanged after FMT in patients with UC (Fig.\u00a05).",

Furthermore, the number of non-overlapping OTUs gradually decreased. This indicates that FMT can, to a certain extent, correct UC-associated dysbiosis. Due to the clinical efficacy of FMT treatment, it can be speculated that these dominant bacteria may improve the symptoms of patients with UC, but this hypothesis requires further verification.",
