We characterized the bacterial communities in 126 sputum samples representing serial collections spanning 8\u20139 y from six age-matched male CF patients. Sputum DNA was analyzed by bar-coded pyrosequencing of the V3\u2013V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, defining 662 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from >633,000 sequences. Bacterial community diversity decreased significantly over time in patients with typically progressive lung disease but remained relatively stable in patients with a mild lung disease phenotype. Antibiotic use, rather than patient age or lung function, was the primary driver of decreasing diversity. Interpatient variability in community structure exceeded intrapatient variability in serial samples. Antibiotic treatment was associated with pronounced shifts in community structure, but communities showed both short- and long-term resilience after antibiotic perturbation. There was a positive correlation between OTU occurrence and relative abundance, with a small number of persistent OTUs accounting for the greatest abundance. Significant changes in community structure, diversity, or total bacterial density at the time of pulmonary exacerbation were not observed. Despite decreasing community diversity in patients with progressive disease, total bacterial density remained relatively stable over time. These findings show the critical relationship between airway bacterial community structure, disease stage, and clinical state at the time of sample collection. These features are the key parameters with which to assess the complex ecology of the CF airway.",

Therefore it is reasonable to expect that a better understanding of airway infection in CF could provide opportunities for novel strategies to maintain lung health in this population. Recently, the microbiota of the CF airways has been assessed through the application of culture-independent methods that leverage the phylogenetic information of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. By using a variety of techniques, including Sanger sequencing of clone libraries (1, 2), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (3, 4), microarray hybridization (5, 6), or pyrosequencing (7), these studies have revealed the presence of a far more complex bacterial community in the airways of CF patients than previously appreciated with culture-based methods.",

Sample 12 was collected after return to baseline 11 wk thereafter and resided close to sample 10 on the PCoA plot. Resiliency over the course of several years also was suggested by PCoA. In patient P2, for example, the community in the last collected sample, obtained during recovery from treatment for exacerbation, clustered close to the first sample, collected during baseline 8.5 y earlier. Similarly, the last samples obtained during periods without antibiotic treatment in patient P1 (sample 13, collected 7.5 y after the first sample) and in patient P3 (sample 12, collected 6.5 y after the first sample) also resided close to their respective first samples (Fig. 2B).",

In our longitudinal study, we, too, found a positive correlation between diversity and lung function; however, at the individual patient level, decreasing community diversity was not necessarily correlated with increasing age. In the three patients with a mild lung disease phenotype, community diversity remained quite stable throughout time spans of 8\u20139 y. Furthermore, in patients S1 and S2, community diversity levels were comparable to those observed late, during periods of advanced lung disease, in the three progressing patients (Fig. 1B). Thus, community diversity alone is not a sufficient indicator of disease status. Of particular note is patient S3, who was homozygous for the \u0394F508 CF transmembrane conductance regulator allele, a genotype more commonly associated with a more aggressive lung disease phenotype. Despite having relatively mild lung disease, this patient had airway bacterial communities that were significantly more diverse than those in the other two stable patients and comparable to those observed in early samples from the three progressing patients (Fig. 1B and Fig. S6). This apparent correlation between community diversity and CF genotype raises intriguing questions about the role the \u0394F508 allele plays in susceptibility to airways infection.",

More recently, Konstan and colleagues (11) used these same principles to clarify the distinction between a patient's overall CF lung disease severity phenotype (lung disease aggressiveness) and that patient's current state of lung disease (lung disease stage). The rate at which %FEV1 declines over a period is an indicator of the aggressiveness of a patient's lung disease, independent of the stage of the patient's lung disease, which is defined as \u201cearly\u201d when serial %FEV1 measures are >70; \u201cintermediate\u201d when %FEV1 measures range between 70 and 40; and \u201cadvanced\u201d when %FEV1 measures are <40. In this context, the three stable patients included in our study can be described as having a mild lung disease-aggressiveness phenotype, and the three progressing patients represent a more typical moderate lung disease-aggressiveness phenotype (Fig. S7).",

As the three (stable) patients with mildly aggressive lung disease ultimately progress from early to intermediate stages of disease, and as antibiotic therapy intensifies, a similar decrease in diversity likely would be observed; however, continued long-term follow-up of these patients will be necessary to demonstrate this decrease. More importantly, our results show that clinical state (BETR category) at the time of sample collection has a pronounced effect on measures of diversity. It remains to be determined how finer-scale demarcation of clinical state (e.g., subcategories taking into account the exact number of days on or off antibiotic therapy relative to sample collection) might further impact measures of community diversity.",

Speculation has focused on presumed acute changes in the composition of the airways bacterial community around the time of exacerbation. Although we detected significantly lower community diversity in samples obtained during antibiotic treatment, we observed no differences in diversity between baseline samples obtained during periods of relatively stable health and samples obtained at the time of exacerbation but before initiation of antibiotic therapy. This lack of a clear microbial signature for the onset of exacerbation suggests that exacerbations (i) may not be associated with specific changes in airway bacterial communities; (ii) may be associated with changes in only a few OTUs and/or very minor changes in several OTUs; or (iii) may result primarily from host-specific factors such as the nature and degree of inflammatory response to some as yet undefined stimulus. We also found no significant changes in total bacterial density by quantitative PCR in samples based on clinical state, suggesting that the reduction in some OTUs with antibiotic treatment may be offset by an increase in other, possibly more resistant, OTUs. It is important to note, however, that our quantitative PCR analysis did not differentiate between live and dead bacterial cells (12). Thus, it is likely that measures of bacterial density, particularly in samples obtained during antibiotic therapy, represent both viable and dead bacteria. Whether this distinction is important with respect to host inflammatory response and disease progression remains unclear.",

However, these confounding variables present a challenge to establishing a simple linear cause-and-effect relationship between the progression of lung disease and decreasing community diversity. Although age, lung function (%FEV1), and antibiotic use were all significantly correlated with community diversity in our study, we found that the effects of age and lung function lost significance when controlled for antibiotic use, suggesting that antibiotic therapy is the stronger driver of decreasing diversity. More robust models of antibiotic use in CF that incorporate antibiotic class, spectrum of activity, route of delivery, synergistic or antagonistic interactions, and duration of therapy are needed to provide a more precise understanding of the impact of antibiotic use on microbial community diversity.",

When pairwise analyses were performed on subsets of samples based on disease stage (Fig. S8 and Table S4), we found that communities from the three progressing patients become more or less distinct in the advanced stage of disease, depending on the dominant species. More specifically, the advanced-stage communities in samples from patient P1, which were dominated by Achromobacter, were quite distinct from those of patients P2 and P3, which were dominated by Pseudomonas.

BC-based PCoA plots showed marked movement of communities in samples obtained during antibiotic therapy for exacerbation relative to other samples, with the correlation between BC distance and antibiotic use exceeding that of either BC distance and age or BC distance and %FEV1. Our results also suggest that CF airways communities are resilient after perturbation by antibiotics. PCoA plots of communities in serial samples from the three progressing patients generally show communities in treatment recovery samples returning to profiles resembling the communities in samples obtained before therapy, indicating that resilience, rather than stochastic reassembly of depleted communities with new species, drives community dynamics in CF. A more complete assessment of the resilience of CF airway communities will require analysis of a larger set of samples from around the time of exacerbations. An important question to address in this regard is whether the dynamic range of communities changes as diversity decreases with disease progression. It may be reasonable to expect that, as airway communities become increasingly constrained by repeated antibiotic use, they may exhibit greater resistance to further perturbation, particularly if the community becomes restricted to a small number of highly antibiotic-resistant species.",

Additional analyses that allow quantitative assessment of potential fluctuations in the absolute density of P. aeruginosa are required to understand better the ecology and clinical impact of this species in CF. Our study also reaffirms that several anaerobic species, including a number of Veillonella and Prevotella species, are common and relatively abundant members of the airway microbiota in CF (13). The facultative anaerobic species of the S. milleri group (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, and S. intermedius) deserve particular attention. Using both culture and culture-independent methods, Sibley and colleagues (4) found that these species are detected frequently in CF respiratory samples and may be associated with clinical decline in health.

One group is comprised of taxa that are prevalent and typically abundant; the other group consists of less commonly found species occurring in low abundance. We, too, found a positive correlation between OTU occurrence and relative abundance; communities in our six patients were dominated most often by Pseudomonas, S. milleri species, and strictly anaerobic species. Again, however, our results highlight the importance of taking clinical state into account in characterizing the airway bacterial community in this regard. We observed that a greater number of OTUs met our definition of persistent, which considers both rate of occurrence and relative abundance, when samples were limited to those obtained in the absence of antibiotic therapy.",

Thus, firm conclusions regarding the relative abundance of species in individual specimens must be made with caution. In comparing communities across multiple specimens, however, a given method of DNA extraction should impart equal bias across all samples; therefore, observed intersample differences would not be expected to be the result of the methodology used.",

Our study extends these observations to show further that, as bacterial community diversity decreases with advancing age, progression of lung disease, and increasing antibiotic use, overall bacterial density remains relatively stable over prolonged periods of time. Our data suggest that, as community diversity decreases, the density of the remaining species increases to maintain a stable airway bacterial load. This result is most evident in the terminal treatment samples from patients P1 and P3, wherein bacterial density remained high (108\u2013109 copies/mL) in the context of markedly species-restricted airway communities and intensive antibiotic therapy.",

We describe diverse communities that, nevertheless, often are dominated by a few select genera. Our longitudinal analysis shows that high levels of diversity can be maintained for prolonged periods of time in patients with a mildly aggressive disease phenotype but that diversity decreases in patients with more typical progressive lung disease, being driven primarily by antibiotic therapy. We found that interpatient variability in community structures exceeds intrapatient variability in serial samples, indicating that patients harbor distinguishable communities. With decreasing diversity, communities converge to a narrower spectrum of distinct profiles, each being described by the dominant species present. Our analyses suggest that CF airway communities are resilient after antibiotic perturbation and that overall bacterial density remains relatively stable despite markedly decreasing diversity in the advanced stages of lung disease. Significant changes in community structure, diversity, or bacterial density at the time of pulmonary exacerbation were not observed. We have shown that patient clinical state and disease stage are critical in interpreting changes in the diversity and structure of the airway community, underscoring the importance of longitudinal studies in determining patterns of association between the CF airway microbiome and lung disease.",
