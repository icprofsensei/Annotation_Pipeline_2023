However, little is known about the effects of crude oil and dispersant on the human fecal microbiota. The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential effects of Deepwater Horizon crude oil, Corexit 9500 dispersant, and their combination on human fecal microbial communities, using an in vitro culture test system. Fecal specimens from healthy adult volunteers were made into suspensions, which were then treated with oil, dispersant, or oil-dispersant mixtures under anaerobic conditions in an in vitro culture test system. Perturbations of the microbial community, compared to untreated control cultures, were assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), real-time PCR, and pyrosequencing methods. DGGE and pyrosequencing analysis showed that oil-dispersant mixtures reduced the diversity of fecal microbiota from all individuals. Real-time PCR results indicated that the copy numbers of 16S rRNA genes in cultures treated with dispersed oil or oil alone were significantly lower than those in control incubations. The abundance of the Bacteroidetes decreased in crude oil-treated and dispersed-oil-treated cultures, while the Proteobacteria increased in cultures treated with dispersed oil. In conclusion, the human fecal microbiota was affected differently by oil and dispersed oil, and the influence of dispersed oil was significantly greater than that of either oil or dispersant alone compared to control cultures.",

To mitigate the effect of the oil spill, accelerate natural dispersion, and enhance biodegradation, approximately 1.5 million\u00a0gallons of a chemical dispersant, Corexit 9500, were sprayed onto the surface of the Gulf of Mexico and also applied at the underwater pipe source of the leak (3). Affected areas used for commercial and recreational fishing were closed, due to concerns for seafood safety, in May 2010, and were completely reopened to fisheries in April 2011 (4). Despite the oil being highly dispersible and readily biodegradable (1), concerns have been raised about the short- and long-term impacts of residual oil components from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on the environment and exposed vulnerable populations (5).",

The bioaccumulation of dangerous petrochemical compounds like PAHs in aquatic organisms and the potential chance to contaminate seafood products via food chain dynamics may cause unintended consequences to the intestinal microbiota of the consumer and pose a public health risk. Potential consequences include a shift in the diversity of the microbial community, which may alter the ability of the indigenous microbiota to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by potential enteropathogens or affect the host physiology and immune system (17, 18). Although there may be a low potential for crude oil residues to bioaccumulate in seafood and be ingested, to our knowledge, there are few data available on the impact of crude oil and dispersed oil on the composition of the human intestinal microbiota.",

Although the controls for samples treated with crude oil and dispersant or dispersed oil were different for the fecal suspensions from each individual, the DGGE profiles of triplicate samples were evaluated and found to be similar for each individual (Fig. 1). The DGGE profiles from cultures treated with the oil-dispersant mixture were changed more than the profiles from samples treated with either crude oil or dispersant alone. The similarities of gel profiles from cultures treated with dispersant alone (71.3% [mean value of three individual samples between control and the highest concentration exposure samples]) were higher than cultures treated with oil alone (70.8%) and with the oil-dispersant mixture (63.6%). The gel profiles showed more significant changes in cultures treated with oil-dispersant mixture than in cultures treated with crude oil alone, and the altered bands in cultures treated with crude oil alone were different with increasing concentration. DGGE profiles indicated that the fecal microbiota was perturbed by dispersed oil much more than by oil and dispersant alone compared to control cultures.

The relative abundances of phyla after exposure to crude oil alone and to the oil-dispersant mixture showed that exposure to the oil-dispersant mixture reduced the diversity of the intestinal microbiota, with increasing concentrations of the oil-dispersant mixture in cultures from all treated individual fecal samples (Fig. 3). Although the phylum Bacteroidetes from individuals B and C decreased with increasing oil concentration in cultures treated with crude oil and dispersed oil, the proportions were lower in the samples treated with oil alone than those in the samples treated with dispersed oil, and the proportions were not consistent with the concentration of crude oil (Fig. 3B and C). However, there were distinct changes in the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria from all individuals after exposure to dispersed oil (Fig. 3A2, B2, and C2). The Bacteroidetes decreased significantly, from 0.5% of the oil-dispersant mixture concentration (from a mean value of 40.4% abundance in the control samples to 0.2% in the cultures treated with 2% oil dispersant), while the Proteobacteria increased (28% in the control samples to 72.8% in the cultures treated with 2% oil dispersant). Also, Actinobacteria from individual B showed a highly significant increase with an increased proportion of dispersed oil. The microbial compositions of control samples were different from each other, but the impact of dispersed oil was similar for all individuals.",

Most genera within Bacteroidetes decreased with increasing concentrations of oil and oil-dispersant mixture, while some genera within Firmicutes responded differently to increasing oil and oil-dispersant concentrations. Although Proteobacteria commonly increased in abundance with increasing concentrations of oil alone and oil-dispersant mixture, Escherichia in the cultures from individual A that were treated with oil alone did not increase. The trends of these changes were similar in oil- and dispersed-oil-treated cultures, but the influence of dispersed oil was greater than that of the oil-alone treatment. Bacteroides and Escherichia were commonly affected in all individuals, and the impacts on them due to dispersed oil were greater than those due to oil alone. Faecalibacterium spp. from individual B decreased more in cultures treated with dispersed oil than in cultures treated with oil alone.",

The 16S rRNA genes of cultured bacteria were increased in controls (274 times higher than the value at 0\u00a0h) and 0.05% dispersant (183 times higher than the value at 0\u00a0h) over the 18-h incubation time (Fig. S1A). However, the 16S rRNA genes of dispersed oil and oil alone were substantially decreased after 18\u00a0h on 0.5% dispersed oil alone (155 times lower than that of the controls), 0.5% dispersed oil plus 0.05% oil-dispersant mixture (579 times lower than that of the controls at 18\u00a0h), 0.2% dispersant alone (129 times lower than that of the controls at 18\u00a0h), and 2% dispersed oil plus 0.2% oil-dispersant mixture (844 times lower than that of the controls at 18\u00a0h), while bacterial growth on 2% dispersed oil was inhibited as the number of 16S rRNA gene copies was approximately 437 times lower than that of the controls. The abundance of 16S rRNA genes increased over the incubation time in the control (176 times higher than the value at 0\u00a0h), 0.05% dispersant (239 times), 0.5% dispersed oil plus 0.05% oil-dispersant mixture (376 times), 0.5% oil alone (242 times), and 0.2% dispersant alone (640 times) (Fig. S1B). However, the total 16S rRNA genes were substantially decreased about 15-fold after 18\u00a0h of treatment with 2% dispersed oil plus 0.2% oil-dispersant mixture and about 13-fold in the culture treated with 2% oil alone compared to the copy numbers of control cultures after 18\u00a0h. On the other hand, no significant impacts of dispersant, dispersed oil, and oil alone on the abundance were observed (Fig. S1C). Although the influence of treatments varied between individuals, the abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA genes within each individual showed that the growth of bacteria was influenced more by the high concentration of oil and dispersed oil than by the dispersant alone or by the lower concentration of oil and dispersed oil. However, differential responses of impacted bacterial populations to dispersed oil and oil alone among the three individual fecal samples, compared to control in vitro incubations, may result from the physicochemical properties and microbiological compositions of the feces, which could affect bioavailability of the crude oil and dispersant mixtures.",

                    "text": "Dispersed oil affected the intestinal microbiota more than either oil or dispersant alone (Fig. 1 and 3). This may be due to the increased solubility of dispersed oil, which could provide more surface area of hydrophobic and toxic compounds for microbial contact than oil alone. Therefore, dispersed oil may be more bioavailable to the microbiota than oil alone. Previous studies reported that chemical dispersants may increase the concentration of PAHs in the water column (20, 21). The toxicity of dispersed oil showed that chemically dispersed oil increased the toxicity and concentrations of TPHs and PAHs in fish more than mechanically dispersed oil, dispersant alone, water-soluble oil fractions, or seawater alone (22). In this study, significantly greater influences of dispersed oil on fecal bacteria than oil alone were shown at the genus and species levels (Fig. 4 and 5). Exposure to dispersed oil increased the abundance of E.\u00a0coli in all three individuals, while the abundance of B.\u00a0uniformis and uncultured Faecalibacterium were reduced. The increased abundance of E.\u00a0coli could be an important health concern, because high densities of E.\u00a0coli have been associated with increased susceptibility to Salmonella enterica infections (18). B.\u00a0uniformis, a prominent species in the intestinal microbiota, is correlated with host urinary metabolites, such as citrate and taurine (10). The reduction of Bacteroidetes by dispersed oil in fecal microbiota could affect barrier disruption with potential susceptibility to protection against pathogens. It is difficult to know the effect of uncultured Faecalibacterium reduction in samples treated with dispersed oil, because of limited information on uncultured Faecalibacterium. The most abundant Faecalibacterium species in the human intestine is Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is related to anti-inflammatory factors and reduced in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn\u2019s disease (23, 24). Most species were more influenced by the oil-dispersant mixture than by the oil-alone treatment. The changes of bacterial population could change nutrient compositions that could affect other biological groups in the gastrointestinal tract, as in previous reports of microeukaryote shifts in mangrove sediments (25). Although the concentration of oil-dispersant mixtures that significantly influenced microbiota was over the level of previously detected concentrations in seafood, the study provides a conservative estimate of impact on human intestinal microbiota with regard to potential food safety concerns (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).",

Although the results have the typical limitations of in vitro studies extrapolated to in vivo exposure and we used fecal samples representative of the lower gastrointestinal microbiota that show individual variation in microbial composition, this pilot study provides new information on the potential influences of oil and dispersed oil on the human intestinal microbiota. This topic should be further explored when assessing the potential risk of exposure to petrochemical contaminated food products.",

The extraction and amplification of genomic DNA from triplicate culture samples were conducted independently. Equal amounts of purified amplicons were loaded on the DGGE gels. The DGGE analysis was conducted using the Dcode system (Bio-Rad) (19), and the profiles of DGGE gels were photographed using the Gel Doc system (Bio-Rad). Normalization and analysis of gel profiles were conducted using the BioNumerics program, version 6.0 (Applied Maths, St.-Martens-Latem, Belgium). The DGGE profiles of triplicate samples were compared to each other to evaluate the reproducibility of experiments.",

Quantification was performed with three independent real-time PCR runs, using the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad), associated with CFX manager interface software (version 1.0.1035.131; Bio-Rad). Amplification was conducted by the following steps: 2\u00a0min at 50\u00b0C, 10\u00a0min at 95\u00b0C, and 40 cycles, with 1 cycle consisting of 15\u00a0s at 95\u00b0C and 30\u00a0s at 60\u00b0C. Fluorescent signals were detected after the 60\u00b0C step of each cycle. Melting curve data were obtained from 60\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C, at a rate of 0.5\u00b0C\u00a0s\u22121, with continuous measurements of the SYBR Green I signal intensities. Melting point analysis allowed confirmation of the specificity of the amplification products. DNA extracted from cultures of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was used to construct standard curves for quantification by plotting the threshold cycle (CT) values obtained from amplification of dilution series.",

The amplification, sequencing, and basic analysis of reads were conducted following previous descriptions (29) using a 454\u00a0GS Junior Sequencing system (Roche, Branford, CT). After excluding low-quality reads (average score of <25), short reads (<300\u00a0bp), ambiguous reads (Ns \u22652), and potentially chimeric sequences, the taxonomic classification of each sequence was assigned to the extended EzTaxon database (http://eztaxon-e.ezbiocloud.net/). The statistical analyses of phylotypes in each sample were performed using the Mothur program (30). The similarity of community structure (Bray-Curtis similarity and Jaccard similarity) between samples was used to evaluate community shift, and the significance of community differences was determined by Libshuff analysis. These analyses were conducted, with 3% difference of sequences, by the Mothur program. The sizes of different samples were normalized for comparison of samples with different read numbers. Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA), based on Fast UniFrac matrices, were conducted using the CLcommunity software (Chunlab, Inc., Seoul, South Korea). The obtained pyrosequencing reads are available at the EMBL SRA database under the study accession number ERP001036 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERP001036).",
