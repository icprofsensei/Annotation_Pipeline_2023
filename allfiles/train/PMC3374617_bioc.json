A profusion of metagenomic sequence data has been generated from human stool samples in the last few years, raising the question of whether more taxa remain to be identified. We assessed metagenomic data generated by the Human Microbiome Project Consortium to determine if novel taxa remain to be discovered in stool samples from healthy individuals. To do this, we established a rigorous bioinformatics pipeline that uses sequence data from multiple platforms (Illumina GAIIX and Roche 454 FLX Titanium) and approaches (whole-genome shotgun and 16S rDNA amplicons) to validate novel taxa. We applied this approach to stool samples from 11 healthy subjects collected as part of the Human Microbiome Project. We discovered several low-abundance, novel bacterial taxa, which span three major phyla in the bacterial tree of life. We determined that these taxa are present in a larger set of Human Microbiome Project subjects and are found in two sampling sites (Houston and St. Louis). We show that the number of false-positive novel sequences (primarily chimeric sequences) would have been two orders of magnitude higher than the true number of novel taxa without validation using multiple datasets, highlighting the importance of establishing rigorous standards for the identification of novel taxa in metagenomic data. The majority of novel sequences are related to the recently discovered genus Barnesiella, further encouraging efforts to characterize the members of this genus and to study their roles in the microbial communities of the gut. A better understanding of the effects of less-abundant bacteria is important as we seek to understand the complex gut microbiome in healthy individuals and link changes in the microbiome to disease.",

Next, those reads with <97% identity to a nearest neighbor in the NCBI NT and RDP databases were considered potentially novel (see Methods). Based on this threshold, 4\u20137% of non-redundant sequences (4,963 Roche V1\u20133 reads and 5,210 Roche V3\u20135 reads) and about 0.6% (336) of Roche WGS reads identified as 16S rDNA were potentially novel (Table 1). Finally, we aligned the Illumina WGS data to the potentially novel Roche WGS and variable region sequences and used 100% identical alignments to validate the Roche sequences. The distribution of Illumina WGS reads across the length of each Roche read was used to identify sequencing errors and chimeras in the Roche data, as described in detail below.

We also removed sequences that did not have sufficient overlap of aligned Illumina sequences to confidently confirm the Roche sequence (Figure 2E). These irregular Roche sequences were revealed by three characteristics of the Illumina alignments: (1) the maximum length of the Illumina sequences that align starting at each position within the Roche sequence gradually decreases and then increases (Figures 2B\u2013D), (2) Illumina sequences did not overlap each other significantly (Figures 2B\u2013E), and (3) Illumina paired-end sequences did not span \u226590% of the length of the Roche sequence (Figure 2B\u2013E). These Illumina alignment patterns are described in detail in the Methods and are graphically depicted in Figure 2. In the Roche variable region datasets, these irregularities served as a database-independent method for detecting chimeric sequences (Figure 2B), and indeed, the majority of sequence irregularities in Illumina coverage indicated the presence of a chimeric sequence. Strikingly, this analysis of the Illumina tiling patterns reduced the number of high-confidence, novel sequences from about 2000 candidates to 30 high-quality novel Roche V1\u20133 and 26 Roche V3\u20135 sequences in each dataset (Table 1).

In particular, the two largest OTUs (OTUs 12 and 13) contained reads identified as Barnesiella or identified with low confidence as a different genus within the same family or order as Barnesiella. These OTUs have substantial representation from the Roche WGS data and at least one Roche variable-region dataset, further validating the observations of these taxa and indicating that they are sufficiently abundant to be reliably detected using different sequencing methods. Nonetheless, the sequences belonging to this OTU included, at most, 1.3% of the total sequences generated from a single sample. This abundance is comparable to a rare organism, such as Escherichia coli, which comprised a maximum of 0.94% of the sequences in stool samples from healthy HMP subjects (The Human Microbiome Consortium (2012) \u2018Structure, Function and Diversity of Human Microbiome in an Adult Reference Population\u2019. Nature: doi:10.1038/nature11234)(dataset: hmp1.v13.hq.otu.counts, OTU263 classified as Escherichia/Shigella by RDP). Interestingly, the sequences in these two OTUs are predominantly from a single subject. Both OTUs have support from multiple visits, indicating that these novel taxa are persistently present in this individual\u2019s stool. Both OTUs have percent identities to nearest neighbors and RDP classifications indicating that these taxa are not vastly divergent from previously observed taxa. Alignments to cultured Barnesiella are <90% identical, indicating that we may have identified novel Barnesiella species or a closely related genus.",

                    "text": "Novel taxa in human stool samples are not expected to be very divergent from known taxa because previous studies, particularly of the 16S rRNA locus, have already captured the major phyla and classes of gut bacteria. As expected, RDP classifies the majority of OTUs with confidence at least to an order and nearly half to a genus (Figure 4B). The two OTUs poorly classified by RDP at the phylum and order level are examples of reads that are particularly difficult to classify (since each OTU contains a single sequence which is less than 200 bp long) and probably do not represent novelty at a high taxonomic level. Similarly, most novel OTUs have relatively high percent identity to previously sequenced 16S rDNA (Figure 4A). We also identified the nearest neighbor within the set of cultured bacteria (see Methods) to further assess how divergent the novel taxa are from cultured, well-characterized bacteria strains. All but two novel sequences were most similar to uncultured bacteria, and the percent identity to a nearest neighbor from cultured bacteria is significantly lower than from uncultured bacteria, on average 4% lower (Figure 4A). The RDP classification and percent identity to nearest neighbors indicate that the novel taxa observed are primarily from genera that have previously been sampled. We observed only a few sequences that may be novel at the taxonomic level of family or higher. The most novel OTU by percent identity contains a single sequence, which has 90.5% identity to its nearest neighbor, but is still well classified by RDP as the genus Barnesiella (Table S3). The next most novel OTU is perhaps a better candidate for novelty at family level or higher, with a single read which has 91.8% identity to a nearest neighbor, only 85.1% identity to a cultured nearest neighbor, and confident RDP classification only as low as the order Clostridiales. While new bacterial phyla may still exist, none was found in this dataset with our stringent filtering of reads.",

Figure 5 shows the distribution of the 26 OTUs in the full set of available stool samples/subjects. The majority of OTUs are present in multiple subjects (Figure 5B), indicating that these novel taxa are widespread in the small population sampled. OTUs 17 and 19 are only present in one subject and are each composed of just one Roche WGS read, suggesting that they were not detected in additional individuals due to extremely low abundance. OTU 12 contains reads from both the Roche WGS and V3\u20135 datasets from multiple samples but only a single individual, indicating that this OTU is relatively more abundant (although still low) than the other OTUs, but specific to a single subject. Figure 5B is stratified by the sampling location of the subjects (St. Louis or Houston). Most OTUs are split relatively evenly between sampling locations. However, OTUs 10, 12 and 13 only appear in the Houston cohort and are all identified as the genus Barnesiella, which could mean these closely related taxa are specific to or more abundant in the communities sampled from this region because they are well suited to the gut environment in this region or population. OTUs 17, 19, 23, and 25 are also only found in the Houston cohort, but this is likely due to chance sampling of these very-low-abundance OTUs.",

To assess if novel taxa found only in the Roche WGS dataset (Figure 5A) were potentially detectable with variable region sequencing, the novel Roche WGS reads were aligned to the V1\u20133, V3\u20135 and V6\u20139 primer sequences using NCBI BLAST. Nearly every novel Roche WGS sequence that overlapped a priming site had 100% identity to a primer sequence (four sequences had one or two mismatches with respect to a primer but likely would still amplify, see Methods). Although the Roche WGS sequence did not span both primer sites, these data suggest that differences in the taxa found in the datasets were not due to primer bias, but rather to random sampling of very-low-abundance taxa. Primer bias may still limit the novelty observed, but the limitations may not be apparent due to insufficient sequencing depth or the effects of the 16S rDNA sequence identification and trimming steps applied to the Roche WGS data. In addition, biases in sampling, preparation, storage and DNA extraction could restrict the novelty observed in both the Roche variable region and WGS samples.",

These findings establish that bacterial taxa remain to be discovered, even in well-studied microbial communities such as the healthy human gut. We also showed that the number of false-positive novel sequences identified in the 11 samples would have been two orders of magnitude higher than the true number of novel taxa without validation by multiple datasets. For example, the discovery of novel bacterial taxa using metagenomic 16S rDNA sequence data was complicated by artifacts, such as sequencing errors and chimerism, which generated false signals of novelty. This study highlights the importance of establishing rigorous standards for the identification of novel taxa in metagenomic data. The pipeline we developed is an important first step towards establishing experimental and bioinformatics criteria for these standards.",

Of the 16S rDNA sequences with less than 97% identity to 16S rDNA reference sequences, less than 1% of the Roche variable region sequences were validated while 25% of the Roche WGS sequences were validated (Table 1). This discrepancy in the percent of reads validated in each dataset is due to the presence of chimeric sequences in the Roche variable regions data. The Roche variable region sequences had been screened for chimeras, but chimeric sequences were still abundant in the subset of sequences that appeared to be novel. Of the potentially novel sequences, the chimeric sequences were the most divergent from a nearest neighbor and were frequently classified poorly by RDP. Thus, an analysis of novel sequences without our validation steps would have grossly overestimated the number of novel sequences and the taxonomic level at which diversity was found. Sequencing errors (insertions, deletions, miscalled or uncalled bases) were also a source of false-positive novel sequences. We did not expect or detect chimeric sequences in the Roche WGS dataset, and the false-positive novel sequences in this case were due predominantly to sequencing errors. While sequencing errors can cause sequences to appear more divergent from a nearest neighbor, small errors do not affect RDP classification. It is likely that including sequences with sequencing errors would have slightly inflated our estimation of novel sequences, but the diversity still would have appeared at the genus or subgenus level. The artifacts we eliminated by using Illumina WGS sequences for validation allows us to more accurately define the degree of novelty and the characteristics of the novel taxa, including their distribution among individuals, abundance, and taxonomic classification.",

Although the Roche V1\u20133 and V3\u20135 sequences had been screened with Chimera Slayer [11], some chimeric sequences were not identified because Chimera Slayer (and other database-dependent methods of chimera detection) only detects chimeras with components that are similar to the sequences in the reference database [11]. Chimeric sequences can be very abundant in 16S rDNA amplicon datasets, accounting for more than half of the diversity in OTUs in some samples [11], and the same chimera can be formed in independent amplifications of the same sample [11]. Chimeric 16S rDNA sequences are likely to be deposited in public databases at a relatively high rate [14]. Chimeric sequences confound 16S rDNA analyses that rely on accurate sequences for alignment, the generation of distance matrices and phylogenetic tree construction, and they also inflate the degree of novelty estimated in bacterial communities. Thus, novel methods of chimera detection, such as the one presented here, can improve the analysis of metagenomic data.",

Earlier studies estimated that proportion was much higher. The novel taxa are of relatively low abundance (<1% of the total reads in a sample), but some are found in multiple individuals (0.5\u201320% of individuals at this depth of sequencing), and this recurrence suggests they are endemic to the human microbiome. Low-abundance organisms may have important roles in microbial communities. Dominant organisms in a community can be used to broadly define microbial habitats in the human body [15] (The Human Microbiome Consortium (2012) \u2018Structure, Function and Diversity of Human Microbiome in an Adult Reference Population\u2019. Nature: doi:10.1038/nature11234) and even microbial community classes within individuals [2] (Zhou et al, manuscript in preparation). However, even minor components of bacterial communities may influence human health [16] or can overgrow under certain conditions to cause disease [17]. The great diversity in these low-abundance organisms may allow us to further distinguish individuals by their bacterial communities or ascribe functional characteristics related to human health and disease.",

The novel sequences identified here indicate that there are undiscovered bacterial taxa. However, the functional capabilities and other characteristics of these bacteria remain to be determined by whole-genome sequencing, isolation and culturing of the organisms, and by studying of the role of these bacteria within their communities. The novel 16S rDNA sequences can be used to target specific bacteria for whole-genome sequencing and will give us insight into what gene functions these uncharacterized organisms are contributing to the gut microbial community. Indeed, many of the novel OTUs are related to organisms that have already been identified by the HMP reference genome sequencing effort and are sequenced or in the process of being sequenced (http://www.hmpdacc-resources.org/hmp_catalog/main.cgi).

The HMP has generated sequence data from samples taken from oral, skin, nasal, and vaginal body sites in addition to stool, and we anticipate that the examination of the bacterial communities in those body sites may reveal diversity that has yet to be appreciated.",

The Roche WGS reads having a nearest neighbor with <97% identity were then aligned to the variable region primers with NCBI BLAST, using a word size of 7. We reevaluated those sequences with less than 100 bases of consecutive non-primer sequence for a nearest neighbor by relaxing the alignment length from 100 bases to the longest stretch of non-primer sequence found in the read. This check only affects short reads of approximately 100 bases by ensuring that database sequences, which are highly similar to the query except for the primer sequence (which is often trimmed off sequences deposited in the databases), would be considered in the nearest-neighbor search. This also ensures that short reads have high information content and are not identical to a known sequence over a large fraction of the read length.

We observed two major irregularities that were indicative of chimerism, miscalled bases, uncalled bases, insertions, deletions, or insufficient Illumina coverage. First, for a Roche read with good Illumina support, the maximum length of the Illumina WGS sequences (60\u2013100 bases in length) that were tiled across the Roche sequence remained a fairly constant length (>90 bases) at any given alignment start point (except at the end of the read). In contrast, the maximum read lengths of the tiled Illumina reads covering a problematic read gradually decreased until the maximum read length was \u226470 bases, only to increase again (Figure 2). Second, for a Roche read with good Illumina support, a tiling path could be identified consisting of Illumina sequences that overlapped by at least 20 bases and extended the coverage by at least 20 bases (excluding those that aligned at the end of the Roche sequence). However, this was not true for Roche reads that were problematic or lacked sufficient Illumina support (Figure 2). The chimeric sequence analysis included manual evaluation of hundreds of reads, including the alignment of separate pieces of the reads to different taxa in 16S rDNA sequence databases. Alignments and coverage were manually reviewed using Tablet [29].",

Some of the paired sequences should (1) align to a non-chimeric Roche variable region sequence or high-quality Roche WGS sequence and (2) span nearly the full length of the Roche read. Roche sequences that do not have support from paired-end Illumina reads could be chimeric or have sequencing errors that prohibit the alignment of one of the mate pairs. Therefore, the paired-end test provides additional support for a Roche sequence that shows no other evidence of chimerism or error. This paired-end test is not informative for all Roche reads, as only a subset of paired end sequences was expected to span the length of the Roche variable region and WGS sequences for several reasons. First, the insert sizes of Illumina WGS libraries ranged from 100\u2013500 bases, so only those paired reads from a fragment of approximately the length of the Roche read being examined could provide support. Furthermore, Roche sequences with few supporting Illumina WGS reads, which are likely rare sequences, may not have paired-end sequences due to the decreased likelihood of finding paired ends with the right span within the relatively few aligned Illumina sequences. Therefore, we only required paired-end support for those reads with a median depth of Illumina WGS coverage greater than 500 reads and a length of greater than 200 bp. These reads were only considered high-quality novel sequences if a set of Illumina WGS paired end reads spanned at least 90% of the Roche sequence.",

Three reads did not overlap any of the variable region primer sites, but the sequences aligned to sequences within the amplified variable region datasets, indicating that the novel sequences are within a region that can be amplified. The remaining four reads had one or two mismatches to a primer, but would likely still amplify. The Roche WGS dataset did not reveal any obvious primer bias. However, the identification of 16S rDNA sequences from the Roche WGS data and the associated trimming may bias the Roche WGS data sample toward known sequences, so that novel reads with unique sequence at the priming sites were excluded from this analysis early in the analysis pipeline.",

Sequences co-clustering with the representative sequences were used as an approximation of the presence of the representative novel sequence in additional subjects.
