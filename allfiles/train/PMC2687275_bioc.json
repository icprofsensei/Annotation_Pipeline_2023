Only two oral \u201cSynergistetes\u201d taxa are cultivable. The aims of this study were to investigate the diversity of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d in the oral cavity, to establish whether \u201cSynergistetes\u201d taxa are more strongly associated with periodontitis than with oral health, and to visualize unculturable \u201cSynergistetes\u201d in situ. Sixty samples (saliva, dental plaque, and mucosal swabs) were collected from five subjects with periodontitis and five periodontally healthy controls. Using phylum-specific 16S rRNA gene primers, \u201cSynergistetes\u201d were identified by PCR, cloning, and sequencing of 48 clones per PCR-positive sample. Subgingival plaque samples were labeled with probes targeting rRNA of unculturable oral \u201cSynergistetes\u201d using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Analysis of 1,664 clones revealed 12 \u201cSynergistetes\u201d operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 99% sequence identity level, 5 of which were novel. \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 4.2 was found in significantly more subjects with periodontitis than controls (P = 0.048) and was more abundant in subgingival plaque at diseased sites than at healthy sites in subjects with periodontitis (P = 0.019) or controls (P = 0.019). FISH analysis revealed that unculturable oral \u201cSynergistetes\u201d cells were large curved bacilli. The human oral cavity harbors a diverse population of \u201cSynergistetes.\u201d \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 4.2 is associated with periodontitis and may have a pathogenic role.",

This disease results in loss of the attachment between the periodontium and the teeth, along with the formation of pockets which become heavily colonized with anaerobic bacteria, many of which possess virulence factors that can cause further damage to the host (21). The bacterial community found below the gum line, subgingival plaque, is extremely diverse, particularly in individuals with periodontitis, and over 400 species are estimated to inhabit the disease-associated periodontal ecosystem (29).",

Because the description of this candidate phylum is relatively recent, \u201cSynergistetes\u201d taxa have frequently been misidentified. For example, phylotypes D084, BH017, W028, W090, and BA121 were originally described as Deferribacteres (Paster), and phylotype E3_33 was originally described as Flexistipes (Munson). Despite the frequent detection of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d taxa at oral disease sites, they are almost never encountered in healthy individuals (1, 19, 29), suggesting that they have a pathogenic role. Furthermore, \u201cSynergistetes\u201d taxa among clones obtained from periodontitis patients and healthy subjects were found to be significantly associated with periodontitis (19). Specific \u201cSynergistetes\u201d phylotypes, including phylotypes W090, BH007, DO84, W028, and BH017, have also been associated with disease (18, 19, 29). However, the results of the different studies are not consistent, possibly because of heterogeneity in the clinical categorization of periodontal disease and health. Therefore, to date, it has not been possible to implicate specific taxa in periodontitis.",

Candidate primers were selected on the basis of having less than three mismatches with members of the \u201cSynergistetes\u201d group and at least six mismatches with members of the Deferribacteres. The primers had G+C contents in the range from 45 to 55% and were checked for self-complementarity. They were validated in silico by interrogation of the Ribosomal Database Project-II 16S rRNA database (5) and a BLAST search of the GenBank nucleotide database and were synthesized by MWG Biotech AG. The primers were then checked for sensitivity and specificity with the panel of strains listed in Table \u200bTable1.1. DNA was extracted from the isolates using a standard method, as described previously (28). PCR was performed using Reddy Mix PCR master mixture (ABgene United Kingdom) with 5 pmol of each primer and bacterial DNA as the template. The initial denaturation was performed at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and this was followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 45 s, annealing at 56\u00b0C for 45 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 90 s. Reverse primer 806R (5\u2032-CACACCCAGCATACATCGTTTACTGCCA 3\u2032) used in conjunction with universal forward primer 27F (22) was found to amplify all of the representatives of the phylum \u201cSynergistetes\u201d tested but did not give products with any of the other strains tested and was therefore selected for use in this study.",

The amplified genes were cloned using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) with the pCR4-TOPO plasmid vector and One Shot TOP10 chemically competent Escherichia coli cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. A library of 100 clones was prepared for each sample. Cloned inserts were reamplified by PCR using standard M13 primers and conditions. Forty-eight amplified inserts from each sample were sequenced by using a BigDye Terminator 3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) with primer 519R (22) and a 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences were checked for chimeras using Chimera_Check of Ribosomal Database Project-II (24) and excluded from further analysis if the presence of a chimera was suspected. The remaining sequences were aligned with Clustal X (42). The phylotypes were provisionally identified based on >99% sequence identity to 16S rRNA gene sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project-II 16S rRNA database (24). Using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (version 3.1), a distance matrix was prepared (with Jukes-Cantor correction), and phylogenetic trees were constructed with the neighbor-joining method incorporating bootstrap analysis. To confirm the phylogenetic placement, a subset of clones (multiple representatives of each distinct taxon, selected from a range of subjects) were further sequenced with sequencing primers 357F (22), 27F, 806R, M13(-20)F, and M13R to obtain triple coverage (including both strands) for the complete length of the 16S rRNA gene insert.

Age and gender matching of the two cohorts (periodontally healthy and diseased subjects) was demonstrated with the Mann-Whitney U test. The same test was used to compare the significance of any differences between the cohorts in the plaque and bleeding indices and in the probing depths of the healthy sites sampled. The prevalence of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d phylotypes (defined at the 99% sequence identity level) in the two cohorts was compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test. In order to directly compare the diseased and healthy subjects, data were analyzed for the five sites common to both cohorts; the two samples taken from \u201cdiseased\u201d sites in subjects with periodontitis were handled separately. \u201cSynergistetes\u201d taxon richness was assessed by comparing the mean numbers of OTUs per subject and per site for each cohort and examined with the Mann-Whitney U test. A similar comparison for the subgingival plaque samples from healthy and diseased sites in subjects with periodontitis was performed using the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test. Ordinal logistic regression (backward model) was used to identify any variables with a significant explanatory effect on differences in the number of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs. The variables considered were subject age, gender, plaque index, bleeding index, cohort (subject with periodontitis or periodontally healthy control), and site sampled (saliva, cheek mucosa, dorsum of tongue, and supra- or subgingival plaque at healthy sites). Data for plaque samples from diseased sites (only for subjects with periodontitis) were excluded from this analysis. Furthermore, \u201cSynergistetes\u201d species richness estimates were obtained and community structure comparisons were made by calculating Chao1 and abundance-based coverage estimators and Jaccard classic and Bray-Curtis similarity indices by using the program EstimateS (6). When the presence of specific \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs was examined, the significance of differences between the cohorts was assessed using the Fisher exact test. The proportion of clones belonging to each \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU was compared for the different cohorts, and the results were assessed with the Mann-Whitney U test. A three-way comparison of the proportion of each \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU in subgingival plaque samples from subjects with periodontitis and healthy controls using the Kruskall-Wallis test was followed by explanatory Mann-Whitney tests comparing data for the diseased sites in subjects with periodontitis with data for the healthy sites in either subjects with periodontitis or healthy control subjects; as two comparisons were made for the same data in this case, the P value threshold was adjusted to 0.03 rather than the normal 0.05. Comparisons between the two cohorts for the presence and proportion of clones representing each \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU (see above) were repeated for OTUs defined at the 98% sequence identity level.",

The probe selection criteria included an exact match with the target group, at least two base mismatches with other phylotypes, and brightness class I to III indicative of E. coli ribosome probe accessibility of >40% (9). Probe specificity was confirmed in silico, and probes were synthesized with one of three fluorophores at the 5\u2032 end, Alexa Fluor 488, Cy3, or Cy5. The excitation and emission spectra of these probes were sufficiently distinct that multiple probes (one with each of the three chromes) could be used together in multi-FISH experiments without the risk of crossover. Probes were validated in vitro with narrow- and broad-range panels of bacteria (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Optimal conditions for probe hybridization stringency were determined by varying the formamide concentration in the hybridization buffer at 50\u00b0C. In brief, the buffer contained 18% (vol/vol) 5 M NaCl, 2% (vol/vol) 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% (vol/vol) 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and formamide at a concentration of 0, 10, 20, 30, or 40%. After validation and optimization of individual probes, probes B_155, J.anth_63, and P1_70 were used in combination with a sample consisting of a mixture of J. anthropi and P. piscolens to confirm the expected patterns of hybridization and the overlap of fluorescent signals.",

Clones (Table \u200b(Table1)1) were grown from a 1:20 dilution of an overnight culture in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 50 \u03bcl/ml kanamycin sulfate (Invitrogen) to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4. After addition of 170 mg/liter chloramphenicol, the broth was incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,200 \u00d7 g, 10 min), resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and applied to microscope slides for FISH analysis. Although the clone FISH method provided distinguishable positive and negative results, the fluorescent signals were weak and did not allow assessment of optimal conditions for probe stringency. Therefore, optimization and further validation of the three probes targeting unculturable \u201cSynergistetes\u201d (A_487, A_845, and 3.3_65) were performed with clinical samples; extinction validation was used to infer optimal hybridization conditions by increasing the formamide concentration until there was a significant decrease in the frequency of positive reactions (14), and the three different FISH probes targeting members of unculturable \u201cSynergistetes\u201d cluster A were used simultaneously with single samples to confirm colocalization of positive reactions and therefore probe validity. For hybridization, 10 \u03bcl of a bacterial or plaque suspension in PBS was applied to each 6-mm-diameter well on 0.075% gelatin-coated, Shandon multispot microscope slides (Thermo Electron Corporation) and allowed to air dry. Cells were fixed with 30 \u03bcl of a 1:1 PBS-100% ethanol solution for 2 h at 4\u00b0C, after which the slides were washed twice with PBS. The slides were then dehydrated for 3 min each with 50%, 80%, and 96% ethanol. Hybridization was performed at 50\u00b0C for 2 h in the dark with 0.5 \u03bcl of each probe (16 \u03bcM) in 8 \u03bcl hybridization buffer at the optimal formamide concentration determined previously. This was followed by incubation in the dark at 52\u00b0C for 15 min in preheated posthybridization wash buffer containing 4.2% (vol/vol) 5 M NaCl, 2% (vol/vol) 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% (vol/vol) 0.5 M EDTA, and 0.1% (vol/vol) 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Twenty-five microliters of Vectashield mounting medium with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories Inc.) was applied to each sample after air drying, and the slides were subsequently sealed with a coverslip and varnish.",

Whereas the difference was highly statistically significant (P = 0.008), in a comparison limited to the five sites common to both cases and controls (for which the means were 6.4 and 3.4 OTUs, respectively) the difference was found to only \u201capproach\u201d statistical significance (P = 0.055). It appears, therefore, that, like the difference in the prevalence of \u201cSynergistetes,\u201d the difference in \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU richness between cases and controls may to a large extent be explained by the data for diseased sites. In addition, however, there was a significant difference between the cohorts in the mean number of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs in saliva (5.2 OTUs in cases and 1.4 OTUs in controls) and samples from the dorsum of tongue (2.6 OTUs in cases and 0.2 OTU in controls) (P = 0.029 and P = 0.034, respectively). In all subjects, the subgingival plaque sample had the highest number of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs, and in one case there were 10 OTUs. There was little difference between the cohorts in \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU richness in subgingival plaque from healthy sites (the means were 3.4 OTUs in cases and 3.0 OTUs in controls). However, in the subjects with periodontitis, there was a significantly greater number of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs in subgingival plaque from diseased sites (mean, 6.8 OTUs) than in subgingival plaque from healthy sites (mean, 3.4 OTUs) (P = 0.039). Finally, regression analysis applied to all samples except plaque samples from diseased sites revealed that the bleeding index was a significant explanatory variable (P = 0.008) for the number of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs present.",

Furthermore, the relative proportions of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs in subjects were found to differ considerably. For example, the \u201cSynergistetes\u201d clones of case A5 were dominated by \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 3.3 (64.1%), whereas case A3 harbored an apparently more diverse \u201cSynergistetes\u201d population, including the greatest number of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs (10 OTUs) with a fairly even distribution. When the prevalence of specific \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs at different sites was examined, it was found that whereas certain OTUs (\u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs 1, 3.3, 6.1, and 6.2) colonized most sites tested in each of the synergistetes-positive subjects, \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 4.2 in particular was found almost exclusively in the samples from \u201cdiseased\u201d pockets (supra- and subgingival plaque). A comparison of the periodontitis cases and healthy controls revealed that 7 of the 12 \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs were present in both cohorts, while the remaining 5 OTUs were present exclusively in the periodontitis patients (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3).3). Furthermore, novel \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 4.2, which was found in four of the five cases and none of the controls, was significantly associated with disease (P = 0.048). When relative abundance was examined, a comparison of the mean values for the percentage of clones belonging to each \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU expressed as a proportion of the total number of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d clones (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4)4) revealed a statistically significant difference between cases and controls only for \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 4.2 (P = 0.018). Since it is a reasonable assumption that the primary habitat of a putative periodontal \u201cpathogen\u201d is plaque at sites of disease and it was noted that \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 4.2 was found almost exclusively in such habitats, a comparison of the proportions of clones belonging to each OTU was made between cases and controls, particularly for subgingival plaque samples (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5).5). This three-way comparison (Kruskall-Wallis test) gave statistically significant results (P = 0.007) for \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 4.2, for which the proportion of clones in subgingival plaque obtained from diseased sites in periodontitis cases was significantly greater than the proportion of clones in subgingival samples obtained either from healthy sites in the same patients (P = 0.019) or from healthy sites in the control subjects (P = 0.019). OTUs were also defined at a less stringent level, 98% sequence identity, which resulted in a reduction in the number of groups to six, involving merging of OTUs 2, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3; OTUs 4.1 and 4.2; OTUs 4.3 and 4.4; and OTUs 6.1 and 6.2. For the six groups, statistically significant differences between the two cohorts were found only for OTUs 4.1 and 4.2 combined, a significantly greater number of which was present in periodontitis cases than in healthy controls (P = 0.048) and which comprised a significantly larger proportion of the clones in cases (P = 0.018) and a significantly greater percentage of the clones from subgingival plaque from deep periodontal pockets in cases than from subgingival plaque from shallow sites in cases (P = 0.019) or controls (P = 0.019).",

It was noteworthy that all phylotypes detected in the current study were members of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d cluster A comprising the as-yet-unculturable \u201cSynergistetes,\u201d and neither of the two cultivable oral \u201cSynergistetes\u201d taxa (cluster B) was detected. A possible explanation for this, that 16S rRNA genes of cluster B phylotypes were not amplified by the primer set used, can be excluded in light of the facts that these taxa (i) were used successfully in this study as the positive controls for PCR and (ii) have been identified by molecular culture-independent methods in plaque and root canal samples (20, 31). Therefore, a more likely explanation is absence or low relative abundance of cluster B \u201cSynergistetes\u201d in the clinical samples.",

However, there was some cross-reaction with some members of the family Acidaminococcaceae in the phylum Firmicutes, which have a similar region in the 16S rRNA gene, but the region has four to six base mismatches with the 806R primer. Experimentation with primer annealing temperatures higher than 56\u00b0C (to reduce the tolerance of the primers) significantly reduced the amount of amplicon and was therefore not pursued further. There is some evidence to suggest that if the target of a specific primer is present only at low levels or is absent from a sample, then the primer more readily selects other taxa which are less stringently matched (37). Accordingly, the larger proportion of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d sequences (of the total number of sequences) in subjects with periodontitis (61.4%) than in healthy controls (28.1%) may perhaps imply that there was a greater abundance of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d in the cases.",

It has been suggested that PCR microvariation artifacts are not uncommon for mixed templates of closely related 16S rRNA gene sequences (39); however, without comparison with a control group involving a mixed template with a broader range, whether the composition of a PCR template plays a significant role remains unknown. Although sequence microvariation may also be the result of PCR errors attributable to the use of a nonproofreading polymerase, the absence of chimeras and the generation of identical sequences representing novel taxa from multiple samples and subjects make this unlikely. The phylogenetic trees with highly branched topology and relatively low bootstrap values and the presence of significant sequence microvariation suggest that recombination events are common for this group of bacteria, which may be indicative of natural competence. Furthermore, in a genome survey of P. piscolens, it was found that some P. piscolens genes were highly similar to genes in Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola, two species which are members of distinct phyla but which frequently inhabit subgingival plaque, and that genes encoding mobile genetic elements were present (8). Horizontal gene transfer may be common among bacterial inhabitants of dental plaque, perhaps due to their close proximity (25, 26).",

Although the time of onset and the duration of disease in the subjects with chronic periodontitis were unknown, the collection of plaque samples from different subjects at sites with comparable clinical probing depths and bleeding status reduced the potential for heterogeneity. Furthermore, plaque samples from four sites per subject were pooled in an effort to render the results representative of each plaque category. Subgingival plaque (particularly that taken from deep periodontal pockets) was the habitat most frequently colonized and contained the greatest range of OTUs, making it a possible source of the \u201cSynergistetes\u201d found at other sites in the oral cavity. Furthermore, the number of saliva and tongue dorsum samples positive for \u201cSynergistetes\u201d was greater for the cases than for the periodontally healthy controls, and the samples from the cases were statistically significantly more OTU rich. There is evidence of dissemination of periodontitis-associated bacteria into saliva and onto the tongue following mechanical periodontal therapy, implying that the periodontal pocket is the source of putative periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity (3).",

Thus, the \u201cSynergistetes\u201d phylum of bacteria appears to have a stronger association with periodontitis than with health. This is in agreement with previous reports of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d detected in humans, which have found that these bacteria are related to sites of disease, including dental sites (7, 13, 27, 29, 36) and sites involving the foot, scalp, and blood (13). Furthermore, the \u201cSynergistetes\u201d species characterized to date have been found to be proteolytic and strictly anaerobic, a profile matched by the typical periodontal \u201cpathogen.\u201d It is interesting that irrespective of periodontal disease or health categorization, the overall gingival bleeding status of the subjects in this study had a significant impact on the \u201cdiversity\u201d of \u201cSynergistetes\u201d at other oral sites; perhaps \u201cSynergistetes,\u201d like Porphyromonas gingivalis belonging to the \u201cred cluster\u201d of potentially periodontopathic bacteria (38), are metabolically adapted to prefer an environment where there is inflammation and bleeding.",

                    "text": "Naturally, it is possible that some bacteria in any particular phylum are harmless commensals, whereas others (whether endogenous or exogenous) may possess particular virulence mechanisms predisposing them to pathogenesis in a susceptible host. Therefore, it is more useful to investigate an association with disease or health for individual species or clusters of species in a phylum rather than for the phylum as a whole. The results revealed that certain \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTUs, \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 1 (including phylotypes BH017 and JV006), \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 3.3 (including phylotype BH007), \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 6.1 (including phylotypes W028 and MCE3_120), and \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 6.2 (including phylotype W090), were present in the majority of both cases and controls, at most of the intraoral sites investigated and at high \u201crelative abundances\u201d in both cohorts (where the relative proportions of sequences representing each \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU were used to indicate the relative abundance of the OTU in the clinical sample). These OTUs are likely to be oral commensals. It has been reported that phylotype BH017 was not associated with periodontitis (19); however, other studies (18, 29) found that this phylotype and other phylotypes mentioned above have a strong association with disease. The possible reasons for the conflicting results are (i) designation of \u201cdisease association\u201d based on prevalence alone (29), as opposed to a combination of prevalence and relative abundance, and (ii) utilization of a single primer pair (for nested PCR) targeting both \u201cSynergistetes\u201d phylotypes D084 and BH017 (18), although these two phylotypes fell into distinct OTUs in the current study. The prevalence and abundance of the novel taxon \u201cSynergistetes\u201d OTU 4.2, which was found almost exclusively in plaque from \u201cdiseased\u201d sites, were significantly higher in periodontitis cases than in healthy controls, indicating an association with disease rather than with health. OTUs in this study were defined using a 99% sequence identity threshold, as recommended on the basis of correlation with DNA-DNA reassociation values (40). When the 98% sequence identity threshold was used to define taxa, the enlarged group which included OTU 4.2 was also significantly associated with periodontitis, providing further support that this OTU represents a disease marker for periodontitis and may potentially play a pathogenic role in the disease.",
