The communities of three patients harboured solitary abundances of Neisseriaceae (patient ID 50), Streptococcaceae (patient ID 73) and Pasteurellaceae (patient ID 64) (figure 3). However, the microbiota of the 30 remaining patients primarily consisted of bacterial families known as commensals, that is, non-pathogenic bacteria colonising the airways. Such commensals included Prevotellaceae, Streptococcaceae and Acidaminococcaceae. Due to the nature of the bacterial families present, this again indicated that the microbiota may not be disturbed in IIP, non-IIP, sarcoidosis and PCP as compared with healthy controls. In addition, a more detailed investigation of the relative differences of the bacterial families revealed that the clinical diagnosis (IIP, non-IIP, sarcoidosis, PCP or controls) is only significantly associated with the relative mean abundance of Flavobacteriaceae (table 2). For all other families, no significant differences were detected (table 2).",

Using procrustes analysis we revealed that 7 of 33 patients (ID 17, 38, 50, 53, 64, 73 and 108) displayed differences exceeding the upper quantile of procrustes errors, suggesting a significant disordered microbiota between the upper and lower respiratory tract (figure 4).",

Patient 38 had mainly commensal Corynebacteriaceae in the oropharynx, but essentially harbouring \u2018normal\u2019 Prevotellaceae, Acidaminococcaceae and Streptococcaceae in the BAL. Therefore, this subject could be considered as healthy in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms indicative of an upper respiratory tract infection. The high procrustes residuals in patients 17 and 64 have their origins in the high abundances of Pasteurellaceae (ie, Haemophilus influenzae as confirmed by culture) in the upper (patient 17) and lower (patient 64) respiratory tract (figure 3). H. influenzae is frequently detected in microbial cultures, but it is often unclear if this reflects non-pathogenic colonisation or infection, given that different strains with both features are known.21 In our study, we identified H. influenzae in patients 17, 25 and 64, but only in patient 64, the overall microbiota was disordered in the lower respiratory tract, suggesting infection rather than colonisation (figure 3). Patient 64 was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis without evidence by conventional microbiology for respiratory tract infection and did not improve under an initial course of systemic corticosteroid treatment. Based on the microbiota results of the lower airways, H. influenzae may have played a clinically relevant role in the course of the exacerbation, and therefore, in the absence of the \u2018normal\u2019 microbiota, an initial antibiotic treatment may have been an appropriate treatment option.",

This finding, together with the excess Neisseriaceae in patients 50 and 108, remains unclear.

This finding was not applicable for seven individuals revealing significant divergence between the upper and lower respiratory tract. This may indicate disturbed microbiota in the upper or lower airways, but has to be investigated for each patient separately. Based on our data, we suggest that the identification of microbiota discontinuity along the respiratory tract should generally be interpreted by taking into account the clinical presentation of the patient.",

Depletion of the normal microbiota with \u2018overgrowth\u2019 of a single bacterial species may indicate that this is clinically relevant, for example, as seen with H. influenzae in our study.

First, based on the ATS/ERS ILD classification into different groups, subjects presented with a certain degree of heterogeneity within this study. Nevertheless, we feel that selecting the five groups, we have compared clinically relevant populations. Second, we did not perform extensive ultra-deep sequencing of viruses and fungi in the collection of samples. Although this has recently been shown to be feasible, fungi identified by this technique were mostly cultivated and known.31 We routinely searched for 15 respiratory viruses, for Pneumocystis jirovecii by immunofluorescence and PCR, measured galactomannan levels and cultured fungi and mycobacteria. We are therefore confident that we did not neglect clinically relevant and currently known pathogens. Third, the number of patients included in this feasibility study is relatively low; therefore, a potential added benefit of characterising microbiota to distinguish between presence of a relevant pathogen and non-infectious clinical worsening in an ILD patient requires further evaluation in prospective, larger studies. Finally, this study includes patients with exacerbated IIP and non-IIP. As we did not include samples from IIP and non-IIP patients during disease stability, we were therefore not able to investigate longitudinal microbiota changes during the actual exacerbation within this study. Nevertheless, considering that we did not detect significant microbiota differences in exacerbated ILD patients compared with normal controls, we hypothesise that changes from an ILD-driven microbiota towards a \u2018normal\u2019 microbiota during exacerbation is unlikely and that the presence of a \u2018normal\u2019 microbiota during times of stability would be more probable. In agreement with this hypothesis, significant changes in community structure or diversity were not observed at the time of exacerbation in adults with cystic fibrosis.32\n33",

Analysis of the topographical continuity along the respiratory tract may provide important additional information to assist the physician in understanding the underlying cause of clinical worsening in ILD patients, a process that will always involve distinguishing infectious from non-infectious causes of inflammation. A potential future application of 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing is the search of hitherto insufficiently known bacteria that may be relevant in the pathogenesis and course of pulmonary disease.",
