The most common species recovered from infants (B. bifidum, B. longum, and B. breve) show vigorous or moderate growth on HMOs as a sole carbon source, while other strains such as B. adolescentis and B. animals show no growth [6]. Consequently, it has been shown that breast-fed infants with a secretor mother possess higher relative counts of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides in their first 4 months of life, compared to breast-fed infants whose mother are non-secretors [12]. However, very little is known in terms of whether these differences persist beyond the period of breast-feeding.",

These questionnaires collected data relating to feeding method which was used to classify children. Children who received only breast milk at the 4 month survey were classified as exclusively breast-fed, while children who received both breast milk and infant formula at the 4 month survey where classified as combined fed. Breast-feeding was initiated in all children and therefore a child was classified as formula-fed if they had discontinued breast-feeding before 2 months of age and as such were reported as receiving only infant formula from the 2 months survey onwards.",

LEfSe was used to identify functional pathways differentially expressed by secretor status. LEfSe is an algorithm for identifying features that characterise the differences between 2 or more groups or conditions [30]. Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test is first applied to detect features with significant differential abundance and subsequently Wilcoxon rank-sum test is used to investigate biological consistency using a set of pairwise tests among sub-classes. Finally, Linear Discriminant Analysis was employed to estimate the effect size of each differentially abundant feature using the default effect size threshold of 2 (log10).",

Secretor status was determined for 30 out of the 37 child participants. One child was found to have the rare Le(a+b+) blood type classifying them as a partial secretor [31] and was therefore excluded. Another child was excluded due to still being breast-fed, leaving 28 children with 20 being secretors (71.4%). Secretor status was determined for all 17 eligible mothers with 11 being secretors (64.7%). The characteristics of the children by child and mother secretor status are detailed in Table 1. The group of children with a non-secretor mother included 2 formula-fed children while the group of children with a secretor mother included no children classified as formula-fed. To ensure this did not influence the reported results all analysis by maternal secretor status was repeated in an ABF (Any Breast-Feeding) subgroup with the 2 formula-fed children excluded. In addition, all analysis by maternal secretor status was also conducted in an EBF (Exclusively Breast-Fed) sub-group, containing only children who had been exclusively breast-fed for at least 4 months.

This technique does not allow for the differentiation of homozygous and heterozygous Secretor gene expression, which has been shown to further influence microbiota composition and function [32]. In addition, the influence of pregnancy on Lewis blood typing resulted in significant numbers of mothers being excluded in this cohort of 2 to 3 year old children. Despite the small sample size of this pilot study we were able to identify statistically significant variations in the gut microbiota of 2 to 3 year old children that could be linked with the child and mother\u2019s secretor status.",

Mothers\u2019 secretor status was significant in explaining a relatively large amount of the variation in the children\u2019s stool microbiota profiles which reached significance only when the analysis was limited to children who had been exclusively breast-fed in their first 4 months of life. This observation suggests that breast-feeding may be an important mechanism by which a mother\u2019s secretor status modulates her child\u2019s gut microbiota.",

                    "text": "Lewis et al [12] reported that the abundance of the Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides genera are greater for infants receiving breast milk from secretor mothers compared to infants receiving non-secretor breast milk during their first 4 months of life. Further analysis revealed a bimodal distribution in Bifidobacteria abundance leading the authors to conclude that the reduced Bifidobacteria abundance in infants of non-secretor mothers reflected an apparent delay in the transition from low to high Bifidobacteria abundance. Here, we show that the microbiota of children who received secretor breast milk exclusively in the first 4 months of life also exhibited higher abundance of Bifidobacteria at 2 to 3 years but there were no significant differences observed between groups for Bacteroides. According to Freter\u2019s nutrient-niche theory, population sizes of species are determined by the availability of their preferred nutrients [33]. Infant\u2019s gut microbiota are dominated by B. longum, B. breve and B. bifidum which appear specifically adapted to an environment rich in HMOs [6, 33]. In particular, infants with a Bifidobacteria dominated microbiota have been shown to have less fucosylated oligosaccharides in their faecal samples compared to infants with Bacteroides dominated microbiota, suggesting the former\u2019s preference for fucosylated oligosaccharide consumption [12]. In general terms, bifidobacterial genomes contain fewer genes encoding for the breakdown of complex polysaccharides [34] consistent with their preference for the degradation of HMOs, starch and starch hydrolysates, with the dietary intake of starch at 9 months of age having been shown to be positively correlated with the abundance of Bifidobacteria spp. [35]. Bacteroides spp. are well recognised for their versatility to utilise a wide variety of complex plant polysaccharides [33] and amino acids [36] and have been identified as being associated with protein intake [36, 37] and the microbiota of populations living Western lifestyles [38\u201341]. In that context, the altered HMO composition and quantities in non-secretor breastmilk may have negative impacts on Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides levels during the period of breast-feeding, however the introduction of solid foods and the cessation of breast-feeding would better suit the nutritional versatility and proliferation of Bacteroides spp via niche expansion, but not Bifidobacteria populations. This is supported by the observed significant increase in Bacteroides in the faecal microbiota of exclusively breastfed infants following the introduction of solid foods [42]. Taken together, this could explain why the lack of \u03b11,2 fucosyl-oligosaccharides in non-secretor breast milk appears to result in a sustained reduction in Bifidobacterium levels at 2 to 3 years of age, but not Bacteroides levels, following the cessation of breast-feeding.",

The prevalence of B. uniformis and B. plebeius within the first 4 months of life has been shown to be associated with both feeding method and genetic risk of Coeliac disease (HLA-DQ genotype), with the high risk genotype being associated with reduced prevalence of both B. uniformis and B. plebeius [43]. In addition, non-secretor status is associated with increased risk of some immune-mediated diseases such as Coeliac disease [44] Crohn\u2019s disease [32] and Type 1 Diabetes [45]. Here, we found Prevotella and species related to Prevotella copri were higher in our non-secretor children and the children of non-secretor mothers, and these bacteria have also been reported to be present at higher levels in untreated Coeliac disease [46] and new onset rhematoid arthritis patients [47] but appear to be reduced in both Crohn\u2019s disease and Type 1 Diabetes [48, 49]. B. plebebius has been shown to utilise sulphated polysaccharides, and is further distinguished by its acquisition of genes homologous to those in marine algae for this purpose [50] and similarly, some Prevotella species have been recognised as being capable of similar de-sulfation of oligosaccharides [51]. These enzymes would plausibly facilitate the utilisation of sulphated gut mucins and acidic sulphated HMOs, whose relative abundance is increased in non-secretor breast milk [12]. Taken together this suggests a mechanism by which non-secretor status would favour the proliferation of these species.",

Here we report that the composition and function of the gut microbiota of 2 to 3 year old children could be linked with the child and mother\u2019s secretor status, presumably mediated by associated alterations in host glycans and breast milk associated HMOs. This highlights the need for mother\u2019s and child\u2019s secretor status to be considered when conducting research into the topic of breast-feeding particularly if the outcome is likely to be related to the microbiota directly or indirectly. In mice, gut microbiota composition can be clustered by secretor status on a standard polysaccharide-rich diet but these specific differences between secretor status were not evident with a polysaccharide deficient diet [15] suggesting complex interactions between the host and dietary sources of polysaccharides on gut microbiota composition. As such, it must be considered that the form and composition of diet in early life would constitute an additional influence guiding the development of the gut microbiota. Understanding these complex interactions is imperative to inform dietary choices in early life to best support long term health and well-being.",
