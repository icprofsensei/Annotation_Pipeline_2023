The oral microbiome has numerous advantages that make it particularly useful for clinical studies, including non-invasive collection, temporal stability, and lower complexity relative to other niches, such as the gut. Despite recent discoveries made in this area, it is unknown how the oral microbiome responds to short-term hospitalization. Previous studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiome is extremely sensitive to short-term hospitalization and that these changes are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Here, we present a comprehensive pipeline for reliable bedside collection, sequencing, and analysis of the human salivary microbiome. We also develop a novel oral-specific mock community for pipeline validation. Using our methodology, we analyzed the salivary microbiomes of patients before and during hospitalization or azithromycin treatment to profile impacts on this community. Our findings indicate that azithromycin alters the diversity and taxonomic composition of the salivary microbiome; however, we also found that short-term hospitalization does not impact the richness or structure of this community, suggesting that the oral cavity may be less susceptible to dysbiosis during short-term hospitalization.",

In recent years, the oral microbiome has received an increasing amount of attention due in part to the major role it has been shown to play in human health9\u201318. Specifically, oral microbial diversity appears to be a strong indicator of dental health. For example, children with higher levels of oral microbiome diversity were found to have a decreased risk of developing severe caries19\u201321. Alternatively, decreased oral microbiome diversity is associated with a number of diseased states20, 22. In both children and adults, the dental plaques of individuals with caries displayed a lower microbial diversity and an increased relative abundance of Streptococcus spp. compared with healthy individuals21. Additionally, reduced taxonomic diversity in the subgingival microbiome of smokers is associated with severe periodontal disease22. It has also been suggested that the oral microbiome may play a role in oral cancers23\u201325. One study analyzing the salivary microbiome of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma found that the presence of three species (Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Streptococcus mitis) was predictive of cancer in 80% of cases25. Therefore, it is evident that the oral microbiome is a major determinant of oral and possibly overall health.",

For example, prior research has suggested that poor oral hygiene increases the risk of community-acquired pneumonia in elderly patients13, 15. Due to its proximity to the respiratory tract, it is unsurprising that the oral microbiota plays a role in pulmonary infections. However, links between periodontal pathogens and more systemic diseases have been observed in recent years, suggesting that the oral microbiota may also have broader impacts on human health9, 26\u201329. For example, several bacterial genera typically found in the oral cavity (including Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Neisseria) have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques, providing a link to cardiovascular disease30\u201332. Additionally, recent studies have suggested a growing link between oral dysbiosis and diabetes9, 26\u201328. Diabetic patients have altered subgingival microbiomes, with a higher prevalence of periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis\n27. Conversely, there is some evidence that unstable periodontitis worsens glycemic control in diabetic individuals, suggesting a potentially important role in regulating host metabolism33. All of these findings suggest that the oral microbiota plays a significant role in human health beyond the oral cavity. While these early studies are intriguing, more research is necessary to deepen our understanding of the links between microbial communities, human health, and medical intervention.",

First, the salivary microbiome appears to be remarkably consistent between individuals and is considerably less diverse in comparison to the fecal microbiota34. This consistency and lower diversity should enable greater sequencing depth of these communities and also simplify downstream statistical analyses35. Furthermore, this consistency is crucial in the context of longitudinal studies. Previous literature suggests that the gut microbiome is prone to large shifts in diversity and composition in response to several perturbations, including diet, exercise, and hospitalization6, 7, 36\u201339. Such instability could make it difficult in some cases to discern the causes of microbiome shifts and their relevance to human health in the clinical setting. Using a community that is more temporally consistent such as the salivary microbiome may improve our understanding of how different treatments or perturbations affect the human microbiota. Additionally, while studies suggest significant temporal stability, the salivary microbiome has been shown to be perturbed during various disease states, such as polycystic ovary disease and diabetes28, 29. Thus, the combination of the salivary microbiome\u2019s stability in the absence of perturbations and its responsiveness to systemic disease make it an intriguing option for analysis in clinical studies.",

Saliva samples can be rapidly collected from subjects and immediately preserved, allowing accurate profiling of taxonomic changes in response to different treatments or disease states. This feature makes the oral microbiome particularly promising as a tool for clinical research, as it would allow health professionals and researchers to closely monitor the impacts of treatment on the microbiota. Additionally, this contrasts with other microbial niches such as the gut, which is typically profiled using fecal matter that is collected after a lengthy transit through the gastrointestinal tract. This process induces taxonomic shifts, thereby introducing a confounding factor when determining associations between taxa and various health states40.",

These changes not only increase the risk of hospital-associated infections, but introduce confounding factors that would make it difficult to identify the causes of specific shifts in downstream analyses38, 39, 41\u201344.

Using this resource, we compared the performance of two commonly sequenced regions of the 16S rRNA gene in the analysis of the salivary microbiome. Using our optimized workflow, we subsequently show that the salivary microbiome of patients undergoing short-term hospitalization is remarkably consistent between individuals. This consistency contrasts sharply with other niches such as the gut, which has been shown in previous studies to display much higher levels of inter-individual variation34. Furthermore, our data show that azithromycin treatment alters the diversity and taxonomic composition of the salivary microbiome; conversely, we found that this community is largely unaffected by short-term hospitalization. This contrasts with previous findings that indicate that the gut microbiome is profoundly sensitive to the impacts of hospitalization39, 42, 43. These findings suggest that short-term hospitalization may not be associated with significant negative impacts on the health of the oral microbiome.",

To do so, we compared the performance of two commonly utilized regions, V1V2 and V4V5, using a mock community composed of bacterial genomic DNA, developed for the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and available through BEI Resources (HM-783D). The composition of this mock community is summarized in Supplementary Table\u00a0S1. Rarefaction analysis of the mock community suggested that the V1V2 region can identify more unique ribosomal sequence variants (RSVs) than was possible with V4V5 (Fig.\u00a02A). As a result, the alpha diversity of this mock community was found to be higher using the V1V2 region regardless of which metric was used (Fig.\u00a02B and C). Distinct differences can also be seen between the two regions when comparing relative abundance of taxa at the genus level (Fig.\u00a02D). In total, the V1V2 region could detect 16 of the 17 genera present in the mock community while V4V5 was only able to detect ten (Supplementary Table\u00a0S2). Furthermore, the V4V5 dataset was dominated by only three genera: Streptococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, and Rhodobacter. Similarly, the V1V2 dataset was dominated by a small number of genera; using V1V2, however, we could detect Staphylococcus - a major component of the HM-783D mock community that was undetected using V4V5 (Fig.\u00a02D). These results are somewhat similar to previous work published by Fouhy et al. using an analogous mock community. They also observed that V4V5 was unable to detect Staphylococcus in appreciable quantities on an Illumina MiSeq, suggesting that this may be a major limitation of using the V4V5 region in microbiome studies49. Therefore, these findings suggest that the V1V2 region is capable of more accurately recapitulating the composition of the mock microbial community.\n",

However, many of the taxa found in the mock community are not typically found in the oral cavity34, 50, 51. Therefore, we generated our own mock communities using genomic DNA extracted from eleven known residents of the oral cavity or closely related species. The composition of these community was based on previously published data and our own preliminary sequencing results. To test the ability of each hypervariable region to detect differences in community composition, we generated both an even and a staggered version of this mock community. The theoretical and observed composition of these mock communities with each region can be found in Supplementary Table\u00a0S3 and S4, respectively. When analyzing the even mock community, we found that the V1V2 region was able to better capture the true community composition (Fig.\u00a03A). The V4V5 region overrepresented Neisseria relative to its true proportions and was nearly unable to detect Porphyromonas. While V1V2 somewhat overrepresented Neisseria, this effect was much more pronounced with V4V5 (Fig.\u00a03A). We also observed several commonalities between the two regions; for example, both regions overrepresented Gemella and underrepresented Oribacterium and Fusobacterium relative to their true proportions (Fig.\u00a03A). When analyzing alpha diversity, we found that V1V2 was able to detect considerably higher levels of Shannon diversity, a measure of richness (Fig.\u00a03B). Because this community was composed of eleven genera mixed in even proportions, we next analyzed Simpson diversity \u2013 a common metric to measure the evenness of a community. We found that the Simpson diversity was considerably higher for the V1V2 region in comparison to the V4V5 region indicating that V1V2 was superior in detecting the evenness of our community and suggesting that V1V2 is better suited to analyze communities of oral bacteria (Fig.\u00a03C).\n",

Both regions underrepresented the relative proportions of Oribacterium and Fusobacterium. However, V1V2 overrepresented Actinomyces while V4V5 overrepresented Gemella and Lactobacillus. As was the case with the even community, both V1V2 and V4V5 overrepresented Neisseria relative to its true proportions; however, this effect was more dramatic for V4V5. Similarly, V4V5 was unable to detect Porphyromonas in appreciable quantities (Fig.\u00a03D). When we analyzed Shannon diversity, we found that both regions were able to capture approximately the same level of richness within the mock community (Fig.\u00a03E). Interestingly, we found that the V4V5 region detected a higher level of evenness as measured with Simpson diversity (Fig.\u00a03F). However, this finding is problematic because this mock community was not designed to be evenly distributed; therefore, this further suggests that the V4V5 may not accurately represent the true proportions of bacteria typically found in the oral cavity.",

Therefore, we wished to test the performance of both regions of the 16S rRNA gene when analyzing saliva samples collected from patients. For our study, we recruited twelve patients that were admitted for treatment to Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Patients were included in the study if they were over the age of 18 and were excluded if they were receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Additionally, none of the patients had received antibiotics at any point during their participation in this study or in the six months prior to admission; therefore, we could rule out antibiotic-induced perturbations as a confounding factor in our analysis. Each participant provided two saliva samples: one at the time of admission (day 1) and another\u00a0at three days post-admission (day 4). We chose to perform a 72\u2009hour follow-up because the average hospital stay in the United States is approximately 4.5 days52. Lastly, we included patients with a variety of diagnoses in our short-term hospitalization group to account for potential pathology- or treatment-induced effects on the salivary microbiome. Currently, it is largely unknown how the salivary microbiome responds during disease and clinical treatment. Recent work, however, suggests that these communities are altered during diabetes and polycystic ovary disease28, 29; therefore, it is likely that other systemic pathologies have a similar impact. By including patients with a wide variety of diagnoses and treatments, we are avoiding bias intrinsic to single pathologies. Otherwise, we concluded that it would be too difficult to determine whether any potential shifts in this community were caused by clinical pathology or by short-term hospitalization itself. However, we excluded all patients receiving antibiotic therapy due to the strong possibility that treatment could cause significant shifts within this community. The characteristics of the participants in our study are summarized in Table\u00a01 along with their respective age, sex, and diagnosis.\n",

                    "text": "Rarefaction analysis of human saliva samples demonstrated that the V1V2 region could detect nearly twice as many unique ribosomal sequence variants as V4V5 (Fig.\u00a04A). Thus, the V1V2 samples displayed higher Shannon and Simpson diversities relative to V4V5 \u2013 a trend that was consistent for both days of sampling (Fig.\u00a04B and C). It is possible that the elevated diversity could be an artifact caused by sequencing errors. To address this concern, we chose to utilize the DADA2 software package to analyze all of our sequencing data. This package infers sample composition using error rates within a sequencing run and has been shown to produce fewer spurious sequences in comparison to other commonly used analytical pipelines53. By using this program, we reduced the likelihood that our rarefaction and alpha diversity analyses would be artificially elevated by sequencing errors. When the taxonomic composition of the samples was analyzed at the phylum level, we detected higher abundances of Firmicutes using the V4V5 region while the V1V2 dataset contained a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes (Fig.\u00a05A). At the genus level, Prevotella was the most abundant taxa detected by both the V1V2 and V4V5 regions (Fig.\u00a05B). However, V1V2 detected higher levels of Streptococcus while V4V5 detected comparatively higher levels of Veillonella and Lactobacillus, two known residents of the oral cavity in humans19, 21, 24, 26, 30, 45, 50, 54\u201357. Together, the higher sequence diversity detected by V1V2 and the known limitations of V4V5 from our mock community analysis suggest that the V1V2 region may be preferable for analysis of the salivary microbiome.\n\n",

Interestingly, this pattern is reversed when we compared the average weighted and unweighted Unifrac distances (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S1). Furthermore, principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) using Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity shows that samples cluster according to the region sequenced and that the region sequenced is the primary source of variation between the samples (Fig.\u00a05D).

Conversely, the V4V5 region appears to allow better detection of the genera Bacillus and Enterococcus. Because these genera are typically found in soil and the human gut, this would suggest that the V4V5 region may be superior for those sample types instead41, 58, 61\u201363. Additionally, both rarefaction and alpha diversity analysis demonstrated that the V1V2 region is capable of detecting more sequence diversity within saliva samples in comparison to V4V5. For this reason, we suspected that the V4V5 region did not contain enough sequence variation to distinguish as many unique members of this community as did the V1V2 region. Alternatively, the V4V5 primer set could induce biases that result in the preferential amplification of a smaller portion of the microbial community.

However, it is currently unknown what impact, if any, short-term hospitalization has on the composition of the oral microbiota. Once we had established that the V1V2 region was superior for our analysis, we sought to determine the impact of short-term hospitalization on the composition of the salivary microbiome. In addition, we wanted to examine the inter-individual variation in community composition. When the data were analyzed at the phylum level, we observed that there was little temporal variation in the composition of the salivary microbiome before and after short-term hospitalization (Fig.\u00a06A). Furthermore, we observed that Firmicutes was the dominant phylum in nearly every sample, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. The relative proportions of these phyla varied somewhat between individuals. When all patients are grouped together to account for inter-individual variation, differential abundance testing showed that none of these changes were statistically significant at the genus or phylum level (negative binomial Wald test: p\u2009>\u20090.9) (Fig.\u00a06B and D). Similar results were observed when analyzing the V4V5 dataset (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S2).\n",

                    "text": "To further analyze the changes in community composition associated with short-term hospitalization, we calculated various metrics of alpha and beta diversity. Regardless of which region was analyzed, we did not detect any significant changes in either Shannon or Simpson diversity after three days of hospitalization (Fig.\u00a04B and C), suggesting that short-term hospitalization does not drastically alter the richness of the salivary microbiome. Next, we wanted to determine the impact of short-term hospitalization on the beta diversity of saliva samples. We found that the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between samples taken from the same individual on two separate days was significantly lower than the average distance between all samples (Fig.\u00a07A, p value\u2009<\u20090.001, unpaired t-test). This finding demonstrates that the distance between samples from the same individual before and during hospitalization is smaller than the distance between any two random individuals, further demonstrating that short-term hospitalization does not contribute to a significant shift in beta diversity. Lastly, we conducted PCoA analyses using unweighted Unifrac, weighted Unifrac, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity on each of our samples. In each analysis, there was no distinct pattern of clustering; however, samples from the same patient tended to cluster closely together regardless of date, further suggesting that the salivary microbiome is not significantly perturbed by short-term hospitalization (Fig.\u00a07B\u2013D). PERMANOVA analysis confirmed that there were no significant differences between the samples on days zero and three for each distance metric (p value\u2009>\u20090.9, PERMANOVA). Similar results were found using the V4V5 region (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S3). These observations suggest that not only is there little inter-individual variation within the salivary microbiome, but that this community is unaffected by short-term hospitalization. This observation also contrasts with previous findings using the gut microbiota, which is known to have a high level of inter-individual and temporal variation34, 59, 64. The lack of significant differences after short-term hospitalization could also suggest that the salivary microbiome cannot be perturbed at all, or that our techniques are not sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes. To address this concern, we collected saliva samples from patients undergoing therapy with azithromycin, a narrow-spectrum macrolide antibiotic known to induce changes in the gut microbiome65. By doing so, we hoped that these communities would verify our capabilities to detect perturbations within the salivary microbiome. While short-term azithromycin did not induce significant community shifts in beta diversity, we observed a significant reduction in both Shannon (paired t-test: p\u2009=\u20090.0334) and Simpson diversity (paired t-test: p\u2009=\u20090.0483) after three days of azithromycin treatment (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S4). Additionally, we were able to detect statistically significant increase of Firmicutes from 45.1% to 53.7% (negative binomial Wald test: p\u2009=\u20090.045) and reduction of Fusobacteria from 4.95% to 1.72% (negative binomial Wald test: p\u2009=\u20090.034) during therapy (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S4). These data demonstrate that, unlike short-term hospitalization, clinical azithromycin treatment does impact the salivary microbiome. This is an interesting and novel finding, indicating that it is possible to induce\u00a0perturbations in the salivary microbiome and that our pipeline is sensitive enough to detect these changes. Therefore, we feel that these observations strengthen our central finding that short-term hospitalization does not significantly perturb the salivary microbiome.\n",

We validated our extraction, sequencing, and analysis workflows using mock microbial communities available publicly through BEI Resources. To further validate our pipeline, we developed our own oral-specific mock community to test our ability to detect key taxa within this niche. Using these resources, we compared two commonly sequenced regions (V1V2 and V4V5) to determine which was better suited for the analysis of the salivary microbiome. Though both regions have distinct strengths and weaknesses, we concluded that the V1V2 region was more appropriate for general analysis of the salivary microbiome.

However, we did not explore the possibility that long-term hospitalization may have a more dramatic effect on the salivary microbiome; therefore, more research is required on this topic in the future. This finding differs dramatically from what has been observed in the gut, where short-term hospitalization is associated with dramatic taxonomic shifts that may increase risk of C. difficile-induced colitis39, 42\u201344. Furthermore, this observation is particularly noteworthy because our study participants varied with respect to age and diagnosis. Previous literature has demonstrated that the gut microbiota changes with both age66 and systemic pathologies67. Therefore, the fact that we detected no significant changes in the salivary microbiome after short-term hospitalization is a testament to the baseline stability of this community. One possible limitation intrinsic to this clinical study is that our sample size may have been insufficient to detect small changes in microbial population dynamics. However, we were able to detect changes in the salivary microbiome in response to short-term narrow spectrum antibiotic treatment with the same sample size. Despite the need for future expanded analysis, our data suggest that the salivary microbiome is remarkably stable while still being capable of being perturbed by clinical intervention. Though more research is needed on this topic, these initial findings suggest that the salivary community may be less susceptible to dysbiosis during short-term hospitalization.",
