Colonization status was determined by culture swabs collected from multiple body sites at enrollment, d7, and d14. Our analysis focused on patients with no MDRO at baseline, a perirectal swab collected at baseline, and at least one follow-up visit. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced from samples and processed with the mothur bioinformatics pipeline. Sequences typically associated with the skin microbiota were removed. The primary outcome was any MDRO acquisition. Exposures of interest included patient and microbiota characteristics. The Microbiome Health Index (MHI) was used to assess microbiota health. An MHI of 0 indicates a balanced abundance between taxa associated with protection and dysbiosis; an MHI above/below 0 suggests better/poorer health, respectively (Figure 1).",
