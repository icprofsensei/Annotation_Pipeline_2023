In contrast, we previously reported that antimicrobial agents without activity against P. aeruginosa were effective in the treatment of LRTI in these patients.5 It is unclear whether these bacteria are the main cause of LRTIs in NMD patients.

The Simpson index values of samples obtained in the infectious state were lower than those of the samples obtained in the non-infectious state in 11 of the 15 episodes (73.3%), indicating that the bacteria in sputum tended to show less diversity on the development of LRTI (Table 2\n). In both the infectious and non-infectious states, the top three bacteria detected by the clone library analysis were not always identified by culturing. The proportion of concordance between the two methods was 66.7% and 60.0% in the infectious and non-infectious states, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). In particular, P. aeruginosa was detected in most of the culture, whereas it was rarely detected as top three bacteria in the clone library analysis. In most cases, the predominant bacterium detected by the clone library analysis in the samples obtained in the infectious state was not consistent with the predominant bacterium detected in the non-infectious state (Supplementary Table 2).

Furthermore, bacteria that were difficult to detect routine bacteriological culturing methods were occasionally detected from these patients. Thus, gene amplification methods may be superior to culturing methods for the diagnosis of LRTIs in these patients. In fact, the clone library analysis indicated that the detection of low bacterial diversity in sputum might be useful for the diagnosis of bacterial LRTIs in NMD patients. In the cases with the discordance between the result of the clone library analysis and the culture, oral bacteria or bacteria that were less culturable were mainly detected as top three bacteria in the clone library analysis. It is also speculated that oral bacteria are assumed to be indigenous and tend to be ignored in sputum samples in ordinary clinical settings. In addition, P. aeruginosa was detected from most sputum cultures, while it was rarely detected in the clone library analysis. Although the data were not shown, the clinical symptoms in most of the eligible patients improved following the administration of antimicrobial agents without activity against P. aeruginosa, suggesting that the frequency of the bacterium as a causative pathogen of LRTI in NMD patients might not be as high as previously thought. Furthermore, although the sample size was small, the clone library analysis suggested that it may be useful to select an antimicrobial agent targeting the bacterium on the development of LRTI, when H. influenzae is detected in asymptomatic patients.",

We performed the clone library analysis in this study because it was most important to identify the causative bacteria at the spices level. However, in the future, the metagenome sequencing analysis may be superior to clone library analysis in the identification of bacteria by the further improvement of the technology.",

Although the sensitivity of the primers for the bacterial species used in this study was approximately 92%, all pathogenic bacteria could be detected by using these primers. Second, there was no method to evaluate whether the bacteria that were predominantly identified by the clone library analysis were the real causative pathogens of LRTI. In general, an increase in the bacterial load in the sputum is associated with the development of LRTIs.7, 10 Our hypothesis that predominant bacteria would become causative pathogens may be justified. Finally, study population was relatively small; this could have affected the accuracy of the statistical analysis.",
