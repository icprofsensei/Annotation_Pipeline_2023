                    "text": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease that usually affects infants and young children under 5 years of age worldwide. HFMD typically causes self-limiting illness, but development of severe cardiopulmonary and neurologic complications have also been reported [1, 2]. The clinical manifestations are typically ulcerations in the oral cavity, buccal mucosa (enanthema) and tongue with peripherally distributed cutaneous lesions and vesicular rash (exanthema) on the palms of hands and soles of feet. Other parts of the limbs including knees, elbows and buttocks may also be affected. Transmission occurs via person-to-person through direct contact with respiratory secretion, saliva, fluid from blisters, and feces from infected individuals. A number of enteroviruses belonging to the family Picornaviridae cause HFMD, although human enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus (CV) type A16 are two of the most important enteroviruses implicated in many large-scale outbreaks in Asian-Pacific countries including Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, and China [2\u20134]. Additional enterovirus species including CV-A6, CV-A10 and CV-A4 also cause HFMD [5\u20139]. Clinical symptoms resulting from CV-A16 as well as other enteroviruses are usually relatively mild and indistinguishable with low incidence of severe complications. In contrast, serious complications such as encephalitis, myocarditis, and poliomyelitis-like illness were observed when EV71 were reported as the causative pathogen [10\u201312].",

                    "text": "HFMD has been continuously present and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality of young children particularly in Asia. Typically, HFMD exhibits cyclical pattern of outbreaks every two to three years. Factors underlying the prevalence of HFMD remain controversial. Data from countries with long history of HFMD outbreaks suggest that dissemination is associated with socio-economic status, population ethnicity [13], regional climate [14\u201316], and attendance in school or care centers of school-age children [17]. The magnitude of HFMD outbreaks appears to fluctuate [3, 18, 19]. HFMD in tropical climate countries, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, typically showed years-round activity with no discrete epidemic periods although peaks during the rainy and winter seasons were also detected depending on season, year, and geographic regions [20, 21]. At present, no specific treatment for HFMD exists. Vaccines or antiviral drug against EV71 are currently being developed in Taiwan, China and Singapore but are not yet commercially available [22\u201324]. Prompted by geographically widespread outbreaks, careful monitoring of the spatial and temporal epidemiology is considered to be of great importance to control the spread of HFMD according to the different regional characteristics. As reported by the Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health of Thailand, HFMD has shown an upward trend in the last five to six years. In June 2012, the largest recorded outbreak of HFMD occurred throughout the country. This outbreak affected more than 39,000 individuals, including three deaths, over a period of four to five months with hot spots in Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son provinces [25]. In our previous study, we monitored HFMD activity in Thailand between 2008 and 2012. Our results revealed that the HFMD epidemic in 2012 was significantly different from previous ones in Thailand including the size of the epidemic and the viruses detected [26, 27]. During the 2012 epidemic, beside a high prevalence of EV71 and CV-A16, multiple EV types such as CV-A6 were also detected. Even though the standardized 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) pan-enterovirus PCR and viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) gene typing PCR assays were used [27], approximately one third of the suspected cases, mostly young children, were negative for enterovirus by these assays. These findings raised questions regarding the sensitivity of the current assay in identifying causative viruses other than EV71 and CV-A16 that may be present below the limit of detection by conventional PCR. In recent years, metagenomic has become an important strategy for virus discovery in human and animal diseases [28\u201330]. This technique, based on recognition of sequence similarities following non-specific nucleic acid amplification, circumvents some of the limitations of virus isolation, serology, and the amplification of only known conserved genomic regions [31]. To evaluate circulating enterovirus and previously uncharacterized viruses associated with HFMD, we describe here the virus community (virome) in fecal samples negative by RT-PCR for EV71 and CV-A16/A6 obtained from 29 pediatric patients with HFMD during the outbreak in Thailand in 2012.",

The inclusion criterion for patient enrollment has been described elsewhere [26, 32]. All samples were previously tested using a 5' UTR pan-enterovirus and EV71, CV-A16/A6 specific VP1 PCRs and found to be PCR negative for enteroviruses [27]. Demographic information of the patients for the 29 selected patients is summarized in Table 1. The HFMD patients were between 8 months and 5 years old (1 male: 1.4 female). Stool was suspended in 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution and subjected to a vigorous vortex to yield fecal supernatants. Then 140 \u03bcl of fecal supernatant from each of 29 HFMD patient samples were mixed into three pools, designated as HFMD-lib01 (10 samples), HFMD-lib02 (10 samples), and HFMD-lib03 (9 samples). The sample pools were centrifuged at 12,000x g and the supernatants were adjusted to 2 ml final volume using PBS. The pooled supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm membrane (Millipore, MA, USA) to remove eukaryotic- and bacterial-cell-sized particle and to enrich for viral contents. The filtrates were concentrated using ultracentrifugation at 22,000 x g for 2 hours and the pellets were resuspended with 100 \u03bcl 1X PBS. To eliminate host genome and other non-viral nucleic acids, a mixture of DNases [Turbo DNase (Life Technologies, NY, USA) and Baseline-ZERO (Epicentre, WI, USA)] and RNase (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada) were added to 120 \u03bcl of the concentrated suspension to the final volume of 140 \u03bcl followed by enzymatic digestion at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 hours. Viral particle-protected nucleic acids were then extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Total nucleic acids were eluted in 25\u03bcl RNase free water (Life Technologies, NY, USA).",

Only enterovirus (EV) species A to D and rhinovirus are human viruses. EV infections primarily cause diseases in the alimentary and respiratory tract, sometimes with manifestation in the central nervous system, most frequently in infants and young children [39]. EV-like sequences could be characterized abundantly in the pooled clinical samples including sequences most closely related to EV species A, B and D (2,142 reads) and rhinovirus (1,772 reads) (Fig 2). Approximately 45.9% (1,797/3,914) of enterovirus sequences were similar to several types within EV species A including CV-A21 [74.3% (1,336/1,797)] (Fig 2). In general, CV-A21 infection is thought to cause mild illness and is not typically associated with HFMD. The CV-A21 sequences identified in this study shared 80%-97% nucleotide identity, depending on the genomic region, to previous strains in the GenBank database. Other EV species A related sequences included 24.1% CV-A10 (433), 0.9% CV- A16 (17), 0.3% CV-A8 (6), and 0.2% EV71 (3) (Table 1). Sequences homologous to EV species B constituted 16% (342) of enterovirus reads, including CV-B1 (125) and echovirus (Echo) type 3 (17). On the basis of sequence similarity, another 200 reads were classified as EV-B but were unassignable to a specific type. In addition to EV BLAST analysis results, three nucleotide sequences from the lib01 pool, which could be assembled into a 371 nt long contig (accession number KP242036), were assigned to EV species D type 68 VP1 gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that EV68-lib01clustered with the previous reported strain identified from many countries worldwide with more than 92% nucleotide identity (Fig 3).",

First identified in 2007 from a child with febrile illness, SAFV are found in the stool of children with nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis and healthy children in Pakistan [34]. However, pathogenicity and clinical relevance of SAFV infection remain to be fully elucidated. SAFV replicates efficiently in the alimentary tract and is transmitted through oral-fecal route, consistent with possible association with gastrointestinal tract illnesses and diarrhea [49]. Infections by SAFV might also contribute to more severe symptoms in children such as HFMD-associated encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, and aseptic meningitis [50\u201353]. In this study, SAFV-related sequences were found in two HFMD pools, contributing to the third most picornavirus sequence reads detected [16.8% (792/4,706)] after HRV-C and CV-A21. Amongst the SAFV-like sequences, two contigs (5,405 nt and 524 nt) and a singlet (176 nt) were recovered from a sample pool.

Although there is no evidence indicating that RSV is an enteric pathogen, the HFMD-lib03 pool in this study contained sequences similar to RSV, which constituted 2.2% (187/8,482) of the virome.

BKV is a non-enveloped virus with a circle dsDNA genome that belongs to the Papovaviridae family. BKV has been detected in a wide range of tissue types and can persist without causing symptoms [73]. BKV can establish latent infection of the kidneys and causes neuropathy and nephropathy in immunosuppressed transplant patients [74, 75]. It has been suggested that the gastrointestinal tract is the latency site for BKV [76]. In addition, BKV can cause colonic ulceration in kidney transplant patient under immunosuppressive drug [77]. So far, route of transmission of BKV has not been clearly determined. However, accumulating evidence suggests that BKV can also be detected in the stool samples of hospitalized children and from gastroenteritis patients as well as healthy adults [78, 79].",

For HFMD-lib01, we found one sample positive for CV-A16 after conventional sequencing and BLAST analysis, while the rest of the samples in this pool tested negative. In pool HFMD-lib02, which showed high number of reads for rhinovirus-C, we also found that only one sample tested positive for rhinovirus. Finally, we identified one sample positive for CV-A21 in HFMD-lib03 pool.

Analysis of the sequences either assembled into contigs or as singletons revealed a complexity of the virus population.

In addition to the commonly identified EV71 and CV-A16, other enteroviruses have been reported to cause HFMD outbreaks in different countries including CV-A10 and CV-A6 in Finland [5] and France [80] in 2010 and in China during 2008\u20132012 [81]. CV-A21 was least reported to cause HFMD with only 42 detections throughout the 36 years of surveillance in the United States [8]. However, a study in China cited a high incidence rate of CV-A21 infection in adults with RTI [82]. Another rarely detected virus found was EV68, originally isolated in the USA in 1962 from patients with RTI [83] and has been detected sporadically thereafter. EV68 is unusual among EV in that it shares phenotypic properties of both enterovirus and rhinovirus [84]. Reports suggested that this virus was associated with RTI including pneumonia and bronchiolitis with greater severity in infant and school-aged children. Between 2008 and 2010, an increasing number of EV68 clusters in cases of RTI have been reported worldwide [85\u201388]. Outbreaks have also been reported in the USA in 2014 when EV68 infection affected more than a thousand people, mostly young children and resulting in at least 12 deaths. The association of EV68 infection and diseases other than RTI remains uncertain. Studies have linked the virus with infection of the central nervous system including acute flaccid paralysis [8] and fatal meningomyeloencephalitis [89]. In addition, by using un-biased metagenomic analysis, our results not only expanded the number of identified types of enterovirus, both common and rare, but also revealed possible circulation of multiple enterovirus types during the outbreak.",

The amount of HRV RNA detected in feces could be as abundant as enteroviruses [90] and feces-derived HRV can retain infectivity in cell culture [91, 92]. No role for HRV has been postulated for HFMD and the virus is typically present in respiratory secretion and associated with asthma exacerbation [93]. Nucleic acids from HRV and other typical respiratory viruses such as RSV in feces may reflect inactivated particles in swallowed respiratory secretions or actual replication in the digestive tract possibly aided by adaptive mutations [90].",

A study of children in India failed to associate MLB1 with diarrhea [97]. Meanwhile, MLB2 was also initially detected in fecal samples from Indian children with diarrhea [98] and in the plasma of a child with undifferentiated fever [97], suggesting replication beyond the digestive tract.

Our study found enterovirus, cardiovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and picobirnavirus in stools from pediatric HFMD patients. Several of these viruses are known to cause gastrointestinal diseases. Although co-infections with different viruses and correlates of disease severity are ongoing, it is conceivable that viral co-infections may aggravate clinical manifestation of an otherwise mild virus infection, which could result in compromised gut function and upregulated immune response leading to increased risk of morbidity. For example, during an HFMD outbreak in Sarawak, Malaysia in 1997, a subgroup of adenovirus and enterovirus were isolated from three fatal cases [108]. It is therefore conceivable that co-infection could precipitate or aggravate HFMD symptoms. Future studies to examine viral profile in individual clinical samples are warranted to clarify the possible role of co-infection with disease severity.",

First, it was not possible to equate viral read numbers with the number of children infected. Second, comparison of the viral loads of viruses with different genome types (e.g. ssRNA, dsRNA, dsDNA) was not possible since the relative efficiency of converting their genomes into next-generation sequencing-compatible DNA may vary. Although stool samples used in this study were convenient samples collected for our previous study, inclusion of other clinical specimens such as throat swab, vesicular fluid, and skin lesions would be ideal. Stool samples may harbor unknown inhibitors of PCR and present nucleic acids of non-viral origin, thus complicating analysis. Nevertheless, our findings highlight the potential advantage of next generation sequencing to detect viruses from clinical specimens, which may be present below the limit of detection by conventional PCR assay. Assessing the role, if any, of these viruses in HFMD will require the study of larger populations, including epidemiologically matched healthy controls, and the analysis of individual, rather than pooled, clinical samples.",
