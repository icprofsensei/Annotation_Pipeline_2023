Several studies of healthy human cohorts have found that although each person has a relatively distinct gastrointestinal microbiome signature, a healthy individual\u2019s microbiome remains relatively stable over time [1\u20134]. Although several factors, such as diet, drive normal levels of day-to-day microbiota variability, it appears that a steady-state equilibrium both ecologically and functionally is required for health. In contrast, acute perturbations of an individual\u2019s microbiome stability within a temporal context can lead to an unhealthy status [5, 6]. Considering that one of the principal aims of the microbiome research community is to use the microbiome as either an indicator for morbidity or to improve human health, an enhanced understanding of the kinetics and taxonomic characterization of microbiome stability in acutely ill patients is of paramount importance [7\u201311].",

Many of the previous investigations examining temporal variability of the microbiome using healthy participants have been limited by small numbers of volunteers [4, 12, 13], short periods of longitudinal sampling [2, 3, 16], or by being focused on only one site of collection [1, 4, 14, 17]. On the other hand, the limited number of temporal variability studies among ill patients have typically been in cohorts with chronic ailments such as atopic dermatitis or colitis [18\u201320]. A study of stool samples from 14 patients under intensive care described rapid shifts in microbiome composition to ultra-low diversity communities comprised of four or less taxa as a result of aggressive antibiotic treatment and other intensive care medication stresses, such as opioids [11]. Similar dramatic changes in the microbiome were also observed in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, where increased microbial chaos early after transplant is thought to be a potential risk factor for subsequent graft versus host disease [21, 22]. However, quantitative measurements of longitudinal microbial variability among ill patients and an analysis of factors affecting microbiome temporal stability are lacking [21, 23\u201325]. Moreover, despite many reports associating low microbial diversity with different illnesses, most studies associate only one-time microbiome measurements with subsequent clinical outcomes, which could be potentially problematic in settings of significant temporal variability [24, 26].",

Similar to other studies of ill patients, we observed instances of rapid and profound shifts in the microbiota in our AML cohort [11, 21, 22]. Thus, herein, we sought to quantify the overall intra-patient temporal variability of the oral and stool microbiome of this cohort expanded to 59 patients. In addition, we sought to determine the consequences of microbiome temporal instability on patient outcomes and clinical factors driving intra-patient temporal variability of the microbiome during IC. We chose to study such patients because of the opportunity to characterize the microbiome prior to receipt of chemotherapy and intense antibiotic exposure (i.e., prior to severe perturbations) and the capacity to obtain dense longitudinal sampling over the course of intensive treatment due to the extended inpatient nature of IC. Moreover, AML patients are at high risk for infection during IC and such infections are generally derived from the commensal microflora [21, 23]. We hypothesized that higher microbiome intra-patient temporal variability, driven by prolonged antibiotic exposure, would be associated with poorer clinical outcomes.",

We first sought to determine intra-patient temporal variability of \u03b1-diversity by calculating the CV of the SDI for both the oral and the stool samples for each patient. The coefficient of variation is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean; thus, a low CV would mean an individual had relatively stable species diversity over time whereas a high CV would reflect more variation. We found considerable heterogeneity in the temporal stability values of both stool (mean SDI CV 0.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25) and oral (mean SDI CV 0.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26) samples among AML patients during IC (Fig.\u00a01a). There was no statistically significant difference in CV values between the two sites (P\u2009=\u20090.16). This finding is in contrast to previous studies performed in healthy individuals where the microbiota of oral samples have been shown to be less variable compared to stool [2, 15]. The intra-patient temporal variability of other \u03b1-diversity metrics, specifically the Chao-1 diversity index and Simpson\u2019s diversity index, were also analyzed for the oral (mean Chao CV 0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18, mean Simpson CV 0.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24) and stool samples (mean Chao CV 0.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22, mean Simpson CV 0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27) of the AML cohort (Additional file 1: Figure S1a, b). Assessment of the temporal variability of \u03b1-diversity also revealed that the SDI CV of oral and stool samples from the same patients were statistically moderately correlated (P\u2009=\u20090.01, r\u2009=\u20090.33; Fig.\u00a01b). The relationship between the two sites leads to the postulation that factors influencing temporal variability of microbial diversity in treated cancer patients may be acting on both sites concurrently. Conversely, it has been reported that the variability of one body site was not associated with the variability of other body habitats in healthy cohorts [15].\n",

Here, we considered the CV of each patient\u2019s samples per site in order to characterize the dispersion of \u03b2-diversity metrics. The mean CVs of weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances for the cohort were 0.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 and 0.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 for the oral samples and 0.32\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 and 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 for stool samples, respectively (Fig.\u00a01c). Contrary to SDI CVs, the temporal variability of the weighted UniFrac distances between the oral and stool of patients was not significantly correlated (P\u2009=\u20090.10; Additional file 1: Figure S1d). Reports in healthy persons have observed associations between diversity and temporal stability, such as individuals with a more diverse microbiome are likely to have a more stable microbiome over time [4, 14, 15]. However, we did not find any statistically significant correlations between either the baseline or median SDI values of patients and their temporal variability as measured by the CV of the weighted UniFrac distances of their samples, suggesting microbiome structural variability does not appear to be affected by \u03b1-diversity in treated AML patients (Additional file 1: Figure S2).",

Thus, to begin to investigate factors that might influence temporal instability in our cohort, we sought to test the hypothesis that temporal instability was influenced by increasing relative abundance of pathogenic-associated genera, such as Enterococcus and Staphylococcus. In order to visualize this relationship, we ranked patients and their samples by CV of weighted UniFrac from smallest to greatest (low variability to high variability of microbial community structure), and correlated this with the relative abundance of specific genera (Fig.\u00a02). Consistent with our hypothesis, high weighted UniFrac CV values were moderately positively correlated with the relative abundance of pathogenic genera such as Staphylococcus (P\u2009<\u20090.001, r\u2009=\u20090.3), Streptococcus (P\u2009=\u20090.02, r\u2009=\u20090.2), and Stenotrophomonas (P\u2009=\u20090.01, r\u2009=\u20090.2) in the oral samples. Similarly, instability of community structure was statistically positively correlated with the abundance of Staphylococcus (P\u2009<\u20090.001, r\u2009=\u20090.2) and Streptococcus (P\u2009<\u20090.001, r\u2009=\u20090.2) in the stool samples. The same genera were correlated with temporal instability of microbial \u03b1-diversity (SDI CV) in oral and stool samples as well (Fig.\u00a03). Also of note, the abundance of non-pathogenic organisms in the stool, such as Akkermansia, were associated with increased temporal stability of both the microbiome community structure and diversity (both stool weighted UniFrac CV and SDI CV P\u2009<\u20090.001, r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.2). Thus, our data imply that patients with a relatively high relative abundance of commensal organisms, like Akkermansia, maintain a more stable microbiome over the course of their hospitalization whereas higher relative abundances of pathogenic-associated bacteria, like Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, are associated with temporal instability of both the oral and gastrointestinal microbiome.\n\n",

Patients were defined as stable, average, or variable according to their weighted UniFrac CV and SDI CV by dividing the population into quartiles with the bottom quartile (lowest CVs) being considered stable, and the top quartile (highest CVs) being considered variable. Figure\u00a04 denotes all genera that had statistically significant abundance differences between stability categories defined by both SDI and weighted UniFrac CVs at the same body site. Pathogenic associated genera such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus were more abundant in both oral and stool samples of individuals that were categorized as temporally variable in both the \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity (Fig.\u00a04). Confirming the analyses performed in Fig.\u00a02, Akkermensia and Subdilogranulum were more abundant in the stool of stable individuals, alluding to a possible stabilizing effect of these genera. Additionally, Pseudobutyrivibrio was also found in greater abundance in the stool of individuals with a stable microbiome, signifying its potential importance in microbiome integrity as well. Other results for relative abundance differences in specific genera (those >1% abundance) between patient stability categories can be found in Additional file 1: Figure S3.\n",

Conversely, stool microbial \u03b1-diversity temporal variability levels, but not oral, were significantly higher during IC in patients who subsequently developed an infection within 90\u00a0days post-neutrophil recovery from IC (P\u2009=\u20090.04; Fig.\u00a05c, d). None of the intra-patient microbiome temporal variability outputs were significantly associated with response of the leukemia to chemotherapy (Additional file 1: Figure S5). Moreover, we went on to assess if those genera found to be statistically correlated with microbial instability (e.g., Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Stenotrophomonas) were also correlated with infection. Indeed, individuals who contracted an infection during IC exhibited significantly higher relative abundances of Streptococcus (P\u2009<\u20090.05 for oral) and Stenotrophomonas (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for oral, P\u2009<\u20090.05 for stool) compared to those that did not. (Fig.\u00a05e). These data indicate temporal variability and microbiome composition dynamics are likely important markers for infectious risk during and after IC.\n",

Indeed, multiple studies have shown that the microbiome can significantly impact a broad variety of pathophysiologic processes, from carcinogenesis to autoimmunity to serious infections [7, 9, 18, 24, 25, 38, 39]. As almost all of the existing datasets ascertaining longitudinal variability exist in healthy controls, the limited understanding of the variability in microbiota composition for sick patients impedes the capacity to readily translate microbiome measurements into the clinical setting. The urgent need to monitor and understand microbiome dysbiosis during critical illness has been expressed with recent initiatives such as the ICU Microbiome Project (http://americangut.org/the-icu-microbiome-project-is-there-a-better-way-to-treat-infections-than-antibiotics/), the National Microbiome Initiative (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/12/fact-sheet-announcing-national-microbiome-initiative), and the Center for Disease Control\u2019s recent Broad Agency Announcement for Advanced and Innovative Solutions to Improve Public Health, which includes the request for microbiome assessment and intervention to address antibiotic resistance in both healthy individuals and in healthcare settings. Herein, we contribute to addressing this knowledge gap by analyzing the inter-patient variability of both the oral and stool microbiome for 59 AML patients using >800 samples collected over a median of 28\u00a0days, the factors driving differential variability in this cohort, and the association of inter-patient variability with clinical outcomes.",

Although a direct statistical comparison is not suitable due to differences between study methodologies, our mean SDI CV values for both oral and stool were two- to fourfold higher than both the HMP as well as a separate cohort of healthy subjects studied by Flores et al.

                    "text": "Although the overall cohort had high levels of variability, there was a wide range, showing that many patients maintained a relatively stable microbiome despite the significant stress of AML therapy and a prolonged hospital stay. It has been previously demonstrated that specific enterotypes and the diversity of the microbiome influence the potential adverse impact of antibiotics on microbial communities [40]. In our cohort, variability was associated with the predominance of potentially pathogenic genera such as Staphylococcus whereas more stable microbiomes were characterized by high levels of commensals such as Akkermansia, Subdilogranulum, and Pseudobutyrivibrio (Figs.\u00a02, \u200b,3,3, and \u200band5).5). Akkermansia spp. have been described to be important in host metabolic homeostasis, anti-inflammatory functions, such as interleukin secretion, and promoting intestinal epithelial integrity in murine models and human colonic cell lines [38, 41]. Moreover, butyrate-producing commensal microorganisms, like Akkermansia and Pseudobutyrivibrio, are important in maintaining the health of the intestinal epithelium, which in turn provides nutrients necessary for microbiota stability [9, 38, 42]. However, Akkermansia spp. have also been recently associated with loss of the colonic mucus layer and compromised intestinal barrier function in mice with graft versus host disease [43]. More perplexing was the increased abundance of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus in the stool of variable individuals, as these organisms have often been associated with microbiome maintenance and mucosal integrity [39, 44\u201347]. These results suggest the importance of performing metagenomic shotgun sequencing in order to determine the specific species among these complex genera that are associated with maintenance and variability. Therefore, in combination with the aforementioned studies, our data appear to suggest that stable microbiomes with high levels of specific commensal microorganisms might be implicated in mechanisms protecting patients from intestinal domination and subsequent infection by pathogenic bacteria. These observations raise the question of whether fecal microbiota transplantation or targeted species repletion of patients with a microbiota dominated by pathogenic bacteria could restore intestinal homeostasis [8].",

These findings are in agreement with recent findings using generalized linear models which identified antibiotic use as a significant predictor of temporal variability of the tongue, but not the gut, in healthy subjects [15]. Given previous literature associating other clinical factors, such as the age and chemotherapy, with microbiome variability and dysbiosis, it was surprising that total antibiotic exposure to all antibiotics, including prophylaxis, was the only clinical variable tested to be statistically correlated with any measure of temporal variability [2, 37]. This suggests the very treatment applied to protect the patient appears to predispose the patient to recurrent infectious-related issues. Thus, greater efforts need to be taken towards antibiotic stewardship as well as tailoring antimicrobial treatments within the context of the microbiome.",

                    "text": "Several limitations of our study bear mentioning. First, all of our patients had a single disease and were recruited from a single center, which means we do not know how these data represent the broader array of hospitalized patients. However, the relative homogeneity of the cohort was chosen in order to facilitate comparative analyses of the complex data generated in microbiome studies and to be able to characterize the microbiota prior to the patient becoming seriously ill. With this in mind, while the majority of samples were true baselines, a number of baseline samples, particularly fecal samples, were taken within the 24\u00a0h after initiation of chemotherapy due to sample availability. To our knowledge, there are no time-wise studies showing the effects of chemotherapy on the microbiome as the studies published to date comparing the microbiome before and after chemotherapy consider a wide range of days post-chemotherapy analyzed together [37]. Moreover, it is also known that the impact of chemotherapy on host factors is not typically observed until 7\u201310 days following chemotherapy initiation (e.g., neutropenia, mucositis, etc.). So, although we believe 24\u00a0h provides a reasonable window to collect baseline samples from patients urgently receiving chemotherapy, we cannot exclude the concern that chemotherapy could affect the microbiome within 24\u00a0h as this is currently unknown. Second, we used 16S rRNA analyses to determine microbial composition, limiting our classification of bacteria to the genus level. A species level analysis could be performed via shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which would also permit functional metabolomics studies that could help to elucidate mechanistic bases for our observations. However, applying such methodology to the very large number of samples in our study is currently cost prohibitive. Finally, although we had >800 microbiome measurements in our cohort, the complexity of the clinical course of our patients meant that we were limited in our ability to detect certain associations between clinical factors and microbiota variability. For example, most of our patients received various durations and combinations of antimicrobial administration that were problematic to reduce to discrete categories that could be incorporated into multivariable regression analyses. However, clinical studies of the microbiota in the acute care setting will face this same challenge which mandates large sample sizes and careful collection and analyses of both clinical and microbiome data.",

We have identified particular bacterial taxa that are positively and negatively correlated with microbiome instability and demonstrated that high temporal variability is associated with increased rates of infectious outcomes. The characterization of microbiome temporal fluctuations described herein contribute to the first steps towards advancing microbiome-based diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that can be applicable in a wide range of ailments such as cancer, critical illness, and other immune-compromised individuals. Our previous data revealed low baseline stool \u03b1-diversity was associated with infectious risk during IC while decreases in both the oral and stool \u03b1-diversity between baseline and last samples were associated with infection post-IC. [25]. These previous findings, combined with the data herein, indicate that both microbial diversity as well as intra-patient temporal variability have infectious implications when studying acutely ill patients. Our finding of high intra-patient variability having clinical implications in these patients signifies that making conclusions based on single microbiome measurements in ill patients is likely to be problematic and suggests that statistical mechanisms that capture both the composition and the overall trajectory of a patient\u2019s microbiota during illness will likely be required to fully integrate microbiome measurements into the clinical arena.",
