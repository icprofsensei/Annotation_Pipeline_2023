Among the primary challenges of clinical metagenomic sequencing is the rapid filtering of human reads to survey for pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity. Metagenomes are inherently variable due to different microbes in the samples and their relative abundance, the size and architecture of genomes, and factors such as target DNA amounts in tissue samples (i.e. human DNA versus pathogen DNA concentration). This variation in metagenomes typically manifests in sequencing datasets as low pathogen abundance, a high number of host reads, and the presence of close relatives and complex microbial communities. In addition to these challenges posed by the composition of metagenomes, high numbers of reads generated from high-throughput deep sequencing pose immense computational challenges. Accurate identification of pathogens is confounded by individual reads mapping to multiple different reference genomes due to gene similarity in different taxa present in the community or close relatives in the reference database. Available global and local sequence aligners also vary in sensitivity, specificity, and speed of detection. The efficiency of detection of pathogens in clinical samples is largely dependent on the desired taxonomic resolution of the organisms. We have developed an efficient strategy that identifies \u201call against all\u201d relationships between sequencing reads and reference genomes. Our approach allows for scaling to large reference databases and then genome reconstruction by aggregating global and local alignments, thus allowing genetic characterization of pathogens at higher taxonomic resolution. These results were consistent with strain level SNP genotyping and bacterial identification from laboratory culture.",

When a symptomatic patient enters the healthcare system, the infectious etiologic agent is rarely known. Patients often are subjected to a battery of expensive tests, often taking days to weeks for results, to narrow down the etiological agent; meanwhile the treating physician is typically forced to make management decisions based on patient symptomology and history. Next-Generation sequencing technologies have transformed our ability to rapidly generate sequence data [1]\u2013[3]; and as such, whole metagenome sequencing is emerging as the future of clinical diagnostics by providing a rapid and highly sensitive method of diagnosing and characterizing infectious agents in clinical samples [4]\u2013[9]. The goal is to replace the multitude of clinical microbiological tests with a single diagnostic approach. In clinical metagenomic analysis, microbial and host DNA are sequenced together and the likely pathogens identified and characterized to streamline treatment. Despite this seemingly simple process, there are numerous obstacles to efficient and accurate identification of pathogens in clinical samples.",

More recently, whole genome sequencing (WGS) approaches have emerged as a powerful alternative that gives a relatively unbiased and global representation of the members of the microbial community [7], [10], [11]. With the advances in sequencing technology, along with decreasing cost, it is now possible to fully interrogate the microbial communities within clinical samples [6], [12], [13], including the ability to genotype community members and understand gene composition. This diagnostic advancement can provide important insights for accurate and timely clinical management of patients. For clinical diagnostics, genus- or even species-level identification may not be sufficient for proper clinical treatment. For example, a patient suffering from methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus TCH1516 requires different treatment than a patient colonized by methicillin sensitive S. aureus Newman.",

Different metagenomic analysis pipelines incorporate available aligners (local/global) in a computational infrastructure, such as cloud computing or high performance computing (HPC), to provide accurate sequence interrogation, computational speed and the scalability necessary to query enormous numbers of metagenome reads against reference databases. There is, however, a tradeoff between the accuracy of detection and computational speed. Local alignment algorithms are considered to be more sensitive and accurate than global alignment algorithms [16], [17]. On the other hand, existing global aligners [18]\u2013[26] are typically preferred over local aligners, given the high volumes of metagenome sequences [27]. For example, PathSeq [6], MePIC [28] and SURPI [29] utilize cloud computing platforms to expand computational scalability. These computing platforms are usually available externally or commercially and have associated utilization costs but do not require server maintenance costs by the user. PathSeq, IMSA [30], VirusHunter [31] and MEGAN [32] are capable of characterizing unknown reads with BLAST, a local aligner [33]; however, with the high number of metagenome reads (>1 million), BLAST is often not optimal for clinical diagnostics given the high computational time required [16], [17]. RINS [34] and IMSA [30] invoke processes such as BLAT [35] but without parallelization and consequently have scalability issues with large reference databases.",

Assigning large numbers of reads (especially 50\u2013200 bp short reads) back to their genome of origin is problematic for multiple reasons including: a) the presence of overlapping/shared genomes from other organisms in the sample; b) querying these reads against related genomes from publicly available databases may result in a greater number of hits due to homology; and c) the computational resources required to scan through large reference databases. We have developed a pipeline, MetaGeniE, which has been designed for accurate, sensitive and specific detection of taxa in complex microbial samples and to address all of the above limitations with typical metagenomic analyses. The MetaGeniE pipeline generates an all-against-all comparison dataset between the reads and the reference database and then uses these results to generate cumulative statistics from combined local and global alignment. MetaGeniE also incorporates features such as comprehensive human read filtration and scalability to search large reference databases such as the microbial Refseq database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/), which is increasing with each release and presently around 20 GB in size.",

To reduce overall computational processing time and memory, one of two faster BWT aligners, BWA [18] or BOWTIE2 [21], are utilized initially in the pipeline. Higher CPU and memory intensive features such as data compression [27] and hash-based sensitive alignment STAMPY [19] are then utilized to further reduce the overall number of reads. The second module of the pipeline, Patho-Detect, aligns the remaining reads against known bacterial, fungal and viral sequences with BWT alignment followed with the local aligner BLAT [35] (Figure 1-B).",

The RefSeq bacterial database has doubled from 8.7 G in Release 54 to 19 G in Release 60 for bacteria and will be increasing in the future. This results in increasing demand for computational memory to scale to sizeable reference databases. To address the issue of scalability with large reference databases, we designed the pipeline to handle multiple partitions of a reference database for better memory management (Figure 1-C). Multithreaded input files query each smaller database partition (\u223c1 GB) iteratively and thus reduce the overall memory footprint. This querying of each input file fragment generates higher number of mapped-unmapped relationships against the partitioned database results per iteration, which increases the computational time. To address this issue, the pipeline utilizes custom hash functions and indexing tools formatdb and fastacmd (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/) to allow faster extraction of millions of reads as an input for the next reference database search.",

There are, however, fewer species- and strain-specific regions of the genome than genus-specific regions, given the relationships of genome composition with taxonomy. Increasing sequencing breadth across a genome allows for better taxonomic resolution of any organism present in a sample, especially for taxa that have been genetically well characterized. For metagenome data, single reads may map to multiple organisms either due to conserved microbial genomic regions (e.g., genus-specific genes) or due to the presence of closely related organisms in queried reference databases or the community being analyzed. Studies have shown metagenomic sequences share similar regions for even the simplest microbial communities [17], [45], [46]. Assigning each read to all mapped genomes might be an effective strategy as metagenome community analysis is unbiased and researchers may have no a priori knowledge about the community composition [38]. The genus specific reads will map to higher numbers of organisms followed by reads specific to species and sub-species/strains. The organism with the highest shared (genus-specific) regions, as well as unique regions, which generally belong to species- and strain-specific genes, will result in a higher percent of the genome mapped. The taxonomic rank and the detection resolution is proportional to sequencing throughput, richness of pathogen(s) in metagenome sampling and the availability of genomic data from the community members (e.g., target pathogens), or close relatives, in the reference database. We benchmarked the sensitivity and specificity of the detection step of the pipeline by evaluating simulated read libraries through identification of correct pathogen, corresponding percent read recalled, genome coverage detected, correct percentage of host reads filtered and false detection of host and/or non-host.",

The efficiency of human read filtration can be measured by the total number of human reads removed from clinical samples. To test the effect on human read filtration with different parameters, seven whole genome sequencing datasets from humans and one simulated dataset created from human reference genome (Hg19) were analyzed. The mg_bwa and mg_bw2 uses only BWA and BOWTIE2 aligners only, while mgall_bw2 and mgall_bwa uses all five steps of pipeline including fast alignment with BOWTIE2 and BWA, respectively (Table 1). We found that use of a single aligner (mg_bwa/mg_bw2) is not always efficient in removing human reads. Utilizing all the features of the MetaGeniE pipeline (mgall_bw2 and mgall_bwa) allowed higher filtration of human reads (Figure 2-A). The runtime of single step (mg_bwa/mg_bw2) was faster than running all steps of human filtration (mgall_bwa/mgall_bw2) (Figure 2-B). Keeping all parameters the same, we found that the BWA aligner ran faster than BOWTIE2 (Figure 2-B) but that this increased speed comes at a cost; BOWTIE (mg_bw2) was more sensitive than BWA (mg_bwa) and correctly aligned a higher number of human reads (Figure 2-A). However, the total number of reads removed by mgall_bw2 and mgall_bwa (that utilizes all the steps of human filtration) was nearly equal, irrespective of whether the BWA or BOWTIE2 aligner was used.",

In a single genome alignment, reads aligning to multiple loci in a reference genome are randomly assigned to a locus and SAMTools only parses these as \u201cmain\u201d hits [47]. To evaluate the ability of MetaGeniE to distinguish a known target strain from its close relatives with our all-against-all strategy, we utilized S. aureus strain TCH1516 to assess the detection of a single infection by a known strain. Staphylococcus is well-characterized genus with high number of sequenced strains, allowing us to test the specificity of detecting the correct organism from not only among the many species of Staphylococcus in the reference genome database, but also from members of its own strain or subtype (i.e. ST8-MRSA-IVa/USA300). Typically the genus-specific regions of Staphylococcus are assigned to several, or all, of the members of the genus. Reads that contribute to unique regions, which may belong to its species (S. aureus), and strain-specific genes (clonal complex 5), will result in highest percent genome coverage of the correct organism. We were able to detect S. aureus TCH1516 in all the test sets as the top hit (highest genome reconstruction/coverage) even with lowest number of reads (i.e., 100 reads). This detection occurred even when single genome alignment was not able to report correct detection (Table S1). We found that the single alignment underestimates the genome coverage compared with the results from MetaGeniE, and the coverage detected by our approach approximated to the actual coverage detected (Table S2).",

Read recall percentage is the percent of simulated reads that correctly align to the reference genome after human filtration. As the read number increased, the expected genome coverage percentage also increased; genome coverage reached 99.9% at 250K reads and thus had coverage across nearly the entire genome. The 250K reads were approximately the number of reads necessary to reconstruct the entire genome of S. aureus TCH1516 from the metagenome. As more reads were sequenced (simulated), a higher number of duplicate reads was also expected. Using the data compression feature of human filtration of pipeline (*_mgall_bw2) to remove duplicates reduced the read recall percentage but had no effect on genome coverage percentage or detection of the correct organism. The duplicate reads therefore did not add additional information; to manage computational scalability, removal of these duplicates improved MetaGeniE performance. We also found that using all the human filtration steps of the pipeline (*_mgall-bw2) as compared to using just fast alignment (*_mg_bw2) or not utilizing data compression (*_mg_dc) did not lead to underestimation of the percent genome coverage for correct pathogen detection.",

Shared regions are expected in even the simplest microbial communities so careful attention is necessary for these orthologs. The simulated library allowed us to evaluate the impact on detection due to the presence of multiple organisms in community with different genome sizes. We designed a simulated complex community of five bacteria based on a similar community composition that was previously detected from a cystic fibrosis clinical sample (See Methods). Simulated reads were generated from the reference genome of each of the five organisms and four libraries with different read numbers (i.e., 100, 1000, 10K, 100K per organism) were created. In metagenomes, many organisms may not have any complete or incomplete entries in the reference genome database. To test the specificity of detection of an unknown organism, Veillonella dispar ATCC 17748 was added to this complex community. This organism was not present in the bacterial reference genome database (RefSeq Build 60). Querying a large reference database usually results in detection of multiple organisms within same genus due to sequence homology. Therefore, for organism detection we selected the highest mapped genome percentage (i.e., the top hit) within the same genus. The correct detection was confirmed for all of the organisms except for V. dispar ATCC 17748 (Table S3). This indicates that the pipeline allowed detection of the correct organisms even in a complex community.",

The robustness of detection can be measured by loss of sensitivity (i.e., genome coverage) of any organism in a complex versus simple community infection. We compared the percent genome coverage of E. coli APEC O1 as single pathogen and in complex community. We found no loss in percent genome coverage for the E. coli APEC O1 between simple and complex community and the trend for simple and complex community overlaps completely in the Figure 4. The all-against-all relationship between the reads and reference database, therefore, allows us to detect any organism without loss in sensitivity, which could potentially occur in samples containing organisms with shared genomic regions.",

Any genome coverage percentage detected for S. aureus Newman in single infection library can be considered as false detection. The percent genome coverage of S. aureus Newman (false call) was slightly less than its true presence in multiple-infection library, due to contribution of homologous reads from S. aureus TCH1516. As summarized in (Table S4), S. aureus Newman ranked behind few other closely related genomes of S. aureus TCH1516 (CC5) in the single infection library (Table S5) but was detected as top hit in co-infection library (Table S6).",

Due to the all reads mapped against all reference strategy, the shared homology between these two organisms resulted in a higher percent genome coverage of S. aureus TCH1516 in the co-infection library than the single-infection library (Figure 5-B). The S. aureus TCH1516 was detected as top hit per genus in single infection library (Table S5) and as one of top hits with S. aureus Newman in co-infection library (Table S6). We can infer that although the \u201ctop hit per genus\u201d detection was correct in identifying the correct strain in a co-infection, proper detection of the strains in a co-infection is difficult and will require additional validation.",

With increasing sequence divergence, higher numbers of reads were not aligned by global aligner (Figure 6). MetaGeniE is nonetheless able to incorporate these divergent reads through local alignment without a decrease in the genome coverage detected (Figure 6). In all 25 of the simulated test cases (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5% and 1% divergence for 100, 1K, 10K, 100K, 250K reads), S. aureus TCH1516 was detected correctly in all except one: at 1% divergence with 100 reads.

Figure S5-1 represents the phylogenetic tree for the metagenome sequences mapping to top hit (S. aureus USA300 TCH1516) detected by pipeline for sample CF1. To confirm the accuracy of the detection of S. aureus USA300 TCH1516 for CF1 sample, the close relatives of available S. aureus from GenBank were downloaded and SNP genotyping was performed. We found that S. aureus USA300 TCH1516 detected by MetaGeniE is confirmed through SNP genotyping for CF1 and other CF samples (Figure S5). We are able to validate that detection at a high taxonomic level is possible in a clinical metagenome sample.",
