Children with maternal education below median had on average higher microbiota maturity and diversity at 18 and 30\u00a0months.

Ownership of goats was inversely associated with Shannon index at 18\u00a0months and being born by caesarean section was positively associated with Shannon index at 30\u00a0months. Results on associations between other environmental exposures and MAZ score or Shannon index at 18 or 30\u00a0months are listed in Table \u200bTable22 and Table S3. Not having access to piped water was positively associated with Shannon index in mothers with similar results in children at 30\u00a0months (Table S4). A sensitivity analysis with multiple imputation of missing data for all exposure variables yielded similar results to the analyses without imputed data (Tables S5\u2010S7).",

The largest number of associations was in children observed for season, maternal education, and water source, whereas in mothers, most differences were related to HIV status. In general, the average gut microbiota composition in children in our study sample was comparable to that in previous studies in similar populations that have reported microbiota compositions dominated by the genus Prevotella.11\n",

As a further limitation, about 10% of the participants were lost to follow\u2010up, mostly because they moved or were unwilling to continue in the study. In general, participants who did not provide data for this study had higher socio\u2010economic status than participants from whom data were analysed, but the differences were small and are unlikely to affect the validity of our results. This study only included characteristics of the living environment and basic maternal factors as exposure variables, but it is possible that unmeasured maternal factors like stress and exposure to violence could have an influence on children's gut microbiota in this population.29, 30, 31\n",

Socio\u2010economic factors and biodiversity of the living environment have previously been associated with microbiota.12, 34 These reports are consistent with our study in which maternal education and type of water source, which can be seen as proxies for socio\u2010economic status, were associated with different aspects of microbiota composition in both children and their mothers. The impact of water source has not been studied previously; to understand whether there could be a direct link with the microbiota, the differences in quality of water from different sources such as pipe, borehole, or well would need to be examined.",

There was considerable variation within our study sample in the outcome measures for microbiota maturity and diversity, but it is possible that these measures are too broad to capture specific differences in microbiota composition that are related to environmental factors. Several taxa that were previously found to be age discriminatory in this population were associated with the predictor variables studied, which may indicate that changes over time in microbiota composition are influenced by environmental factors.8 Improved understanding about the underlying mechanisms could help to improve health outcomes, also considering that improved living conditions and urbanization can lead to shifts in microbiota composition that are associated with non\u2010communicable diseases.51, 52, 53, 54, 55 This is highlighted by the fact that maternal education showed an inverse association with microbiota diversity, suggesting that improved educational levels may have a negative impact on gut microbiota composition. However, further research is needed to determine what constitutes a healthy microbiota composition in this population and what direct or indirect interventions could be beneficial to the developing gut microbiota. Our findings suggest that public health interventions targeting water quality could have an indirect effect on microbiota as water source was associated with several microbiota outcomes.",
