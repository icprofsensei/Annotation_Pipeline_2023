Short courses of probiotics are widely used in patients with acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Helicobacter pylori infection, etc. [12]. In addition, these preparations are also used for treatment of several immune-inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis [14\u201316]. In animal models, amelioration of inflammation following administration of gut commensals is associated with a change in the composition of the gut microbiota, and in the host immune responses [17].

Further, any merged reads with Phred score of <\u200930 (assessed using NGSQC Toolkit) or with chimeric sequences (identified using Usearch61) were also purged. The remaining high-quality, non-chimeric merged reads were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the UCLUST-based, sub-sampled, open-reference OTU picking protocol of QIIME 1.9 [20]. A representative sequence for each OTU was then aligned with the SILVA core set alignment using the PyNAST tool and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the FastTree tool [21]. Taxonomy was assigned to each OTU using the QIIME\u2019s UCLUST Consensus Taxonomy Assigner against the SILVA v123 reference OTUs pre-clustered at 97% threshold, using the software\u2019s default parameters [20]. During this step, sequences that failed to align, singleton OTUs (those with only one read in all the specimens taken together), unassigned OTUs, and eukaryotic (chloroplast and mitochondrial) OTUs were removed. Further, to reduce data noise, any OTUs observed in fewer than 10% of stool specimens were purged. Specimen-wise observation counts of various OTUs were tabulated in an OTU table in the \u2018biom\u2019 format (referred to hereafter as \u2018filtered OTU table\u2019).",

Then, the cells were first surface-stained with anti-CD4-FITC and anti-CD3-APC antibodies, followed by fixation and permeabilization using cytofix/cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The permeabilized cells were then treated with anti-IFN\u03b3-PE, anti-IL-17A-PerCP-Cy5.5 or anti-IL-4-PE intracellular antibodies. The Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells were then counted as CD4+/IFN\u03b3+ cells CD4+/IL-4+ cells and CD4+/IL-17A+ cells, respectively, in the CD3 gate.",

VSL#3 is a commonly used probiotic preparation that contains eight bacterial species considered to be beneficial to humans. In some studies, its use in patients with ulcerative colitis [31], pouchitis [32] and irritable bowel syndrome [33] was found to lead to changes in gut microbiota. These changes included an increase in the abundance of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, species that are present in this preparation [32], and specific detection in stool or tissue biopsies of the bacterial species contained in this preparation [33]. In addition, in one study, there was a decline in the abundance of Bacteriodes [33], and another study showed an increase in bacterial diversity [32]. However, in our study, administration of VSL#3 did not lead to any change in either the composition, i.e. relative abundance of various taxa, or in the diversity of gut microbiota. There could be several explanations for this lack of change. First, the gut microbial community is known to be quite stable, and is rapidly restored on removal of an external influence, such as acute inflammation or antibiotic administration. It is possible that the gut microbiota in our volunteers changed on administration of VSL#3, but that this change was transient and was reversed despite its continued administration for 4 weeks, when the follow-up specimens were collected. Second, our study included healthy volunteers with normal microbiota and not patients. It is possible that probiotics can induce change in the abnormal gut microbiota of diseased persons, but not in normal microbiota of healthy persons.",

In a recent study, ingestion for 4\u00a0weeks of a probiotic that contained Lactobacillus casei led to a reduction in the frequency of IL-6-producing monocytes on ex-vivo LPS stimulation [36]. However, in some older studies, supplementation with lactobacilli in healthy adults had no effect on IL-6 production on LPS stimulation [37, 38]. Administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or of Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis to healthy adults has also been shown to reduce TNF-\u03b1 production in whole-blood cultures [37\u201339]. In in vitro co-culture experiments, VSL#3 led to an increase in the frequency of colonic and blood dendritic cells that produced IL-10 [40]. Bifidobacteria are also known to induce IL-10 production [41]. However, in contrast, we found a significant reduction in LPS-induced IL-10 production in whole-blood cultures after VSL#3 administration. This may be because of an opposing effect of Lactobacillus casei, another constituent of VSL#3, intake of which has previously been shown to reduce IL-10 production in whole-blood cultures from healthy adults [42].",

Moreover, the cytokine responses may vary depending on the probiotic preparation used [45]. With preparations such as VSL#3, which contain a mixture of organisms, the stimulatory effect of some organisms may be cancelled out by the inhibitory effect of the other constituents [38]. Thus, future studies on effect of probiotics on immune responses may need to focus on individual probiotics, rather than their mixtures. Further, it is possible that the effect of probiotics on immune responses in healthy persons differs from that in various disease states. Such a difference could explain why we failed to find a change in immune responses following VSL#3, though some previous clinical studies have shown this preparation to be useful in some inflammatory conditions.",

An imbalance in gut microbiota may lead to immune activation through an expansion of Th17 cells [48]. For instance, gut dysbiosis may provide an increased amount of TLR ligands, leading to activation of dendritic cells or monocytes to produce IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2, which may in turn mediate differentiation of Th17 cells.",

Hence, it is unlikely that this probiotic preparation can be used to induce changes in the composition of gut microbiota in healthy subjects. However, it led to a reduction in the frequency of Th17 cells and in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine from monocytes. These immune changes may be involved in its beneficial effect in immunoinflammatory disorders.",
