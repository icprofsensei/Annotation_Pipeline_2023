Previous research has revealed numerous nasal microbial signatures that correlate with SSTI development and Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Thus, we hypothesized that the ecology of the inguinal, oropharynx, and perianal regions may also be altered in response to SSTI and/or S.\u00a0aureus colonization. We collected body site samples from 46 military trainees with purulent abscess (SSTI group) as well as from 66 asymptomatic controls (non-SSTI group). We also collected abscess cavity samples to assess the microbial composition of these infections. Samples were analyzed by culture, and the microbial communities were characterized by high-throughput sequencing. We found that the nasal, inguinal, and perianal regions were similar in microbial composition and significantly differed from the oropharynx. We also observed differences in Anaerococcus and Streptococcus abundance between the SSTI and non-SSTI groups for the nasal and oropharyngeal regions, respectively. Furthermore, we detected community membership differences between the SSTI and non-SSTI groups for the nasal and inguinal sites. Compared to that of the other regions, the microbial compositions of the nares of S.\u00a0aureus carriers and noncarriers were dramatically different; we noted an inverse correlation between the presence of Corynebacterium and the presence of Staphylococcus in the nares. This correlation was also observed for the inguinal region. Culture analysis revealed elevated methicillin-resistant S.\u00a0aureus (MRSA) colonization levels for the SSTI group in the nasal and inguinal body sites. Together, these data suggest significant microbial variability in patients with SSTI as well as between S.\u00a0aureus carriers and noncarriers.",

Despite the variation in presentation, the bulk of disease manifests as purulent abscess and cellulitis. For military service members, especially trainees, SSTIs are common and may even prevent successful completion of training (1, 2). High rates of infection are believed to be due to close living conditions, high frequency of skin abrasions, and imperfect hygiene practices that foster an environment conducive to colonization, transmission, and infection with Staphylococcus aureus (3,\u20138). Indeed, S.\u00a0aureus has routinely been identified as the most common cause of cutaneous abscesses (9, 10). In the general community, S.\u00a0aureus-associated SSTIs have become a serious health concern in the United States (11,\u201313), and their treatment is costly and challenging. This is especially true with the emergence of strains of methicillin-resistant S.\u00a0aureus (MRSA) (11, 12). To combat SSTIs, previous strategies have aimed to prevent or clear S.\u00a0aureus colonization (14,\u201317). Unfortunately, the majority of these studies have mixed results, suggesting that other microbe- and host-related factors may also contribute to SSTI risk and therefore warrant further investigation. Study of the interaction of microbial communities (microbiota) with their respective human hosts has revolutionized modern medicine (18, 19). Thus, we set out to understand the associations between SSTI, S.\u00a0aureus colonization, and microbial composition in military trainees.",

Indeed, these reports have demonstrated the impact of SSTI development as well as S.\u00a0aureus colonization on nasal microbial composition (22, 23). Importantly, nasal carriers of S.\u00a0aureus, and especially MRSA, are significantly more likely to develop SSTI than noncarriers (24, 25). However, in spite of extensive research, it is still unclear why some nasal carriers of S.\u00a0aureus develop SSTI while others do not. We now appreciate that S.\u00a0aureus colonizes multiple body sites, including the oropharynx, inguinal, and perianal regions (26,\u201328). However, the contribution of S.\u00a0aureus extranasal colonization to SSTI risk has not been well characterized. Therefore, we hypothesized that, in addition to the nose, the microbiota at other body sites may differ among individuals with and without SSTI and/or between S.\u00a0aureus carriers and noncarriers. To address this hypothesis, we enrolled military trainees that either did or did not have a purulent abscess and collected colonization swabs from multiple body sites. Specimens were analyzed using culture and high-throughput sequencing. In an effort to improve current SSTI treatment and prevention measures, we sought to reveal important microbiological signatures throughout the body that may correlate with SSTI and colonization with S.\u00a0aureus.",

Seventy-six (67.9%) participants had S.\u00a0aureus (MRSA or methicillin-sensitive S.\u00a0aureus [MSSA]) cultured from at least one body site (76.1% versus 62.1% for SSTI versus non-SSTI groups, respectively). While the prevalences of MSSA and no S.\u00a0aureus (NoSA) colonization at the various body sites were comparable between groups, MRSA colonization prevalence was more variable (Table\u00a01); MRSA colonization prevalence was higher among SSTI than non-SSTI participants, particularly in the nasal (19.0% versus 13.6%) and inguinal (14.3% versus 7.7%) regions. Additionally, of the 40 abscesses for which we obtained culture results, the majority were S.\u00a0aureus positive (50.0% MRSA, 45.5% MSSA). Of these, 36 were characterized by pulsed-field type (PFT); USA300 (66.7%) was the most common PFT followed by USA200 (5.6%), USA400 (5.6%), and USA1000 (2.8%). Seven isolates (19.4%) had patterns that did not correspond to any known PFT (see Table\u00a0S1\u00a0in the supplemental material). In addition to the abscess isolates, we found that the majority of MRSA strains isolated from the other four body sites were USA300 (see Table\u00a0S1). While numerous MSSA USA300 strains were also isolated throughout the body, there were a significant number of MSSA strains that did not correspond to any known PFT (see Table\u00a0S1). Other PFTs (USA200, USA400, US500, USA600, USA700, USA800, USA1000) were less frequently isolated from the various body sites (see Table\u00a0S1).",

The microbial compositions of the nares of S.\u00a0aureus-positive and S.\u00a0aureus-negative communities were dramatically different from those of the other regions tested. Indeed, while the overall diversity levels did not significantly differ (P > 0.05) (Fig.\u00a05D), S.\u00a0aureus-positive nasal communities were found to be significantly richer in diversity than S.\u00a0aureus-negative nasal communities (P = 0.0001) (Fig.\u00a05C). Statistical AMOVA of the Jaccard (P < 0.001) and \u0398YC (P < 0.001) distance matrices revealed significant alterations in bacterial membership and abundance levels between S.\u00a0aureus-positive and S.\u00a0aureus-negative nasal communities (Table\u00a04). Furthermore, Metastats analysis revealed multiple bacterial genera that differed significantly in abundance levels between the two groups, including Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Dolosigranulum (Table\u00a03). Of note, levels of Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium were inversely correlated in the nares (coefficient of determination [r2] = 0.4547, correlation coefficient [r] = \u22120.6743, slope [m] = \u22120.6721, P < 0.0001) (Fig.\u00a06A). Furthermore, the average percent abundance of Corynebacterium in the nares of S.\u00a0aureus-negative communities was significantly greater than that of S.\u00a0aureus-positive individuals (P < 0.0001) (Fig.\u00a06B).",

Furthermore, studies of the nasal microbiota have shown that the presence of S.\u00a0aureus can dramatically impact the microbial community composition (22, 23, 32). However, no study has assessed the potential associated microbial dysbiosis at extranasal regions. Therefore, we set out to assess the impact of S.\u00a0aureus colonization and/or SSTI at multiple anatomic regions (nose, oropharynx, inguinal, perianal) among military trainees known to be at increased risk for SSTI. To our knowledge, our study was the first of its kind to utilize both culture and high-throughput sequencing techniques to evaluate the relationships among infection, colonization, and microbiome with respect to S.\u00a0aureus, a major cause of SSTI in both hospital- and community-based settings. Together, these findings highlight a dynamic interplay of microbial factors, some of which may contribute to an individual\u2019s risk of SSTI when exposed to and subsequently colonized with S.\u00a0aureus.",

In contrast, the oropharynx not only was unique in its microbial composition (Fig.\u00a01) but was significantly more diverse than any of the other regions tested (Fig.\u00a02). Despite these differences, a common feature shared among all body sites was the ability to culture S.\u00a0aureus. Thus, it is interesting to speculate about how S.\u00a0aureus behaves in these variable microbial communities. In particular, how can the interaction of S.\u00a0aureus with different bacterial cohabitants ultimately influence the overall abundance levels of S.\u00a0aureus? Moreover, could the expression profile of S.\u00a0aureus at the various body sites make it more or less \u201cprimed\u201d to cause infection? These and other SSTI microbiome-related questions are under investigation in our laboratory.",

Additionally, we observed a difference in phylotype membership between the SSTI and non-SSTI nasal communities (Table\u00a04). While it is difficult to speculate on the role of these differences with respect to risk of SSTI, we do note that these findings corroborate our previous nasal microbiota study conducted among military trainees (22).

It has been demonstrated that various species of Corynebacterium can either inhibit or promote the growth of S.\u00a0aureus (32). Indeed, previous studies have observed an inverse correlation between the levels of S.\u00a0aureus and Corynebacterium in the anterior nares (22, 32, 35, 36). This inverse correlation was even stronger with respect to the entire Staphylococcus genus. Here, we also observed an inverse correlation between Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium (Fig.\u00a06A). Furthermore, there was significantly more Corynebacterium bacteria in the nares of S.\u00a0aureus noncarriers than in those of carriers (Fig.\u00a06B). This apparent competition between S.\u00a0aureus and Corynebacterium has been well documented and is likely of clinical significance given that nasal colonization with S.\u00a0aureus often precedes SSTI formation (29,\u201331).",

We observed a similar inverse correlation between these two genera in the inguinal region (Fig.\u00a06C). However, there were comparable levels of Corynebacterium in the S.\u00a0aureus-positive and S.\u00a0aureus-negative groups on the basis of inguinal S.\u00a0aureus colonization results (Fig.\u00a06D). Thus, the influence of Corynebacterium on Staphylococcus abundance in the inguinal body site may extend beyond just S.\u00a0aureus. Indeed, there is evidence that Staphylococcus epidermidis abundance levels are also inversely correlated with Corynebacterium abundance (22). It is possible that Corynebacterium may serve as a semiuniversal \u201cgood guy\u201d protecting against possible pathogens within the human microbiome. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this apparent bacterial antagonism in the nasal and inguinal body sites remains unclear. Elucidation of these mechanisms is critical for better understanding of the complex dynamics between SSTI formation, S.\u00a0aureus colonization, and the human microbiome. Moreover, these mechanisms may yield insight for the development of novel therapeutics.",

Surprisingly, this effect was not observed at any of the other regions tested (oropharynx, inguinal, or perianal). Although there are undoubtedly numerous factors that may contribute to this nose-specific phenomenon, one obvious environmental difference that distinguishes the nose from the other tested body sites is temperature. While the inguinal, oropharynx, and perianal body sites reside at or around body temperature (37\u00b0C), the anterior nares are exposed to substantially lower temperatures (23 to 25\u00b0C) (37). Perhaps, upon exposure to lower temperatures, S.\u00a0aureus activates and/or represses a distinct repertoire of genes that encode secreted factors and/or surface-exposed proteins that directly affect abundance levels of neighboring bacteria in the nasal cavity. Indeed, there have been numerous studies that indicated the presence of temperature-influenced regulons in S.\u00a0aureus, including those associated with biofilm formation and toxin production (38, 39). Thus, the factors that govern the impact of S.\u00a0aureus on nasal microbiota composition warrant further investigation.",

With respect to the nose, we found that while the numbers of S.\u00a0aureus (MRSA or MSSA)-colonized participants in the SSTI and non-SSTI groups were comparable (~60% for each group), the percentage of MRSA-colonized participants was higher in the SSTI group than in the non-SSTI group (Table\u00a01). This finding is in agreement with previous studies that found a correlation between MRSA nasal colonization and SSTI development (25, 29, 40). Despite the clinical significance of nasal colonization, it is now evident that nonnasal (oropharynx, inguinal, and perianal) colonization with S.\u00a0aureus is more common than previously recognized. Indeed, our data suggest that when S.\u00a0aureus is isolated from any one body site, there is a high likelihood that it can also be isolated elsewhere on the body (see Fig.\u00a0S1 and S2\u00a0in the supplemental material). Thus, there is significant interest in understanding if S.\u00a0aureus colonization throughout the body is linked to overall SSTI risk. Interestingly, we found that, in addition to the colonization of the nose, inguinal colonization with MRSA was substantially more common in the SSTI group than in the non-SSTI group (Table\u00a01). Furthermore, there was a significant likelihood that when MRSA or MSSA was isolated from the abscess, MRSA or MSSA would also be isolated from the inguinal body site (see Fig.\u00a0S1 and S2). This paradigm-shifting observation suggests a potential link between the inguinal region and risk of SSTI. Of note, given the all-male study population, whether this link would also apply to females remains unknown. Additionally, considering the four regions together, it is possible that S.\u00a0aureus colonization at body sites in frequent contact with the hands or other items that facilitate spread (i.e., towels) increases the likelihood of self-inoculation and subsequent SSTI. Although this is speculative, future studies aimed at SSTI prevention should be cognizant of S.\u00a0aureus colonization in not only the anterior nares but the inguinal region as well.",

On the basis of our current and previous (22) abscess microbiota results, we estimate that approximately 1 in every 3 purulent abscesses at Fort Benning is polymicrobial in nature. While the clinical significance of polymicrobial infections has been briefly reported (41, 42), there are likely countless variables that are impacted, including SSTI resolution time, responsiveness to antibiotics, treatment options, likelihood of severe complications (i.e., deep-tissue infection), and S.\u00a0aureus gene expression/virulence.

                    "text": "There were limitations to our study. As with our previous nasal microbiota investigation, the current analysis represents only a snapshot of the microbiota at the various body sites. Thus, it is impossible to distinguish between S.\u00a0aureus carriers, noncarriers, and intermittent carriers. Indeed, these various designations have been shown to carry unique microbial signatures, especially in the anterior nares (32). Thus, a multi-body-site longitudinal study that characterizes microbial communities over time is needed. Additionally, while our study investigated numerous body sites, we acknowledge that other regions of the human body (e.g., axilla) may harbor clues regarding SSTI formation. Also, our study population was composed entirely of young, healthy, male military trainees in good physical condition and therefore may not reflect the relationship between colonization and SSTIs in the general community. We also must acknowledge a potential drawback of the statistical approach regarding the multi-body-site colonization data (see Fig.\u00a0S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). Use of multiple 2-by-2 chi-square tests without adjustment may inflate the type 1 error rate, resulting in some false-positive results. However, the 2-by-2 chi-square test seems most appropriate, since an overall chi-square test is not feasible given its reliance on independent observations. Overall, we note that the numbers and patterns of significant results are sufficient to suggest that the general findings of the 2-by-2 chi-square tests are true even if some of the individual significant results may represent type 1 errors. Finally, we note limitations with our sequencing platform (MiSeq) and strategy (phylotype-based) analyses. Because the forward and reverse MiSeq reads did not completely overlap, an operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-based approach was computationally impossible (43). This phylotype strategy also limited our taxonomic resolution; we were unable to reach species-level classification of the reads. Despite these limitations, our genus-level results were largely in agreement with previous body site microbiota analyses, including our own (22, 44, 45).",

Participants underwent swab sampling (BD BBL CultureSwabs [BD Diagnostic, Sparks, MD]) at the following sites: the anterior nares, oropharynx, inguinal, and perianal regions. Participants could decline sampling of any site. Two swabs were collected from each body site, one for microbiological analysis and the other for microbiome characterization. No participants had received antimicrobials prior to sampling, with two exceptions: study identification (ID) numbers 1098 and 1411. Participant 1098 had received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 2\u00a0days prior to sampling, and participant 1411 had received doxycycline 1\u00a0day prior to sampling. Microbiome analysis of these 2 participants showed no obvious abnormalities compared to the other patients (data not shown). Exclusion criteria included the following: suspected or documented bacteremia, suspected or documented sepsis, neutropenia, chronic cellulitis, vascular insufficiency, deep soft tissue infection, surgical site infection, diabetic foot ulcers, animal or human bite wound, and infection involving the genitals.",

Prior to incision of the abscess, the infection site was cleaned with 4% chlorhexidine and isopropyl alcohol. Abscess swab samples were collected from within the abscess cavity. The samples from the anterior nares were collected as previously described (22). Briefly, a swab was introduced 1\u00a0cm deep into a nostril and rubbed a minimum of three times in a circular manner along the nasal septum and the superior, lateral, and inferior surfaces of the nostril. The same swab was then used to sample the other nostril. A second nasal swab was then obtained following the same procedure. For the oropharynx samples, while avoiding the tongue, a swab was inserted into the mouth and rubbed gently across the tonsillar area using a combination of twirling and circular motions. The swab was rotated at least three times to ensure that the entire swab surface contacted the tonsillar mucosa. Inguinal swab samples were self-collected. Briefly, participants were instructed to hold the swab by the cap and gently rub in a twirling, circular motion, along the inguinal crease from the proximal to distal end. They were also instructed to ensure that at least three rotations of the swab were performed on each side of the groin. Perianal samples were also self-collected. Participants were instructed to handle the sterile swab by the cap and to rub it gently, with at least three rotations, across the surface of the anus, ensuring that that the entire swab head had come in contact with the anus.",

The reverse PCR primer contained a 12-nucleotide error-correcting Golay bar code to facilitate multiplexing of samples (47). All PCRs were carried out in a final volume of 20\u00a0\u00b5l using high-fidelity Accuprime Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture consisted of 1\u00d7 Accuprime PCR buffer II, a 0.2\u00a0\u00b5M concentration of each primer, 15\u00a0\u00b5l of genomic DNA, and 0.15\u00a0\u00b5l of Accuprime polymerase (22). PCR amplification was performed in triplicate for each sample. PCR cycling conditions were in accordance with the method of Caporaso et al., with slight modification (47). Briefly, DNA was denatured at 94\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min, followed by 35 amplification cycles (94\u00b0C for 45\u00a0s, 53\u00b0C for 60\u00a0s, and 72\u00b0C for 90\u00a0s) and a final extension cycle of 10\u00a0min at 72\u00b0C. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel, pooled, and cleaned using a MinElute Reaction cleanup kit (Qiagen), per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Purified PCR amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 8000; Thermo Scientific). Equimolar ratios of amplicons from each sample were then combined into a single sample. This combined sample was sent to the Tufts University Genomics Core Facility for paired-end 300-bp sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq platform. In total, 4 separate MiSeq runs using either 114 or 115 samples per run were performed. To obviate any sequencing bias, samples from each of the body sites (nasal, oropharynx, inguinal, and perianal) were included in each MiSeq run. Similarly, abscess samples were interspersed among 3 of the 4 MiSeq runs.",

Contigs were discarded if they contained any ambiguous calls, were greater than 500\u00a0bp in length, or contained a homopolymer greater than 8\u00a0bp in length. Filtered sequences were aligned to the SILVA rRNA database (49). Sequences within 4\u00a0bp of each other were then merged. At this point, data from the 4 individual sequencing runs were combined and analyzed as a single data set. PCR chimeras were detected and removed from the study via mothur\u2019s implementation of UCHIME (50). Sequences were assigned taxonomy information using the Bayesian classifier provided by the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) and an 80% bootstrap cutoff value of over 100 iterations (51). DNA reads classified as chloroplast, mitochondria, archaea, Eukaryota, or \u201cunknown\u201d at the kingdom level were discarded. Taxonomy information was then used to bin sequences into phylotypes at the genus level. Lastly, to ensure comparability between samples for diversity analyses, 5,714 reads were randomly subsampled from each sample.",

Briefly, individual sample diversity (alpha diversity) values, as well as diversity comparisons between samples (beta diversity), were calculated using mothur. The inverse Simpson (invsimpson) index was used for alpha diversity analyses, while the Jaccard and \u0398YC beta diversity calculators were implemented to assess similarities in phylotype membership and abundance (52, 53). Differences in microbial composition between groups (for example, SSTI versus non-SSTI) were computed using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of the Jaccard and \u0398YC distance matrices and visualized in two dimensions using principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA). Differences in invsimpson values between groups were identified using analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed on log-transformed data followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Statistical testing for percent abundance data was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Phylotype abundance differences between groups were identified using mothur\u2019s implementation of Metastats (54). Phylotypes that differed in abundance had to meet two criteria to be considered significant: a Metastats P\u00a0value of less than 0.05, and a mean abundance of greater than 1% in at least one group. We utilized the 2-by-2 chi-square test to assess the likelihood of multi-body-site colonization with S.\u00a0aureus. Comparisons with small sample sizes were corrected for by the use of the Fisher exact test. Finally, linear regression analyses were used to determine if the relationship between two variables resulted in a regression line that was significantly nonzero. Additionally, correlation coefficients were computed for all linear regression data. All statistical analyses were calculated using GraphPad Prism, with the exception of the mothur-generated AMOVA values.",
