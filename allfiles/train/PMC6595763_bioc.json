Moreover, it indicated that the IBS symptom features were associated with the dysbiosis of whole gut microbiome, instead of one or several certain genera even they were dominating. Two genera, Bacteroides and Lachnospiracea incertae sedis, were identified as the core genera, meanwhile, the non-core genera contribute to a larger pan-microbiome of the gut microbiome. Furthermore, the dysbiosis in patients with IBS-D was associated with a reduction of network complexity of the interacted microbial community (HC vs. IBS-D: 639 vs. 154). The disordered metabolic functions of patients with IBS-D were identified as the potential influence of gut microbiome on the host (significant difference with q\u200a<\u200a0.01 between HC and IBS-D).",

Furthermore, it is nontrivial that the variation tendencies of the two phyla in patients with IBS were found contrary to ones from the European countries such as Finland and Sweden.[16\u201319] It was reported that gut microbiota was possibly influenced by gastrointestinal disease, diet, inheritance, or other potential factors that varied with racial populations,[1,7,20] which partially explained the different direction of dysbiosis, and as well contributes to our understanding of dysbiosis to some extent. However, the existing researches of dysbiosis based on the metagenomic data were still not able to clarify how the host and gut microbiota act on each other or interact mutually. On the other hand, since Chinese population has made up nearly 20% of the world's populations, the further study of dysbiosis of Chinese patients with IBS is of urgent demand to approach the unknown associations between the host and gut microbiota in the pathogenic mechanism of IBS.",

With higher than 80.0% eigenvalues represented in PCA and optimal division by PAM, the PCA plots revealed strong clustering of HC or IBS-D. Herein, Cluster I and II contained mainly IBS-D individuals while Cluster III embraced almost all HC individuals except one in Cluster II.

Seven features of IBS symptom severity, abdominal pain, onset frequency of pain, bloating, satisfaction to bowel habit, interference to quality of life, maximum bowel movement, and IBS-SSS in Figure \u200bFigure6,6, were found correlated with Bacteroides and Prevotella to be weak with no statistical significance, where the Pearson correlation magnitude r\u200a<\u200a0.13 and q\u200a>\u200a0.50. IBS-SSS is the global assessment of symptom severity according to the Rome III criteria, which deserves more attention. It was worthwhile to note that all the 204 genera were negatively correlated with IBS-SSS, where only Coprococcus (r\u200a=\u200a\u20130.43, q\u200a=\u200a0.0121) and Sutterella (r\u200a=\u200a\u20130.39, q\u200a=\u200a0.00704) presented statistical significance among the top 30 genera. Interestingly, the features of visceral sensitivity threshold, such as perception, first sense to defecate, urgency, and maximum tolerance also turned out weak correlation with Bacteroides and Prevotella.",

In fact, Prevotella revealed beneficial ability for human such as degradation of fiber and plant-derived compounds,[36] and the essential genes for biosynthesizing vitamin B1 were found enriched in the Prevotella-dominating enterotype.[37] As to the minor genera, for instance, Faecalibacterium which ranks the third by average abundance among the 60 individuals (7.2%), the main species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in Faecalibacterium was deemed to take an important part in balancing immunity in the intestine, and could be potentially applied as a probiotic.[38] In several investigations with respect to gut diseases such as IBS, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, F. prausnitzii was confirmed to decrease in the gut microbiota of patients and regarded as a sensor for health.[38,39] The fact thus implied that we should concentrate on the different structure of the whole gut microbial community between HC and IBS-D, as described in the following subsection.",

Moreover, we plotted the genus networks, to show the different co-abundance and co-exclusion correlations between each two genera, in two groups HC and IBS-D, respectively (Spearman correlation magnitude \u22650.4 and q\u200a<\u200a0.05) [Figure \u200b[Figure8].8]. For magnifying visualization, more detailed networks of top 30 genera are in Figure \u200bFigure9.9. As shown in Figure \u200bFigure8,8, there were 187 connections among genera in HC while only 51 ones in IBS-D, meanwhile most of which were between the genera belonging to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, implying that the two major phyla were evidently more interacted than any other in the microbial community for both HC and IBS-D.",

Since sugar is one of the essential substances to maintain the vital movement, the sugar transport system is playing an important role in the healthy gut microenvironment. Dysbiosis might lead to reduction of the related proteins, and meanwhile, the functions of six subunits of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) were found enriched in IBS-D (q\u200a<\u200a0.01) [Figure \u200b[Figure10C10C and Table \u200bTable2].2]. Herein, NADH is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and is the coenzyme in the reaction of glycolysis, during which CO2 may generate as the final product. Hence, we can indicate from the enrichment of the subunits that increased gas production existing in the bowel of patients with IBS-D may potentially lead to recurrent bloating as the symptom.",

We identified three types of gut microbiome that were Prevotella dominating, Bacteroides dominating, and relatively balanced, and showed that the individual with relatively balanced gut microbiota is healthy-like. Interestingly, two genera, Lachnospiracea incertae sedis and Ruminococcus, were not relatively abundant in the Chinese individuals in the current study, but were found potentially dominating among American individuals suffering with IBS-D[22] as a consequence of different types of gut microbiome composition among populations around the world much more likely due to diet or drug intake.[7,36,37] Besides, Bacteroides and Lachnospiracea incertae sedis were identified as core genera among the total 204 genera in the 60 individuals. This finding was not consistent with several studies of European countries such as Finland and Sweden,[14,16\u201319] as a possible result of gastrointestinal disease, diet, inheritance, or other potential factors that vary with racial populations.[1,7,20]",

Unfortunately, since the ability of existing studies to contribute to the investigation of gut pan-microbiome of IBS-D population is quite limited, our current study can only give rise to a brief discussion of the gut pan-microbiome herein. However, through the comparative analysis of taxonomic composition at both phylum and genus level, it is still clear that the abundant phylotypes are even more enriched in the gut microenvironment with dysbiosis, which may disturb the interacted relationship of the community and occupy the living space of the phylotypes with low abundance, and thus become a potential factor of the disease.",

The more co-abundance correlations (than co-exclusion ones) in the networks of both HC and IBS-D indicate stronger symbiosis in the community. It is widely known that human intestine is colonized with an intricate community of indigenous microorganisms such that a symbiotic host-bacterial relationship exists in our intestine,[51] where the microbiota with its internal interactions are shaping a reticular system to maintain the organism. Accordingly, the strong symbiosis in microbial community, or namely, a symbiotic bacterial group, is more likely to be mutualistic with the host, and thus networking with the immune system to mediate anti-inflammatory responses necessary for mammalian health.[52] Whereas dysbiosis may weaken the symbiotic network and alter the normal function of immune system, thus become a major factor for disorders such as IBS-D.",

As one might know, fucose is component of mucin in the gut epithelial barrier; hence, the enrichment of fucose permease in IBS-D may alter the normal function of the barrier, which is reported to be associated with bacterial conglutination and invasion against host cells.[53,54] It also implied that with the barrier thinner, the increased fucose synthase of gut microbiota in IBS-D provides a protection to the host. While in the case of HC, mutarotase, and isomerase of fucose may keep the normal function of the barrier. Moreover, we found the enriched functions of proteins for sugar transport system of great importance in the healthy gut microenvironment, as well as another signature NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase enriched in IBS-D indicating the increased gas production potentially leading to the recurrent bloating as IBS symptom. The results revealed the alteration of host functional mechanism possibly caused by the dysbiosis of gut microbiota.",

We presented the consistent feature of dysbiosis by lower complexity level of gut microbial community, and identified the disordered metabolic functions of saccharides in the gut microbiota of patients with IBS-D, which indicated the potential influence of gut microbiota on the symptoms of patients with IBS-D. Moreover, we identified Bacteroides and Lachnospiracea incertae sedis as core genera of the Chinese individuals as a result of potential factors that vary with racial populations. Our current study provided more pathological evidences for IBS-D with the further understanding of dysbiosis, which broadened our horizon on the intricate pathogenic associations between gut microbiota and host. Nevertheless, analyses based on 16S rRNA sequences are limited, and in future studies we will aim at the more detailed distinction of potential metabolic functions of IBS-D gut microbiota to seek diagnostic biomarkers for new treatment strategies.",
