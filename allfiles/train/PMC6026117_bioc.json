Recently, it has been proposed that dental calculus may provide a more robust environment for DNA preservation than other skeletal remains, but this has not been systematically tested. In this study, shotgun-sequenced data from paired dental calculus and dentin samples from 48 globally distributed individuals are compared using a metagenomic approach. Overall, we find DNA from dental calculus is consistently more abundant and less contaminated than DNA from dentin. The majority of DNA in dental calculus is microbial and originates from the oral microbiome; however, a small but consistent proportion of DNA (mean 0.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08%, range 0.007\u20130.47%) derives from the host genome. Host DNA content within dentin is variable (mean 13.70\u2009\u00b1\u200918.62%, range 0.003\u201370.14%), and for a subset of dentin samples (15.21%), oral bacteria contribute\u2009>\u200920% of total DNA. Human DNA in dental calculus is highly fragmented, and is consistently shorter than both microbial DNA in dental calculus and human DNA in paired dentin samples. Finally, we find that microbial DNA fragmentation patterns are associated with guanine-cytosine (GC) content, but not aspects of cellular structure.",

Unlike body mucosal surfaces that have continual cell turnover, teeth do not remodel. Consequently, they are relatively stable environments for bacterial colonization during biofilm development4, making the formation of dental calculus difficult to prevent without mechanical removal. As a result, dental calculus is prevalent in the archaeological record, and due to its excellent morphological preservation, it has long been an attractive target for microscopic analysis5\u201311. More recently, dental calculus has been explored as a source of ancient DNA (aDNA) and has been shown to retain an excellent record of the human oral microbiome12\u201315. It may provide insights on ancient diet through isotopic analysis16, and it\u00a0serves as an alternative source of endogenous host DNA17.",

These degradative processes include oxidative and hydrolytic damage to individual bases, hydrolytic lesions on the sugar-phosphate backbone, DNA fragmentation due to nuclease activity, and general degradation by microorganisms involved in the decomposition process18,19. As a result, there is a reduction in the amount of recoverable DNA, and aDNA that is retrieved is characterized by predictable forms of damage, including extreme fragmentation, depurination, and high-levels of terminal cytosine deamination19\u201321. In addition to damage, ancient samples can acquire exogenous contamination that may obscure any remaining endogenous signal. Susceptibility to contamination and molecular degradation appears to be tissue specific, with petrous bone and tooth cementum generally exhibiting the highest proportions of endogenous human DNA among archaeological skeletal and soft tissues22\u201325. Recent studies have suggested that dental calculus may be more resistant to environmental contamination than other sources of aDNA, and higher overall DNA yields have been reported from dental calculus than from any other archaeological source14,17. While these attributes of dental calculus are compelling, they have been reported from a small number of samples that have been\u00a0insufficiently explored for additional variables such as temporal age, depositional context, or geographic location14,17,26. Therefore, the prospect of ancient dental calculus as a dependable source of well-preserved, endogenous aDNA (both host and oral microbiome derived) has yet to be rigorously and systematically tested.",

Individuals included in this study represent seven archaeological sites spanning diverse geographic, environmental, and temporal ranges. Thirty-six paired samples were selected from a single medieval cemetery in Kilteasheen, Ireland (here referred to as the regional sample set) in order to examine intra-site variation in preservation. Additionally, 12 paired samples from six different archaeological sites on three continents spanning a broad temporal range were selected to control for environment, burial context, time period, and individual dynamics that may impact preservation quality (here referred to as the global sample set) (Fig.\u00a01; Supplementary Table\u00a0S1). We compare DNA preservation within archaeological dental calculus and dentin from the same tooth, with a specific focus on four main measures: (1) DNA abundance, (2) microbial community composition and contamination, (3) human DNA content, and (4) DNA fragmentation and damage patterns. Our findings confirm that calculus yields more total DNA when compared to dentin, with a low, albeit consistent, proportion of endogenous human DNA. Microbial profiles of dental calculus suggest that it retains a robust signal of the human oral microbiome and is relatively resistant to exogenous contamination, while dentin is typically dominated by environmental microbial sources. A subset of dentin, however, contains DNA from oral bacteria (possibly deriving from postmortem colonization during decomposition processes), indicating that dentin may serve as an alternative source for DNA from individual oral microbes in some cases. With respect to DNA degradation, we find that DNA fragmentation patterns within dental calculus are associated with the genomic source of the DNA (human vs. microbial) but not with cellular structure (e.g., microbial cell wall type or presence of a surface-layer). Additionally, human DNA is consistently shorter in dental calculus than in paired dentin samples, which may reflect differences in the manner by which human DNA is incorporated into each matrix. Finally, we observe a systematic loss of short AT-rich DNA fragments that is particularly marked in bacteria with low to medium GC content genomes.",

This fit accounts for 34% of the total variance using a linear regression model (Fig.\u00a02b).

To explore these differences, shotgun-sequenced reads from the 48 dentin and dental calculus pairs were taxonomically binned for microbial identification using MALT28, and the resulting assignments were visualized using MEGAN29 (Supplementary Tables\u00a0S2 and S3). A species-level PCoA plot based on a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix demonstrates that dental calculus samples form a relatively tight and cohesive group that is distinct from the more diffuse distribution of microbial communities identified within dentin (Fig.\u00a03a). Alpha diversity is significantly higher for dentin samples as compared to dental calculus (Mann-Whitney-U, p\u2009=\u20098.55E-15), consistent with a signal of external contamination (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S1). Differences in microbial community structure and composition between dentin, calculus, and blanks was further explored using linear discriminant analysis30. Dentin and blank samples are primarily discriminated by taxa that are environmentally abundant, while calculus samples are discriminated by typically oral taxa (see Supplementary Methods; Supplementary Table\u00a0S4). Importantly, microbial communities from each material (dental calculus or dentin) are less similar to their paired sample than they are to samples of the same material. This pattern is consistent with expectations that the microbial taxa within dental calculus represent a relatively well preserved biological community derived from dental plaque, while dentin \u2013 being sterile in life \u2013 is expected to harbor a microbial community primarily composed of exogenous contaminant bacteria acquired through stochastic postmortem processes.",

The highest predicted contributions of skin and soil to dental calculus samples are 7.9% and 14.0%, respectively, while the same predicted contributions for dentin are 33.5% and 89.0%, respectively. Together, these analyses suggest dental calculus is relatively robust to environmental contamination when compared to dentin.",

This contrasts with contaminant human DNA observed in the extraction and library blanks, which showed no evidence of DNA damage, and thus is consistent with modern human contamination (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S5; Supplementary Table\u00a0S10). Because the human DNA sequences present in the blanks lack damage, they are therefore unlikely to be the source of the damaged human reads in the dentin and calculus samples. Taken together, these analyses suggest that although a small subset of reads may be erroneously assigned to the human genome, most reads are likely correctly assigned, and these reads appear to be authentic ancient human DNA and not contamination.",

Overall, the median fragment lengths of total DNA recovered from both dental calculus (56\u201388\u2009bp, mean 72.8\u2009bp) and dentin (53\u2013105\u2009bp, mean 66.0\u2009bp) are short and fall within a size range expected for archaeological samples (Supplementary Table\u00a0S1). For each dental calculus sample, the median fragment length of human reads was found to be 15.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2\u2009bp shorter than the overall median fragment length of DNA in each sample, which is primarily microbial in origin (Fig.\u00a04b). Dentin samples, however, show no pattern with respect to human DNA fragment length compared to overall DNA fragment length. Because some dentin samples have a high endogenous human content, a separate analysis comparing the fragment length profile of human mapped reads and all non-human reads was performed (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S6). In calculus, there is a greater average magnitude of difference between the mean fragment length of human and non-human reads (calculus: 0.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15; dentin: 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17, Cohen\u2019s d), and the median length of non-human reads is consistently longer than that of human reads. Conversely, the magnitude of difference between human and non-human fragment length profiles in dentin is variable and inconsistent (Supplementary Table\u00a0S11). This analysis confirms that the observed differences in fragment length profiles between dentin and dental calculus is not the result of high human endogenous content of particular samples. Comparing human DNA in dental calculus and dentine, we find that human DNA within dental calculus is generally more fragmented than human DNA in paired dentin samples, with the median length of calculus-derived fragments being approximately 10.3\u2009bp\u2009\u00b1\u200912.0 shorter than that of dentin-derived fragments (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p\u2009=\u20090.01178); however, this pattern is largely driven by the relatively long human DNA fragment lengths in dentin, and further work is needed to determine if this is an artifact of sample preparation or a true biological pattern.",

Genera were chosen to maximize the range of GC content with two genera each representing low, medium, and high-expected genomic GC content (Fig.\u00a06). Among all published genomes available in the NCBI genome database33, members of the genus Methanobrevibacter range in genomic GC content from 24.2% in M. wolinii to 32.6% in M. ruminantium. The common oral methanogen M. oralis is expected to have a GC content of 27.9%. Members of Fusobacterium also have low GC content, ranging from 26.0% (F. perfoetens) to 35.1% (F. necrophorum). Among the medium GC content genera, the GC content of Tannerella ranges from 37.7% (T. sp. CAG:118) to 56.5% (T. sp. oral taxon HOT-286), and Porphyromonas range from 42.7% (P. gingivicanis) to 56.3% (P. bennonis). Finally, for high GC content genera, Actinomyces ranges from 49.6% (A. coleocanis) to 73.1% (A. dentalis), and Streptomyces ranges from 56.4% (S. sp. WAC00263) to 71.1% (S. sp. NBRC110027). In comparing reads assigned to these genera in our samples, we detect an increase in GC content at shorter read lengths among all chosen genera except for Streptomyces, where no shift was observed. Importantly, this shift is greater for genera with moderate and low expected GC content. For example, in Methanobrevibacter and Fusobacterium the length at which the mean GC content begins to substantially shift (\u22651 z score) is 39\u2009bp and 48\u2009bp, respectively (Supplementary Figure\u00a0S8). This shift occurs at longer lengths for Tannerella and Porphyromonas at 59\u2009bp and 58\u2009bp, respectively, while Actinomyces does not present a substantial shift until 35\u2009bp. No shift is observed in Streptomyces, although this may occur in short fragments that are below the length-filtering threshold (30\u2009bp) used for this dataset.",

Approximately 70% of the dry weight of plaque consists of microbial cells44, and a large proportion of the biofilm matrix itself is composed of extracellular bacterial DNA, which provides both structural support and protection to its microbial inhabitants45. Furthermore, the mineralization process that leads to dental calculus formation involves rapid inter- and intracellular crystal formation by calcium phosphates, including hydroxyapatite, which strongly bind DNA. The result is a dense crystalline structure that is relatively inert and resistant to microbial attack, enzymatic action, and non-acidic chemical alteration46. Although the surface of dental calculus remains porous47, penetration of substances towards the internal layers of the calculus matrix is restricted48, which may account for its high DNA preservation qualities. Calculus is not an entirely closed system, however. It has been shown to disproportionately lose soluble small metabolites over time49, suggesting that the mineralized matrix allows some degree of water movement.",

Most cells within teeth are instead found within the dental pulp and consist of perivascular cells, blood cells, and pulpal blood vessels44,52, all of which decompose readily after death through a combination of necrosis and microbial invasion3. Thus, while the majority of cells within dental calculus are found within a mineralized structure conducive to preservation, the majority of cells within teeth are not, which may partially explain the large differences in total DNA yield between the two substrates.

By contrast, the relative proportion of human DNA is uniformly low and relatively consistent in dental calculus. When dentin is strongly degraded and the relative proportion of host DNA in dentin is very low (<0.1%), the absolute amount of human DNA within dental calculus can exceed that of dentin. In such cases, the genetic richness of dental calculus appears to compensate for its low relative proportion of human DNA.

Neutrophils, the most abundant nucleated cell type in human blood, are an essential cell type of the innate immune system that are recruited during active microbial infection55.

While neutrophils and other immune cells are capable of phagocytizing individual or small aggregates of microbial cells, large pathogens or those that can thwart phagocytosis by forming biofilms stimulate the formation of neutrophilic extracelluar traps (NETs)57,58. NETs are composed of decondensed chromatin that is released from the nuclear membrane and mixed with disarticulated histones and granules containing antimicrobial proteins before being ejected from the cell55,58\u201360. The expelled chromatin traps the offending microbes while simultaneously promoting destruction of the entrapped cells55. Interestingly, along with the granular proteins, disarticulated histones and short fragments of DNA (<100\u2009bp) are also potent antimicrobials, likely increasing the antibiotic effect of NETs59,61.",

Moreover, certain bacteria subvert NETosis by producing extracellular nucleases (DNases) which are either bound to the cell membrane or secreted from the cell63. These nucleases free trapped bacteria by degrading the DNA backbone of the excreted NETs55. This activity is particularly prevalent during periodontal disease, and a wide range of oral bacteria including P. gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Parvimonas micra are able to produce extracellular nucleases45.",

However, a subsequent investigation of four dental calculus samples failed to find such a correlation26. In this study, we test this hypothesis in 48 dental calculus samples and find no relationship between attributes such as cell wall peptidoglycan structure or the presence of an S-layer and DNA fragmentation or terminal cytosine damage patterns. This analysis does not preclude other aspects of cellular structure (e.g., spore formation or the presence of mycolic acids) that may impact aDNA preservation and were not tested in this study. Our analysis of reads assigned to specific bacteria suggests that fragmentation and damage patterns may be taxonomically structured. However, the consistency and biological basis of these patterns is beyond the scope of the data presented here.",

Short DNA fragments lack thermostability and are easily lost through denaturation. The melting temperature of short DNA fragments is primarily dependent on DNA sequence and length, in addition to environmental conditions and other factors65, and in general sequences with longer lengths and higher GC content have higher melting temperatures. Short DNA fragments from taxa with lower GC content genomes are expected to be more susceptible to loss through denaturation because their melting point for a given fragment length will be lower, and this may contribute to taxonomic skew. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that high GC-content genera had slightly shorter median fragment lengths overall (Fig.\u00a05b), which accords with a higher retention of short DNA fragments.",

If the loss of short AT-rich fragments is primarily taphonomic and not methodological in nature, greater taxonomic skew may be expected in libraries generated using a single-stranded library preparation, which is known to retain a higher proportion of shorter DNA fragments than the double-stranded DNA library preparation method used in this study67.

Our results confirm that dental calculus is a rich source of well-preserved oral microbiome DNA and a consistent source of highly fragmented and low abundance human DNA. We find that cell wall structure has no significant association with microbial DNA preservation, but that all samples exhibit systematic loss of short AT-rich DNA fragments, a trend that disproportionately affects taxa with low and moderate GC content genomes. Finally, we show that approximately one third of teeth retain DNA from the oral microbiome and thus dentin may serve as an alternative source of oral bacterial DNA in the absence of preserved dental calculus deposits. Our findings demonstrate that dental calculus provides a favorable environment for long-term DNA preservation.",

Processed reads were then taxonomically binned using MALT version 03828 and the full NCBI nucleotide database (\u2018nt\u2019, April 2016) with an 85% identity threshold, a minSupportPercent threshold of 0.01, and a topPercent value of 1.0 (Supplementary Tables\u00a0S2, S3, S14). Metagenomic profiles were analyzed with MEGAN6 CE29 and screened for specific taxonomic levels for fragment length and damage pattern profiles using a RMA file format parsing script79. Length and damage patterns were visualized using the ggplot280 and lattice81 libraries in R. For all fragment length and damage rate analyses only those samples that were paired end sequenced were used. Additionally, only merged reads were considered to prevent artifacts brought on by unmerged pairs, the maximum length of which is fixed. Mapping to the human genome (hg19) was performed using BWA (\u2212n 0.01, \u2212l 1000, \u2212q 30)82 as implemented in EAGER v1.9278. A normalized taxon table with species-level assigned reads (Supplementary Table\u00a0S2) was exported from the bacterial and archaeal sub-trees in MEGAN and used to generate a Bray-Curtis taxonomic distance matrix in R using the vegan library (version 2.4\u20131)83. Principal coordinates were generated using the R ape library84 and visualized as a PCoA plot using ggplot280. The same taxon table was used to produce microbial profiles of each sample according to isolation source within a nested classification scheme85. This scheme illustrates the relative environmental and human microbial contributions to each sample based on a species-by-species literature survey based on species name searches in PubMed. Pathobionts and opportunistic pathogens are designated as such when literature on the organism consistently presented it as a health threat, though it also may be a natural inhabitant of the human microbiome or soil. Assigned read counts for the classified species were tabulated and visualized using the Krona Excel Template31. Potential source contribution to samples was also calculated from summarized read quantities of the bacterial and archaeal sub-trees (Supplementary Table\u00a0S3) using SourceTracker version 0.9.834. Source accession numbers: ERR1017187, ERR1019366, ERR1022687, ERR1022692, ERR1034454, ERR1035437, ERR1035438, ERR1035441, ERR1039457, ERR1039458, ERR1043165, ERR1044071, ERR1044072, ERR1051325, SRR1631060, SRR1631061, SRR1631063, SRR1631064, SRR1633008, SRR3184100, SRR3184876, SRR3189411, SRR3189416, SRR3189418, SRS014107, SRS015650, SRS018665, SRS018975, SRS019029, SRS019129, SRS019387, SRS023538, SRS063215, SRS077312. The microbial classification scheme with Krona plots and SourceTracker were used in conjunction to control for potential biases related to the modern samples used in the latter and together present a layered representation of the types of microorganisms typically found in ancient dental calculus and dentin. Finally, GC content versus length profiles were generated using a custom python script (https://github.com/aemann01/gcLenCorPlots). When possible, analyses were run in parallel using GNU parallel86.",
