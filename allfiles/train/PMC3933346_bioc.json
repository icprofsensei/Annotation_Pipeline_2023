Quadruplicate PCR reactions were set up per DNA sample. The 16S rRNA gene primers, spanning the V3-5 region of the 16S rRNA gene, were configured as follows: 338F, 5\u2032-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3\u2032, where the bases in italics are 454 Lib-L kit adaptor \u201cB\u201d, and 926R, 5\u2032- CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG-Marker-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT-3\u2032, where the underlined bases are 454 adaptor \u201cA\u201d and the marker sequence was a unique 12-mer string of error-correcting Golay barcode bases for each sample[28]. No barcode was added to the forward primer. Hence the PCR products were flanked by a 40 bp fusion primer/multiplex identifier sequence at the reverse end and a 30 bp fusion primer at the forward end. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 2 minutes at 94\u00b0C; 20 cycles of 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C, 30 seconds at 53\u00b0C, 120 seconds at 68\u00b0C. Following confirmation of adequate and appropriately sized product, the quadruplicate reactions were pooled and ethanol precipitated prior to purification as per the recommended AMPure purification method for 454 sequencing. The PCR products were then sequenced with the Roche 454 Titanium sequencing platform using the Lib-L kit (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridgeshire, UK). The sequence data are available from the European Nucleotide Archive under Study Accession Numbers ERP004371 and ERP004372, and Sample Accession Numbers ERS373486 and ERS373498.

The abundance of 16S rRNA gene copies was determined from standard curves and specific bacterial groups were expressed as a percentage of total bacteria determined by universal primers. 5 ng of DNA was used per reaction. The same DNA concentration was used for all runs, including universal primer runs which were used to normalize specific bacterial groups against total bacteria, to minimize errors due to any inhibitory substances in the samples.

Initially, the \u201ctrim.seqs\u201d function was used to filter reads for quality by truncating them once average quality scores dropped below 35 across a rolling window of 50 bases. In addition all reads with any mismatches to the primer or barcode sequences, plus reads with ambiguous bases (i.e. \u201cN\u201ds) or with homopolymeric stretches of longer than 8 bases were removed. Read length following this step ranged from 336 to 351 bp. Chimeras were then checked for and removed using Perseus software[31], as implemented in Mothur. The sequences were then aligned to the reference SILVA database provided in Mothur, a distance matrix generated, and then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity using the average neighbor setting in Mothur. Each OTU was assigned a taxonomic classification at all levels from Phylum to Genus using the reference Ribosomal Database Project database (RDP) provided in Mothur with the Gemmiger/Subdoligranulum classification error corrected. Jaccard and Yue and Clayton distance matrices were calculated using the vegan package in R[32]. Dendrograms were generated using Ward clustering, and then visualized using the iTOL web package[33].",

Bacterial families were reported where at least one sample had an abundance of 5% or more. For each family, samples were only included from participants with at least 0.5% abundance for that bacterial family in one or more of their samples. Modelling was also done in a similar manner using individual OTUs. When using linear modelling at the OTU level, Holm's method was used to correct for multiple testing. Correlation between pyrosequencing and qPCR data was done using Pearsons's correlation coefficient. Analysis was performed using R 2.15.2 (R Statistical Foundation, Vienna, Austria).",

The Jaccard calculator is used to describe overlap in community membership between different samples and ignores the proportional abundance of each OTU while, in contrast, the Yue and Clayton calculator takes the proportional abundance of each OTU into account when comparing community similarities. Jaccard-based calculations revealed a clear clustering of samples primarily by subject of origin (Figure 3a). This is as expected given the well-known inter-individual variation in microbiota composition between individuals[34]. Within individuals, however, the MoBio-processed samples tended to cluster together, separately to those processed using the FastDNA kit, indicating that, although there were overall similarities in the range of organisms that were identified using the two DNA extraction kits, there is some bias associated with the use of each kit. More serious repercussions of using different DNA extraction kits were observed when using the Yue and Clayton distance metric, where dominant organisms can have more impact on clustering patterns. The MoBio-processed samples of subject I1 clustered with the samples from subject H4 rather than with the FastDNA-processed samples from patient I1, presumably as a result of elevated Bacteroides and lower Lachnospiraceae proportional abundances in the MoBio extractions compared to the FastDNA extractions (Figure 3b). This demonstrates that biases introduced by DNA extraction methodology can over-ride the real underlying patterns of community structure driven by inter-individual variation.",

Significantly lower DNA yields were seen with the MoBio kit than the FastDNA kit. This is consistent with results published previously[19]. More importantly, there were significant differences in the relative abundance of bacteria measured at both the family and OTU level. There is no gold standard to which these data can be compared, and so it is impossible to say which technique yields results closer to the true profile of the samples. However, the lower yield of the MoBio kit, and reduced proportional abundance of the Lachnospiraceae family of Firmicutes, suggests that this kit may not be stringent enough for optimal lysing of some Gram-positive organisms. Regardless, these differences are such that it is important to stipulate that all samples in a particular experiment should be extracted using the same technique. This is of particular importance with multicenter studies. Moreover, it should prompt researchers to exercise caution when comparing datasets from different studies. Indeed, if DNA has been extracted using different kits then studies should not be considered cross-comparable. Of note, a recent meta-analysis found that samples from studies of fecal microbiota within Western populations clustered by study, suggesting that systematic bias was introduced by factors such as DNA extraction technique[37].",

                    "text": "Ariefdjohan et al. previously assessed the effect of DNA extraction method on the measured bacterial composition of stool using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)[19]. This study demonstrated variability in bacterial community between fecal samples extracted with QIAamp DNA, MoBio Ultra Clean Fecal DNA and FastDNA SPIN kits, and noted that both the MoBio and Qiagen kits were not able to extract DNA from all the bacteria in the specimen. More recently, Claassen et al. used DGGE, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and qPCR to compare fecal samples extracted using kits from Qiagen, ZymoResearch and MoBio and found few significant differences[20]. In contrast, the previous study by Wu et al. which assessed the effect of extraction methods on 16S rRNA pyrosequencing demonstrated increased yield of Firmicutes when a hot phenol bead-beating method or the PSP kit were used. The present study helps bring further clarity to this important issue with next generation sequencing permitting a more detailed exploration of the differences between samples extracted with different methods.",
