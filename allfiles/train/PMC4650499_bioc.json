To quantify phage recovery, samples were spiked with low numbers of c2, \u03d529, and T4 phages (representatives of the Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Myoviridae families, respectively) and their concentration (plaque-forming units) followed at every step during the extraction procedure. Compared with LIT, TFF and PEG had higher recovery of all spiked phages, yielding up to 16 times more phage particles (PPs) and up to 68 times more phage DNA per volume, increasing thus the chances of extracting low abundant phages. TFF- and PEG-derived metaviromes showed 10\u00a0% increase in relative abundance of Caudovirales and unclassified phages infecting gut-associated bacteria (>92\u00a0% for TFF and PEG, 82.4\u00a0% for LIT). Our methods obtained lower relative abundance of the Myoviridae family (<16\u00a0%) as compared to the reference protocol (22\u00a0%). This decline, however, was not considered a true loss of Myoviridae phages but rather a greater level of extraction of Siphoviridae phages (TFF and PEG >32.5\u00a0%, LIT 22.6\u00a0%), which was achieved with the enhanced conditions of our procedures (e.g., reduced filter clogging). A high degree of phage diversity in samples extracted using TFF and PEG was documented by transmission electron microscopy.",

In spite of this shared backbone, protocols differ from study to study, as different centrifuge speeds, filter cut-off values, and concentration techniques are being used. Recently, Hoyles et al. [26] reported that through the inclusion of 0.45-\u03bcm filters, instead of 0.22-\u03bcm cut-off filters, it is possible to double the yields of viral DNA isolated from human feces and cecal fluids. However, determining the efficiency of extraction of viral particles from fecal samples by (i) spiking with known phages, (ii) measuring the impact of extraction procedures on DNA purity (presence of bacterial and host derived DNA) for mining auxiliary metabolic genes, and (iii) profiling the metagenomic virome as measurements of true success have not been performed to date.",

Further, it is well known that viruses differ in size and structure, so differences in extraction procedures are likely to influence the structure of the phage community and amount and quality of extracted DNA and further metagenomic analyses, which in turn could lead to inaccurate or biased conclusions [29]. Further, it is important to point out that obtaining higher enrichments of viral particles will not only improve the yields of DNA but also give more accurate estimations of their concentration in stool samples (and the human gut). In addition, high phage yield will increase the probability of retaining relatively rare phages that otherwise would not be represented in the metagenomic dataset [30].",

The optimization of protocols was based on two well-known laboratory techniques, tangential-flow filtration (TFF), and polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG), using an adapted method from a published protocol [20] that has been used in several previously published studies [1, 9, 31] as control (literature-adapted protocol (LIT)). We analyzed the recovery rate of the three methods for a set of spiked bacteriophages (c2, \u03d529, and T4; representatives of the Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Myoviridae families, respectively), their efficiency to concentrate phage particles (PPs), and their impact on the phage community structure through metagenomic analyses. Our optimized methods not only yielded a higher number of PPs and DNA compared to the control but also demonstrated a higher efficiency for recovering spiked bacteriophages and increased the proportion of phage-derived sequences.",

Several approaches including different concentrations of NaCl and speeds of centrifugation/ultracentrifugation, dead-end and tangential-flow filtrations, two PPs concentration techniques (PEG and TFF), as well as four- and two-layer CsCl gradients (Fig.\u00a01) were investigated. For convenience, the procedures for extraction were divided in two sections: the pre-processing (or part 1) was used to homogenize and remove large particles, whereas the purification section (or part 2) aimed at eliminating low molecular weight particles (impurities) and microbial cells and to concentrate phages. Representative populations of the Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Myoviridae bacteriophage families (a set of c2, \u03d529, and T4 phages) were inoculated to a concentration of 5.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 phages per sample (5\u00a0g of feces re-suspended in 45\u00a0ml of SM buffer). If losses of more than 50\u00a0% of the spiked phages were observed in a given step of extraction (data not shown), these were consequently diverged into a new extraction route until a higher recovery of the inoculated populations was reached (free of impurities and contaminating cells). Instead of applying a 0.22-\u03bcm cut-off for tangential-flow filtration as described in previous studies [9, 12, 20], the reference (LIT) method was coupled with a 0.45-\u03bcm membrane cut-off as recently suggested [26]. The routes with the highest phage recovery, which eventually became the optimized protocols (PEG, route 5; TFF; route 8), were compared to the reference method (LIT, route 6) [20] based on their concentration of PPs (in the final phage concentrate collected from CsCl gradients) and yields of DNA. Each of the optimized routes of pre-processing and purification were assessed with fecal samples from three subjects and using two biological replicates as shown in Additional file 1.",

Using the TFF and PEG protocols, virtually no spiked phages were lost until the ultracentrifugation step (CsCl gradient), whereas the literature-adapted protocol (Fig.\u00a02a) lost up to 90\u00a0% of the spiked phages at the tangential-flow filtration step using a 0.45-\u03bcm membrane cut-off filter. The infectivity of the spiked T4 phage was compromised during the ultracentrifugation step (CsCl gradients), which occurred independently from the two speeds of ultracentrifugation used (using 82,000 and 150,000\u00d7g, for the control and optimized procedures, respectively) and possibly due to tail alterations at this step. Nevertheless, by performing a T4-specific qPCR analysis [32], we observed that T4 DNA was equally detected in samples that were treated with and without DNAse I after ultracentrifugation and prior to DNA extraction (data not shown), thereby suggesting that in spite of the infectivity loss, the phage head remained undamaged and therefore retained the genetic material.",

For Y1-LIT and X1-LIT, no phage particles were observed by TEM as the low yield of PPs extracted were below the detection limit. For X1, the number of PPs extracted with our procedures was estimated to be 108 PPs g\u22121 of wet material, and various Myoviridae (including Peduovirinae) Siphoviridae and Podoviridae and putative unclassified phage morphotypes were seen as the most common viral families (see Fig.\u00a04a, b). For the largest Myoviridae-like phages, unique long whiskers attached to the lower (tail-orientated) part of the capsids were detected. In principle, all phage morphotypes were observed with both TFF and PEG. However, in the latter procedure, a high number of very small Podoviridae-like or unclassified phages with capsid sizes smaller than 50\u00a0nm were observed (shown on bottom of Fig.\u00a04b) that were not present in the corresponding TFF extraction (Fig.\u00a04a). This result indicates that the PEG methodology might be superior to the TFF procedure with respect to the recovery of small-size phages (putatively not sufficiently retarded by the TFF filtration membrane). For subject Y1 (Fig.\u00a05a, b), different phage types were again detected, one Myoviridae phage with long whiskers uniformly attached to the capsids, as well as long capsid-anchored whiskers for a tail-less Podoviridae-like phage were identified. Differences in phage population were observed again, as large Siphoviridae phages with distinct cross-striations on the tail were only present in the TFF procedure (Fig.\u00a05a) (that apparently could not be collected by PEG precipitation, Fig.\u00a05b). Our detailed TEM analysis confirmed that both TFF and PEG methods are suitable for recovery of intact phages of various morphotypes, as phage ghosts with empty capsids were only observed occasionally. It was furthermore verified that TFF and PEG samples were not contaminated with cells or cellular components (flagella, cell wall debris, etc.).",

As our and other studies have demonstrated [9, 31], tangential-flow filtration is indeed a reliable and efficient technique for concentration of viral particles (e.g., 100\u00a0kDa filter) but also has limitations when it is employed towards removing large particles other than phages (i.e. microbial cells) as in the case of the 0.45-\u03bcm membrane cut-off (possibly due to filter clogging). Our results demonstrated that the recovery rate of the different bacteriophages is very variable and seems highly dependent on the method of extraction chosen. The optimized methods were at least eight times more efficient for c2 and \u03d529 phages and over 286 times more efficient for the T4 phage compared to the reference (LIT) procedure (Fig.\u00a02). The infectivity of T4 (Myoviridae representative) was compromised in all protocols during the last step of purification using ultracentrifugation in CsCl gradients. Bourdin et al. [39] showed that various T4-like phages contract their tails and have a tendency to aggregate across the exposed tail tube during ultracentrifugation procedures. Corroborating those observations, qPCR-based quantification of T4 phage DNA showed that this loss in infective T4 phages is not an impediment for further recovery of their DNA as their phage heads are still intact protecting the phage DNA, which could be equally subjected to HTS and metagenome studies.",

                    "text": "The degree of bacterial/eukaryotic and host contamination in the phage DNA was considerably lower in the extractions performed with TFF and PEG. This was accomplished using centrifugation steps (at 5,000\u00d7g) to remove remaining bacterial cells/host DNA in the phage concentrate, rather than relying on the filtration system performed with 0.45-\u03bcm cut-off. Despite our low degree of contamination (in TFF and PEG), we do not rule out the idea that sequences identified as bacterial may have also been derived from active/induced prophages found within our purified PPs what could potentially lead to overestimate bacterial DNA levels. The genetic diversity of every metavirome was explored using cluster richness analysis [6]. None of the rarefaction curves reached a plateau, meaning that the genetic diversity of the metaviromes was not completely covered. Metaviromes derived from PEG and TFF showed similar degree of sequence diversity with each other but slightly lower than the control method (Fig.\u00a06). However, it must be pointed out that the optimization of our protocols was addressed towards recovering a higher yield of bacteriophages, specifically those PPs located in a density fraction ranging from 1.41 to 1.50\u00a0g\u00a0ml\u22121 (see Fig.\u00a01; adjusting the sample density to 1.39\u00a0g\u00a0ml\u22121 allowed us to remove impurities from the phage concentrates). Following these optimized procedures, we increased the proportion of reads belonging particularly to bacteriophages (i.e., Caudovirales, unclassified dsDNA phages and unclassified phages, accounting for >92\u00a0% of the affiliated sequences) and reduced simultaneously the abundance of sequences associated with eukaryotic viruses (non-bacteriophage groups) (Fig.\u00a07).",

We chose this approach since contigs may reduce the diversity of the environmental samples, as unique reads of less abundant viruses are difficult to assemble [29]. The percentage of sequences that matched with the NCBI Refseq complete viral genomes protein database was dependent on the extraction protocols: The reads of LIT-based metaviromes had the lowest affiliation (10.7\u00a0%), while PEG and TFF had a approximately twofold higher affiliation (19.7 and 22.6\u00a0%, respectively). Even though the proportion of known reads for all our metaviromes were similar to those reported in previous investigations [10, 36], the divergence in the percentage of affiliations observed between the adapted and optimized protocols may also have been a response associated with the density fraction recovered from the CsCl gradients (Fig.\u00a01) (i.e., increasing the proportion of non-affiliated reads derived from eukaryotic viruses or non-phage groups).",

This relative increase of Siphoviridae in the metagenomic dataset does not necessarily suggest a true loss of Myoviridae phages (as their relative distribution was higher in LIT) but rather indicate an enhanced recovery of the siphophages compared to the LIT method. Unlike the TFF and PEG procedures, in LIT, the 0.45-\u03bcm cut-off tangential-flow filtration demonstrated to have poor performance possibly due to filter clogging, thereby triggering a massive loss of PPs what may have negatively influenced the recovery of long-tailed bacteriophages (Siphoviridae).",

Since Metavir has limitations analyzing metaviromes containing more than 2,500,000 sequences, the non-assembled datasets (metavirome) were first adjusted to 5,000,000 reads and then split in two sections (2,500,000 sequences each). Composition and relative abundance generated by Metavir were converted into operational taxonomic units (OTU) tables, and subsequent analyses were performed in QIIME (1.7.0 and 1.8.0) [47] . Metaviromes were subsampled using 90\u00a0% of the number of sequences within the most indigent sample (multiple rarefactions computed with 1,000 OTU tables). The differences in the relative abundance of phage-taxa (dependent variable) given by paired-comparison between extraction procedures (independent variable) were assessed using one-way ANOVA. The Kraken program [48] was used to map host (human genome NCBI release 71) and bacterial (Kraken Minidatabase, as of 01.08.2015) derived DNA. To get better estimations of uncultured bacteria/eukaryotes, which may not be represented in the previous database, the unclassified reads were also blasted (UBLAST algorithm [34], using -evalue 1e-3, -id 0.7, -query_cov 0.6), against representative sequences of 16S (GreenGenes [49]) and 18S rRNA (Silva [50]) gene databases. Cluster richness analysis [6] was carried out with the UCLUST pipeline [34] using a 75\u00a0% sequence similarity threshold (2,000,000 reads were used in each metavirome). Rarefactions curves were computed using 10 subsampled cluster tables and expressed as number of clusters for each metavirome.",
