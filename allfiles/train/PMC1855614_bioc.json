These steps are the major bottlenecks in current microbial comparative analyses. We used direct comparisons of taxon density distributions in an absolute evolutionary coordinate space. The coordinate space was generated by using alignment-independent bilinear multivariate modeling. Statistical analyses for clone library comparisons were based on multivariate analysis of variance, partial least-squares regression, and permutations. Clone libraries from both adult and infant gastrointestinal tract microbial communities were used as biological models. We reanalyzed a library consisting of 11,831 clones covering complete colons from three healthy adults in addition to a smaller 390-clone library from infant feces. We show that it is possible to extract detailed information about microbial community structures using our alignment-independent method. Our density distribution analysis is also very efficient with respect to computer operation time, meeting the future requirements of large-scale screenings to understand the diversity and dynamics of microbial communities.",

Similar approaches have also been adapted for comparisons of microbiological clone libraries (25). The problem, however, is that there are no natural species barriers for asexual prokaryote species and thereby no rationale criteria for phylogroup definitions (9). Thus, a dependence on phylogroups severely limits the ability to describe and understand microbial communities (5). Furthermore, most of the microbial biodiversity is actually found within environmental clone libraries in which it is difficult to determine the boundaries of the phylogroups (8).",

The problem with DNA sequence alignments and phylogenetic reconstruction, however, is that large data sets cannot readily be analyzed. The reasons for this are both that there is no objective criterion for determining the correctness of an alignment and that the number of possible phylogenetic trees increases exponentially with the number of taxa analyzed. There are currently nearly 300,000 16S rRNA gene sequences in public databases, and that number is estimated to double every 7 months (8). Relying on alignments would therefore not suit the future needs for microbial community analyses.",

Density distribution comparisons are very efficient with respect to computer operation time (CPU), enabling analyses of very large clone libraries. A further benefit of our approach is that we can directly apply multivariate statistical tools, such as multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) and multivariate regression for the microbial community comparisons.

This was carried out by reanalyzing the extensive human bacterial clone library provided by Eckburg et al. (6). We present a detailed description of significant differences in the microbiota with respect to different persons and to mucosal tissues from the six major subdivisions of the colon in addition to fecal samples. We also present initial results for an in-house-generated clone library for infant fecal microbiota, showing differences for age and mode of delivery (caesarean or vaginal).

The transformation was based on sliding a window of 5 nucleotides along a DNA sequence and counting the frequencies of the different multimers encountered. The sizes of the multimer windows were chosen as tradeoffs between detecting phylogenetic signals (homologous multimer equalities), avoiding base composition biases due to nonhomologous multimer equalities, and the requirements for computer operation time (20). The multimer frequency data were compressed using principal component analysis (PCA) as previously described for the alignment-independent bilinear multivariate modeling (AIBIMM) approach (20). The phylogenetic content in the PCA was evaluated by cross-validation, while the potential presence of chimerical sequences was determined empirically by conflicting multimer loadings.",

If the sequences have different lengths, then this should be corrected for by weighting using the \u201cnormalize data\u201d option in PhyloMode, so that the weighted numbers of multimers are equal for all taxa. Clustering in the PCA plot indicates close relatedness between the taxa if the residual variance is low, while if the residual variance is high, clustering could be because the taxa are not separated within the model. Deep branches can also be difficult to resolve since perfect matches for the entire multimers are required for a phylogenetic signal.

In particular, there was a very clear differentiation of the Bacteroidetes from the rest of the bacteria. Bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes, on the other hand, were separated into three groups. The Clostridia were separated into two distinct groups (1 and 2), while the rare Firmicutes formed a relatively loose association (designated Firmicutes/misc) with the other rare bacteria identified in the samples (6). The bacteria in this group were not separated by the principal components used for the fLAND analyses due to their low abundance. A total of 579 out of 6,400 segments in the fLAND density plot contained one or more taxa, while 141 segments contained only single taxa. Surprisingly, only 22 segments contained 46% of the taxa in the library. Hierarchical clustering for the first three principal components further supported the group structure of the density distribution data (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1B).1B).

The 50-50 MANOVA program has been developed for purposes other than microbial community comparisons (11), so the limitation could be that the program has not been optimized for the analysis of such large data sets. The infant library, however, is much smaller, enabling MANOVA with our desktop computers. By using MANOVA, we found significant variance in the data related to all of the categories of samples analyzed (age and mode of delivery) (Table \u200b(Table1).The1).The ages of the children explained 3.30% of the variance (P < 0.01), while the mode of delivery explained 0.75% (P = 0.05) and the interaction between age and mode of delivery explained 0.54% (P < 0.01). Most of the variance (95.4%) in the data, however, could not be explained by the categories evaluated. This is probably due to high stochastic variation in the microbiota among the children analyzed. We obtained a high linear correlation between age and the microbiota using PLS regression (validated correlation coefficient of 0.87). There were also relatively strong correlations between the total microbiota and the mode of delivery category with a validated correlation coefficient of 0.30. fLAND analyses showed that there were nine segments in the fLAND density plots that were significantly different between the two age categories analyzed (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2B).2B). The segments at coordinates [given as (PC1, PC2)] (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2) were classified as Escherichia using an RDP II hierarchical classifier, while the segment (13, 31) was classified as Bacteroides and the segments (45, 20), (46, 20), (48, 20), (49, 21), and (50, 20) were classified as Bifidobacterium. We also found significant differences for five segments with respect to mode of delivery (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2C).2C). According to the RDP II hierarchical classifier, the segment (13, 30) belongs to Bacteroides, segment (13, 39) belongs to Staphylococcaceae, and segments (47, 19), (47, 20), and (50, 20) belong to Bifidobacterium.",

The library from the ascending colon from subject A was a subset of the other libraries, and the descending colon was a subset of the ascending colon for subject B (6).
