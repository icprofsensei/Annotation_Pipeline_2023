In this study, we illustrated a model of this mucosa bacterial communities' biogeography, based on the largest data set so far, obtained via 454-pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rDNAs associated with 77 matched biopsy tissue samples taken from terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum of 11 healthy adult subjects. Borrowing from macro-ecology, we used both Taylor's power law analysis and phylogeny-based beta-diversity metrics to uncover a highly heterogeneous distribution pattern of mucosa microbial inhabitants along the length of the intestinal tract. We then developed a spatial dispersion model with an R-squared value greater than 0.950 to map out the gut mucosa-associated flora's non-linear spatial distribution pattern for 51.60% of the 188 most abundant gut bacterial species. Furthermore, spatial co-occurring network analysis of mucosa microbial inhabitants together with occupancy (that is habitat generalists, specialists and opportunist) analyses implies that ecological relationships (both oppositional and symbiotic) between mucosa microbial inhabitants may be important contributors to the observed spatial heterogeneity of mucosa microbiota along the human intestine and may even potentially be associated with mutual cooperation within and functional stability of the gut ecosystem.",

(Kau et al., 2011). Among these microbiomes, the human intestinal tract harbors the most abundant, and one of the most diverse, microbial communities known in the human body (Costello et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2013). The general diversity of the gut microbiome is matched by the observed high level of variance in its composition between individuals (Turnbaugh et al., 2009; Yatsunenko et al., 2012; Schloissnig et al., 2013). Similarly, significant latitudinal variation between surface-adherent and luminal microbial populations has been confirmed by both DNA fingerprinting method (Zoetendal et al., 2002) and polymerase chain reaction-based clone library sequencing, (Eckburg et al., 2005) and plenty of other studies found longitudinal variations of microbial components along the length of the intestinal tract based on cultivation approaches, (Moore and Holdeman, 1974; Hayashi et al., 2002) molecular fingerprinting methods, (Zoetendal et al., 2002; Hayashi et al., 2005; de Carcer et al., 2011) as well as polymerase chain reaction-based clone library sequencing analyses (Hayashi et al., 2002; Hold et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2003, 2005; Eckburg et al., 2005; Frank et al., 2007). Despite a rather well-rounded view of the gut microbiome taken from many viewpoints, to date there has been no quantitative illustration or feasible explanations that help explain the observed longitudinal variations in the intestine, largely due to a dearth of large-scale data. This dilemma prompted us to consider two successive questions in the present study: (1) is there discernible heterogeneity along the intestinal tract; (2) if so, what would modulate the resulting spatial distribution?",

The term \u2018distribution' is used in both the biological and statistical senses. The aggregated (spatial) distribution (sensu biology) generally needs highly skewed statistical distributions such as a Negative Binomial, Neyman's type A, Polya and Ades distributions to be described mathematically. Random distributions (sensu biology) correspond to Poisson statistical distribution (sensu statistics), whereas regular or uniform (sensu biology) correspond to the uniform distribution (sensu statistics) in statistics. Both random and uniform distributions\u2014though especially uniform\u2014are extremely rare in field populations, even though they are meaningful theoretically. One obvious biological interpretation of the parameter b is that it actually measures the degree of aggregation (or its opposite, dispersion): the larger the b-value, the higher the aggregation degree or the lower the dispersion degree.",

To establish the degree to which the sampled gut microbiota was similar in terms of the various compositions of their constituent microbes, we used the method proposed by Ochman et al. (2010) to construct the phylogenies of the 77 samples based on the frequencies of taxonomically assigned OTUs in their gut microbial communities. Character matrices based on all reads were converted into phylogenetic trees using a parsimony-based approach. Each character corresponds to a taxonomically assigned OTU whose frequency in each sample was normalized by coding with one of the four ordered states, reflecting log-unit differences in its occurrence, with an OTU absent from a sample coded as state 0. The range in the occurrence of each OTU across samples (from 0 to 1 \u2009400 at the species level) resulted in a five-state data matrix. The matrix was then processed with a heuristic maximum-parsimony-tree search algorithm implemented in PAUP 4.0b10. The default settings of PAUP were used to conduct the tree search.",

In this case, X would be the distance from the sampling location to the anus while Y is the abundance of a given OTU in an individual subject.

A total of 396 pairs of correlations (278 positive correlations and 118 negative correlations) were found to have an absolute Pearson's correlation above 0.81 with an FDR-corrected significance level under 0.05, and these correlations were transformed into links between two OTUs in the OTU co-occurrence network. The co-occurrence networks were then visualized using Cytoscape 2.8.2 with a force-directed algorithm (Smoot et al., 2011), and network topological parameters were computed using NetworkAnalyzer (Assenov et al., 2008). Highly connected microbial clusters (modules) in the network were identified using Network Module identification (NeMo) (Rivera et al., 2010) within Cytoscape. The mining of high-confidence modules was largely dependent on both high scores gained by NeMo and high clustering coefficient within modules (clustering coefficients closer to 1.0 represent higher fidelity, with the highest being 1.0).",

No significance of sequence numbers among all seven sampling sites through the human intestine (Supplementary Table S5) indicated a minimal sequencing bias across any of the seven sampling sites. In addition, no noted significance of Good's Coverage between all seven sampling sites (Supplementary Table S5) indicated that each sampling site had similar coverage of total microbial species.

First, along the intestine (Figure 1c), we found no significant difference of either dominant (e.g., Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) or rare bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria) (Figure 1a). Similarly, three dominant bacterial genera (e.g., Bacteroides, Prevotella and Faecalibacterium) only showed weak variations without significant differences among any of the tested sites (Figure 1b). These results indicated that at a higher taxonomic level, mucosa microbial components potentially tend to be far more stabilized along the intestine. To further visualize spatial variation of mucosa microbiota species within individuals, we used a heatmap-based analysis (Figure 2) on the 188 gut species (from the filtered 5085 OTUs) that had a relative abundance greater than 10\u22123 (that is, the read number of an OTU divided by total reads, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, there were 79 OTUs (42.02%) shared by at least six subjects (four OTUs of these were by all 11 subjects), 102 OTUs (54.26%) shared by two to five subjects and seven subject-specific OTUs (3.72%). The visualized results (Figure 2) indicated that there may be micro-heterogeneities of mucosa microbial species existing along the intestine within specific individuals, although significant differences across sites were not detected by ANOVA, possibly due to the masking of a high level of inter-subject variation.",

Subsequently, we opted to use Taylor's power law analysis on gut bacterial community per subject, consisting of the gut species (from the filtered 5085 OTUs) with at least 10\u22123 relative abundance (that is, the read number of an OTU divided by total reads per subject) (Table 1) (See Materials and methods). We found gut bacterial communities for all 11 subjects had b-values>1 (1.858\u00b10.049) with statistical significance (P<0.0001) as well as a high correlation coefficient (R2=0.754\u00b10.031) (Table 1). The biological interpretation of the parameter b indicates that aggregation degree values greater than 1 denote a high heterogeneity in the spatial distributions of mucosa-associated bacterial community along the intestine within individuals. However, we should caution that in future research it may be necessary to use large-scale 16S rDNA molecular data with high species coverage (that is, high Good's Coverage of 88.80\u00b10.68% per sampling site in this study) if species abundance\u2014as an indicator of population density of species\u2014is applied to Taylor's power law analysis. Additionally, we also found that the assessment of the parameter b in Taylor's power law analysis was independent of using absolute/relative taxonomic abundances as well as sequence differences among seven sampling sites within a single subject (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). Similarly, test results based on individual-independent phylogenetic beta-diversity metrics (Supplementary Table S9) also suggested that significant differences (Bonferroni corrected P\u2a7d0.01) in community diversities exist among seven sampling sites per subject. In total, based on quantitative assessments from both Taylor's power analysis and phylogenetic beta-diversity metrics, we consistently found clear, significant heterogeneity of mucosa microbiota along the axis of the intestinal tract within individuals, without any masks from inter-subject variation.",

According to the earlier explanation of the parameter b, the power law analysis at the community level (b=1.975\u00b10.021 with both P<0.001 and R2=0.894\u00b10.009) (Supplementary Table S3) revealed non-random or highly aggregated distributions among the gut bacterial community. This finding was independent of different taxonomic levels (phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) (Supplementary Table S3). The consistent pattern was further confirmed using the filtered 5085 OTUs to compare community diversities among seven locations using three phylogenetic beta diversity metrics (Supplementary Materials and methods). The results suggested that significant differences in community diversities (Bonferroni corrected P\u2a7d0.01) exist across all seven sampling sites, though a few exceptions were found after correction of multiple testing (the combined 11 subjects in Supplementary Table S10). Furthermore, we investigated spatial heterogeneity of mucosa microbial species along the intestine based on the combined samples of the 11 subjects, using the 188 gut species (OTUs) (Supplementary Table S4) for Taylor's power law analysis (See Materials and methods). Our analyzed results from each of the concerned 188 species yielded b-values ranging from 0.5393 to 5.3701 (2.2565\u00b10.0474) (Supplementary Table S4).

To better discern the relatedness among 77 mucosa-associated bacterial communities, we used a cluster method developed by Ochman et al. (2010) to perform a community relatedness analysis. The results with high bootstrap supports reveal that all 77 samples (Figure 3c) were primarily grouped by individuals with the exception of several samples (e.g., S401). The analysis from a data set of the three American individuals reported by Eckburg et al. (2005) also showed a consistent pattern (Supplementary Figure S1).

To increase the power of ADD modeling, using more strict R-squared values (0.600, 0.700, 0.800, 0.900 and 0.950, respectively), we found that the ADD relationships in 165, 159, 152, 118 and 97 of the total 188 species (87.77%, 84.57%, 80.85%, 62.77% and 51.60%) fit the ADD model. Totally, our results demonstrated that both spatial dispersion of mucosa microbial inhabitants and their co-occurrence associations through the human intestine could be nonlinear. The biological significance of this described non-linear relationship, though provocative, remains unknown. A similar study suggested that the non-linear relationship could raise a potential spatial segregation of mucosal microbial populations of similar and competing species, and there is a possibility that this spatial segregation could act to stabilize the coexistence of similar species, relaxing the expected interspecific competition (Shigesada et al., 1979).",

OTU318-matched module A with the most stabilized topological structure (clustering coefficient=1.0) was modulated largely by generalists (Figure 5b). Within this module, generalist F. prausnitzii (represented by OTU1457 and increasing towards the rectum) was negatively correlated to and much more abundant (P=0.004) than generalist B. coprophilus (the most abundant in the descending colon) (Figure 5c). Meanwhile, OTU191-matched module B with clustering coefficient of 0.639 was involved in both generalists and specialists (Figure 5b). The abundance of R. gnavus represented by specialist OTU191 (the most abundant in colon) was significantly (P\u2a7d0.001) lower than that of its negative cooperator (generalist OTU1449 with 99% similarity to Bacteroides vulgatus PC510) (the most abundant in terminal ileum and rectum) (Figure 5c). The inter-module interplay was modulated by F. prausnitzii represented by two bacterial OTUs (244 and 2109) (Figure 5b).",

Along the length of the human intestinal tract, spatial heterogeneity of mucosa microbiota remains poorly elucidated, despite previously observed spatial variations of mucosa microbiota (Zoetendal et al., 2002; Eckburg et al., 2005; de Carcer et al., 2011; Hong et al., 2011; Nava et al., 2012). The results of this study allowed us to conclude that there are clear, significant spatial heterogeneities existing in the human intestinal mucosa microbiota within a single individual based on a quantitative Taylor's power law analyses, which is in accordance with classical phylogenetic beta-diversity metrics of mucosa-associated microbial community diversities across seven sampling sites. Spatial heterogeneities of mucosa microbiota along the intestine could be indicative of underlying differences in gut physiology or a host effect on the microbiome (e.g., diet or lifestyle). This result also expands earlier findings of significant heterogeneity between intestinal luminal, mucosal and fecal microbiota (Zoetendal et al., 2002; Eckburg et al., 2005; Hong et al., 2011) to the scope of mucosa microbiota along the intestinal tract. Spatial co-occurrence patterns of mucosa microbiota together with occupancy (that is habitat generalists, specialists and opportunist) presented in this study provides novel insights into understanding the association between spatial heterogeneity of mucosal-associated intestinal microbiota and human health.",

This finding was consistent with two facets linked with human gut health or disease. The members of the Enterobacteriaceae were the most abundant in the distal regions of the intestine in health subjects (de Carcer et al., 2011). Otherwise, a large increase in Enterobacteriaceae was found potentially associated with the ileocecal form of Crohn's disease (CD) (Willing et al., 2009, 2010). Given the scope of this study, local environmental drivers that form spatial heterogeneity of mucosa microbiota through the intestine cannot be determined, but the general trend follows the main physicochemical changes known to occur along the axis of the human intestine.",

Likewise, a significant trend from high to low short-chain fatty acid concentrations was again found passing distally from cecum to the descending colon, which provides strong evidence for the occurrence of the microbial breakdown of carbohydrates in the human colon (Cummings et al., 1987). Moreover, another review indicated that glycan-degrading phenotypes are distributed across the length of the human intestinal tract (Koropatkin et al., 2012). Genome analysis suggested that Bacteroides vulgatus PC510 represented by OTU1449 (Supplementary Table S4) encodes arylsulfatases, hexosaminidases, fucosidases and a sialidase with putative roles in harvesting host glycans (Cu\u00edv et al., 2011). In addition, mucin composition was the most abundant in the rectum and correlated with the composition of different sulfate-reducing bacteria genera along the human colon (Croix et al., 2011).",

                    "text": "Recent studies found that the occurrence of CD is always following a decrease in obligate anaerobes of the phylum Firmicutes and an increase in facultative anaerobes, including members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (Willing et al., 2009, 2010; Joossens et al., 2011). The shift of bacterial communities from obligate to facultative anaerobes strongly suggests a disruption in anaerobiosis and points to a potential role for oxygen in intestinal dysbiosis (Rigottier-Gois 2013). Spatial variation of mucosal oxygen concentration was also implicated along the human colon, especially between the cecum and distal regions (Sheridan et al., 1987). The overgrowth of aerotolerant bacteria with ileal CD (Baumgart et al., 2007; Willing et al., 2009, 2010) was frequently found in several studies, wherein they indicated that the functional stability or disturbance of oxygen-microbe interaction through the intestine may be related to local intestinal health or dysbiosis. Recently, Larsson et al. (2012) found that gut microbiota enables inducing different host responses along the length of the gut. Schluter and Foster (2012) also found that the evolution of the gut microbiota mutualism was dependent on host epithelial selection (Schluter and Foster, 2012). These findings together suggest that spatial heterogeneity of mucosa microbiota through the human intestine may have actually resulted from underlying differences in gut physiology or host effect on the microbiome (again, diet and/or lifestyle). More succinctly put, local environment-microbes or host-microbe interaction may be one of the major driving forces in forming the spatial heterogeneity of the mucosa microbiota along the intestinal tract.",

Our ADD modeling results imply that it is impossible to use classic multivariate analysis methods to describe spatial co-occurrence relationships across mucosa-associated microbial inhabitants. Unlike classic multivariate analysis methods, correlation (co-occurrence) network analysis allows for the interrogation of nonlinear dynamics of mucosa microbiota over space. This concept was leveraged in the present study, wherein we explored co-occurrence patterns of 165 from 188 gut bacteria species together with occupancy (that is, habitat generalists, specialists and opportunists) (Figure 5a). Co-occurrence network analysis of the healthy human gut microbiota revealed a strong niche specialization with most microbial associations occurring within and between body sites, answering some of the interesting questions as to how healthy microbiota remains stable while showing remarkable variability or spatial heterogeneity within individuals (Faust et al., 2012). Consistent with the finding reported by Faust et al. (2012), via co-occurrence network analysis, our results suggest that ecological relationships (both oppositional and symbiotic) between mucosa microbial inhabitants may also be important contributors to spatial heterogeneity of mucosa microbiota along the human intestinal tract.",

Similarly, network module analyses together with the reported occupancy findings in this study revealed two patterns of spatial microbe-microbe interactions with potentially biological implications. First, the colonization resistance between habitat generalists may be closely related to functional stability of the gut ecosystem along the human intestine, such as generalists F. prausnitzii and B. coprophilus (Module A in Figure 5b). F. prausnitzii is considered to be an anti-inflammatory commensal bacterium identified by gut microbiota analysis of CD patients, (Sokol et al., 2008) and a decrease of F. prausnitzii is closely related to gut dysbiosis in patients with CD (Willing et al., 2010; Joossens et al., 2011). Our study found that F. prausnitzii (generalist OTU1457) was negatively correlated to and significantly (P=0.004) much more abundant than B. coprophilus (generalist OTU1517) (Module A in Figures 5b and c), suggesting there may be colonization resistance between F. prausnitzii and B. coprophilus along the length of the intestinal tract. Accordingly, if the turnover of colonization resistance between those two species occurred, the overgrowth of B. coprophilus along the intestine may result in a decrease of F. prausnitzii possibly linked with the presence of gut dysbiosis, such as CD (Willing et al., 2010; Joossens et al., 2011).",

Beneficial bacteria B. vulgatus is amongst the most commonly isolated microbes from the human gastrointestinal tract in healthy humans (Tap et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2010). If this were not the case, Willing et al.'s (2010) study suggested that an overrepresentation of R. gnavus is closely related to the ileocecal form of Dour study; however, we found that B. vulgatus (generalist OTU1449) was negatively correlated to and significantly (P\u2a7d0.001) much more abundant than R. gnavus (specialist OTU191 to AC) (Module B in Figures 5b and c), implying that there may be local colonization resistance between B. vulgatus and R. gnavus in AC, possibly linked with the healthy status of AC in humans. This finding further indicated that an overgrowth of R. gnavus may induce local gut dysbiosis, such as the AC form of CD, similar to the ileocecal CD (Willing et al., 2010). Interestingly, the interplay between the two modules (Figure 5b) indicated that the two patterns that we described were interdependent but not isolated, possibly associated with local gut health. Willing et al. (2010) found that local gut dysbiosis specific to patients with ileal CD included the disappearance of core bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium (corresponding to generalist OTU 318 and OTU1447 within Module A in Figure 5b) and increased amounts of R. gnavus (corresponding to specialist OTU 191 within Module B in Figure 5b) (Willing et al., 2010), partially supporting our inference stated above.",
