The conventional method used for several decades to identify gastrointestinal bacterial populations has been culturing on selective media followed by biochemical characterization and serotyping, a clear disadvantage when identifying slow-growing or fastidious organisms. Only a small percentage of intestinal microorganisms have been identified by these conventional culture techniques, while recent molecular techniques have provided new knowledge about the complexity of the intestinal micro-flora [3,4]. The first step in molecular diagnostics is the extraction of intact template DNA, which may be generated by boiling bacterial colonies from cultured samples or by DNA extraction directly from the sample. The extraction of fecal DNA is a challenge, since feces not only contains bacterial and human cells but also many different substances derived from for example food, medicine, secondary cell metabolites etc. that can inhibit downstream PCR [5-9]. Various extraction methods have been developed and evaluated [10-13]. These methods are mainly based on chemical and mechanical lysis in the presence of buffers and chelating agents protecting the liberated DNA from degradation, followed by charge-dependent binding to an immobilized matrix that permits washing and elution of pure DNA. When using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA it has been demonstrated that the diversity of the microbiota in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is less complex than in healthy subjects [14]; nevertheless, the influence of DNA extraction methods is unknown.",

It was noted that using less silica than suggested by the easyMag\u00ae manufacturer resulted in a higher DNA yield. An explanation could be that when using the semi-automatic easyMag\u00ae with 140\u00a0\u03bcL silica relatively more non-DNA compounds such as protein will be extracted from the sample compared to 35\u00a0\u03bcL silica. These non-DNA compounds probably interfere with the DNA extraction. Diluting the DNA extracts and thereby the non-DNA inhibiting compounds 10 and 15 times resulted in more bands as revealed on DGGE gels. One of the goals of this study was to investigate whether easyMag\u00ae can be used to extract small amounts of fecal DNA. IBD patients frequently have a reduced diversity of bacterial DNA in comparison to healthy controls [24-26]. Our results demonstrate that easyMag\u00ae can extract DNA from fecal samples and the method is suitable for extracting DNA from fecal samples of IBD patients. However, the DGGE gel lanes representing 16S rDNA PCR products of the DNA extracted by Qiagen revealed clearly more visible bands in comparison with DGGE gel lanes representing 16S rDNA PCR products derived from DNA extracted by easyMag\u00ae. The reason why Qiagen extracted DNA is of better quality may be found in the method used to extract fecal DNA. The Qiagen DNA extraction method was combined with TissueLyser, which enhances lysis of gram-positive microorganisms (5) and a dedicated step to eradicate non-DNA molecules (InhibitEX) that might interfere with the DNA extraction and downstream PCR (16). Cellular debris that is not removed can also result in a decreased yield and quality of DNA or RNA preparation (16).",
