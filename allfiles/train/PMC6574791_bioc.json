Infants received mother's own milk (assigned to human milk [HM] reference group) (n\u00a0=\u00a025) or were randomized to receive one of two infant formulas: amino-acid based (AAF; n\u00a0=\u00a025) or extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk protein (EHF; n\u00a0=\u00a028). Neither study formula included added Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. DNA was extracted (Baseline, Day 30, Day 60), 16S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced (Illumina MiSeq), and exact amplicon sequence variants (ASV) were assigned using the DADA2 model. Alpha (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1) and beta diversity (Bray Curtis distance) and differential abundance in taxa were analyzed. Relative ASV enrichment (Baseline vs Day 60) was visualized using heat maps and taxa abundance was analyzed by DESEq2 in R (ver 3.4.3).",
