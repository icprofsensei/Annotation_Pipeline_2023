Electrochemical biosensors are well suited for urinary diagnostics due to their excellent sensitivity, low cost, and ability to detect a wide variety of target molecules including nucleic acids and protein biomarkers. We report the development of an electrochemical immunosensor for direct detection of the urinary tract infection (UTI) biomarker lactoferrin from infected clinical samples. An electrochemical biosensor array with alkanethiolate self-assembled monolayer (SAM) was used. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to characterize the mixed SAM, consisted of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and 6-mercapto-1-hexanol. A sandwich amperometric immunoassay was developed for detection of lactoferrin from urine, with a detection limit of 145 pg/ml. We validated lactoferrin as a biomarker of pyuria (presence of white blood cells in urine), an important hallmark of UTI, in 111 patient-derived urine samples. Finally, we demonstrated multiplex detection of urinary pathogens and lactoferrin through simultaneous detection of bacterial nucleic acid (16S rRNA) and host immune-response protein (lactoferrin) on a single sensor array. Our results represent first integrated sensor platform capable of quantitative pathogen identification and measurement of host immune response, potentially providing clinical diagnosis that is not only more expeditious but more informative than the current standard.",

While E. coli is the most common pathogen, UTI can also be caused by a variety of other pathogens, including Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus. Similar to majority of other bacterial infections, diagnosis of UTI depends on bacterial culture, which has a significant time delay. One of the shortcomings of standard UTI diagnosis is that it does not define the infection severity, which would be helpful to guide antibiotic treatment. For example, the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, lower urinary tract (i.e. bladder) infection, and upper urinary tract (i.e. kidney) infection are significantly different, ranging from no treatment, 3 days of antibiotics, to 7\u201314 days of antibiotics, respectively (Schaeffer and Schaeffer 2007). A diagnostic platform capable of rapid determination of infection severity, therefore, would be of great clinical importance.",

Due to their excellent sensitivity, ease of miniaturization, and low-cost, electrochemical biosensors are well suited for point-of-care applications. A useful strategy to modify the sensor surface is self-assembled monolayer (SAM) (Baldrich et al. 2008; Ulman 1996; Wink et al. 1997). Consisted of regularly oriented, single layer of bifunctional organic molecules, SAM is thought to block adsorption of nonspecific molecules to the sensor surface and thereby improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SAM can be either homogeneous or mixed, and tailored with different terminal functional groups to detect a wide variety of target molecules. While SAM-based electrochemical biosensors have been well described, they have primarily focused on detection of synthetic targets and purified samples (Chaki and Vijayamohanan 2002). A potential advantage of SAM-based electrochemical biosensors is the reduction of matrix effects\u2014particularly in clinical samples\u2014on overall detection SNR, although this not well characterized (Chiu et al. 2010 (in press)).",

The detection strategy is consisted of sandwich hybridization between a pair of short DNA capture and detector probes to bacterial 16S rRNA, followed by signal amplification with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The biosensor assay can deliver sample-to-answer within 1 hour, a marked improvement from the 2\u20133 days required for standard bacterial culture. Similar to bacterial culture, however, the biosensor assay does not provide information regarding infection severity to better guide treatment.

We hypothesize that urinary lactoferrin (LTF), a 80 kDa iron-binding protein secreted by polymorphonuclear white blood cells (WBC), is a useful target for electrochemical immunoassay development as well as a predictive UTI biomarker as the average concentration of LTF was found to be 30.4 ng/ml in health urine and 3,300 ng/ml in infected urines (Arao et al. 1999; Farnaud and Evans 2003; Ward et al. 2005). We determined the optimal SAM configuration and capture/detector antibody combination to maximize the amperometric signal while avoiding non-specific bindings. This was followed by analytical and clinical validation of LTF detection to determine the limit of detection (LOD) and assay compatibility in a large number of clinical samples. We correlated urinary LTF level to the presence of WBC in urine (pyuria)\u2014an important hallmark of UTI. Finally, we demonstrated pilot multiplex detection of urinary pathogens and LTF in clinical samples through simultaneous nucleic acid (i.e. 16S rRNA) and protein (i.e. LTF) assay on a single sensor array.

For each patient sample, one aliquot was brought to our laboratory and one was sent to the clinical laboratory for urinalysis (microscopy and dipstick) and urine culture. Urine microscopy provides information including the degree of pyuria by quantifying the number of white blood cells per high power field (WBC/HPF). Urine dipstick analysis includes pH, specific gravity, leukocyte esterase, and presence of nitrite. Urine culture provides bacterial identification and concentration reported as colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml). Samples were received in our laboratory within 2 hours of collection, divided into 1 ml aliquots, and transferred to a \u221280\u00b0C freezer for storage.

The SAM layer is considered as a capacitive element and a resistive element in parallel. The resistive element typically has a large value and the impedance is dominated by the buffer conductivity at high frequency. At an intermediate frequency, higher impedance for the MUDA chip indicated a smaller capacitance for the MUDA coating, which has a larger thickness. The electrochemical impedance spectra at low frequency data indicated that the space coating had a low resistance value, which can potentially increase the signal level of the sensor (Anandan et al. 2009). This is supported by the amperometric data, which shows the amperometric readout of the two different SAM conjugated to biotin followed by serial dilution of streptavidin-peroxidase. The MUDA:MHOH chips yielded signals 4-fold higher over 4-logs. Based on the impedance analysis and the amperometric data, SAM based on mixed MUDA-MHOH was selected for LTF immunoassay development.",

For the LTF assay, we compared two different methods to immobilize the capture antibody: direct covalent (Au-SAM-biotinylated-pAb) or indirect (Au-SAM-biotin-SA-biotinylated-pAb). Figure 1C shows there were minimal differences between the direct and indirect method. Since our nucleic acid detection is based on the indirect method of immobilizing the capture DNA probes, the indirect method is chosen for the LTF assay development to facilitate the surface functionalization steps for integration of the two assays. Lastly, we examined optimal capture Ab concentration (0.1 to 40 \u03bcg/ml) and incubation time (1 to 4 hours) on the sensor surface. Capture Ab concentrations of 5 \u03bcg/ml with 1 hour incubation were found to be optimal (data not shown).",

Pyuria, or the presence of WBC\u2019s in urine, has long been established as a UTI marker (Antwi et al. 2008; Hiraoka et al. 1995). As one of the proteins secreted by the WBC\u2019s, LTF has antimicrobial properties and competes with pathogens for scavenging of iron, which is important for pathogen survival (Farnaud and Evans 2003; Ward et al. 2005). Pyuria is typically determined by urine microscopy and reported as the number of WBC\u2019s per high power field (WBC/HPF), which requires an experienced laboratory technician counting the WBC under the microscope using the 40X objective. Pyuria may also be indirectly determined as part of the urine dipstick to measure the enzymatic activity of another WBC-derived protein, leukocyte esterase (LE). When the dipstick containing the enzymatic substrate of LE is in contact with urine containing WBC, a colorimetric change results (reported as None, 1+, 2+, 3+), which corresponds to the degree of pyuria.",

We examined the feasibility of immobilizing both capture DNA probes and antibody against bacterial 16S rRNA and host LTF, respectively, on the same sensor array. Figure 4 shows 1 of 5 integrated pathogen and LTF assays conducted using an urine sample suspected to be infected. The simultaneous assay identified E. coli (signals in EC probe and positive control probes EB and UNI) and 1208 ng/ml of LTF in the urine. The entire assay was completed on a single sensor array within 2 hours of receiving the urine sample, providing both the pathogen identification based on 16S rRNA as well as the LTF level, a significant improvement over the standard 2-day requirement for the clinical laboratory to perform urine culture. Based on these promising results, we anticipate starting a larger prospective clinical study to evaluate UTI diagnosis and severity assessment using the combined assay.",

While urine microscopy and dipstick analyses are relatively fast and inexpensive, their disadvantages include imprecision, inter-operator variations, and lack of multiplex capability. To add ELISA to measure urinary biomarkers would result in 4 different tests for a single urine sample (i.e., microscopy, dipstick, culture, and ELISA). Additional barriers include absence of validated biomarkers and a flexible diagnostic platform in which the biomarkers, once validated, can be easily integrated. Our sensor platform offers an attractive approach to incorporate urinary biomarker detection as part of UTI diagnosis. The multiplex capability to perform simultaneous assays on a single detection platform will facilitate the integration of automated sample preparation with microfluidic technology which we are currently investigating. Furthermore, as additional biomarkers (nucleic acids or protein) are identified and validated (Nanda and Juthani-Mehta 2009; Zaki Mel 2008), they can be readily integrated into our sensor platform. Our findings represent an important step toward a comprehensive point-of-care biosensor platform that includes quantitative pathogen identification and measurement of host immune response.",

Clinical validation of LTF detection was performed in 111 patient-derived urine samples, which correlated with pyuria, an important hallmark of UTI. We further demonstrated in pilot experiments multiplex detection of both bacterial-specific nucleic acids (16S rRNA) and host immune response protein (LTF) on a single array. Our detection platform has the potential to deliver diagnostic information not only more expeditiously but more informative than the current standard.",
