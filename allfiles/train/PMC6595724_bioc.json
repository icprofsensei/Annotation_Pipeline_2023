With the continuous development of genetic technology, the role of gut microbiota in a variety of diseases has attracted great attention in the past few years.[8] Previous studies have shown that the diversity and composition of gut microbiota play important pathophysiological roles in cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis.[9] The main mechanisms for these diseases involve vasomotor dysfunction caused by a variety of neurological and humoral factors,[10] which exhibit some similarities to the pathogenesis of VVS. Many precursor symptoms of VVS are often accompanied by gastrointestinal disorders manifested as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. These abdominal symptoms were previously thought to be related to autonomic dysfunction. Therefore, we hypothesized that gut microbiota might be involved in the mechanisms for VVS. However, the role of gut microbiota in VVS has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to explore the change and significance of gut microbiota in VVS of children.",

Alpha diversity was applied to analyze the complexity of the species diversity in each sample based on six indexes: the observed-species, Chao1, ACE, Shannon, Simpson, and Good's coverage indexes. These indexes were used to evaluate the uniformity and richness of each sample.[12] A beta diversity analysis was used to evaluate differences in the species complexity between samples based on diversity-weighted UniFrac.[13] Rarefaction curves and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were displayed using R software (v2.15.3). Differences in beta diversity between the two groups were tested based on the UniFrac distance using Anosim, which was used to examine whether the differences between groups were significantly greater than the differences within groups; this algorithm was included in the R vegan package. The specific bacterial taxa differentiating the two groups were characterized using the LEfSe method, which emphasized statistical significance and biological relevance. An effect size threshold of 4 was used for the biomarkers in the two groups. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant for all tests.",

With the development of genetic techniques, advances in the microbiome have suggested a relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and cardiovascular disease. Complex mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and include vasomotor dysfunction caused by a variety of neurohumoral regulatory processes, which exhibit similarities to the pathogenesis of VVS. Clinically, we found VVS children often had concomitant abdominal pain, nausea, and other gastrointestinal discomforts as a prodromal symptom, which was previously thought to be related to autonomic regulation. However, the role of gut microbiota in VVS has not been investigated. Therefore, we determined the difference between the gut microbiota of VVS children and that of healthy children and then explored its significance in the development of the disease.",

These results suggested that Ruminococcaceae might be associated with anxiety. Emotional disorders including anxiety are common triggers of VVS, and recurrent syncope may also result in increased anxiety. In our study, we found a positive correlation between the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae and syncopal frequency. However, whether the increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae is a cause or an effect of the increasing frequency of syncope remains unknown.",

SCFA are final products of complex carbohydrates that are cleaved by intestinal microbiota.[18] SCFA can enter the bloodstream under the actions of anaerobic bacteria and participate in various metabolic processes such as affecting the energy supply, regulating immune responses and suppressing inflammatory cytokine production. These processes serve as protective measures against many chronic diseases.[19] During the past years, studies have shown that butyrate and acetate can improve hypertension[20] and that the specific mechanism might be related to angiotensin II (AngII). Kim et al[21] found that the blood pressure of mice injected with AngII and butyrate was significantly lower than that of mice injected with AngII alone, and the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in the intestinal tracts of the mice injected with AngII was significantly reduced. To further investigate the mechanism, Wang et al[22] injected AngII into unilaterally nephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats and divided them into an experimental group with injected butyrate and an untreated control group. The authors found that the elevated blood pressure induced by AngII was significantly suppressed and that renal injury and inflammation were improved in the butyrate-injected Sprague-Dawley rats, the mechanism of which was related to renin receptor regulation. These studies suggested that SCFA could decrease blood pressure and that the mechanism might be related to the regulation of RAS, which was similar to the pathogenesis of VVS. Therefore, we speculated that the higher the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae and the higher its metabolite concentrations, namely SCFA, the more obvious the effects of vasodilation and blood pressure drop would be. This was consistent with our findings.",

Previous studies have shown that SCFA can reduce insulin resistance in obese patients[28] and that among healthy people the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae is higher in low-BMI subjects than in high-BMI subjects,[29] consistent with previous findings showing that VVS is more likely to occur in low-BMI cohorts.[30]",

The predominant bacteria in the gut microbiota composition of the VVS group was Ruminococcaceae. A correlation exists between gut Ruminococcaceae and clinical syncopal frequency and hemodynamics. The results suggest that the disturbed gut microbiota may be involved in the development of VVS. Future studies should include further investigation into the pathogenesis of VVS and implementation of new methodologies for assessing VVS.",
