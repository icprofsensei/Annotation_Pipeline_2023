The human oral cavity contains a poorly explored reservoir of these genes. Here we analyse and compare the resistome profiles of 788 oral cavities worldwide with paired stool metagenomes. We find country and body site-specific differences in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes, classes and mechanisms in oral and stool samples. Within individuals, the highest abundances of antimicrobial resistance genes are found in the oral cavity, but the oral cavity contains a lower diversity of resistance genes compared to the gut. Additionally, co-occurrence analysis shows contrasting ARG-species associations between saliva and stool samples. Maintenance and persistence of antimicrobial resistance is likely to vary across different body sites. Thus, we highlight the importance of characterising the resistome across body sites to uncover the antimicrobial resistance potential in the human body.",

Given this rapidly developing global crisis, it is imperative that the current gaps in our understanding of the distribution, spread and associations of all AMR factors are filled. AMR is most often conferred through the expression of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) that reduce a microbe\u2019s susceptibility to the effects of an antimicrobial compound. As such, monitoring the abundance and diversity of these ARG profiles, or the resistome, has huge potential to increase our understanding of the spread and persistence of AMR within a population. High-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies are beginning to be used as tools for screening ARGs for potential surveillance of antimicrobial resistance worldwide. Shotgun metagenomic data mapped against dedicated ARG reference databases are providing a wealth of insight into the resistomes of human2\u20137 and animal guts8,9, as well as the wider environment10\u201313. However, no large studies have, to date, attempted to characterise the resistome profiles of the human oral cavity. Commensal microbes from the oral cavity harbouring ARGs have potential to lead to antimicrobial resistant infections at other body sites. For example, \u03b2-lactam, clindamycin and erythromycin resistant strains of oral streptococci have caused infections at distal body sites such as infective endocarditis14.",

The presence of an oral resistome containing aminoglycoside, \u03b2-lactam, macrolide, phenicol and tetracycline ARGs in isolated Amerindian communities and ancient humans, indicates that the presence of these genes is not dependent on antibiotic exposure and is an inherent feature of the oral microbiome17,18.",

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has been documented as an important mechanism for the transfer and acquisition of ARGs within and between oral bacterial species19,20. The erythromycin resistance mefA and mefE genes have been found on the MEGA mobile genetic element associated with Tn916-like conjugative transposons (also called integrative conjugative elements ICE), and this has been implicated in conjugative transfer between viridans group streptococci (VGS) and other streptococci21.

The percentages of saliva samples that contain at least one ARG for each class and mechanism from these cohorts were evaluated.

All or almost all saliva samples from every cohort contain cephamycin, fluoroquinolone, lincosamide, macrolide, streptogramin and tetracycline ARGs, and a high percentage (above 50%) of saliva samples from all cohorts contain pleuromutilin ARGs.

A meta-analysis strategy was implemented to combine results from all regions. Stool samples are enriched with more ARGs compared with oral samples, but oral samples have enriched ARGs of highest and lowest abundances compared with stool samples across all regions (Fig.\u00a03c; Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). macB, OXA-85 and tetA(60) ARGs in dental plaque have the highest log fold changes (20.8, 21.0 and 21.1, respectively), whilst patB and RlmA(II) in plaque, and RlmA(II) in saliva, have the lowest log fold changes (2.9, 2.6 and 2.3, respectively) compared with stool samples (Fig.\u00a03c). Highest log fold changes are seen in cmlA6, Lactobacillus reuteri cat-TC, macB, TEM-1 and tet32 from saliva (20.6, 20.5,19.8, 20.5 and 20.5, respectively), and cmlA6, macB, OXA-85, pmrA, tetA(60) and tet(G) from dental plaque (20.8, 20.6, 20.7, 20.7, 20.8 and 20.8, respectively) compared with stool samples in China that are not enriched across all cohorts (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). As well as differences between the oral and gut, differentially abundant ARGs were found between different sites in the oral cavity (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). For example, between the US dorsum of tongue and plaque samples, and between the US dorsum of tongue and buccal mucosa, all ARGs are enriched in the dorsum of the tongue. Similarly, between dental plaque and buccal mucosa, all ARGs are enriched in dental plaque. Most of these ARGs confer resistance to cephamycin, fluoroquinolone, MLS (macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin) and tetracycline antibiotics. From China, there are more significantly abundant ARGs in saliva than plaque with resistance to aminoglycoside, cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone (pmrA and patB), lincosamides, macrolides (macB and mefA ARGs), MLS (in particular to the Erm 235 ribosomal RNA methyltransferase family) and tetracycline antibiotics. Overall, stool samples are enriched with more alternative ARGs and ARG classes compared with oral samples, but with the highest and lowest enrichments of individual ARGs originating from oral samples.",

Although there are no significant difference between saliva and stool samples from Fiji and Western Europe, both Chinese and USA samples have significant differences in ARG richness. China and USA stool samples have a significantly higher ARG richness than paired China plaque and saliva, and paired USA plaque and buccal mucosa (Mann\u2013Whitney, paired, two-sided t test, p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a04). In contrast, the USA dorsum of tongue contains a significantly higher ARG richness than USA stool. Between oral sites, Chinese saliva has a greater ARG richness than paired dental plaque (Mann\u2013Whitney, paired, two-sided t test, p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, USA dorsum of tongue has a higher ARG richness than both plaque and buccal mucosa, whilst plaque has a greater ARG richness than buccal mucosa (Mann\u2013Whitney, paired, two-sided t test, p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). It is important to note that while ARG richness only measures the gene incidence regardless of expression, multiple ARGs have the potential to be involved in the expression of a single efflux-pump complex, meaning ARG richness may overestimate this potential expression. Therefore, to determine the impact of this overestimation, the analysis was repeated to exclude ARGs that regulate or are part of an efflux pump complex. The differences in ARG richness have the same significance across all paired samples and countries (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08).",

Only significant correlations are found in saliva and stool from China, and saliva from the Philippines. The CfxA beta-lactamase family, RlmA(II), tetQ, tetA(46), pgpB, patB and pmrA ARGs are all strongly correlated with specific species found in both countries (Fig.\u00a05a, b). The strongest co-occurrence can be found in saliva samples from China between APH(3\u2019)-Ia and a Komagataella pastoris strain, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, whilst pgpB correlates with Porphyromonas gingivalis. The highly abundant ARG RlmA(II) in Chinese saliva is associated with Gemella haemolysans, Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus mitis/oralis/pneumoniae. In contrast to saliva, there are fewer species associated with a greater number of ARGs in stool samples from China. E. coli in Chinese stool samples is co-associated with many ARGs that encode multidrug efflux pumps and ARGs from E. coli, including ampC beta-lactamase, acrA and mdfA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). Thus, this analysis has the potential to be a predictive tool of ARG origin in metagenomes. However, it can only be applied where an ARG or taxon is found in a high proportion (in this case, at least half) of the samples to ensure Spearman\u2019s correlation does not falsely rank many zero values.",

The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled us to analyse resistomes throughout a microbiome. In this study, we provide key insights into the resistomes of different intraoral sites from healthy individuals across diverse geographical locations and compare their composition to paired gut resistomes. At a population level, there are both country and body site-specific differences in the prevalence of ARGs, ARG classes and resistance mechanisms.. It is possible that differences in extraction protocols and batch effects may have a greater bias towards some ARGs over others. Therefore, we do not make direct statistical comparisons between cohorts. For China, the Philippines, USA and Western Europe, the abundance of ARG classes does not correlate with antibiotic prescription rates. A possible reason is for this is the prescription data does not include over-the-counter antimicrobial use, which is especially prevalent in China and the Philippines, and thus may underestimate antimicrobial use32,33. In addition, antibiotics are widely used in husbandry and the fishing industry with poorly understood impacts on AMR incidence and dynamics in humans34\u201336. Prescription levels for a particular antibiotic are unlikely to be of significant value in the surveillance of AMR in the regional community. Instead, determining the population resistome would be more informative37.",

Although, there are significantly more distinct ARGs in stool compared with oral samples, those ARGs present at the highest relative abundances exist in oral samples. There are several potential reasons why this may be. It is notable that many sites in the oral cavity (e.g., plaque and tongue dorsum) host highly complex and robust microbial biofilm structures. It has been posited that the compact structure of microbes within oral biofilms is a conducive environment for the aquistion of ARGs and their HGT within biofilms38. Likewise, the generally protective nature of biofilms against antimicrobial drugs may favour ARG acquisition. It is notable that the dorsum of tongue contains a higher diversity of these genes than other oral sites. This may be explained by the unique papillary structure on the dorsum of the tongue which acts as complex microbiological niche favouring the deposition of oral debris and microbes39, thus giving rise to a richer microbial community with potentially greater numbers of transient microbes. Another reason could be the difference in species resident in the gut compared with the oral cavity. E. coli strains in Chinese stool samples are predicted to contain a variety of ARGs, especially of the multidrug class, whereas species found in Chinese saliva were estimated to contain fewer ARGs. Due to stringent constraints of the correlation analysis, however, it was not possible to predict the origins for ARGs for all cohorts.",

Pharmacokinetics of orally administered antibiotics suggests that the oral cavity and oesophagus would be only briefly exposed to the antibiotic during swallowing, whilst the gut is exposed over a more prolonged period. As antibiotics transit through the intestinal tract, they are gradually absorbed via the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream. Therefore, microbes in the gut exposed to antibiotics for a longer period of time due to their increased bioavailability will receive higher antibiotic selection pressures than those in the oral cavity40. The incidences where the oral cavity is likely to acquire ARGs from selective pressures of local antibiotics are from topical antibiotics for periodontal infections or orally administered antibiotics being absorbed into the bloodstream.",

Whilst the gut may be a diverse reservoir of ARGs, whether these genes are particularly prevalent or have the potential for expression sufficient to drive resistant infections at other body sites is not clear41. It is therefore imperative that to test potential applications of non-culture-based metagenomic AMR surveillance, we need to characterise the resistome at different body sites with different pharmacokinetic exposures to antimicrobials. This information can then be integrated with culture-based susceptibility tests, culturomics42 and functional metagenomic screens43 to determine the expression potential of these ARGs. In doing so, we will obtain a more complete picture of the state of AMR within a population.",
