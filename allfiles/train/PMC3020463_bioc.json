Thirty-eight patients were matched on the basis of clinical parameters into 19 pairs comprised of one U.S. and one United Kingdom patient. Analysis was performed to determine what, if any, bacterial correlates could be identified. Two culture-independent strategies were used: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling and 16S rRNA clone sequencing. Overall, 73 different terminal restriction fragment lengths were detected, ranging from 2 to 10 for U.S. and 2 to 15 for United Kingdom patients. The statistical analysis of T-RFLP data indicated that patient pairing was successful and revealed substantial transatlantic similarities in the bacterial communities. A small number of bands was present in the vast majority of patients in both locations, indicating that these are species common to the CF lung. Clone sequence analysis also revealed that a number of species not traditionally associated with the CF lung were present in both sample groups. The species number per sample was similar, but differences in species presence were observed between sample groups. Cluster analysis revealed geographical differences in bacterial presence and relative species abundance. Overall, the U.S. samples showed tighter clustering with each other compared to that of United Kingdom samples, which may reflect the lower diversity detected in the U.S. sample group. The impact of cross-infection and biogeography is considered, and the implications for treating CF lung infections also are discussed.",

Due to the altered lung physiology, CF patients suffer chronic bacterial lung infections (25). The host immune response to these infections leads to an irreversible loss of lung function, with 85 to 95% of CF patients ultimately succumbing to respiratory failure (11, 20, 25, 34). Therefore, gaining a better understanding of the characteristics and dynamics of these infections is of the greatest importance.",

Conventional diagnostic microbiology focuses on the detection of a limited group of species, including those listed above (16). However, more recent studies have indicated that the range of bacterial species harbored in sputa from adult CF patients is much wider (28, 29, 31). These findings emerged through the application of culture-independent analytical strategies that detect bacterial species signatures in nucleic acids extracted directly from clinical samples. In particular, the combination of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling and 16S rRNA clone sequence analysis has revealed the widespread presence of anaerobic bacterial species within the lower CF airways (15, 29).",

Patients were grouped in pairs, with one United Kingdom and one U.S. patient matched on parameters considered clinically relevant. The analysis of these data showed that, both in terms of species presence/absence as well as the relative prevalence of species in the lung, no clear transatlantic divide could be defined between bacterial communities.

After collection, samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to nucleic acid extraction. All nucleic acid extractions, as well as T-RFLP analysis, were carried out by one person in the laboratory in the United Kingdom. Clone sequence analysis was performed on these same nucleic acid extracts by one person in the United States. Patient age, sex, lung disease severity, CFTR genotype, body mass index (BMI), and antibiotic therapy details relating to these samples are shown in Table \u200bTable11 . Patients recruited to this study represented a random cross-section of CF patients. All were between 18 and 47 years old, with 12 females and 7 males per group. Enrolled patients from the United Kingdom and United States were paired according to age, gender, and lung obstruction category (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1%] predicted), as assessed clinically (Table \u200b(Table1).1). An age difference of less than 10 years together with a difference of 15% or less in FEV1% predicted but in the same lung obstruction category (i.e., normal, mild, moderate, severe) was considered acceptable. Mean age difference was 5.4 years (standard deviation [SD], 4.1) and mean difference in FEV1% predicted was 10.1% (SD, 7.7%). Exceptions where only one parameter could be matched acceptably where UK/US1, UK/US3, UK/US4, and UK/US9, with an age difference and difference in FEV1% predicted of 8 years and 30%, 7 years and 18%, 17 years, and 2% and 9 years and 20%, respectively. Additional criteria, such as distance to hospital, were recorded. Patients were clinically stable at the time of sampling (at least 21 days had passed before or after a treatment for pulmonary exacerbation), with eight exceptions (U.S. patients 4 and 19 and United Kingdom patient 19, who were receiving intravenous [i.v.] antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbation; U.S. patient 2, United Kingdom patient 2, and United Kingdom patient 4, who had finished i.v. antibiotics 12, 14, and 13 days previously, respectively; and U.S. patients 7 and 17, who were clinically stable but were receiving antibiotic therapy for reasons other than pulmonary exacerbation).

One hundred microliters of culture was saved as a glycerol stock, and the remaining 1.9 ml of culture was centrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g for 10 min. Supernatants were removed and plasmid DNA isolated from the bacterial pellet with the Wizard SV 96 plasmid purification system (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wisconsin). The quality of resulting cloned 16S rRNA gene fragments containing plasmid DNA was assessed by TAE-agarose gel electrophoresis.

To reduce bin complexity, bins containing three or more sequences were aligned using the Greengenes alignment tool (http://greengenes.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/nph-NAST_align.cgi) using a batch size of 100, a minimum length of 100, and a minimum percent identity of 75%. The bins of three or more aligned sequences were transferred to ClustalX v2.0.12 (Conway Institute, UCD, Dublin, Ireland), and a multiple alignment was carried out with an output in the form of a phylogenetic tree. For each bin, the longest most-similar branch was chosen as the representative sequence, labeled to represent the number of sequences it contained (at 100 and 98% sequence identity), and the remaining sequences removed. Overall, this reduced sequence complexity from 871 to 136. To construct the phylogenetic tree for all patients, these 136 binned sequences were put into the Greengenes alignment tool and ClustalX as described above, together with the sequences of type strains that all sequences were most similar to, including CF pathogens, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with the same parameters as those described above.

Samples for this analysis were chosen on the basis of T-RFLP results to include two patients from each group with high diversity (at least 10 different T-RF band lengths), one patient with low diversity (5 or fewer bands), and two patients for which the band at 155 bases, consistent with P. aeruginosa, was not detected. Clone sequence analysis showed that clones clustered with 30 different typed strains. These typed strains were used to name the clusters of the phylogenetic tree constructed (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1,1, Table \u200bTable2)2) and here will be referred to as species. A wide range of species was identified from 22 different genera. These included one species, Phenylobacterium koreense, which had not previously been associated with the CF lung, as well as six species (20%) of obligate anaerobes. Overall, 9 genera of 22 were detected in both patient groups (Table \u200b(Table2,2, Fig. \u200bFig.1).1). Individual species within eight bacterial genera detected, namely, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Staphylococcus, Parvimonas, and Neisseria, as well as two genera of the obligate anaerobes Prevotella and Veillonella, were present in at least one individual from both the United Kingdom and United States as analyzed by this approach (Table \u200b(Table2,2, Fig. \u200bFig.1).1). In the United Kingdom patient group, the most abundantly identified clones were P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia (31% each), and in the U.S. patient group they were P. aeruginosa (30%) and S. aureus (33%). Overall, 12 (40%) species were found for the United Kingdom patient group alone, 7 (23%) species were found for the U.S. patient group alone, and 11 (37%) species occurred in both patient groups (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1,1, Table \u200bTable2).2). Type strain clusters that comprised four or more unique sequences all contained sequences from both United Kingdom and U.S. patients, with the exceptions of Phenylobacterium koreense and S. maltophilia, which both were detected in the United Kingdom patient group only (Table \u200b(Table2,2, Fig. \u200bFig.11).",

The two largest sets (band lengths of 155 and 565 bases) contained high numbers of both U.S. and United Kingdom patients. In total, this represented 79% of both patient groups. Overall, all four of the most commonly detected band lengths were found in at least one patient from each geographical group.

Patients in the two countries were paired prior to microbiological assessment according to clinical parameters. Two culture-independent, molecular strategies were used to analyze sample pairs, T-RFLP profiling and 16S rRNA clone sequence analysis. Both relied on the PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene from DNA extracted directly from bacteria in the sputum samples collected. These approaches have been used previously to characterize the communities of bacteria in the adult CF lung (3, 15, 28-32, 35, 36). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of such techniques to assess the impact of geographical location on bacterial community composition in CF respiratory samples.",

No marked difference was identified in the mean number of species per sample for the United Kingdom or U.S. patient group. While no comparable studies could be identified in the literature, the mean number of species obtained here was lower than that in earlier studies of stable adult CF patients (29, 30, 36), with this difference accounted for by the selection of a higher detection threshold. Statistical assessment showed a modest significant correlation in species number in relation to the patient pairs. As such, the number of species per sample did not provide evidence for a geographical difference in samples from the United Kingdom or U.S.",

Species traditionally associated with the CF lung, e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1), as well as a number of species previously detected in CF samples primarily by culture-independent means, were identified here (15, 28, 29, 36), including one species that had not previously been reported in the context of CF, Phenylobacterium koreense. Eleven (37%) of the species, identified within the genera Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Staphylococcus, Parvimonas, Neisseria, Prevotella, and Veillonella, were common to both the United Kingdom and U.S. patient group. Interestingly, species from within the latter two genera require anaerobic conditions for growth. Anaerobes previously have been detected in CF sputum (3, 15, 29, 37), nonetheless it was striking that even in geographically distinct locations, similar lung physiological conditions were reflected in the species present. However, the majority of species were uniquely found in one geographical location, suggesting a strong local dominance in their biogeography.",

Here, a large number of sample pairs with nonsignificant values (0.05 > SRC < 0.95) would indicate stochastic dispersal, while a large number of significant SRC values would indicate a structuring influence, such as niche selection. The paired patients from the United States and United Kingdom showed little tendency to cluster on the basis of community composition, with evidence of this in only ca. 25% of patient pairs. In patient groups from either of the two geographic regions, where no attempt was made to pair on clinical grounds, U.S. patients had communities that clustered to a greater degree (ca. 40%) than U.S.-United Kingdom pairs, whereas United Kingdom patients showed a lower degree of significant clustering (ca. 15%). This suggests that the pairing had only a limited impact on the community findings of this aspect of the study. The reason that the United Kingdom samples as well as the United Kingdom-U.S. matches differed so much in terms of this analysis is not clear, although possible explanations may rest in the differential treatments, exposure to different microbes, or factors that were not assessed. It also is possible that the lower diversity in U.S. samples, as confirmed within the detection limit of this study, allows for the tighter grouping of these samples.",

Two distinct clusters of exclusively United Kingdom patients (comprised of 4 and 6 patients, respectively) were formed with a third cluster of 11 U.S. and 1 United Kingdom patient. Further, when average Morisita index values for United Kingdom, U.S., and paired United Kingdom-U.S. patient groups were examined, U.S. samples again showed a greater level of similarity.

This focus on single species made it difficult to carry out a full comparative analysis with the findings here. In our study, bacterial species found to be common to both geographical patient groups included both known CF pathogens, such as P. aeruginosa, and those species not traditionally associated with CF lung infections, such as members of the genus Prevotella. However, the analysis of larger patient groups will be required to better characterize the geographic distribution of these species that were commonly detected here but as yet are not recognized as CF pathogens.",

A number of such species were detected in the samples analyzed here; however, whether these are derived from the wider environment, the immediate treatment environment, or directly from other CF patients is not known. While some such species were detected in both United Kingdom and U.S. patient groups, others showed an uneven geographic distribution. This distribution may be related to differences in the treatment regimes between the two centers or environmental and biogeographical factors. Again, a wider study of this topic is warranted to determine the likely origin of the differences under the condition of patients attending different CF centers (23).",

Species numbers per sample were similar in the two sites, but differences in terms of species identities were detected, as could be confirmed by the detection limit here. Despite this, the four most frequently detected T-RF bands were present in 80% of all patients, suggesting that certain species are common to the CF lung on both continents. Overall, the U.S. samples showed a stronger association with each other than the United Kingdom samples, which may reflect the lower diversity detected in U.S. samples. Geographical differences were identified in species composition and more strongly in species prevalence in samples taken from patients attending the two CF centers. Overall, it is clear that the bacteriology of the CF lung is complex. Given the importance of lung function to CF patient health, it is by extension important to be able to understand this complexity as the first step in advancing therapy for these patients.",
