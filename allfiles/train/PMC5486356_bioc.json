Today, although benchtop sequencers are considered to be accurate platforms to deliver data for targeted metagenomics studies, the limiting factor has become the analysis of these data. In a previous paper, we performed an Ion Torrent PGM 16S rDNA gene sequencing of faecal DNAs from 48 Blastocystis-colonized patients and 48 Blastocystis-negative subjects, in order to decipher the impact of this widespread protist on gut microbiota composition and diversity. We report here on the Ion Torrent targeted metagenomic sequencing and analysis of these 96 human faecal samples, and the complete datasets from raw to analysed data. We also provide the key steps of the bioinformatic analyses, from library preparation to data filtering and OTUs tables generation. This data represents a valuable resource for the scientific community, enabling re-processing of these targeted metagenomic datasets through various pipelines and a comparative evaluation of microbiota analysis methods.",

For example, it has allowed deeper insight into the critical role played by the community of microorganisms inhabiting our gastrointestinal tract in determining human health and disease. From a technological viewpoint, shotgun metagenomics still remains very expensive, and data analysis remains a challenging issue, due to both the size and complex structure of the data1. Thanks to the recent benchtop sequencer releases (Ion Torrent and MiSeq technologies), targeted metagenomics that focuses only on an informative genomic marker like 16S rDNA, has become widespread in microbiology studies, and is commonly used today to assess the gut microbiota.",
