                    "text": "Successful treatment of adolescent/young adult Hodgkin lymphoma (AYAHL) has enabled investigation of the pathogenesis and consequences of this disease. Adolescent/young adult Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with reduced exposures to infections, including small sibship size, less crowded living conditions, and higher socioeconomic status (Westergaard et al, 1997). Similarly, a previous study of AYAHL survivors suggested fewer early childhood fecal-oral exposures compared with unaffected co-twin controls (Cozen et al, 2009). Adolescent/young adult Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with suppressed T-helper 1 (Th1) immunity, a hyper-inflammatory Th2 response, and persistent immune defects (Fisher et al, 1980; Poppema, 1996; Salas et al, 2012). Colonisation, expansion, and maturation of gut microbial populations during infancy (Dominguez-Bello et al, 2010; Koenig et al, 2011) coincide with a switch from a fetal Th2-dominated to a mature Th1-dominated immune profile (Matricardi and Bonini, 2000; Martin et al, 2010). Elevated levels of IgE and Th2 cytokines in AYAHL patients, as well as deficits of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells in Hodgkin lymphoma tumours (Romagnani et al, 1980; Samoszuk, 1992; Skinnider and Mak, 2002; Poppema, 2005), suggest a failure to make this early Th2-to-Th1 switch. These observations raise the possibility that the gut microbiota, which strongly influences adaptive and innate immunity (Blumberg and Powrie, 2012; Hooper et al, 2012), may impact AYAHL. Thus, the current study employed next generation sequencing of fecal microbial DNA to test whether gut microbial diversity or taxonomy differed between AYAHL survivors and unaffected co-twin controls.",

Briefly, subjects were AYAHL-discordant twin pairs participating in the International Twin Study (Mack et al, 1995).

At least 1 member of 15 pairs either declined or was not able to be located, and 5 pairs were excluded for gastrointestinal illness or recent use of certain medications in at least 1 member, leaving 13 pairs. All 26 participants provided written informed consent and 1 fecal specimen. The majority of the HL survivors had nodular sclerosis subtype that was negative for Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Participants were provided with a kit that fits over the toilet seat for fecal specimen collection. Specimens were immediately frozen at \u221220\u00b0C, shipped overnight to University of Southern California, and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C after replacement of identifying information with a code number.

Cases and controls were compared on alpha diversity and body mass index by paired t-test (Freeman et al, 2007). Differences in microbial communities within vs between twin pairs (beta diversity) were tested with UniFrac (weighted and unweighted for relative abundance; Lozupone and Knight, 2005) and permutation tests with 1000 replications. Each time, the sum of the paired UniFrac distances across the 13 twin pairs was compared with the corresponding sum in 13 randomly paired sets of individuals.

These results need to be cautiously interpreted as the absolute differences were modest and other measurements of diversity, which adjust for OTU relative abundance, were not statistically significant. In our conservative analysis, restricted to the 19% most abundant OTUs, only the PD_whole tree estimate of alpha diversity was statistically significant. Deeper sequencing could shed light on rare taxa and whether they discriminate between affected and unaffected co-twins. Based on this study, we cannot determine whether lower diversity contributed to the immune perturbations that underlie AYAHL risk, or was merely a consequence of the disease and its treatment. Two small studies suggest that various chemotherapy regimens immediately reduce and alter the composition of the gut microbiota (van Vliet et al, 2009; Zwielehner et al, 2011). However, these observations were partially confounded by antibiotic use, and long-term studies are lacking. In our study, microbial diversity was assayed many years after the case twins' diagnoses; observed differences between discordant co-twins could have been permanently induced by the disease or its treatment, or have been present before the malignancy appeared.",

Consistent with previous twin studies (Turnbaugh et al, 2009; Yatsunenko et al, 2012), fecal microbial diversity was significantly more concordant within our twin pairs than between randomly paired individuals. Likewise, concordance in diversity was similar for mono- and dizygotic pairs, suggesting that human genetic polymorphisms have little influence on the overall bacterial phylogenetic structure of the fecal microbiota (Turnbaugh et al, 2009; Yatsunenko et al, 2012). Moreover, our findings suggest that changes during adulthood related to diet, transient illnesses or treatments, are too small to modify the relatively fixed effects of twin pairing and the propensity for or consequences of obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and, in our data, AYAHL (Turnbaugh et al, 2009; Willing et al, 2010).",

Specifically, invariant natural killer T cells, that can secrete Th2 cytokines, accumulate in germ-free mice affecting the pattern of colonisation with a gut microbiota from conventionally raised animals (Olszak et al, 2012). Neonatal rodents fail to develop a Th1 immune response on a sterile diet, but a Th1 response can be induced by feeding them bacterial extracts (Bowman and Holt, 2001; Hrncir et al, 2008). In humans, genetic polymorphism and functional studies suggest that a Th2-dominated profile is a risk factor for AYAHL (Cozen et al, 2008; Urayama et al, 2012).",

Thus, a statistically significant result could be due to chance. We excluded pairs in which either member had a gastrointestinal illness or had recently used a medication likely to affect the gut microbiota, thereby reducing confounding. These exclusions applied equally to the cases (HL survivors) and controls (unaffected co-twins) who were ascertained together as pairs, thus selection bias is unlikely. We noted that body mass index, which is a potential confounder (Turnbaugh et al, 2009), did not differ significantly between cases and controls. Second, we lacked specifics on treatment of the AYAHL, which might have helped to distinguish among the alternative hypotheses. Third, multiple fecal specimens per subject and deeper sequencing of each specimen would have been desirable to reduce misclassification of rare taxa and the potentially important fluctuations in the fecal microbiota over time (Turnbaugh et al, 2009; Caporaso et al, 2011; Wu et al, 2011; Consortium, 2012). Use of unaffected co-twins as controls is a strength, as it assured very tight matching on early life exposures that are related to AYAHL risk and establishment of the gut microbiota. Tight matching reduces the chance of a false-positive association.",
