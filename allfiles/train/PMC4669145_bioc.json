The aim of this study was to analyse the composition and the gene content of the microbial community in bronchial secretions of COPD patients in both stability and exacerbation. Taxonomic data were obtained by 16S rRNA gene amplification and pyrosequencing, and metabolic information through shotgun metagenomics, using the Metagenomics RAST server (MG-RAST), and the PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) programme, which predict metagenomes from 16S data. Eight severe COPD patients provided good quality sputum samples, and no significant differences in the relative abundance of any phyla and genera were found between stability and exacerbation. Bacterial biodiversity (Chao1 and Shannon indexes) did not show statistical differences and beta-diversity analysis (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index) showed a similar microbial composition in the two clinical situations. Four functional categories showed statistically significant differences with MG-RAST at KEGG level 2: in exacerbation, Cell growth and Death and Transport and Catabolism decreased in abundance [1.6 (0.2\u20132.3) vs 3.6 (3.3\u20136.9), p = 0.012; and 1.8 (0\u20133.3) vs 3.6 (1.8\u20135.1), p = 0.025 respectively], while Cancer and Carbohydrate Metabolism increased [0.8 (0\u20131.5) vs 0 (0\u20130.5), p = 0.043; and 7 (6.4\u20139) vs 5.9 (6.3\u20136.1), p = 0.012 respectively]. In conclusion, the bronchial microbiome as a whole is not significantly modified when exacerbation symptoms appear in severe COPD patients, but its functional metabolic capabilities show significant changes in several pathways.",

Culture-based procedures diagnose bacterial infection in ~50% of these episodes [2], Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most commonly identified pathogens [3]. Molecular culture-independent techniques have recently broadened our knowledge of the bacterial communities in the bronchial tree of COPD patients, both when the disease is stable and during exacerbations [4\u20136], but the role of most bacteria identified by these methods remains unknown, as do their interactions with the bronchial tree [4]. Recent studies have suggested that exacerbation patterns in COPD may be related to the bacterial microbiota as a whole and not just to a narrow range of well-known pathogenic bacteria, which are currently considered to be the cause of most of these acute episodes [4,7].",

However, this analysis provides no information on the metabolic activity and function of the bronchial microbiota [8], whose characterization may be approached by other techniques such as shotgun metagenomics. Millions of fragments of short DNA reads are created when this approach is used, and after de-replication and quality control, the fragments obtained may be mapped to databases of orthologous gene groups such as KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) [9] to identify matches to genes or proteins with previously described functions [10,11]. However, this approach depends on the isolation of sufficient quantities of bacterial DNA, and other method has recently been developed to investigate the functional profiles of the microbiota. PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) uses evolutionary modelling to predict metagenomes from 16S data and a reference genome database [12]. Though this approach has limitations, such as the fact that the software does not distinguish differences at strain level and cannot detect genes not included in the genomic database used [12,13], it is useful for detecting microbial function and its variability, when the quantity of bacterial DNA present is low [8].",

Patients in the cohort had scheduled visits every three months from their inclusion and unscheduled visits when exacerbations symptoms appeared, as described elsewhere [15]. Previous diagnosis of asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, cancer and chronic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs were exclusion criteria [6,17]. For the purposes of the study, patients were followed for one year after their baseline assessment, with follow-up visits which included sputum sampling and culture scheduled every three months, until the first unscheduled exacerbation visit. As previously described [6] acute episodes of increased dyspnoea, sputum production and/or purulence appearing during follow-up and treated with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids were considered as exacerbations [18,19]. Patients in the cohort were included in the study when they provided good quality sputum samples for culture from an exacerbation and from a previous stability visit 1\u20136 months before the acute episode. Participants should have not taken antibiotics between both samplings, and the amount of DNA extracted had to be sufficient for the proposed analyses [6].",

KEEG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway was used to identify metagenomic contents. For shotgun pyrosequenced data, sequences were first analysed with the MOTHUR software package 1.27 to remove sequences shorter than 100 bp. Then, reads were aligned with the Cluster Database at High Identity (cdhit-454) with a sequence identity cutoff of 1 [29]. The sequences were compared against the Small Subunit rRNA Reference Database (SSUrdb) with an e-value cutoff of 1e-10 and all sequences that remained unassigned as SSU rRNA were analysed with the Large Subunit rRNA Reference Database (LSUrdb) with an e-value cutoff of 1e-4 as described by Urich et al [30]. The remaining sequences were analysed with the MG-RAST pipeline version 3.3 [14]. MG-RAST is a data repository, an analysis pipeline and a comparative genomics environment which provides quality control, feature prediction and functional annotation [11]. Quality control of the sequences was done by using the default parameters of MG-RAST in length, ambiguous base and dereplication filtering.The metabolic potential of the microbiota was examined using KEGG with default parameters, maximum e-value of 10\u22125, minimum identity of 60%, and minimum alignment length of 15. Abundance profiles of functional annotations were obtained by both methods, and differences in the functional genomic content were evaluated after normalizing the abundances of each category to the total number of proteins predicted for each sample.

Bacterial diversity was assessed through the Chao1 estimator [31] and the Shannon index [32], calculating both indexes after subsampling with QIIME to avoid sequencing effort bias [6]. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index [33] were used to study community composition, assessing the statistical significance of the differences in sample groupings through Bray-Curtis distance matrices and Adonis testing. Functional categories and their relative abundance in exacerbation samples were compared with the stability reference using Wilcoxon test for paired data, and correlations between PICRUSt and MG-RAST data were assessed using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Statistical tests used in the study were two-sided, and a p value of 0.05 or less was reported as statistically significant [6].",

Sputum samples in stability and during a subsequent exacerbation were analysed in order to identify the changes both in the community composition and in its functional capacities, which may be associated with the appearance of acute impairments. Considering the group as a whole, no differences in the bronchial microbiota were found between stability and exacerbation samples, but clear functional differences were identified during exacerbations in the Carbohydrate Metabolism, Cancer, Cell Growth and Death and Transport and Catabolism categories in MG-RAST. PICRUSt prediction showed a good correlation with MG-RAST, but differences between the categories did not reach statistical significance when assessed using this predictor. These results suggest that the bronchial microbiota as a whole do not change significantly during COPD exacerbations, but the resident community modifies its metabolic functional patterns during exacerbations.",

These results agree with previous observations that have identified that increases in relative abundance during exacerbations are restricted to some genera, which may account for the appearance of acute symptoms [6]. Similarly, analysing the changes in the bacteria composition in serial samples obtained before, during and after an exacerbation in COPD patients, Huang et al. [7] found that the microbial composition as a whole did not show large changes in exacerbations. Likewise, in other respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, no differences in diversity and community composition were observed between samples obtained during stability and at the time of an exacerbation [34,35]. In our study, 16S rRNA analysis showed a high prevalence of two genera, Streptococcus and Haemophilus, in the bronchial microbiome of COPD patients, without statistical differences between stability and exacerbation. In other chronic respiratory diseases as cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, it has also been reported that a restricted number of taxa form the main part of the bronchial microbiota, while a wide range of taxa, which have low abundance in bronchial secretions, account for most of the bacterial community richness observed [34,36,37]. Overall, these observations suggest that the context of the microbial community as a whole may be important in order to understand the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbations.",

Although metagenomic analysis is not able to provide information on the end product expression profile of bacterial communities [38], it accurately describes the genomic potential of the community, which is reflected in the genes encoded into their genomes [8]. The PICRUSt programme may be used to predict the genomic content of the bacterial community through 16S phylogenetic information, which has been shown to be well correlated with the genomic content [12]. Although the use of this 16S-based phylogeny to infer function is cost-effective, it offers only an estimation [13]. Deep metagenomic sequencing, as well as metatranscriptomics, metabolomics and metaproteomics are required to characterize more accurately the microbiome function [12,13]. In our study, in agreement with previous results [12], the two techniques were correlated, but statistically significant results were only attained through MG-RAST, confirming the importance of this approach. The relationship between phylogeny and gene content is not perfect [39], and may be the cause of the lower strength in the PICRUSt analyses.",

In exacerbated COPD patients, Huang et al [7] also reported increases in various metabolic pathways involving viral and bacterial infection and apoptosis, and decreases in pathways associated with flavonoid and steroid biosynthesis and betalain and indole alkaloid production. Bacteria, then, have the ability to modify their functional pathways when the clinical situation of their host changes, without major modifications in the microbiota as a whole. From the results of our study it is not possible to determine whether the changes observed in the microbial function contribute to the appearance of symptoms or are only a consequence of the acute episodes. Similar changes in the functional capabilities of the regional microbiome have been found in patients with type 2 diabetes, who showed minimal alterations in their gut community composition but significant changes in functional annotations compared with healthy subjects, suggesting that functional alterations rather than changes in the abundance of specific microorganisms could be associated with the disease [40]. Likewise, in a study of patients suffering from hepatitis B liver cirrhosis, functional diversity was found to be significantly reduced in the fecal microbiota compared with healthy subjects [41].",

The modification in the carbohydrate metabolism pathway in exacerbation is probably due to the fact that the main energy sources for bacteria were carbohydrates, and may be related to the decrease found in the Transport and Catabolism pathway. Carbohydrates have the ability to minimize catabolism through carbohydrate-mediated catabolite repression [42], which has been shown to modulate virulence gene expression in many microorganisms [43\u201346] such as the genus Streptococcus. It does so through three major mechanisms: acquisition of crucial nutrients, adherence to eukaryotic cells and interference with the function of host immunity proteins [45]. Overall, these changes in the functions of the bronchial microbiome may indicate higher virulence and pathogenic capacity of bacteria in exacerbations.",

Thirdly, metagenomic shotgun sequencing is expensive and computationally intensive, which limits the number of samples analysed and the possibility of extrapolating the results obtained in these samples. Finally, quality control of the analyses performed is needed, because shotgun pyrosequencing is more difficult in samples which have low bacterial DNA content or contain mainly host DNA [12], as happens in sputum.
