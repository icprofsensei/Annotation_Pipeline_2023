While IBD has been associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut metabolome -- the molecular interface between host and microbiota -- are less-well understood. To address this gap, we performed untargeted LC-MS metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling of cross-sectional stool samples from discovery (n=155) and validation (n=65) cohorts of CD, UC, and non-IBD control subjects. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were broadly correlated with fecal calprotectin levels (a measure of gut inflammation). Across >8,000 measured metabolite features, we identified chemicals and chemical classes that were differentially abundant (DA) in IBD, including enrichments for sphingolipids and bile acids, and depletions for triacylglycerols and tetrapyrroles. While >50% of DA metabolite features were uncharacterized, many could be assigned putative roles through metabolomic \u201cguilt-by-association\u201d (covariation with known metabolites). DA species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected adaptation to oxidative stress in the IBD gut, and were individually consistent with previous findings. Integrating these data, however, we identified 122 robust associations between DA species and well-characterized DA metabolites, indicating possible mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in IBD. Finally, we found that metabolome- and metagenome-based classifiers of IBD status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation cohort. Our findings thus provide an improved understanding of perturbations of the microbiome-metabolome interface in IBD, including identification of many potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",

There are two main IBD subtypes, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), which localize in the large and small intestines, respectively, and are characterized by unique microbial signatures3. Previous studies have shown major shifts in the gut microbial composition of patients with IBD2, 4\u20138. Likewise, microbial composition can shape the environment in the colon as metabolites they produce can be involved in signaling, immune system modulation or have antibiotic activity9\u201311.

SCFAs can affect host cells by modulating histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory activity, gene expression, cell proliferation, and immune response7, 12. In addition, butyrate can protect against colitis by regulating Treg cell production and enhancing antibacterial activity of macrophages13, 14. In stool from patients with IBD there is a decrease in butyrate, a SCFA that is important in modulating the immune system along with a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria2, 15.",

Untargeted serum metabolomics of germ-free versus conventional mice showed that a large number of serum metabolites arise due to commensal microbes16. For example, tryptophan metabolism is largely affected by the presence of gut bacteria, as microbial tryptophan decarboxylases (among other enzymes) convert tryptophan from the diet into tryptamine and other molecules. Microbially-derived tryptophan metabolites alter host physiology not only by decreasing the available tryptophan (which can in turn perturb serotonin production, and by extension, behavior17), but also by producing indole derivatives that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor18. There is a decrease in tryptophan metabolism genes in microbiome samples from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease4. A mouse study recently found that animals lacking one of the IBD susceptibility genes, CARD9, had altered microbial metabolism of tryptophan and were more susceptible to colitis19.",

However, these studies have tended to rely on small cohorts or 16S rRNA amplicon-based profiles of the associated IBD microbiota (i.e. lacking shotgun metagenomic information). In a study of healthy individuals, untargeted fecal metabolomics correlated better with 16S-based microbiome composition than targeted metabolomics26. IBD-associated taxa were also highly correlated with metabotype in a study of inactive pediatric IBD. In the same study, healthy first-degree relatives displayed a similar microbiome and metabotype as relatives with inactive disease25. Both CD and UC gut microbiomes exhibit general decreases in taxonomic diversity relative to healthy gut microbiomes, along with Phylum-level decreases in Firmicutes and increases in Proteobacteria3, 25, 27. In CD specifically, proportions of the Clostridia family are altered: the Roseburia and Faecalibacterium genera of the Lachnospiracae and Ruminococcaceae families are decreased, whereas Ruminococcus gnavus increases5, 28, 29. Together, these findings suggest that yet-to-be characterized molecules in the gut metabolome, linked to inflammation and ultimately IBD, may be largely microbially derived or modified.",

While metagenomic findings were largely in agreement with previous studies, metabolomic profiles revealed >2,700 DA metabolites in IBD, including 224 that were significantly elevated in both UC and CD. IBD-elevated metabolites were enriched for sphingolipids and bile acids (among other chemical classes), as well as many uncharacterized metabolites of potential microbial origin. Indeed, many DA metabolites participated in robust associations with DA microbial species and enzymes: suggestive of biological mechanisms relating their abundances. Finally, the vast majority of IBD associations from the discovery cohort replicated in the independent validation cohort, thus making our findings a useful resource for the study of microbiome and metabolic perturbations in IBD.",

Across 93 subjects with FC measurements, the first axis of metabolic variation correlated in a reasonably strong and highly statistically significant manner with FC (Spearman\u2019s r=0.486, two-tailed p<10\u22126; Fig. 1D). This correlation was driven in part by the tendency of control subjects to have very low FC levels (mean=35 \u03bcg/g) and CD patients very high levels (mean=130 \u03bcg/g). However, the correlation remained strong and significant when evaluated on UC subjects only (n=25, r=0.565, two-tailed p=0.003). We observed a similar trend between FC measurements and the first axis of metagenomic variation (Fig. 1E), leading us to conclude 1) that our UC subjects vary from control-like levels of inflammation to more active inflammation, and 2) that this variation may contribute to UC subjects\u2019 more heterogeneous metabolic and metagenomic profiles.",

The relative over-abundance of primary bile acids in IBD subjects\u2019 guts is consistent with disruption of bile acid transformation activities in the IBD microbiome33. Sphingolipids, another of the overabundant classes in IBD, play multiple roles in the healthy gut, including 1) as structural components of intestinal cell membranes and 2) as signaling molecules involved in cell fate decisions34. In addition to their presence in the membranes of human cells, sphingolipids are prevalent in the membranes of Bacteroidetes, and these microbially-derived sphingolipids modulate the invariant natural T cell population35. Previous work suggests that sphingolipid metabolism may be disrupted in IBD, resulting in an accumulation of specific sphingolipid compounds that promote an inflammatory state36\u201338. Two of these compounds, ceramide and sphingomyelin (Fig. 2D), were significantly over-abundant in both CD and UC (q<0.02 in all comparisons).",

Triterpenoids and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs; including 2-hydroxymyristic acid, Fig. 2E) were the most numerous depleted classes (total n=135 and 111), while phenylbenzodioxanes and cholesterols (including cholestenone) were the most consistently depleted classes (the majority of their members were individually significantly depleted in CD). Phenylbenzodioxanes are primarily derived from fruits, which reinforces that some of the detected metabolic changes are a result of variation in subjects\u2019 diets. Triacylglycerols (TAGs), including C54:6 TAG (Fig. 2F), were additionally enriched in controls relative to CD and UC subjects. This change, coupled with the above-mentioned enrichments for LCFAs and cholesterols, is consistent with previously suggested perturbations of fatty acid metabolism in IBD39.",

Lactate has been previously reported as elevated in CD and UC patients40, and is notable for being produced by members of the IBD gut microbiome, including lactobacilli, enterococci, and pediococci. Pantothenate (vitamin B5) is a precursor for coenzyme A, which is notable here for being involved in fatty acid metabolism. Moreover, pantothenate is produced by the healthy gut microbiota, and so (like lactate) its differential abundance in IBD subjects may indicate a perturbation of microbe-metabolite relationships in the gut: a topic we explore in detail in a later section. While not statistically significant in this cohort, the SCFAs butyrate and propionate were decreased in both UC and CD relative to controls (Supplementary Dataset 3).",

A total of 1,403 such clusters were identified with intra-cluster Spearman correlation of 0.7 (note that these unsupervised clusters, listed in Supplementary Dataset 1, are distinct from the HMBD-defined molecular classes used above during enrichment analysis). Each cluster was assigned a representative metabolite: the cluster centroid, or the standard metabolite closest to the centroid (where applicable).

Biological signals suggested by metabolite co-variation, especially those arising from inter-conversion of metabolites, can be used to transfer knowledge from annotated metabolites to their unannotated partners. This \u201cguilt-by-association\u201d principle also arises in gene co-expression data, where it has been applied to identify modules of functionally related genes41 and predict gene function assignments42. Following this logic, we found that co-clustered metabolites were 2.7x more similar in retention time, 3.0x more similar in mass/charge ratio, and 15x more likely to belong to the same chemical class relative to random metabolite pairs (Methods). Clusters are thus enriched for similar physicochemical properties, and cluster co-membership may be predictive of such properties.",

To further dissect this trend, we applied the linear modeling approach introduced above to the abundances of 195 species-level clades (from 67 genera) that were present in at least five samples at 0.1% relative abundance (Supplementary Dataset 5). A total of 50 species were differentially abundant (DA) in one or more phenotypes, of which 35 were elevated in controls relative to IBD (Supplementary Fig. 2). Roseburia hominis, Dorea formicigenerans, and Ruminococcus obeum were among the species exhibiting the strongest enrichments in non-IBD controls. The fact that these and many other species were significantly depleted in IBD relative to controls is consistent with the general trend toward loss of species diversity in the IBD microbiome2, 3, 27 and with specific previous taxonomic enrichment studies4, 5, 43, 44. Unclassified Roseburia species were significantly elevated in both CD and UC subjects, while Bifidobacterium breve and Clostridium symbiosum were uniquely DA and enriched in UC. Twelve species were uniquely DA and enriched in CD, including Ruminococcus gnavus, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium clostridioforme. Many of these species-specific enrichments and depletions were in line with previous studies as cited here and discussed in the Introduction.",

Such relationships are consistent with a mechanism relating the abundance of the species and metabolite which is then perturbed during IBD pathogenesis. For example, a positive association between a metabolite and species could indicate that the metabolite promotes the growth of that species, or that the species produces that metabolite. To identify such relationships, we performed large-scale association discovery between differentially abundant (DA) metabolites and species, focusing on representative DA metabolites and species from the clustering approach described above (notably, most species clustered alone by this approach). More importantly, we performed association discovery on metabolite and species residual abundances from the above-described linear modeling approach, which will tend to de-emphasize associations driven purely by mutual association with disease status. This revealed a total of 15,679 FDR-significant (q<0.05) associations between representative DA metabolites and species. Among these was a positive association between lactic acid and Pediococcus acidilactici (Spearman\u2019s r=0.23): one of the expected microbe-metabolite relationships alluded to above (see Fig. 2G). To further enrich for putatively mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in disease, we specifically focused on the subset of associations that were nominally significant (p<0.05) and in the same direction when considering raw metabolite and species abundances from non-IBD controls only (we refer to these associations as \u201cconfirmed in controls\u201d).",

Associations covered 901 metabolite clusters representing 1,878 DA metabolites. 46 of 50 DA species were represented in at least one association. However, of the large number of possible associations between these metabolites and species, only 6% were statistically significant and confirmed in controls. This implies that, although many metabolites are associated with one or more species, they tend not to associate mechanistically with most species (and vice versa). The largest group of associations were positive associations between metabolites and species that were both elevated in controls (1,398 associations; 61% of all significant associations). These associations were representative of a general pattern of \u201cconcordance\u201d with disease, resulting (for example) when a species produces a protective metabolite. Discordant associations (e.g. negative associations between metabolites and species that both increased in disease) accounted for only ~2% of total associations. In these cases, while the species and metabolite may be mechanistically linked, the mechanism does not appear to directly aggravate IBD pathogenesis.",

ETA and DPA are polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids (PUFAs), and are examples of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, respectively. ETA and DPA are important constituents of eukaryotic cell membranes, and their elevation in the IBD-afflicted gut may be explained by higher rates of host cell death/turnover or reduced absorption from diet. In addition to roles in immune and inflammatory signaling, PUFAs possess bactericidal activity by virtue of their hydrophobic nature and potential to disrupt bacterial cell membranes45. This activity is particularly consistent with the negative correlations involving ETA (e.g. with Eubacterium ventriosum; Fig. 4B), several of which had a \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d character (i.e. when ETA was present, the corresponding species tended to be absent, and vice versa). Conversely, DPA associated positively with IBD-associated species, most notably Ruminococcus gnavus (Fig. 4C). This suggests that DPA encourages the growth of these species, possibly through disrupting the growth of health-associated species.",

Caprylic acid was enriched in non-IBD controls in our dataset, consistent with previously observed patterns of MCFA depletion in IBD22. Like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), MCFAs may occur in the gut as a breakdown product from anaerobic fermentation of fiber, though dietary contributions are perhaps more abundant. Consistent with this idea, caprylic acid was (weakly) positively correlated with a number of health-associated gut anaerobes, including Alistipes shahii, A. putredinis, and A. finegoldii. On the other hand, caprylic acid was significantly negatively associated with the abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus. Such a negative relationship would be consistent with possible uptake and metabolism of caprylic acid by R. gnavus (in which case, as the species\u2019 abundance increases, more caprylic acid is used up). Alternatively, and more consistent with its aforementioned antibacterial properties, caprylic acid may have an inhibitory effect on growth of R. gnavus.",

For example, magnesium-importing ATPase (EC 3.6.3.2) was enriched in both CD and UC subjects relative to controls (Fig. 5A). Magnesium deficiency has been described as a known side-effect of IBD47: one which could be explained in part by sequestration of the ion by the IBD-associated microbiome. Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.7) was similarly enriched in the IBD gut (Fig. 5B). This enzyme is involved in the production of glycerophospholipids, one of the most significantly enriched classes of metabolite in CD and UC subjects (see Fig. 2A). A final example of an IBD-enriched enzyme was glutathione-disulfide reductase (\u201cGR\u201d; EC 1.8.1.7; Fig. 5C). GR catalyzes the production of glutathione: a compound involved in resistance to oxidative stresses. Oxidative stress is a hallmark of inflammation in the IBD-afflicted gut48, thus giving species encoding GR a selective advantage in that environment.",

Enzymes involved in the synthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B12) were also enriched in controls, including precorrin-2 dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.76; Fig. 5E).

Several associations occurred between standard metabolites and the enzymes discussed above. For example, magnesium-importing ATPase was strongly negatively associated with 2-hydroxymyristic acid (a control-enriched compound; Spearman\u2019s r=\u22120.492; Fig. 5F). Conversely, precorrin-2 dehydrogenase was positively associated with caproic acid (another control-enriched compound; r=0.507).

Within the PRISM cohort, metabolites, species, and their combination predicted UC, CD, or non-IBD control labels correctly 64\u201365% of the time: less successful than case/control predictions, but still considerably greater than random (i.e. 33% correct; Fig. 5B). The most common source of classification error was labeling UC subjects as non-IBD or CD. This is not surprising, given that the distribution of UC subjects overlapped with the (largely distinct) CD and non-IBD populations (see Fig. 1B). Comparatively, Non-IBD subjects were rarely classified into one of the two IBD subtypes, while CD subjects were sometimes erroneously classified as UC. More distinction among the input data types was observed when applying the PRISM-trained IBD subtype classifier to the Netherlands cohorts (Fig. 5C). While the metabolite-incorporating classifiers performed reasonably well (77% correct classification), the species-based classifier performed considerably worse (48% correct classification), largely due to marked misclassification of CD subjects as UC. This suggests that, although many IBD-varying species trended similarly in the Netherlands cohort, subtype-informative details of their abundance distributions (as learned from the PRISM cohort) were less conserved.",

More generally, we observed that metabolites and metabolite classes were frequently depleted in IBD patients relative to non-IBD controls. This pattern is suggestive of a loss of \u201cmetabolic diversity\u201d among IBD subjects that is analogous to the loss of taxonomic (ecological) diversity observed in the IBD microbiome.

While uncharacterized metabolites no doubt encompass previously undescribed microbe- and disease-associated molecules of biological interest, they also include non-biological adducts and fragments of sample molecules, and are generally more challenging to interpret. We approached these challenges using a combination of methods: 1) experimentally validating metabolites against a standard compound library (a precise but resource-intensive process), 2) approximate annotation of metabolites to broad chemical classes, and 3) clustering of metabolites according to residual covariation across samples. Covariation-based clusters were found to be enriched for metabolites of similar physicochemical properties: a form of \u201cguilt-by-association\u201d that complements existing network-based approaches49 to metabolite characterization. The covariation-based approach suggested potential roles for many unlabeled metabolites that clustered with known standards (as in Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the process also revealed clusters of wholly uncharacterized, IBD-associated metabolites (as in Fig. 3B). Such clusters may represent microbial metabolites with pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, and are prime candidates for additional experimental characterization.",

By prioritizing associations between microbial species and enzymes that associate with metabolites independently of disease status, we enrich for potential mechanistic associations that may become perturbed in IBD. Many details of these associations remain to be determined. For example, a positive association between a microbial taxon and metabolite could be explained by 1) the metabolite representing a preferred carbon source that promotes the species\u2019 growth, 2) the metabolite occurring as a by-product of the species\u2019 metabolism, or 3) the metabolite selectively inhibiting the growth of other species (or otherwise interacting ecologically). These options can be disentangled computationally by analysis of genome and metagenome annotations, when available, as well as experimentally by growing microbial species in the presence of their associated metabolites and/or profiling their metabolic output in monoculture. Naturally, further in vivo experiments (e.g. in mouse models of IBD) will be required to confirm that validated microbe-metabolite associations play a causal role in IBD pathogenesis. Such efforts are laborious, and hence the computationally derived subset of putative associations uncovered here will be a critical aid, as will further bioinformatic prioritization based on meta\u2019omic profiling.",

Statistical significance was not as consistently replicated, in part due to power limitations of the smaller validation study (hence, further replication in a larger cohort could be warranted in the future). At the same time, integrating individual microbial and metabolomic signals was sufficient to build accurate classifiers for case/control status that generalized to new subjects. Surprisingly, combining signals of both types (microbes and metabolites) did not boost classification performance markedly. This result is suggestive of tight coupling of the IBD gut metabolome and microbiome, which may result from a combination of 1) both profiles changing in response to disease, 2) an altered microbiome perturbing the metabolome, or 3) an altered metabolome perturbing the microbiome (with potential feedback therein). Mechanisms underlying this coupling will be naturally expanded through experimental validation of targeted microbe-metabolite associations, as described above.",

While CD patients did not stratify strongly by disease localization (see Supplementary Fig. 4), CD patients as a whole separated well from non-IBD controls (see Fig. 1). The same could not be said for UC patients, which were dispersed into inflamed/CD-like and non-inflamed/control-like subpopulations, consistent with previous reports of high variability among UC microbiomes25. Many features that were individually differentially abundant in UC were also differentially abundant in CD, while the converse was not true. This is typical of the UC microbiome in general, and it suggests that IBD-linked perturbations may be divided into at least two modules: 1) perturbations that are associated with inflammation in general, and 2) perturbations that are specific to CD. The first module underlies the general association between multi\u2019omic profiles and inflammation status (as measured here by fecal calprotectin level), and provides a basis for classifying case/control status. The second module can also aid in classifying case/control status, in that it is informative for CD subtype specifically. However, the absence of a strong UC-specific signal, coupled with heterogeneity among the UC subpopulation, hindered the predictability of UC status. That being said, a small number of molecules, including ethyl 9-hexadecenoate (see Fig. 2F), were individually differentially abundant in UC, and make promising targets for further study.",

To better differentiate UC, for example, it is possible that the metabolomic methods employed here missed classes of molecules that specifically vary with UC status. Alternatively, the stool metabolome may be imperfect for capturing UC-specific signals. In such cases, profiles of serum metabolites might augment serum antibodies50 as diagnostic biomarkers for IBD/UC, while remaining less-invasive than biopsy but still associable with the microbiome. While this study employed cross-sectional sampling of a larger number of subjects, dense longitudinal sampling of a subset of individuals would further aid in the dissection of putative microbe-metabolite associations (by intrinsically controlling for within-specific properties), and would further illuminate whether the observed population substructure was stable over time, or correlated with changes in metabolomic or microbiome composition. This would, critically, also help disentangle causality\u2014which metabolite shifts precede microbial or host phenotypes, and vice versa\u2014as well as provide a potential predictive target for interception of disease activity. However, even without these additional studies, the multi\u2019omic screens and associations uncovered here provide many actionable hypotheses regarding the role of specific known and yet-to-be characterized metabolites and their microbial partners in IBD pathogenesis.

Features were clustered on their residual abundance values from the above-described linear modeling approach. This procedure enriches for covariation between features that is independent of mutual covariation with disease status (or other subject metadata, such as age or medication use). Features were ranked according to the significance of their association with IBD (the smaller of the two p-values from the CD- and UC-centered comparisons). The highest-ranked feature was seeded into an initial cluster. Each subsequent feature was then compared to each extant cluster: if the feature had a mean similarity to the cluster\u2019s members exceeding a threshold, the feature was added to that cluster. (For all clustering analyses, we applied Spearman correlation as a similarity measure with a threshold of r=0.7.) If the feature was not added to a cluster in this way, it was used to seed a new cluster. After considering all features, clusters were renumbered according to their size (such that cluster 1 had the most members, etc.). Each cluster was characterized by a representative member. For metabolite clusters containing standards, this representative was the standard closest to the cluster centroid; the true centroid was used for clusters without standards. Similarly, characterized (vs. \u201cunclassified\u201d) species-level taxonomic features were preferred as representative features in microbial species clusters.",
