However, identifying the microbial taxa that differentiate these samples can be challenging. These issues stem from the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data (or, more generally, taxon or functional gene data); the changes in the relative abundance of one taxon influence the apparent abundances of the others. Here we acknowledge that inferring properties of individual bacteria is a difficult problem and instead introduce the concept of balances to infer meaningful properties of subcommunities, rather than properties of individual species. We show that balances can yield insights about niche differentiation across multiple microbial environments, including soil environments and lung sputum.

An understanding of how microbial communities are affected by environmental conditions might yield insights into microbial interactions and their role in macroecological processes, such as nitrogen fixation (1) and acidification (2). However, despite the extraordinary increase in available data brought about by advances in DNA sequencing, characterizing niche differentiation in microbes remains an outstanding problem, partly due to the difficulty of correctly interpreting compositional data. Broadly speaking, a compositional data set is represented by relative abundances, or proportions, that individually carry no meaning for the absolute abundance of a specific feature (i.e., 20% of 100 and 20% of 10,000 are very different absolute abundances). The constraints associated with compositional data are well known but unfortunately often neglected in microbial ecology, leading to conflicting interpretations and irreproducible analyses (3, 4).",

Analyses that rely on such assumptions, as many statistical approaches do, are thus prone to misinterpretation. For example, traditional correlation metrics, such as Pearson and Spearman metrics, can be misleading when estimating microbe-microbe correlations (6,\u20139). As a result, it becomes a major challenge to specify types of interactions between microbes, such as parasitism, competition, predation, or mutualism, as shown in correlation studies of oral, fecal, and vaginal samples from the Human Microbiome Project (6, 10). Even-more-advanced correlation-detection techniques, such as SparCC (3) and SPIEC-EASI (5), struggle with this and typically require additional assumptions, such as sparse operational taxonomic unit (OTU) correlations (i.e., few OTUs are actually correlated with each other). Furthermore, interpreting the resulting network is a major challenge, making it difficult to differentiate between true ecological relationships and random processes (10).",

More-advanced tools for differential abundance detection, such as analysis of compositions of microbiomes (ANCOM) (12), are typically designed to control for false-positives and reliably detect differentially abundant species, but they require multiple assumptions (i.e., the number of changing microbes across environments is small) and may require complex parameter tuning. To help overcome these issues of compositionality, we explore using the concept of balances by moving away from inferring changes of individual species to instead inferring changes of microbial subcommunities to study the niche differentiation of microbial communities.",

Instead of examining proportion changes, we can investigate the balance between Red and Blue individuals by taking the log ratio of Red and Blue counts (Fig.\u00a01c).

A single balance can capture information about the transition from a high relative abundance of Red individuals in low-pH environments to a high relative abundance of Blue individuals in high-pH environments. In low-pH environments, the balance is positive, since there are proportionally more Red individuals than Blue individuals. When the Red and Blue individuals are present in roughly equal proportions, the balance is roughly zero, representing a turning point, transitioning from a Red species-dominated community to a Blue species-dominated community. As the pH increases, the balances become increasingly negative, since there are more Blue individuals than Red individuals.

To gain more intuition about this, consider Fig.\u00a01e, in which there are five species and 11 individuals.

                    "text": "In this study (17), 88 soil samples were collected from North and South America, along with many edaphic measurements. The study reported that there was a strong correlation between pH and species richness, suggesting that pH was a strong driver behind fluctuations in soil microbial communities. Acidobacteria were found to be negatively correlated with pH and Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes to be positively correlated with pH, while alpha-, beta-, and gammaproteobacteria were not correlated with pH at all. These correlation analyses are a little misleading, since the pH was correlated with each of the phyla independently. The problem with this approach is that it does not account for all of the other phyla; as with the argument made for the experiment represented in Fig.\u00a01b, the change in a single phylum might also be explained by correlated changes in all of the other phyla. Here, the negative correlation between Acidobacteria abundance and pH might also be caused by the positive correlation between Bacteroidetes abundance and pH. Additionally, we cannot determine whether the alpha-, beta-, and gammaproteobacteria are correlated with pH or not. Another possibility is that these three phyla are positively correlated with pH but that Acidobacteria abundance is not correlated with pH. However, Bacteroidetes may be so strongly correlated with pH that Acidobacteria appear to be negatively correlated with pH and the other three phyla to not be correlated with pH at all. This scenario is one of the infinite possible underlying relationships that can explain these observed correlations.",

Rather than attempting to correlate individual phyla against pH, we grouped OTUs together according to their difference in mean pHs (Fig.\u00a02a) and investigated how these balances of groups change with respect to pH (see Materials and Methods on hierarchical clustering). This circumvented the dependence issue noted previously. We do not need to worry about subgroups within the left and right subtrees of a balance influencing each other, due to the independence property shown in Fig. 1e and \u200bandff.",

If we were to sort the samples by their mean pHs and the OTUs by their mean pHs (see equation\u00a03 in Materials and Methods), a well-defined band pattern appears. Here, it is clear that OTUs with a mean pH less than 3 rarely have nonzero counts above 8. Likewise, OTUs that have a mean pH of more than 8 rarely have nonzero counts below 3. If we tie in this band pattern in Fig.\u00a02c together with the balance-versus-pH trends shown in Fig.\u00a02b, we obtain a very different interpretation from that of the original study. OTUs tend to be observed in very specific pH ranges but not commonly observed outside these ranges. This ties together with some concepts in niche theory: OTUs are more suited to live within a designated range of pHs, and if they are placed outside this pH range, they are outcompeted by other organisms who are more suited to live within the given pH range.",

However, these changes could not be detected using available statistics, likely due to the compositionality problem. Since the different CF patients had idiosyncratic lung communities, they ended up having different OTUs responding across the laboratory pH gradient, yielding insufficient statistical power to detect changes in any given OTU.

In Fig.\u00a03b, y0 represents the log ratio of all of the high-pH OTUs (7.6 < mean pH < 8.12) over all of the low-pH OTUs (5.4 < mean pH < 7.4). As the pH of the samples increases, the balance increases, likely because the low-pH OTUs are becoming increasingly less abundant than the high-pH OTUs (P\u00a0value = 7.5 \u00d7 10\u221246). The same pattern is even more apparent in y1 (Fig.\u00a03c). The low-pH OTUs (5.4 < mean pH < 6.4) become increasingly less abundant than high-pH OTUs (6.5 < mean pH < 7.4) as the sample pH increases (P\u00a0value = 2.25 \u00d7 10\u221267). When Bonferroni multiple-hypothesis correction was applied to these tests, the P\u00a0values were rounded down to zero. While these patterns were not obvious when looking at the raw proportions, the balance tree approach shows very well defined trends among groups of OTUs. This can be done because even though individual OTUs may be sporadically distributed across the original samples, OTUs that thrive in similar pH niches grouped together on the environmental balance tree. It is clear from Fig.\u00a03b and \u200bandcc that there is a transition from low-pH organisms to high-pH organisms along the pH gradient. Even though the CF patients do not have the same lung microbiomes, they contain OTUs that behave the same with respect to pH.

First, balances are known to be scale invariant, so balance trees naturally correct for differences in sequencing depth without requiring rarefaction (see Text\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material) and avoid many of the limitations associated with this procedure (23). Second, balances are subcompositionally coherent, which means that changes in nonoverlapping subcommunities do not impact each other. For instance, in Fig.\u00a01e and \u200bandf,f, the Purple population triples, balances, and changes because the organisms explicitly contain the Purple species. In contrast to proportions, the balance b3 does not change between these two scenarios because it does not relate to the Purple species (in fact, it accounts only for the Red and Green species). This is not the case when observing the raw proportions, from which it appears as though everything is changing, even though the Purple species is the only changing species. This phenomenon has previously been noted (12) and can lead to extremely high false-positivity rates with some standard statistical techniques, such as Pearson correlations or t\u00a0tests on proportions. More discussion about this issue can be found in Fig.\u00a0S1. Third, arithmetic operations on balances directly translate into perturbation and powering operations on proportions (21, 22), which can capture information about relative growth and decay of species. This ultimately opens the door for applying standard statistical techniques, such as multiple linear regression (24) and linear mixed-effects model nested-design statistics, directly to balances, providing additional justification for the analyses performed in the case studies. We have shown this in the two case studies. Finally, balances are permutation invariant. Species can be sorted in any order deemed appropriate. Along the same lines, these species can be rearranged into any arbitrary grouping represented as a bifurcating tree. These trees can be built to address the questions at hand, whether it be studying species turnover across pH gradients or even uncovering the relationships between phylogenetic clades. In fact, balances can be thought of as being utilized as an ordination technique, since every bifurcating tree forms an orthonormal basis in the Aitchison simplex (13).",

These questions can be based either on the phylogenetic tree of the bacterial community or on environmental clustering. There is still room for improvement on utilizing balances. For example, the issue of zeroes still remains, because the logarithm of zero is undefined. Currently, the common approach is to add a pseudocount (25). However, an appropriate tree choice can mitigate this issue, because the zeroes can be explicitly aggregated in some scenarios (Fig.\u00a0S2 and\u00a0S3). Along the same lines, issues can arise from low-coverage samples. If sampling is not saturated, many OTUs have low read counts, and the balances toward the tips of the trees can be highly volatile. This is because the absolute change between one or two reads may be small for low-abundance OTUs, but this will lead to large changes in log ratios, which lead to spurious signals at the tips of the tree. As a rule of thumb, balances toward the root of the tree are more trustworthy than those at the tips of the tree.",

It is known that in environments like the human gut, people share very few OTUs with each other but have roughly the same proportions of functional genes (26). This suggests that there is substantial functional redundancy across OTUs, which has been observed previously in time series studies in the context of infection (27); in other words, in these microbial communities, many players might be sporadically distributed across similar niches. This phenomenon might explain the sparse nature of 16S relative abundance data and why similar environments, such as human guts, share few common OTUs. Such distributions pose tremendous challenges to analyses based around identifying the niche occupancy of individual OTUs. By instead permitting the statistical comparisons to be performed across nested groups of OTUs with similar distributions, it becomes possible to robustly identify patterns of niche differentiation without requiring sufficient information to be present in the abundances of each individual taxon. Identifying common functional roles of potentially diverse organisms and analyzing the balances between these groups might significantly simplify analyses in future amplicon studies. The ability to construct such trees would enable rapid characterizations of environmental niches and the corresponding functional roles of the microbes occupying in these niches.",
