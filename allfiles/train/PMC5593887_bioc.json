Few studies have investigated their correlation with polypharmacy, multimorbidity and frailty. To assess it, we analyzed the fecal microbiota from 76 inpatients, aged 83\u2009\u00b1\u20098. Microbiome biodiversity (Chao1 index) and relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa were determined by next-generation 16S rRNA microbial profiling. Their correlation with number of drugs, and indexes of multimorbidity and frailty were verified using multivariate linear regression models. The impact of gut microbiota biodiversity on mortality, rehospitalizations and incident sepsis was also assessed after a 2-year follow-up, using Cox regression analysis. We found a significant negative correlation between the number of drugs and Chao1 Index at multivariate analysis. The number of drugs was associated with the average relative abundance of 15 taxa. The drug classes exhibiting the strongest association with single taxa abundance were proton pump inhibitors, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Conversely, frailty and multimorbidity were not significantly associated with gut microbiota biodiversity. Very low Chao1 index was also a significant predictor of mortality, but not of rehospitalizations and sepsis, at follow-up. In aging, polypharmacy may thus represent a determinant of gut microbiota composition, with detrimental clinical consequences.",

First, the studied population had a high burden of chronic diseases and disability, whose impact on gut microbiota composition may not be completely measured and explained by the considered indexes. For the same reason, the sample size could have been insufficient to fully represent the high inter-individual variability of microbiota, and could have influenced the results. Second, the studied population had different admission diagnoses. The association of some of these acute diseases, such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure, and stroke, with gut microbiota has been hypothesized25, but not verified in population-based studies26. Even if subjects with diseases known to have an established association with dysbiosis, such as IBD, were excluded from the study, and no significant microbiome clusters were identified among subjects with the same acute disease, the population heterogeneity may have represented a possible source of bias. Third, other factors explaining gut microbiota variability in adults, such as long-term dietary habits and smoking26, were not considered in the present study. For all these reasons, our results should be considered as hypothesis generator for future research rather than definitive remarks on the topic. Future research should also verify whether fecal microbiota composition changes with medication revision in older patients.",

However, all the existing studies were carried out on adults subjects taking less than 5 drugs, and thus cannot be defined as taking polypharmacy according to the current consensus threshold29. For example, Rogers and Aronoff showed that the gut microbiota composition of adult patients chronically taking a single drug is significantly different from that of subjects without pharmacological treatments, and that the association of non-steroidal antinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with PPIs influences the gut microbiota in a different way than treatment with NSAIDs alone27. Imhann and colleagues recently demonstrated that, in adult subjects, PPIs, antibiotics, antidepressants and statins are the drug classes with the strongest influence on microbiome composition28. Consistently with our results, few studies carried out in adult subjects without multimorbidity have underlined that PPIs30, 31, antidepressants32, and antipsychotics33, 34 are the main drug classes able to induce modifications of gut microbiota composition alone.",

PPIs can promote the overgrowth of specific taxa by raising luminal pH35, which, in turn, makes enteric mucosa more susceptible to drug-induced damage36. Mucosal modifications of permeability and functionality promoted by drugs can also contribute to select specific microbial taxa. For example, metformin treatment can stimulate goblet cells number and functionality, and thus contribute to select bacteria, such as Akkermansia spp, with a particular trophism towards mucin glycans37. Some drugs may also exhibit bacteriostatic or bactericidal side effects, that can selectively inhibit some bacteria and promote the overexpression of competitors. For example, metformin treatment is associated with overexpression of SCFA producers and Enterobacteriaceae through this mechanism38. Finally, some drugs can trigger local mucosal inflammation by raising its susceptibility to lipopolysaccharide effects, and thus contribute to select specific bacterial populations39.",

The severity of dysbiosis was able to significantly predict death after a 2-year follow-up. Future observational and intervention studies should better define the association between geriatric domains and gut microbiota composition, and address the complex relationship between gut microbiota and the physiopathology of aging. The effect of single drug classes on gut bacteria in elderly patients should be also better investigated in the future.",
