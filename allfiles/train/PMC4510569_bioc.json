This has lead to the consensus that more must be done to monitor and combat the occurrence and spread of antimicrobial resistance [2, 3]. Current diagnostic laboratory practice for the detection of antimicrobial resistance relies on isolate culturing, followed by growth inhibition assays for the identification of resistant phenotypes and determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations against a range of antimicrobials (MICs) [4]. Alternatively, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) can be identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantified using real-time PCR, requiring specific primers for the amplification of target sequences [5]. These approaches take time, consume resources, and have limitations that may result in clinically relevant resistances being undetected e.g. phenotypic testing will miss non-culturable bacteria and non-expressed ARGs, whereas limitations of multiplex composition and size in molecular testing complicates the detection of ARGs [6, 7].",

AMD technologies, such as the whole genome sequencing of bacterial isolates as well as uncultured bacteria (metagenomic sequencing), have the potential to identify antimicrobial resistance more quickly and effectively than conventional laboratory assays [8]. In addition to these well-understood advantages, AMD technologies can also be applied to circumvent the requirement of prior knowledge of causative agents and provide clinically relevant information for the treatment and surveillance of pathogens as well as antimicrobial resistance [9]. Upon receipt of a metagenomic (e.g. environmental or faecal microbiome) or isolate sample, DNA can be extracted, compiled into a library and sequenced within hours [10]. Indeed, AMD approaches to pathogen detection are currently being developed and seek to identify pathogens directly from metagenomic samples within clinically relevant timeframes [11]. Recent studies have also shown AMD to be effective in the epidemiological tracking of pathogens, as well as the detection of ARGs present in their genomes [12, 13]. AMD offers an alternative screening tool that may be quicker than traditional culture-based techniques. For example, the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires inoculated isolation media to be incubated for several days in order to diagnose infection and additional time for phenotypic characterisation of antimicrobial resistance [14]. This highlights the potential for developing more efficient diagnostic tests and the utilisation of AMD technologies to create more rapid alternatives for ARG detection.",

However, there is need to establish a metagenomic framework for use in the monitoring of ARGs within the environment in order to influence public health decisions and the growing concern over antimicrobial resistance [18]. This must include the development of reliable surveillance methods and tools for risk assessment [19]. When designing metagenomic tools for the environmental monitoring of ARGs, it is therefore necessary to provide context in terms of the relative abundance of ARGs, so that these can be correlated with environmental variables (e.g. such as antimicrobial concentrations, etc.) as well as to obtain information on the mobile genetic elements (MGE) and pathogens that they are associated with.",

To our knowledge, no existing tools give an ARG abundance measure or simultaneously provide MGE information. The targeting of full-length gene matches using BLAST requires a sequence assembly step, adding time, infrastructure requirements, and complexity to the analysis. Furthermore, full-length gene assembly is often difficult to achieve in metagenomic samples where coverage is frequently low and uneven across the sample. Ideally, raw sequencing data would be used directly to rapidly identify and quantify ARGs of interest. Although mapping-based approaches have been used for individual studies [24, 25] and tools that work directly with reads (though on non-ARG databases) such as the SEED subsystems and SRST2 can be applied to work to this aim [26], there is as yet no such ARG-detection algorithm. Here, we present an automated pipeline, the Search Engine for Antimicrobial Resistance (SEAR), which quickly and accurately identifies antimicrobial resistance information from biological samples. Furthermore, it also provides abundance estimates and returns the true sample full-length reconstructed gene sequence. To demonstrate efficacy, we present the application of the pipeline to a range of sequencing data types including novel environmental metagenomes, human faecal metagenomes and clinical isolates of pathogenic enteric bacteria (Shigella sonnei).",

In contrast, the farm effluent had ARGs conferring resistance to five resistance profiles with the most diverse being the beta lactam resistance profile and the most abundant also being tetracycline resistance (Fig 2). The most abundant ARGs in the metagenome datasets were tetracycline resistance genes; tetC (41.6%) in the farm effluent, and tet39 (15.3%) in the WWTW effluent. A subset of ARGs identified by SEAR (tetA, qnrB and bla-ACT; chosen to encompass clinically relevant resistances, drugs with both a long and short history of resistance and chemically diverse antimicrobials) was confirmed in the original farm effluent DNA sample using PCR.

SNPs are not currently tested for due to the annotation parameters being calibrated for detecting partial ARG matches to compensate for low sequencing coverage. Hence, such SNPs may be missed by SEAR due to the number of mismatches permitted or by a low coverage cut-off (though these are both customisable settings). For these reasons, it is not recommended to include SNP-based resistances in reference databases used with SEAR as they may lead to false positives. The detection of SNP-based resistances in metagenomic samples represents a significant future challenge that needs to be addressed. It should also be stressed that the default SEAR parameters, which are based on high-stringency read clustering and mapping, result in an analysis that finds ARGs that are known in the reference data and it is not suited for discovery of emergent ARGs. The high-stringency settings are designed to exclude the possibility of non-competitive read mapping causing false positive results by ensuring that annotated ARGs have a high sequence identity compared to the reference database.",
