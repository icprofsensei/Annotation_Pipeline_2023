Commensal microbiota participates in the host immune system and metabolism, reflecting the host's health condition. However, the interaction mechanisms between the microbiota and the host's health condition remain unclear. This study reports the influence of long sea voyages on human health by utilising a metagenomic analysis of variation in the microbiota of the buccal mucosa. Paired samples collected before and after a sea-voyage were analysed. After more than 120 days of ocean sailing, the oral microbial diversity of sailors was reduced by approximately 5 fold, and the levels of several pathogens (e.g., Streptococcus pneumonia) increased. Moreover, 69.46% of the identified microbial sequences were unclassified microbiota. Notably, several metabolic pathways were dramatically decreased, including folate biosynthesis, carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid pathways. Clinical examination of the hosts confirmed the identified metabolic changes, as demonstrated by decreased serum levels of haemoglobin and folic acid, a decreased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and increased levels of triglycerides, cholesterol and homocysteine, which are consistent with the observed microbial variation. Our study suggests that oral mucosal bacteria may reflect host health conditions and could provide approaches for improving the health of sailors.",

The oral mucosa is considered not only a barrier to the outside world but also an immunological and biochemical organ; therefore, oral health can be seen as a window to the body's health13. The nonspecific and specific immune activity of the mucosa constantly monitors and responds to oral cavity commensal organisms to maintain oral homeostasis and defend against potential pathogens. The Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) (http://www.homd.org) was specifically designed to provide comprehensive information on oral bacteria and tools for examining and analysing each taxon in the human oral microbiome at both the taxonomic and genomic levels14. Such data can be used to speculate on the host physical condition by analysing the community structure and metabolism of the oral commensal microbes. Recently, it was suggested that the oral microbiome will cause disease in a majority of individuals during their lifetime and that aberrant microbial compositions are correlated with oral diseases, such as chronic periodontitis and saprodontia10,15.",

By combining DNA-based 16S rRNA phylotyping to identify the major bacterial phyla with whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) to obtain a deeper taxonomic analysis, we characterised the microbial diversity associated with host health and pathogens during a long-term ocean voyage. We found that after a long sea voyage, microbial diversity was reduced greatly, whereas several pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumonia, increased. Furthermore, more than half of the microbial sequences were unclassifiable. Functional analysis revealed that sequences annotated as pertaining to microbial nutrient metabolism, such as folate biosynthesis and carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid and xenobiotic metabolism decreased significantly. Additionally, the belly-button microbiota were analysed and showed similar changes, including reduced microbial diversity and metabolic activities. The clinical laboratory examination of the host demonstrated decreases in haemoglobin and folic acid (FA) concentrations and the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (GRN/LYM), and increases in the triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (CH) levels, in accordance with the microbial variation. Our data are the first to suggest that the bacteria living in the oral mucosa are correlated with the host's health condition during sea voyages.",

The alpha diversity in the samples after a long sea voyage was significantly reduced (Figure 1 a and b) by approximately five times after a long sea voyage (33.85 to 6.26). By annotating the sequences using the NCBI taxonomy tree, we investigated the number of identified taxa in the two samples. In the before sample (before voyage), a total of 493 taxa were detected, whereas the number of detected taxa in the after sample (after voyage) decreased significantly to 267. Of the 643 total taxa detected in both samples, only 117 taxa were shared. There were 376 taxa specific to the before sample and 150 specific to the after sample (Figure 1c).",

Skin is the most exposed organ and, similar to the buccal mucosa, provides an open microenvironment for a large amount of microbes to live on. The belly button represents, to some extent, the natural state of the human skin microbial community because its unique position allows the resident bacteria to avoid daily removal by washing. Sequencing the belly button samples from the same volunteers who provided the buccal mucosa samples revealed that the microbial diversity in the belly button decreased more than two-fold after the sea voyage (19.91 to 7.08, Figure 1b). Accordingly, the number of taxa identified also decreased. There were 371 taxa in the before sample and 201 taxa in the after sample, with only 52 taxa being shared, indicating a great decline and change in the belly button microbial community (Figure 1d).",

After the sea voyage, the second richest phylum, Proteobacteria, decreased greatly, and the change in the abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria was significant (Figure 2c). Then, the changes in the frequency of the most abundant genera were further analysed. Streptococcus and Staphylococcus were the most abundant genera, and their proportions increased after the sea voyage (Streptococcus, 44.23% to 49.61%; Staphylococcus, 9.05% to 18.71%).

Streptococcus comprised 79.70% of the total identified bacteria in the before sea voyage sample and increased to 96.76% after the sea voyage. When analysing the taxa overlap between the two samples, the taxa identified after the sea voyage belonged mostly to Streptococcus, and fewer taxa belonged to Clostridium, Listeria, Paenibacillus, Lactobacillus, Weissella, Enterococcus and other genera. This finding was consistent with the result that Streptococcus was the most abundant genus in the buccal mucosa after the sea voyage. Notably, opportunistic pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus parasanguinis and Streptococcus suis increased after the sea voyage, indicating a weaker host immune system (Figure 3c; Table 1).",

To clarify microbial functions, we annotated the function of enzymes identified in the whole-metagenome data according to the KEGG Orthology. The comparative analysis of microbial metabolic profiles between buccal mucosa samples before and after the long sea voyage showed a significant decrease in functional genes after the sea voyage, including three major metabolic pathways involving carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids (Figure 4a). More specifically, in carbohydrate metabolism, pentose and gluconate interconversions, ascorbate metabolism, and upstream metabolism for the biosynthesis of the streptomycin, butirosin and neomycin were affected. In lipid metabolism, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid and ether lipid metabolism, and fatty acid elongation were affected. In amino acid metabolism, the urea cycle and cyanoamino acid metabolism were affected. Notably, the TCA cycle, which combines the three metabolic pathways above, was also reduced after the sea voyage. In addition to these basic essential metabolic pathways, other metabolic pathways were affected, including the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins (e.g., folate biosynthesis, biotin, thiamine, riboflavin and vitamin B6 metabolism), xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism (e.g., benzoate, toluene, naphthalene, dioxin and aminobenzoate degradation and the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450), and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides (e.g., brassinosteroid and carotenoid biosynthesis).",

Moreover, genes involved in the metabolism of cofactors, vitamins (e.g., porphyrin, chlorophyll, and thiamine metabolism), terpenoids (e.g., brassinosteroid and carotenoid biosynthesis) and xenobiotics (e.g., metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 and drug metabolism) were also decreased, which is similar to the results for the buccal mucosa samples (Figure 4b).",

                    "text": "Diversity is important in all ecosystems to promote stability and performance17. More diversity is considered to be more advantageous because of higher resiliency. The diversity of the microbiota may become a new biomarker or indicator of health18. Reduced microbial diversity in the gut has been reported to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)19,20. Moreover, it is reported that individuals with a lower bacterial richness are characterised by more striking overall adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and a more noticeable inflammatory phenotype21. The human commensal microbiota is under direct influence of the external environment. The loss of biodiversity in the external environment correlates with atopic and chronic inflammatory diseases and may further affect the human commensal microbiota and its immune modulatory capacity22. Compared with a similar individual on land, the microbiota of an individual on a sailing ship has a much lower biodiversity. Although not significant when analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing (Supplementary Figure S4), our findings showed a much lower microbial diversity within an individual after a sea voyage using WGS. No significant change was observed in the microbial diversity according to 16S rRNA sequencing, most likely due to the PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene before sequencing that can lead to a failure in detecting low-abundance species. Further confirmation of the influence of a long sea voyage was provided by sequencing the microbiota of the belly button from the same individuals. The microbial diversity in the belly button samples was significantly reduced after the sea voyage. Thus, exposure to the sea voyage environment can reasonably be assumed to be one of the causes of reduced microbial diversity in sailors. Previous reports have suggested methods to increase the diversity of the commensal microbiota. Short-term probiotic administration was shown to enhance the microbial diversity in the saliva microbiome23. In another study, exercise and high protein intake were considered to be associated with higher microbial diversity17. Therefore, in preparing for a sea voyage, the sailing preparation, period and route should be carefully considered. Recommendations for long voyages include adding protein-rich food and food containing probiotics to the food inventory on the ship, docking as often as possible to allow sailors contact with an environment with higher biodiversity and thus enable the individual microbial diversity to be maintained at a relatively high level.",

Approximately 1000 species are estimated to colonise the human mouth, making it the second most complex area of the human body8. The most abundant genera in the buccal mucosa are Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Prevotella, and Veilonella8. In our study, Streptococcus was the most abundant, whereas other genera were not as abundant before voyage, and which was increased after sea voyage. A large number (>100 species) of Streptococci colonise human and animal mucous membranes. However, numerous Streptococci act as opportunistic pathogens, causing infections only in the presence of a weak immunological response by the host24. Not limited in habitat, Streptococci in the oral cavity have a close relationship with the entire body. Group A Streptococci have long been associated with the development of autoimmune sequelae associated with rheumatic fever25. The primary manifestations of rheumatic fever involve the heart, joints, brain, and/or skin. Rheumatic carditis is the most serious of the five streptococcal sequelae and presents with a heart murmur as a result of valve deformation26. S. sanguinis, S. mitis, and S.\ngordonii have also been reported to be correlated with endocarditis27,28,29. S.\ngordonii is also involved in septic arthritis30. Moreover, in the after sea voyage samples, we discovered an increase in the number of species such as S. cristatus, S. pneumoniae and S. anginosus. Zhang et al. reported that S. cristatus attenuates the production of IL-8 stimulated by Fusobacterum nucleatum by blocking NF-kappa B nuclear translocation at the level of I kappa B-alpha degradation31,32. S. pneumoniae is a pathogen that is responsible for a variety of infections, including meningitis, otitis media, bacteraemia, and pneumonia. According to an estimation by the World Health Organisation (WHO), S. pneumoniae is the main cause of pneumonia, a disease that kills annually approximately 1.2 million children under 5 years old, which accounts for 18% of all deaths in this age group33. S. anginosus is part of the human bacteria flora, but it can cause infection under certain circumstances. The appearance of, and increase in, opportunistic pathogens indicate a weaker immune system, suggesting the necessity for creating a health management plan that includes physical exercise, sufficient rest, and a balanced diet to avoid the potential diseases caused by pathogens. Furthermore, it is reported that upper respiratory infections are among the highest morbidity diseases during sea voyages1, which is consistent with the observation of increased pathogens. However, we could not verify the direct correlation between increased pathogens and diseases during the voyage. Because opportunistic pathogens cause respiratory diseases and the air in the ship is recirculated, regularly examining the air circulation system of ships, including air conditioners, is important to avoid an epidemic outbreak during a sea voyage.",

                    "text": "As human's \u201csecond genome\u201d, the genes of the metagenome encode a wide variety of proteins, which participate not only in the proliferation and metabolism of commensal microbiota but also in the metabolism and immune response of the human body. A previous metagenomic study of skin bacteria indicated that commensal Staphylococcus bacteria were enriched in mannitol utilisation, methicillin resistance, the alpha-acetolactate operon, triacylglycerol metabolism, acetoin metabolism, butanediol metabolism and arginine deiminase pathways, suggesting that these microbes are strongly adapted to the exploitation of compounds produced by the human skin34, including sugars, lipids and iron, and by petrobactin-mediated iron uptake systems. TCA-dependent ROS have been demonstrated to enhance the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics, and a propensity for clinical isolates to accumulate TCA cycle dysfunctions presumably as a way to tolerate antibiotics has been revealed35. In the buccal mucosa samples in our study, genes annotated with functions and projected to the KEGG pathways were greatly reduced after the sea voyage. The pathways with decreased expression included the TCA cycle and the three basic metabolic pathways, for carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids. In particular, genes involved in the urea cycle were reduced after the sea voyage. Continuously secreted from saliva and gingival crevicular fluid, urea is rapidly hydrolysed by bacteria in the oral cavity, resulting in ammonia production. The ammonia increases the pH of the oral environment, further changing the plaque biofilm and reducing the occurrence of saprodontia. Thus, the low frequency of genes involved in the urea cycle implies an increased incidence of saprodontia. Genes involved in nutrient metabolism detoxification were also reduced. Insufficient nutrient intake, especially of vitamins, is common during long sea voyages, which has induced diseases such as scorbutus for hundreds of years. Our discoveries revealed a decline in the metabolism or biosynthesis of ascorbate, carotenoid, and vitamin B groups such as folate, riboflavin, and thiamine, reflecting the insufficiency of certain nutrients in the human body. The data above indicate that a necessary step involves reserving ample nutrient supplements on sea voyage ships to prevent these diseases. Furthermore, xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism correlates with the process of detoxification, in which microbes play important roles. Microbes degrade xenobiotics, which are usually caused by the release of industrial compounds. It is not surprising to find a decreased metabolic activity of xenobiotic biodegradation in the marine environment, where there is little industrial pollution. Moreover, investigation of the microbial metabolic activity in the belly button corroborated the results observed in the buccal mucosa. Finally, the vast majority of metabolites in our bodies are believed to not be of human origin, and thus a change in microbial metabolic activity directly influences human health6. However, we lack a clear understanding of whether microbial metabolites influence host biology. This area is therefore promising for future research. As a cofactor, folate is an essential nutritive component of the human diet, providing one carbon donor molecule for the biosynthesis of methionine, purine, and pyrimidine. Epidemiological studies have indicated that a folate deficiency is often associated with an increased risk of breast cancer36. Disrupted folate homeostasis may induce the hypomethylation of DNA, thereby promoting cancer in the proliferating cells of the colorectal mucosa37. Humans take in folate from their diet and from commensal bacteria mainly located in the colon. Some Lactobacilli and other lactic acid bacteria (LAB) contribute most to the synthesis of microbial folate in their human host38. The microbial metabolic analysis revealed that enzymes in the folate biosynthesis pathway were much less abundant in the after sample than in the before sample, implying that less microbial folate was synthesised. In accordance with this observation, our results suggest that Lactobacillus lactis, a major contributor of microbial folate, was reduced after the sea voyage (Figure 3c), suggesting that less microbial folate was produced for the host. Consistently, the medical examination of the seafaring sailors showed that the level of folate in the serum decreased after the ocean voyage. Therefore, evaluating the physical condition of an individual by examining the commensal bacteria is reasonable. Furthermore, bacterial folate plays a role in the host immune system. Kjer-Nielsen39 reported that microbial metabolites derived from folate and riboflavin are ligands for MR1, a molecule that binds and activates mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Thus, MAIT cells use these metabolites to detect microbial infection. Reduced microbial folate could potentially lead to a blind area of microbial infection detection and further influence the host immune response.",

FA exists in fruits and vegetables and is especially rich in green-leaf vegetables, although these foods are difficult to store long-term. As a result, very few fruits and vegetables are consumed during a long sea voyage, leading to FA deficiency in sailors. Our data suggested that FA deficiency could be moderated if ships reached shore regularly to replenish fresh fruits and vegetables and if sailors took a vitamin supplement to provide FA. Thus, these measures are of great importance to ensure that the crew remains healthy. In contrast to FA, VB12 exists in meat and eggs, which are convenient for long-term storage, and thus the VB12 supply is adequate, which explains why no significant differences were observed between sailors and onshore workers. The analysis of HCY showed that HCY was inversely related to FA, a critical cofactor for HCY metabolism. High HCY levels in the blood leads to cardiovascular40 and other diseases, and FA intake is the perfect therapy41. Therefore, providing plenty of FA is a key step in health management for long sea voyages.",

                    "text": "The results of the medical examination of a larger cohort who experienced the same voyage as the volunteers provided another hint regarding the physical condition of sailors. We discovered a decrease in the MCHC. In human adults, red blood cells (RBCs) differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mature in the niche of the bone marrow. VB12 and folate are critical materials for the maturation of RBCs. Combined with the decrease in the genes associated with the biosynthesis of folate in the metagenome and the relatively constant serum concentration of VB12 in sailors (Table 3), it is reasonable to deduce that the inactive biosynthesis of folate in the metagenome may have led to the reduced MCHC. Moreover, the decrease in GRN/LYM indicated a change in the immune system, and the slight increase in ALT indicated a change in liver function. Although the increases in TG and CH were not significant, the tendencies were consistent with a previous report that showed the TG and CH levels were higher in sailors than individuals on land3. The co-occurrence of increased lipid metabolites in the blood of sailors and the decrease in microbial lipid metabolism suggests a potential relationship between the host and commensal microbial metabolism. One possible reason of the elevated TG and CH is the relatively higher fat diet on the ship due to the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. Elevated TG and CH indicated increase risk of obese. Accordingly, in our data it is found that an opportunistic pathogen, Enterobacteriaceae, which is reported to induce obesity in germ-free mice model42, increased after the long sea voyage. However, more data are needed to confirm the above speculation.",

                    "text": "In this study, we employed both 16S rRNA sequencing and WGS to clarify the impact of a long sea voyage on the buccal mucosa and belly button commensal microbiota. We investigated the oral commensal microbiota of sailors who experienced voyages of more than three months with highly intense work, altered diet and circadian biorhythms in an extremely humid and salty environment. Our data illustrated that the microbial diversity was reduced, several pathogens appeared, and the activities of microbial carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolisms were lower. Microbial folate biosynthesis decreased sharply. Taxa analysis showed a large number of unclassified bacteria. Clinical analysis of the cohort showed reduced FA, MCHC and GRN/LYM and increased TG and CH, which are correlated with the changes in the commensal microbiota. Our discoveries indicate that the oral bacteria may reflect the health condition of the host. During a long sea voyage, the natural and working environment could weaken the human immune system and potentially cause disease. However, it is important to note that the analyses described above are a preliminary pilot project with a limited sample size and that more extensive studies are needed to confirm these observations. This article highlights, for the first time, the discovery of a correlation between the haemostasis of the oral mucosa bacteria and human health. Moreover, we analysed the influence of a long sea voyage on human health by examining the commensal microbiota using metagenomic approaches. Future work will focus on the exact factors in the sea voyage that cause the changes in the commensal microbiota on the basis of the metagenomic analysis of a larger sample size.",
