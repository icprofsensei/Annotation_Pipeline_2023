For example, pathogens such as human papilloma virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium nucleatum are all closely associated with cancers [4\u20137]. Collectively, the ubiquitous bacteria living on and in the human body are described as the microbiota. As the second microbiome habitat behind the alimentary canal in the human body, the respiratory tract harbors numerous microbiota, containing an estimated 500 to 700 different species of bacteria [8]. Until recently, the lower respiratory tract was considered sterile, and the detection of microbes was suggestive of microbial infection [9,10]. However, culture-independent methods have proven that the lungs are not sterile even in healthy controls [11,12]. Bacterial colonization in the respiratory tract is considered normal and comprises a complex microbiome [12]. When present at the mucosal sites, microbes can be attributed to part of the tumor microenvironment of airway malignancies, and their toxic metabolites may damage the local immune barrier. Moreover, intratumoral microbes may directly influence the growth and spread of cancer cells in various ways [13].",

Yan et al. [20] have also demonstrated that there are possible associations of saliva microbiota with lung cancer. Particularly, their research found that levels of Capnocytophaga and Veillonella were significantly higher in the saliva from lung cancer patients [20]. However, oral microbiota is susceptible to external environmental factors, such as smoking or household coal burning, which has implications in lung tumor etiology [21]. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is more objective and representative than saliva or sputum in reflecting the microbial environment of the lungs. The potential role of BALF microbiota in lung cancer susceptibility, however, has yet to be defined. To this aim, the present study explored the possible variations of oral and lung microbiota in lung cancer patients and the difference in microbial diversity in samples from the saliva and BALF.",

All of the patients were first examined and clinically diagnosed via case history, chest radiography, and blood tumor marker examinations. Pathology of transbronchial lung biopsy was the most important criterion for patient inclusion in the study because it confirmed the diagnosis and validated the classification of histological pathology. Fifteen healthy controls were recruited as normal controls by advertisement and were reimbursed for their participation. The age composition, lifestyle, and eating habits of the controls were similar to those of the patients. The demographic data of all study participants, such as gender, age, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, pathology type, TNM staging of tumor, and the data from laboratory studies were recorded (Supplementary Table 1). The exclusion criteria for this study were as follows: the participant manifested other basic pulmonary diseases, oral disorders or the presence of removable partial dentures or orthodontic appliances; systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, gastritis, hepatitis and other cancers in addition to PBC; immune-compromising diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or ongoing immunosuppressive therapy; and other diseases known to affect the oral and airway microbiota. Additionally, none of the participants had received glucocorticoid or antibiotic treatment for at least 30 days before sample collection. The saliva and BALF samples were taken in parallel from each enrolled participant after clinical diagnosis and before treatment. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University. All samples were collected according to the approved protocol. Based on the patients\u2019 full understanding of the purpose of this research, written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Patients were notified if their sample was suitable for our study, and additional verbal consent from the participants was also obtained to undertake additional research.",

Nearly all of the rarefaction curves featured 2-component curves that included a sharp slope in the beginning and a flat slope for the remainder (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1A). This result is a sign of sufficient depth and coverage of sequencing for the number of patients enrolled in the present study. The Shannon and Simpson indexes are 2 indicators commonly used for the quantitative description of alpha diversity in community polymorphisms. The Shannon index is in direct proportion to microbial diversity in samples, whereas the Simpson index is negatively correlated with microbiota diversity. As shown in Figure 1B and 1C, the Shannon index was significantly lower in the lung cancer groups than the healthy control group, while the Simpson index was significantly higher than that in the healthy control group (P=0.002 for Shannon index and P=0.033 for Simpson index in the saliva samples and P=6.55e-07 for Shannon and P=2.46e-07 for Simpson in the BALF samples) for samples from the same sites. There was no difference between saliva and BALF samples in the healthy controls (P=0.683 for Shannon index and P=0.354 Simpson index) for the Shannon or Simpson indexes. Nevertheless, there was a significant difference between the saliva and BALF samples in the lung cancer groups (P=0.029 for Shannon index and P=0.004 Simpson index). When the different pathological lung cancer groups were compared, both the Shannon and Simpson indexes were still significantly different in the lung cancer groups if samples were obtained from the same site as the healthy control group (Supplementary Table 3). When stratifying these results by the pathological type of lung cancer with samples from different sites, the only difference was from the comparison of the lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) group with the healthy control group (P=0.011 for Shannon index, P=0.004 for Simpson index, Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C).",

To determine whether the microbiota in samples distinguished PBC patients from healthy controls and whether the diversity of microbiota was associated with the sampling site, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was employed to perform the dimension-reduction treatment of the OTU data set when comparing the overall structure of microbiota collected from different samples and sites. The PCoA analysis results showed that microbiota constitution in both BALF and saliva samples from cancer patients was clearly different than the healthy controls (Figure 1D). PERMANOVA analysis also indicated that the microbial structure in the lung cancer groups was significantly different from that in the healthy control group at the 2 sampling sites (BALF samples: R2=0.070, P=1e-04; saliva samples: R2=0.066, P=1e-04). Furthermore, significant segregation of microbial communities was also observed between different pathological types in the lung cancer groups and the healthy control group regardless of the sampling site (Supplementary Figure 1D for BALF samples and Supplementary Figure 1E for saliva samples).",

A total of 37 phyla were responsible for >99% of all sequence reads, and 3 predominant phyla were Firmicutes (30.90%), Bacteroidetes (30.22%), and Proteobacteria (24.25%) in all samples (Figure 2A). A total of 280 genera were identified across all participants. The 7 most abundant and frequently detected genera that each represented at least 3% in average relative abundance were classified as Prevotella (22.46%), Neisseria (12.07%), Veillonella (10.55%), Streptococcus (9.40%), Haemophilus (4.44%), Capnocytophaga (4.21%) and Fusobacterium (3.50%) (Figure 2B). The constitution of microbiota in BALF and saliva showed great homogeneity, as displayed in Figure 3. The Spearman\u2019s rank correlation rho of relative abundance for both samples was 0.674 in the healthy control group and 0.656 in the lung cancer group (Figure 3A, 3B). We further estimated the proportion of BALF microbiota that come from saliva samples by SourceTracker software, and homogeneity analysis demonstrated that a certain number of bacterial species in BALF come from saliva (Figure 3C, 3D). Certainly, species differences existed between the 2 sources of samples in both the healthy control and lung cancer groups. As shown in Figure 2A, relative abundance analysis at the phylum level indicated that Firmicutes was significantly enriched in BALF samples from patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). Actinobacteria was concentrated in saliva samples from LAC and LSCC patients, while Spirochetes was concentrated in saliva samples from small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. At the genus level (Figure 2B), relative abundance analysis indicated that Pseudomonas was enriched in the BALF samples from LAC and SCLC patients. Veillonella and Corynebacterium were abundant in the BALF samples from LSCC patients as well. In saliva samples, Haemophilus and Streptococcus were found to be enriched in the LSCC patients, Rothia and Actinomyces were enriched in both LAC and LSCC patients, while Treponema was enriched in SCLC patients.",

By comparing the bacterial phyla with mean values greater than 0.1% in at least 1 group, taxa with significant differences between healthy controls and lung cancer patients were considered (Table 2). We observed that Spirochetes, Synergistetes and Tenericutes were 3 common differential phyla for cancer patients regardless of whether the sample was from BALF or saliva. Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were identified as the different phyla in BALF samples, while Actinobacteria was identified in saliva samples. Significant differences in species between the healthy control and lung cancer groups in the BALF and saliva samples at the genus level are displayed in Figure 4A and 4D.",

The selected genera were synthetically evaluated for their incidence in the microbial community and were ordered by using the mean decreasing accuracy and the Gini coefficient. Treponema was selected as the bacterial biomarker candidate with the highest mean decreasing accuracy and the Gini coefficient value among 10 selected genera, while Filifactor was identified as the potential bacterial biomarker in saliva samples. ROC analysis was performed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these potential bacterial biomarkers to evaluate their preclinic utilities. The overall performance of the 2 potential biomarkers in detecting lung cancer and identifying different pathological types of lung cancer (LAC, LSCC, and SCLC) are displayed in Figure 4C and 4F. Treponema generated a ROC value of 85.57% (95% CI: 73.22\u201397.91%) in BALF samples to distinguish between healthy controls and lung cancer patients, while Filifactor obtained a ROC value of 79.74% (95% CI: 68.58\u201390.90%). Further ROC analysis of different pathological lung cancer subtypes is displayed in Supplementary Figure 3 for BALF and saliva samples, and the ROC values are noted next to the ROC curves. We also performed Spearman\u2019s rank correlation analysis to evaluate the potential relationship between the selected genera and the clinical index, which is usually launched as a routine examination for diagnosing lung cancer. The heat map of the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation between microbiota genera and clinical index in BALF and saliva samples is displayed as Figure 5A and 5B, respectively. Clearly, the results of the correlation analysis indicated that significant correlations between Treponema and clinical lung cancer markers, including SCCA, CA125, CK-19, CA-199, and CEA, were observed in the BALF samples. Similarly, Filifactor was associated with CA125, CK-19, and CA-199.",

As shown in Figure 6, we explored the metabolic characteristics and differences in the microbiota of lung cancer from BALF and saliva samples. The metabolic differences in the second and third KEGG pathway levels for the microbiota of lung cancer and healthy controls are displayed. We found that the metabolic characteristics of microbiota varied by sampling site. In general, there were 16 and 13 discrepant maps enriched in the healthy control and lung cancer groups, respectively. Microbes in the BALF of cancer patients always exhibited apparent metabolic behaviors for the signaling of amino acid metabolism, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism. Conversely, several metabolic pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and replication and repair signaling, were activated in healthy individuals. Notably, more functional differences were observed in saliva samples than in healthy controls. Overall, there were 25 and 29 discrepant maps enriched in the saliva samples from the healthy control and lung cancer groups, respectively. Antimicrobial resistance, folding, sorting and degradation, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins and nucleotide metabolism were enriched only in cancer patients. Rather, some metabolic-related signaling pathways, such as amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism and lipid metabolism, were activated in the cancer group, while others were depleted.",

Several studies have demonstrated that microbes and the microbiota may contribute to tumor occurrence, development and progression [12,13,18,20,21,33]. There are 3 approved categories in which microbiota contribute to carcinogenesis. First, microbiota in the local environment disrupted the equilibrium of host cell apoptosis and proliferation at the genetic and metabolic levels. Second, microbiota may impact the host immune surveillance system, and their secondary metabolites may affect the local inflammatory response. Finally, microbiota could influence the metabolic process of pharmaceuticals and host and environment factors [5,13]. In the current study, pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA was employed to evaluate and compare the structure, diversity and metabolic characteristics of saliva and lower respiratory tract microbiota associated with lung cancer and healthy controls in a Chinese population. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to use 16S rDNA approaches to profile and compare the microflora composition and function prediction in saliva and BALF samples and to determine microbiota characteristics, significant discrepancies and biomarkers for the early diagnosis of lung cancer.",

Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to investigate saliva and BALF microbiota in lung cancer patients and studied more than 1700 OTUs, including nearly 300 genera. The \u03b1-diversity analysis results showed that lung cancer patients had less lung and oral microbiota diversity than healthy controls. Microbes may find a tumor\u2019s oxygen tension or carbon sources permissive and take advantage of an underused nutritional niche [4]. Decreased abundances of specific microbes may also increase the risk for cancer development in the host at sites that are local or distant from this microbial shift [13]. The detailed mechanism remains unknown. In healthy controls, no obvious differences in the upper and lower respiratory tract [12] were observed. In the current study, our PCoA results also demonstrated a similar flora composition in both the oral and lower respiratory tract, which expanded the current flora known to the digestive tract. PCoA results also consistently showed that distinct microbiota composition can be identified between and lung cancer and healthy control patients regardless of the sampling site, indicating that remarkable microbial taxa may be found and most likely serve as biomarkers or indicators for lung cancer patients.",

Capnocytophaga species are commonly found in the oropharyngeal tract and the airway of mammals; they are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases as well as some animal bite wounds [34]. Additional specific studies focus on the expression of Capnocytophaga in a large sample of lung cancer patients. Veillonella was also found to be enriched in the BALF of lung cancer, and it was previously isolated from the lower airways of lung cancer patients, suggesting that Veillonella species may be related to lung cancer [35]. Streptococcus is causally linked to chronic lung disease pneumonia and was enriched in the saliva samples [21]. These findings, including ours, seem to suggest that either these bacteria induce a long-term immune response/infection to the organ, or the cancer growth environment favors the growth of these bacteria in the airway or oropharyngeal tracts. When stratifying by pathological type of lung cancer, a significant enrichment in Veillonella and Capnocytophaga was observed in the BALF samples of LSCC patients. Likewise, Capnocytophaga and Actinomyces were specifically validated to be enriched in the LSCC group, and an enrichment of Streptococcus was observed in the SCLC group, while Rothia was also observed to be significantly different in the LAC group. It seems that lung cancer-specific microbial taxa may be pathologically dependent. The microenvironment of the tumor is different from the pathological type of cancer cells, and the great variability of metabolic products and cytokine levels also affected the colonization and growth of bacteria, which contributed to the pathological-specific phenomenon.",

Exposure to xenobiotics, such as carcinogens, insecticides, and drugs, and their deposition in pulmonary tissues were considered as initial factors for lung cancer development [36]. In the present study, xenobiotic biodegradation was enriched in the BALF of lung cancer, including the degradation pathway of atrazine, benzoate, chlorocyclohexane, chlorobenzene, fluorobenzoate, nitrotoluene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and xylene. We can speculate that the enrichment of xenobiotic biodegradation is how microbiota alteration is used to cope with environmentally damaging factors. Although xenobiotic biodegradation is depleted in saliva samples of cancer patients, we cannot entirely deny our previous speculation that oral microbiota is susceptible to multiple influencing factors from the external environment. Further stratification analyses on large sample sizes of different pathological types of cancer patients are promising, and additional research is needed.",

The results of our study indicated that lung cancer patients carry a different and less diverse microorganism community than healthy controls. Certain bacterial taxa might be associated with lung cancer, but the exact species depends on the sampling site and the pathological subtype.
