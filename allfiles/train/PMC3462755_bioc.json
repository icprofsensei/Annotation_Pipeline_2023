Here we describe Serial Illumina Sequencing (SI-Seq): a method for deep sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using next-generation sequencing technology. SI-Seq serially sequences portions of the V5, V6 and V7 hypervariable regions from barcoded 16S rRNA amplicons using an Illumina short-read genome analyzer. SI-Seq obtains taxonomic resolution similar to 454 pyrosequencing for a fraction of the cost, and can produce hundreds of thousands of reads per sample even with very high multiplexing. We validated SI-Seq using single species and mock community controls, and via a comparison to cystic fibrosis lung microbiota sequenced using 454 FLX Titanium. Our control runs show that SI-Seq has a dynamic range of at least five orders of magnitude, can classify >96% of sequences to the genus level, and performs just as well as 454 and paired-end Illumina methods in estimation of standard microbial ecology diversity measurements. We illustrate the utility of SI-Seq in a pilot sample of central airway secretion samples from cystic fibrosis patients.",

Decades of culture-based study have provided a solid foundation for our understanding of microbial physiology, genetics, and evolution, but investigations of microbial ecology have been notoriously difficult due to the small size and vast diversity of microbes. Recent developments of culture-independent methods have illuminated the microbial ecosystems that are found in terrestrial and aquatic environments, as well as those intimately associated with organisms. Of particular interest are microbial ecosystems within the human body (the human microbiome), as they are expected to profoundly impact human health and disease. For example, bacterial communities within human intestines are being studied for their effects on atopic and bowel diseases [1], [2], and altered structure of bacterial communities in the vagina is associated with susceptibility to a plethora of diseases including bacterial vaginosis and sexually transmitted infections [3].",

We clustered starting at the average of these two identities (87%) and repeated the process using identities of 97%, 95%, 93%, 90%, 85%, 83%, and 80%. The consensus sequences for each cluster at each identity cutoff were then classified using the RDP Classifier [14] and the clustering identity that most closely recapitulated the single species input with a low level of false positive classification was chosen. Because 87% was found to be the average nucleotide identity within Pseudomonas and Bacillus, and also had the optimal empirical results with the single species controls, we performed all clustering of SI-Seq data using an identity cutoff of 87%. Seed sequences from each cluster from each community were classified by further clustering with the SI-Seq structured Silva database using USEARCH, with parameters values chosen to ensure the best hit was chosen (--maxaccepts \u200a=\u200a0 and --maxrejects \u200a=\u200a0).",

The resulting SI-Seq library consisted of templates with 16S rRNA V5\u2013V7 amplicons flanked by the barcoded universal 16S rRNA PCR primers flanked by the standard Illumina paired-end adaptors (Figure 1).

Samples for both platforms were taken from the same PCR stock to ensure no PCR bias. Sequence reads from 454 and SI-Seq were filtered for quality and de-barcoded either using QIIME (454) or a pipeline developed in-house (SI-Seq) (as described in Materials and Methods). The range of sequences obtained per sample differed substantially between the two sequencing approaches: between 478 and 11,405 quality reads were obtained using 454, whereas between 38,120 and 859,764 quality reads were obtained using SI-Seq (Table 2). The average length for the 454 reads was 415nt, with 33% of the reads shorter than the average. A rarefaction sampling analysis indicated that the number of reads obtained for each patient sample saturated the community diversity in all cases for the SI-Seq data and in most cases for the 454 data (Figure 5). Both rarefaction analyses suggest that \u223c1,000 sequences would be sufficient for characterizing the majority of bacteria present in these CF lung communities. The saturation of community diversity with such low read numbers indicates that a much higher degree of multiplexing would further reduce per patient sequencing costs without reducing community information.",

We next tested for statistical significance using a Procrustes analyses to determine whether the OTU dissimilarity matrices obtained from each approach were statistically indistinguishable. We applied a variety of distance metrics and found that the match between community profiles generated by 454 and SI-Seq were highly significant regardless of the dissimilarity matrix used (Table 4; Figure S2).",
