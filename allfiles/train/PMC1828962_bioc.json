In this study, we evaluated the difference in oral microbial diversity between children with severe early-childhood caries (S-ECC) and caries-free (CF) controls by means of a cultivation-independent approach called denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Pooled dental plaque samples were collected from 20 children aged 2 to 8 years. Total microbial genomic DNA was isolated from those subjects, and a portion of the 16S rRNA gene locus was PCR amplified by using universal primers. We observed that the mean species richness of the bacterial population was greater in the CF children (n = 12) (42 \u00b1 3.7) than in the S-ECC children (n = 8) (35 \u00b1 4.3); the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.005). The overall diversity of plaque samples as measured by the Shannon index was 3.5 for the S-ECC group and 3.7 for the CF group (P = 0.004). Differences in DGGE profiles were distinguished on the basis of a cluster analysis. Sequence analysis of excised DGGE bands consisted of 2.7 phylotypes, on average. After adjusting for the number of observed bands, we estimated that the S-ECC group exhibited 94.5 total phylotypes and that the CF group exhibited 113.4. These results suggest that the microbial diversity and complexity of the microbial biota in dental plaque are significantly less in S-ECC children than in CF children.",

The cause of S-ECC remains speculative. Formerly, S-ECC was thought to be associated with the prolonged use of a nursing bottle (19), but dietary intake alone may not account for the severe nature of this disease (10, 49). A compelling body of scientific evidence suggests that Streptococcus mutans is a major etiologic agent in the development of S-ECC (5, 20, 46); however, it remains to be determined whether S-ECC is caused by a single or specific consortium of bacteria (6, 46) or whether the biofilm as a whole undergoes a more complicated shift in multiple groups of bacteria, as suggested by several investigators (3, 4, 8, 45).",

Previous studies by our group (24, 25) and others (17, 39, 40) demonstrated the value of a whole-microbiota survey method called denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) to depict the composition of the oral microbiota. With the DGGE approach, specific regions of the 16S rRNA gene locus are amplified by PCR, and the products are run on a denaturing gel that separates amplicons according to nucleotide composition. Different amplicons can then be displayed as bands with different migration distances to yield a distinctive fingerprint representing each of the various bacterial phylotypes or species on a single gradient gel. Microbial profiles of plaque or saliva from different individuals can be compared with a variety of measurement tools, and inferences about shifts in the ecological balance of the biofilm can be made. This approach has been widely used by environmental ecologists to survey entire bacterial communities without cultivation (15, 36, 37) and to analyze gastrointestinal microbial ecosystems (32, 43, 51). Specific bands of interest can be excised from gels, and these fragments of the 16S rRNA gene can be sequenced and compared with known sequences in an rRNA database (11).",

The results were transferred into a microbial database that allowed us to cross-compare multiple DGGE profiles simultaneously.

The final parameters used to analyze the banding patterns included the numbers of the detected band, the band frequency distribution, the Shannon index (H\u2032) for species richness (the number of different distinct bands in any individual lane) and evenness, and levels of pairwise similarity coefficients.

                    "text": "DGGE profiling of the bacterial populations in the plaque of children with S-ECC displayed significantly less diversity than that for the CF controls. This finding suggests that the caries-associated microbiota becomes less diverse, perhaps because certain groups of microbes supplant or dominate the plaque biofilm as caries progresses. The results of this study are consistent with our previous study with adults (24). Although not a focus of the present study, one possible explanation for the lesser microbial diversity in S-ECC plaque is that caries plaques contain higher proportions of acidogenic and aciduric bacteria than caries-free plaques, as some research papers have reported (4, 18, 26, 48). For S-ECC, several studies suggest that this form of caries results predominantly from a mutans streptococcus infection (3, 5, 27). Other, nonmutans streptococcus bacterial groups capable of tolerating low pH have also been found associated with dental caries (47, 48). A recent study that used a DNA-based reverse capture checkerboard assay indicated that more than 10 bacterial species were overabundant in the oral cavities of caries-active children (12). Those bacteria have previously been associated with diseased subjects but not healthy subjects (38). Each individual bacterial species may collectively contribute to the overall cariogenicity of the microbial biocommunity of the dental plaque associated with dental caries (13, 21). Another explanation for the decrease in diversity is that caries lesions create more retentive niches for cariogenic microorganisms, which increase their total numbers of cariogenic bacteria but subsequently decrease the overall richness of the plaque community. This notion was supported by several studies (2, 3, 47). For example, Becker, et al. (3) showed that bacterial levels were significantly increased at each of the caries sites, including white spot, cavitated lesions, and excavated carious dentin, compared to those found on intact enamel surfaces. They also reported that a number of other bacterial species may also be associated with caries initiation and development. Clearly, the concept that dental caries is a polymicrobial infectious disease was well supported by the published literature (7, 8, 28, 33). Further studies, however, are needed to determine whether caries-associated plaques are more or less diverse overall and to elucidate the determinant associated with the microbial composition.",

The delineation of two distinct clusters was reflected by the number of bands detected (richness), the intensity, and the migration distribution of the PCR 16S amplicons. This finding is noteworthy, considering that the S-ECC and CF profiles were generated on multiple gels. Moreover, the overall S-ECC and CF profiles were more similar within each group than between the groups, which suggests the presence of common phylotypes associated with diseased or healthy status. These results demonstrated that caries group can be predicted with reasonable accuracy based on DGGE banding patterns. Even though the molecular fingerprinting profile does not provide immediate discrimination among bacterial species, it does enable the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples and thus facilitates the direct comparison of microbial communities from different samples of interest (35, 36). Additionally, DGGE-generated molecular fingerprinting also allows the study of changes in individual microbial communities over time (25, 30, 31, 44).",

By doing so, we were able to obtain valuable information in three areas: the distribution of gram-positive versus gram-negative microbes, the identification of each amplicon to at least the genus level, and the number of phylotypes represented in each band. Interestingly, we found that on average, each band represented not just one, but 2.7 phylotypes. If we assume that each band present on the DGGE gels from the plaque samples represented 2.7 different phylotypes, it would mean that the overall species richness of the samples for the 20 children as a group is 248.4 (92 \u00d7 2.7) and that the group-specific species richness is 94.5 (35 \u00d7 2.7) for the S-ECC children and 113.4 (42.2 \u00d7 2.7) for the CF children. Since a known limitation of DGGE in most instances is that the identification is based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequences, which may not be sufficient for species-level assignment, this adjusted value could be an overestimation of the actual numbers of phylotypes in the supragingival plaque samples.",

(34) found an average of 32 phylotypes present within caries lesions in which gram-positive species dominated the sample, and they noted that lactobacilli were the most prevalent of all species present. Kroes and coworkers (22) reported an overall diversity of 59 phylotypes from subgingival plaque samples collected from a healthy adult. Paster and colleagues (38) found 215 novel phylotypes in subgingival samples, and on average healthy subjects harbored 72 of the 215 phylotypes of bacteria. They estimated that this number represented only 84% of the total number present based on coverage estimation. An adjusted value of 99 (72 identified plus 27 expected) would be closer to our estimation of 113.4 for caries-free individuals. Becker et al. (3) reported that only 11 phylotypes were present in the tooth surface plaque from a caries-free child. More recently, Aas et al. (1) reported that in five healthy volunteers, 52 species were detected on sound tooth surfaces. This discrepancy in the number of phylotypes among the different studies may be due to differences in sampling methods, sampling sites, the number of clones that were sequenced, and the number of subjects that were included in different studies. In our study, greater species richness was found than in previous studies. Possible reasons could be that we gathered pooled supragingival samples from each child to get better consistency in the plaque sample and that DGGE profiles were obtained and systematically analyzed for all 20 children, i.e., 12 highly caries-active children and 8 caries-free children. Moreover, the bacterial lysis method we employed appears to have yielded a better representation of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms as evident on DGGE profiles (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1).1). Because pooled supragingival plaque is dominated by gram-positive streptococci and that group of bacteria is difficult to lyse, all of the bacterial samples were treated with a cocktail lysis buffer containing mutanolysin, proteinase K, and a lysozyme treatment, which yielded a high quality and concentration of total bacterial genomic DNA and a wide range in the 16S rRNA gene diversity. Sequencing of excised amplicons from DGGE gels further demonstrated that the distribution of the amplicons ranged from low GC content to high GC content (Table \u200b(Table2).2). Since the goal of this study was to evaluate the overall variation in oral microbial diversity in children of different caries status by means of the DGGE technique, we did not conduct extensive cloning or sequence entire sets of bands from each subject to identify all members of the microbial population. If more precise taxonomical identification is required, then the full-length 16S rRNA pool from which the nested DGGE amplicons were generated can be cloned and sequenced.",
