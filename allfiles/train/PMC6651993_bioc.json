Recently, checkpoint blockade immunotherapy targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has shown promising efficacy for treating HCC. In two multicenter, phase 2 studies [3, 4] investigating the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in sorafenib-refractory HCC, the ORR was nearly 20%, which quadrupled that of sorafenib.

Dynamic microbial composition variation was also analyzed. Before treatment initiation, the Gram-positive Firmicutes, Gram-negative Bacteroidetes and Gram-negative Proteobacteria dominated the fecal microbiome of both R and NR, which was in accordance with the findings in healthy adults [9], suggesting that no severe gut microbiome dysbiosis was present in the study group at baseline. Specifically, Bacteroidetes were most abundant, followed by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. As treatment proceeded, microbial composition at the phylum level in R remained relatively stable. However, in NR, Proteobacteria markedly increased as early as Week 3, and became predominant at Week 12 (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1c).1c). Increase of Proteobacteria in NR was mainly attributed to the prevalence of Escherichia coli, while the most notable proteobacterial member in R was Klebsiella pneumoniae. Composition of Bacteroides and Firmicutes also exhibited individual patterns (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S2 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S3). These findings suggested that the dynamic variation characteristics of gut-microbial diversity and composition at the early treatment period of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in HCC may have distinct implications on drug efficacy and disease prognosis.",

Twenty R-enriched species and fifteen NR-enriched species were identified (Fig.\u00a02a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S4). Among the R-enriched species, four Lactobacillus species (L. oris, L. mucosae, L. gasseri, and L. vaginalis), Bifidobacterium dentium and Streptococcus thermophilus were probiotic lactic acid bacteria, which were beneficial to host metabolism and immunity by inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and accompanying spoilage agents. Oral administration of Bifidobacterium could improve tumor control efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)-specific antibody therapy [10]; Coprococcus comes, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus, and Subdoligranulum sp. also possessed probiotic potential, as they were reported to be related with dietary fiber digestion and short-chain fatty acid production. Notably, enrichment of one Lachnospiraceae and two Ruminococcaceae species (Lachnospiraceae bacterium 7_1_58FAA, Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus bromii) and Akkermansia muciniphila in R was also observed. Commensal A.muciniphila and Ruminococcaceae benefited host health by preventing increases in intestinal permeability and systemic immunosuppression. In previous studies, a significantly higher relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was identified in melanoma patients responding to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy [7], and oral supplementation with A. muciniphila could restore the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy [8]. In the present study, the SparCC algorithm was applied to gain insights into the mutualistic networks between R-enriched and NR-enriched species (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2b).2b). The number of significant positive-correlation pairs and the correlation strengths in R-enriched species were higher than those of NR-enriched species. Among the R-enriched bacteria, the four Lactobacillus species were most significantly correlated with each other, indicating their possible pivotal roles in the network. Our findings further indicated the biological significance of particular bacterial strains during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in HCC and may provide support for the development of a gut-microbiome-modulation scheme in immunotherapy.",

A total of 189 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) were identified to be enriched in R (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, P\u2009<\u20090.05). Significant positive correlations were identified between 123 R-enriched KOs and 18 R-enriched species (Spearman\u2019s correlation, rho\u2009>\u20090.5, Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Table S1). Pathway identification of KOs verified the potential bioactivities of R-enriched species (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2c2c and Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Figure S5). In detail, the cellobiose-transport system (ko02010) was significantly correlated with B. dentium; the pectin lyase (K01732), which may be involved in pectin metabolism, was correlated with A. muciniphila. Both cellulose and pectin have been highlighted for their prebiotic and anti-inflammatory potential as dietary fibers [11, 12]. Methanogenesis pathway (ko00680) was found to be correlated with R. obeum and the four Lactobacillus species. Methane generated in human gastrointestinal tract has been reported to ameliorate oxidative stress injury and suppress the host inflammatory response [13]. Other pathways with potential benefits included sulfate reduction (ko00920) and carbon fixation (ko00720) functions that were correlated with R. obeum, carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906) correlated with B. cellulosilyticus and A. colihominis, and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism (ko00590) associated with C. comes (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Table S2). Such findings further illustrated the potential underlying mechanisms of gut microbiome influencing the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy in HCC patients.",

In the present study, patients were enrolled with strict criteria to minimize potential dietary or geographical influences during the whole course of treatment, as well as to ensure that the dynamic changes of gut microbiota in both R and NR were attributed to the therapeutic intervention instead of any daily factors.",

To further elucidate this relationship, several strategies have been developed. Firstly, \u2018meta-omic\u2019 analysis combining sequencing and multiple biochemical techniques can greatly advance the knowledge of the human microbiome and its specific role in governing disease states. For example, Gopalakrishnan et al. compared the tumor-associated immune infiltrates via multi-parameter immunohistochemistry (IHC) and found a statistically significant positive correlation between CD8+ T cell infiltrate in the tumor and the Faecalibacterium genus as well as the Ruminococcaceae family, suggesting a possible mechanism through which the gut microbiome may modulate anti-tumor immune responses [7]. More importantly, in vitro or in vivo experimental models are required in order to allow the systematic manipulation of variables and, thus, allow experimental testing and validation of results derived from meta-omics [16]. In our previous study, we had demonstrated that Behcet\u2019s disease (BD), a kind of autoimmune disorder, was associated with considerable gut microbiome changes [17]. To determine whether the gut microbiome contributes to development of this disease, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed in mice undergoing autoimmune uveitis. We demonstrated that mice colonized with whole-gut microbiomes from BD patients showed an exacerbation of disease activity and an excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results may confirm the hypothesis that specific bacterial patterns contributed to the development of intraocular inflammatory disease. In our future studies, similar meta-omics strategies, as well as the use of mouse FMT models, will also be incorporated in order to deeply explore the interaction between the gut microbiome and host responses to immunotherapies among HCC patients.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the association between the gut microbiome and the response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for HCC. Furthermore, while previous studies had mostly only provided cross-sectional comparisons, the present study showed the different trajectories of microbiome shifts between R and NR and revealed a stronger stability of the gut microbiome in R during the whole course of treatment. We believe that the potential of the gut microbiota as a therapeutic target is indicated in this study, and that the relevant bacterial species and metabolic pathways revealed here could be developed as a modulation strategy for better treatment options for HCC patients.",
