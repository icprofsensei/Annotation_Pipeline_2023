Previous culture-based studies\nhave found staphylococci, streptococci, and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in LCL\nlesions, but there have been no comparisons to normal skin. In addition, this\napproach has strong bias for determining bacterial composition. The present study\ntested the hypothesis that bacterial communities in LCL lesions differ from those\nfound on healthy skin (HS). Using a high throughput amplicon sequencing approach,\nwhich allows for better populational evaluation due to greater depth coverage and the\nQuantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology pipeline, we compared the\nmicrobiological signature of LCL lesions with that of contralateral HS from the same\nindividuals.Streptococcus,\nStaphylococcus,Fusobacterium and other strict or\nfacultative anaerobic bacteria composed the LCL microbiome. Aerobic and facultative\nanaerobic bacteria found in HS, including environmental bacteria, were significantly\ndecreased in LCL lesions (p < 0.01). This paper presents the first comprehensive\nmicrobiome identification from LCL lesions with next generation sequence methodology\nand shows a marked reduction of bacterial diversity in the lesions.",

(2012) evaluated the role of skin\nmicrobiota on local immunity using germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen free (SPF) mice in\na model of dermal infection induced by L. major. GF mice infected\nintradermally with L. major showed smaller lesions with reduced oedema and\nnecrosis compared to SPF mice, however with higher parasite load in the lesion. These\noutcomes were associated with a smaller production of interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis\nfactor-alpha by cutaneous T-cell and demonstrated the role of skin microbiota in\nLeishmania infection control. Previous studies comparing GF and\nconventional (microbiota-bearing) mice infected subcutaneously with L.\nmajor (revised by Lopes et al. 2016)\ndemonstrated GF mice failed to heal lesions and presented higher parasite load at the\ninfection site than conventional mice. The cytokine production profile did not differ in\nboth; however macrophages from GF mice were not as efficient at killing parasites as\nconventional mice, suggesting an important role of microbiota in macrophage activation\n(Oliveira et al. 2005). Vieira et al. (1998) also found similar results with GF mice failing to\nresolve lesions after 13 weeks of L. major infection, in contrast with the\nconventional mice. Despite this, the cytokine profiles were indistinguishable in both\ngroups. GF mice macrophages, albeit capable of producing nitric oxide (NO) in response to\nleishmanial infection, were no able to destroy the parasites. Absence of the normal\nindigenous microbiota was suggested as cause of increased susceptibility to L.\nmajor infection (Vieira et al.\n1998).",

Furthermore, culture-independent tests revealed a much greater\ndiversity in skin bacterial communities compared to culture-based estimations (Grice & Segre 2011, Rhoads et al. 2012, Scales & Huffnagle\n2013). The use of massive molecular methods allows deep insights into the\nmicrobiome-composition in general and also in the LCL microbiome because it is more\nsensitive than culture, as described for other chronic wounds (Rhoads et al. 2012). Our hypothesis is that bacterial communities in\nLCL lesions differ from those on contralateral healthy skin (HS). Thus, our aim was to\ncharacterise the LCL lesion microbiome and to compare it to that found on HS, in the same\nindividuals, using next generation sequencing.",

Our results showed that cutaneous microbiological signatures in human\nleishmaniasis lesions from patients living in an area with high predominance of\nL. braziliensis transmission (up to 95%) (Rosa et al. 1988) exhibit restricted bacterial diversity compared to\nthose of HS. Three out of 10 patients did not show positive results in PCR. In these\ncases, it was not possible to identify the implicatedLeishmania. Two of\nthese patients did not show delayed healing, but presented parasites in\nhistopathological examination (patient 3) and culture (patient 7). The negative results\nof patients 3 and 7 in the PCR could be explained by the presence of inhibitors in the\nisolated DNA of these patients, which hamper the amplification of target DNA in the PCR\nreaction. Different samples could also be used in the PCR and other tests (histology and\nculture) which caused this conflict in the results. Only patient 10 showed delayed\nhealing and had negative results in the direct tests, suggesting that the PCR and other\ntests had insufficient sensitivity for this patient diagnosis. Although we did not\nidentify otherLeishmania species in these patients, it is likely they\nwere infected with L. braziliensis or L. amazonensis.\nAs only, these two species were identified in human cases from this endemic area.\nHowever, L. amazonensis is mainly associated with other clinical\nmanifestation as DCL (Costa et al. 2009).",

High bacterial diversity is associated with host\nprotection, by innate and adaptive immune system modulation (Grice et al. 2010, Grice & Segre\n2011, Kong & Segre 2012). The\ninflammation triggered by the innate immune system provides a suitable environment to\nsome commensal bacteria, which could resist to the subjacent inflammation promoted\nbyLeishmania and hampering development of less adapted bacteria.",

The other patient with delayed healing was excluded from\nanalysis due to sequencing issues. These three genera were found in HS samples from the\nsame patients; however, Streptococcus andFusobacterium\nshowed a lower prevalence in HS and presented a high increase in LCL lesions. These\nspecies alone seem not to influence healing time as observed in patients 1 and 2. These\nfindings suggest a synergistic effect of these three genera on the healing process of\nLCL lesions. This was an interesting observation in our study; however it must be\nconfirmed by further studies due the small number of analysed patients with delayed\nhealing.",
