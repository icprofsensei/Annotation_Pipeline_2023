We evaluated neurogenic bowel management and changes in the gut microbiota in patients with TCSCI as well as associations between these changes and serum biomarkers. Fresh fecal and clinical data were collected from 20 male patients with TCSCI and 23 healthy males. Microbial diversity and composition were analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Moderate NBD was observed in patients with TCSCI. The diversity of the gut microbiota was lower in patients with TCSCI than in healthy adults. Furthermore, patients with TCSCI showed altered levels of serum biomarkers related to lipid metabolism, indicating unfavorable lipid profiles. Interestingly, Firmicutes had a positive effect and Verrucomicrobia had a negative effect on lipid metabolism (P < 0.05). At the genus level, Bacteroides and Blautia were significantly more abundant in patients than in healthy subjects and could be associated with lipid metabolism (P < 0.05). Faecalibacterium, Megamonas, and Prevotella, which were correlated with lipid metabolism markers, may be suitable targets for the treatment of TCSCI. Lactobacillus was positively correlated with glucose levels. The dysbiosis of several key gut bacteria was associated with serum biomarkers of lipid metabolism in patients with TCSCI. The observed interdependency of the microbiota and lipid metabolism provides a basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying lipid disorders after cervical SCI.",

Despite a recent increase in survival rates, the quality of life remains poor for patients with TCSCI, as cervical injuries often result in paralysis and bowel dysfunction. Neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) is a major physical and psychological problem in patients with SCI. The two main manifestations of NBD are constipation (in 40-58% of patients) and fecal incontinence (in 2-61% of patients) [3-5]. Patients with chronic cervical SCI tend to spend more time evacuating their bowels than healthy individuals. An effective bowel program should address issues of fecal incontinence, constipation, and effective evacuation. In the current study, we documented neurogenic bowel management in male patients with chronic TCSCI at our center.",

                    "text": "The human intestinal tract is colonized by thousands of bacteria species whose number and genetic content exceed those of the host by factors of 10- and 150-fold, respectively [6]. These taxa are critical for normal digestion, nutrient absorption, metabolism, and cell function [7,8]. Common causes of gut dysbiosis include antibiotic use, prolonged stress, and gastrointestinal dysfunction [7-10]. Most patients with acute complete SCI have substantial changes in physiological processes after injury, such as the excessive growth of bacteria and the displacement of the intestinal flora, making the intestines the largest \u201cendotoxin pool\u201d in the human body. In addition, cervical SCI often requires antibiotic treatment due to compounding factors, such as pulmonary infection. The use of antibiotics also affects healthy intestinal micro-ecological systems [11-14]. Gut dysbiosis is highly likely in TCSCI. Few clinical studies have evaluated the intestinal microecology after cervical SCI. In a clinical study of intestinal microbes in 30 patients with SCI and 10 healthy controls using 16S rRNA technology, Gungor et al. detected significantly fewer butyrate-producing members in patients with SCI than in healthy individuals [14].",

Patients with SCI have a high incidence of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease [15]. The adverse lipid profile in men with SCI compared with control subjects results from physical inactivity with low maximum oxygen uptake levels depending on the injury level [16,17]. In previous studies, differences were found between the lipoprotein profiles of men with SCI and those of male controls. Among men with SCI, tetraplegia was associated with higher levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides (TG) and lower levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Similarly, paraplegia was associated with high total cholesterol (TCHO) and LDL [18]. In the current study, we report the lipid profiles of patients with chronic TCSCI at our center.",

Profiling of the predictive urine microbiota was performed using PiCRUSt based on the Greengenes database, accessed August 13, 2013 [22]. The KW rank sum test and pairwise Wilcoxon test were used for the identification of the different markers, and LDA was used to score each feature in LEfSe analysis. The index of alpha diversity was calculated with QIIME based on sequence similarity of 97%. Beta diversity was measured by unweighted UniFrac distance, which was also calculated by QIIME. Hierarchical clustering was performed, and a heatmap was generated using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient as a distance measure and a customized script developed in the R statistical package. The output file was further analyzed using the Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles software package (version 2.1.3) [23].",

A total of 746 OTUs were recognized. No significant differences in OTU abundance (ACE or Chao1 index; Student\u2019s t-test, P = 0.78 and 0.76, respectively) were observed between healthy males and patients with cervical SCI.

In total, 495 of the 760 OTUs were shared between the two cohorts (Figure 1C). A principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) of phyla and a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NIMDS) of OTUs revealed significant differences in bacterial community composition between the two groups (Figure 1D, \u200b,1E).1E). ANOSIM/Adonis revealed significant differences in the structure of the gut microbiota between the two groups (ANOSIM, r\n2 = 0.4532, P = 0.001; Figure 1F).

RDA/CCA showed that GLU (P = 0.047, r2 = 0.1475), HDL (P = 0.032, r2 = 0.1547), APOA1 (P = 0.001, r2 = 0.5067), and LPA (P = 0.001, r2 = 0.2143) significantly affected bacterial composition at the phylum level. In the top 20 genera, HDL (P = 0.035, r2 = 0.1508) and APOA1 (P = 0.002, r2 = 0.2785) significantly affected bacterial composition. Linear regression of the factors showed association between the serum levels of GLU, LPA on phylum level and HDL, APOA1 on genus level according to PCoA (Figure 4A-D). We found that serum biomarkers GLU, HDL, APOA1, and LPA had significant correlations with the microbial community structure (P < 0.05).",

The lipid metabolism in the COG functional database and lipid metabolism (level 2) and fatty acid metabolism (level 3) in the KEGG metabolic pathways were significantly decreased in the cervical SCI group when compared with healthy males. To our knowledge, microbiome studies targeting lipid profiles in patients with cervical SCI are non-existent and the results of this study suggest that gut microbiome dysbiosis ha implications in cervical SCI.",

In the current study, traffic accidents (50%), bruises by heavy objects (20%), and falls from heights (15%) were the main causes of injury. The average age of patients with cervical SCI in this study was 39.9 years old, which is considered the prime of life and the period when individuals also particularly susceptible to accidental injuries. Wu et al. reported that the male/female ratio for TCSCI is 5/1 [25].

In previous studies, no significant correlation was detected between the prevalence of gastro-intestinal symptoms and injury level in SCI [28-30]. However, our study included only hospitalized patients with complete cervical SCI, and the prevalence of NBD was therefore higher owing to the limited physical activity. The average NBD score was 11.17, which is considered moderate [31]; the average defecation time was 41 min, which was similar to the 31-45 min reported in 72-80% patients in a previous study [26,27]. The main technique for fecal evacuation was suppository and supplementary interventions were abdominal massage and digital anus-rectal stimulation; 60% of patients were in bed during evacuation and 95% patients needed help to complete evacuation; constipation and bloating were common symptoms in those patients. Due to the absence of nervous control in patients with cervical SCI, NBD results in constipation, incontinence, and discoordination of defecation [3]. Patients with cervical SCI who participated in this study had serious symptoms of NBD, severely affecting the quality of life. Despite bowel management measures, but gastrointestinal problems were not completely addressed. The gut microbiota provides a potential target to address this problem.",

The risk factors for cardiovascular disease include unfavorable lipid profiles, such as high concentrations of TC, LDL, and TG and low concentrations of HDL in individuals with tetraplegic SCI [18,32-36]. We found that differences in lipid profiles between groups; the serum biomarkers TG, TCHO, LDL, APOB, LPA, and NEFA were higher while HDL and APOA1 were lower in the SCI group than in healthy males. The serum biomarkers TCHO, LDL, APOA1, APOB, LPA, and NEFA showed a significant difference between SCI and healthy male groups, indicating that the patients with SCI in our study exhibited dyslipidemia. This may be explained by inactivity and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system of patients with cervical SCI. Inactivity is associated with higher insulin resistance, increased occurrence of glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus, and reduced activity of the lipoprotein lipase. This could be related to decreased body fat, increased cardiovascular fitness, and associated metabolic changes [37,38]. Different serum catecholamine levels resulting from the impairment of the sympathetic nervous system have been observed in patients with SCI. Schmid et al. found that the lower the noradrenaline values, the lower the HDL [18]. LDL is also correlated with levels of catecholamines and particularly with levels of adrenaline [18]. After SCI, sympathetic tone diminishes, reducing the resting metabolic rate, which could decrease lipid metabolism [39].",

Multiple linear regression and PCoA showed associations between the serum levels of GLU and LPA and taxa at the level of phyla and between HDL and APOA1 and taxa at the genus level. Additionally, the serum biomarkers GLU, HDL, APOA1, and LPA were significantly correlated with the microbial community structure. In the SCI group, the phylum Firmicutes decreased significantly, consistent with the results of Gungor et al. [14], who showed that butyrate-producing taxa are specifically reduced in patients with SCI when compared with healthy subjects. Short-chain fatty acids, particularly butyrate, have potent anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages [40], which contributes to secondary tissue damage and axonal retraction following SCI [41,42]. In our study, the abundance of fatty acid metabolism in level 3 of the KEGG metabolic pathway hierarchy in the 16S rRNA functional prediction was significantly decreased in the SCI group, suggesting that reduced levels of butyrate may contribute to macrophage-mediated neurotoxicity in these patients. The low butyrate levels may have an impact on long-term recovery after cervical SCI. Moreover, we found that the prevalence of [Eubacterium]_rectale, a butyrate-producing bacterial genus [43], in the SCI group was positively correlated with APOA1 and negatively correlated with TG. The decreased APOA1 and increased TG indicate that [Eubacterium]_rectale may affect lipid metabolism via these factors.",

There is a very close correlation between ApoA1 and HDL cholesterol (HDLC), and ApoA1 is a protective factor for atherosclerosis [49]. ApoA1 activates key enzymes in cholesterol metabolism. Thus, the reduced serum levels of APOA1 and HDL might lead to a blood lipid metabolism disorder and have a negative effect on SCI recovery.",

These key bacteria were associated with serum biomarkers of lipid metabolism. Bacteroides is a gram-negative bacterium, accounting for more than 1/4 of the adult intestinal flora with important roles in the health of hosts. When immunity is low, bacterial proliferation and translocation can cause endogenous infections [50,51]. In our study, Bacteroides was negatively correlated with APOA1, indicating that increased Bacteroides may have adverse effects in immune-compromised patients with cervical SCI. Blautia produces short-chain fatty acids [50]. Blautia was positively correlated with UA and HDL, suggesting that increased Blautia in the SCI group may improve lipid metabolism in these patients.",

Species in the genus can utilize acetate CoA-transferase to affect butyrate synthesis [52]. Butyrate has histone deacetylase activity and signals via GRP43 and GRP109a, thereby influencing brain function or structure [53]. In this study, Faecalibacterium was negatively correlated with UA, TG, LDL, and APOB. The protein APOB is synthesized in the liver and accounts for 97% of the total protein content of LDL. APOB can directly reflect the level of LDL [35]. Decreased Faecalibacterium was correlated with increased levels of TG, LDL, and APOB, which is harmful for lipid metabolism, suggesting that this genus is beneficial for lipid metabolism.",

In addition, an increase in the proportion of Lactobacillus can increase insulin secretion [57]. Therefore, the increased Lactobacillus may have a protective effect in patients with cervical SCI by the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Vogt et al. reported that a high abundance of Dialister is associated with less Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, suggesting that these bacterial taxa have protective effects against the development or progression of AD [58]. In the current study, Dialister was negatively correlated with LDL, TCHO, and LPA and positively correlated with HDL. Elevations of these serum markers indicate high blood lipids, which are harmful to health. Together, our observations revealed that carbohydrate, lipid, and fatty acid metabolism were damaged in patients with cervical SCI. This suggests that improvements in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in patients can correspond with an improvement in the composition of the gut microbiota. Moreover, therapies targeting the gut microbiota can be used to evaluate and modulate patient metabolism.",

However, individual differences in diet-associated flora could not be determined; this remains a major weakness of our study. We found that gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with serum lipid profiles in male patients with cervical complete SCI and used 16S rRNA sequencing to predict the dysfunctional components of lipid metabolism in these patients. This is the first comprehensive investigation of the correlations between gut dysbiosis and serum biomarkers in patients with TCSCI. This study could contribute to the development of novel strategies for improving conditions of patients with TCSCI. However, further genomic and metagenomic analyses are required to determine the precise functional changes caused by the SCI-mediated dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and the effects of those changes on serum lipid profiles. Further work, including animal experiments and longitudinal human studies, are needed to determine the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and cervical SCI. Determining the role of the gut microbiota in the progression or maintenance of SCI may lead to novel interventional approaches that can alter or restore a healthy gut bacterial composition or to the identification of microbial metabolites that are protective against cervical SCI.",
