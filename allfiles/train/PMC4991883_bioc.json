Of the 4,369 metabolites detected, 12% were unique to CFPE samples; however, the only known metabolites significantly elevated at exacerbation across the dataset were platelet activating factor (PAF) and a related monacylglycerophosphocholine lipid. Due to the personalized nature of the sputum metabolome, a single patient was followed for 4.2 years (capturing four separate exacerbation events) as a case study for the detection of personalized biomarkers with metabolomics. PAF and related lipids were significantly elevated during CFPEs of this patient and ceramide was elevated during CFPE treatment. Correlating the abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons to metabolomics data from the same samples during a CFPE demonstrated that antibiotics were positively correlated to Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas, while ceramides and other lipids were correlated with Streptococcus, Rothia, and anaerobes.",

Mutations in CFTR result in airway mucus buildup and chronic airway infections. CF patients experience intermittent pulmonary exacerbations (CFPE), events that are poorly defined clinically, but known to lead to lung function decline and accelerated disease progression (Goss & Burns, 2007). A CFPE is characterized as an acute increase in symptom severity, such as dyspnea, cough, sputum production, chest pain, fevers, acute and chronic sinusitis, and occasionally hemoptysis (Dakin et al., 2001; Goss & Burns, 2007; Bilton et al., 2011; Stenbit & Flume, 2011). Exacerbations require an increased use of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and lung clearance therapies. These events decrease the quality of life of CF patients and a higher CFPE frequency is correlated with poor outcomes in one and three-year probability of death studies (De Boer et al., 2011; Aaron et al., 2014; Habib et al., 2015). CFPEs are challenging to predict (Rogers et al., 2011). Clinicians rely on symptoms common across patients or those that a single patient has previously experienced to provide some indication that a CFPE is occurring. Biomarkers that predict pulmonary exacerbations are needed to supplement existing clinical and physiological assessments (Rogers et al., 2011; Stenbit & Flume, 2011).",

With appropriate rigor and validation, metabolites are particularly good biomarkers, because they are easily detectable with analytical methods and can reflect imbalances in microbial or host metabolism that may explain disease pathology (Koulman et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013). For example, ceramide has been observed to accumulate in the epithelium of CFTR knockout mice (Teichgr\u00e4ber et al., 2008; Brodlie et al., 2010), with follow up studies linking CFTR to ceramide regulation (Bodas et al., 2011). The fermentation product 2,3-butanedione has been detected in the breath gas of CF patients; its source traced to streptococcal metabolism in the lung (Whiteson et al., 2014). Microbial growth signatures have also had value as predictive of exacerbation (Twomey et al., 2013; Carmody et al., 2013; Quinn et al., 2015a), although some studies find little change in microbial activity (Stressmann et al., 2011; Fodor et al., 2012). More comprehensive studies of metabolic and microbial changes through CFPE are needed, as well as an assessment of the molecular similarity across patients, to determine whether universal biomarkers can be identified or if a more personalized approach is required.",

Treating physicians determined which patients would be selected for the study, whether or not they were presenting with an exacerbation (principally based on the Fuchs criteria (Fuchs et al., 1994)), and the subsequent treatment regime. Samples were classified as \u2018exacerbation,\u2019 according to the clinicians diagnosis of the need for intravenous antibiotic administration, \u2018treatment,\u2019 as any sample collected during the 14 day treatment course, \u2018post-treatment,\u2019 as samples collected immediately after treatment course, and \u2018stable,\u2019 as samples collected during routine clinical visits that were not known at the time to be during an exacerbation. Sample collection involved an initial saline mouth rinse followed by expectoration of sputum into a sputum cup after inhalation of 7% hypertonic saline for 30 min and then syringe homogenized according to Lim et al. (2013). Two different sample sets were collected for assessment of metabolome similarity in different clinical states or between patients, one in 2012 and another in 2014 (Table S1). For a separate and more in depth longitudinal analysis, another sample set was collected from a single patient through 1,492 days (n = 37 sputa, Table S2). This sample set captured four separate exacerbation events, including samples that were collected daily for 14 days through treatment of the second exacerbation. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiles were previously published on sputum samples from this daily collection of the second CFPE event (Quinn et al., 2015a) and this data is also utilized in this study (see methods below and Table S2).",

The 2012 and 2014 sputum datasets were processed and analyzed separately due to batch effects, and global similarity between patient and clinical state was only compared within each dataset. The metabolomes for dataset 1 and 2 were analyzed with a Bray\u2013Curtis distance matrix separately using the vegan package in R (Oksanen et al., 2015). Each distance matrix was then projected with nMDS to visualize clinical state and patient metabolome similarity. The distance matrices were tested for similarity between the two classifiers using ANOSIM and PerMANOVA (adonis) from the vegan package in the R statistical software. The ANOSIM R statistic is a permutation test of the null hypothesis that within group variation is not greater than between group variation; an R-value above 0.4 is considered sufficient to reject the null hypothesis. The PerMANOVA test is a non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance using a pseudo-F-test. Here the larger the value of F the greater likelihood the null hypothesis of no differences between group variations is false and the p-value comes from permutations. We used the ANOSIM R and PerMANOVA F to test whether the metabolomic data classified more strongly by patient or clinical state.",

In order to do so a novel algorithm was used, which employs robust methodologies to overcome difficulties in identifying the same metabolite across multiple data sets (details in Supplemental Information 1). With this unified MS1 spectral data matrix, a supervised random forest using clinical state as the classifier produced a variable importance plot that identified differentially abundant features across clinical states. Ten features were identified as especially able to differentiate between the clinical states. These features were tested for significant differences using an ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s test of significance (p < 0.05) and corrected for multiple comparisons. Biomarkers in the CF1 longitudinal dataset were identified first using a random forests classification based on disease state. The variable importance plot (VIP) of these random forests was then used to identify the 30 most differential features across the clinical states. These 30 features were then subjected to a one-way ANOVA and a Tukey\u2019s test of significance with a Bonferroni correction (30 features compared for CF1 dataset, p < 0.00167).",

Technical variability of this method within a single run was assessed using multiple extractions of the same sample and on different days, revealing a highly reproducible method within a LC-MS/MS batch (Fig. S1, Supplemental Information 1 and 3). The data was analyzed with the molecular networking algorithm that identifies unique MS/MS spectra (a proxy for molecules) available through the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking database (GNPS, gnps.ucsd.edu, (Watrous et al., 2012)). A total of 4,639 unique MS/MS spectra were detected in the sample set. Exacerbation samples had 556 unique metabolites, Tr samples contained 132, Pt samples contained 781, St samples contained 100, and 1,222 metabolites were common across all clinical states (Fig. 1A).",

Due to these LC-MS/MS batch effects, the similarity of each metabolome could not be compared across the two datasets, only within each dataset. Therefore, a Bray\u2013Curtis distance matrix was generated on the metabolite abundance matrix for each sample set separately and visualized with non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) (Fig. 1B). The metabolomes were tested for similarity within the patient or clinical state classifiers using the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and permutation multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) (Fig. 1B and Table 1). The metabolomes clustered more strongly by patient than clinical state for both datasets (Fig. 1B). The ANOSIM statistic R (a measure of the difference of mean ranks between and within groups) was higher by patient classification than clinical state (for both datasets patient R > 0.4, Table 1). The PerMANOVA F-test verified this trend (for both datasets patient F \u2265 2.0, Table 1). This untargeted metabolomics analysis demonstrated that although there were a large number of unique molecules belonging to each clinical state, particularly exacerbation, the overall data did not reveal similarity in these clinical states across patients.",

Although the majority of metabolites unique to exacerbation were patient specific, some were significantly elevated across patients. These were identified using a supervised random forests (Liaw & Wiener, 2002) approach with the samples classified by clinical state on the merged abundance matrix between the two sample sets. Data from both sets were merged using a novel algorithm expressly designed to overcome inter-batch m\u2215z and retention time variations in order to maximize the number of metabolites common to both sets (see Supplemental Information 1). The variable importance plot revealed eight metabolites had a mean decrease in accuracy of classification above 4, indicating they were highly enriched in a particular disease state, the remaining metabolites contributed less to the classification (Fig. S2). Of these eight metabolites, MS/MS spectral matching and GNPS library searching allowed putative annotations for two. Platelet activating factor (m\u2215z524.36 (M + H+)) was significantly more abundant in Ex than Tr and Pt states, but not during St (Tukey\u2019s test of ANOVA, Ex\u2013Tr p = 0.021, Ex\u2013Pt p = 0.022, Fig. 2).

Known spectra detected in the CF1 longitudinal dataset were identified through the GNPS molecular networking workflow and library searching and their abundances tracked through time (Figs. 3A and \u200band3B).3B). The abundance of PAF, Lyso-PAF and a monoacylglycerophosphocholine lipid Lyso-PC (1-O-hexadecyl-2-C-methyl-3-phosphatidylcholine) were monitored through the data set and revealed fluctuations in the abundance of these metabolites through time (Fig. 3A). PAF and Lyso-PAF were elevated during Ex and Tr and the Lyso-PC was elevated during a 6-month period of stability (Fig. 3A). A Tukey\u2019s test of a one-way ANOVA for each molecule across the clinical states Ex, Tr and St (no Pt samples were available from this patient) showed that PAF and Lyso-PAF were significantly more abundant during Ex than during St (PAF p = 0.035, Lyso-PAF p = 0.039), but not Tr (Fig. 3C). PAF and Lyso-PAF abundance was highly correlated through the sampling period (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.96, p < 0.0001), but not Lyso-PC (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.25, p = 0.13). Sphingolipids were also identified in this patient through GNPS library searching including ceramide, sphingomyelin and sphingosine. Ceramide was especially elevated during treatment of an exacerbation (Fig. 3B). The Tukey\u2019s test revealed that this molecule was significantly more abundant during Tr compared to St (p = 0.0008, Fig. 3D). Ceramide and sphingosine were significantly correlated in their abundances (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.53, p = 0.0007), but sphingomyelin and ceramide were not (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.27, p = 0.10).

Therefore, abundances of Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Streptococcus, Rothia and anaerobes (Veillonella, Prevotella, Gemella and Oribacterium) from the published data were regressed against the metabolite abundances in the same CFPE1 samples (n = 16). Statistically significant Pearson correlations (p < 0.05) were visualized by networking analysis using Pearson\u2019s r as the edge values, such that molecules that were positively correlated with a particular bacterial genus would be connected in the network (Fig. 5). The network topology revealed that there were 168 molecular features significantly correlated with Pseudomonas abundance, 66 with Stenotrophomonas, 46 with Streptococcus, 23 with Rothia, and 22 with anaerobes. The network topology showed two groups of molecules, those that correlated with either Stenotrophomonas or Pseudomonas and those that correlated with Streptococcus, Rothia, and anaerobes (Fig. 5). A number of molecules were correlated to more than one bacterium, but there were no correlations between these two groups of bacteria. This indicated that there were two microbial and molecular communities in this patient during this exacerbation, one associated with Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas and one with Gram-positives and anaerobes. These two communities have been previously identified as the Climax and Attack communities, respectively, from a parallel study of these samples (Quinn et al., 2015a).",

Antibiotic treatment is most often used to reduce the flare of acute symptoms (Horsley et al., 2013), but patients often have lingering effects and 25% of those treated do not return to their previous level of lung function (Sanders et al., 2010; Sanders et al., 2011). There is a need to identify the onset of these events before they develop to facilitate more effective treatment and minimize permanent lung remodeling. Biomarkers that could be longitudinally monitored to provide predictive value of the probability of an imminent CFPE would greatly aid clinicians. However, significant challenges exist in identifying ubiquitous biomarkers for CF due to the heterogeneity between patients in disease presentation (Collaco et al., 2010; Horsley & Siddiqui, 2015) and microbial infections (Carmody et al., 2013; Lim et al., 2013).",

A collective assessment of the similarity in the longitudinal sputum metabolomes from 11 different patients demonstrated that there was not a universal signature of exacerbation. Instead, the chemistry of sputum was more similar within individuals longitudinally than between different patients at the same clinical state of disease. Cystic fibrosis manifests in heterogeneous phenotypes, but the reasons for this are not clear (Collaco et al., 2010; Horsley & Siddiqui, 2015). At least 1,700 mutations in CFTR have been described and the clinical relevance of most of them is unknown (Bareil et al., 2010). Moreover, there are five described classes of CFTR mutations that disseminate into CF, but even within the same genotype class, the presentation of disease can be quite variable (Rowntree & Harris, 2003). The data in this study supports the heterogeneous nature of CF, where patients were found to have different chemical populations within their lung. It is well known that microbial profiles of patients are often unique (Carmody et al., 2015), this study indicates that the collective chemistry of sputum is also very specific to the individual.",

Two of the universally elevated molecules were PAF and a related molecule PC (18:0/3:1). The elevation of these two metabolites may indicate lipid remodeling during exacerbation. PAF is a particularly intriguing biomarker of CFPE, as it is a known inflammatory signaling lipid (Camussi, Tetta & Baglioni, 1990; Welch et al., 2009; Yost, Weyrich & Zimmerman, 2010) and has been reported to be elevated in exacerbations of other inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma (Schauer et al., 1992; Kasperska-Zajac, Brzoza & Rogala, 2008). PAF and Lyso-PAF have opposing effects on neutrophil activation, the former activating neutrophils, and the latter deactivating them (Welch et al., 2009). Monitoring the flux through PAF and other related lipids might be an effective means of identifying increased neutrophilic inflammation and the potential onset of exacerbations.",

This dataset captured four unique exacerbation events. Known molecules identified through GNPS spectral matching (including PAF-like lipids, sphingolipids and specific drugs) were monitored for changes in their abundance through time with attention to different disease classifications of each sample. PAF and Lyso-PAF had highly correlated abundances. This may indicate that PAF is being synthesized through phospholipid breakdown, first through the production of Lyso-PAF by phospholipase A2, then acetylation by Lyso-PAF acetyltransferase. This is the classic remodeling pathway of PAF synthesis and is associated with pathology and inflammation (Uemura, Lee & Snyder, 1991) (Fig. 6). PAF production may be another host physiological response to exacerbation and an important signature of an increased inflammatory load. Sphingolipids were also followed through the CF1 longitudinal data set. Ceramide, another potent inflammatory signaling lipid (Nixon, 2009), was especially abundant during treatment of an exacerbation. This too may represent a heightened inflammatory response, or influx of ceramide containing inflammatory cells in response to CFPE (Fig. 6). Together, PAF and ceramide are potentially strong candidates as CFPE biomarkers across patients or within certain individuals. The pathways of their production in the context of the CF lung microenvironment are illustrated in Fig. 6. This figure depicts the potential biomarkers detected in this study and their likely source from the membranes of both epithelial and recruited inflammatory cells.",

The fluctuations in sphingolipids and overall elevation of ceramide during CFPE treatment indicate that sphingolipid signaling may be dynamic through an exacerbation. Because cells deficient in CFTR have been shown to accumulate ceramide in the epithelium (Teichgr\u00e4ber et al., 2008; Bodas et al., 2011; Brodlie et al., 2010; Ziobro et al., 2013), CFTR mutations may be responsible for the buildup of ceramide in sputum (Quinn et al., 2015b), which is then observed as large fluctuations in ceramide signaling in response to inflammation induced at the onset of exacerbation. Although this study represents a relatively small sample size, these results support further research into the role of ceramide and ceramide induced signaling in CF as a potential therapeutic target (Brodlie et al., 2010; Becker et al., 2011; Ziobro et al., 2013) and biomarker of exacerbation. Larger population studies will be needed to determine if PAF and ceramide could be universally useful biomarkers or if they may be more patient specific.",

While these were not automatically annotated molecules through GNPS, in the context of personalized biomarker detection for CFPE, metabolite signatures do not need to be known spectra to be to clinically relevant. If they are statistically robust and provide a consistent LC-MS/MS signature, they may be just as effective in identifying CFPE onset as known metabolites. Annotation of the thousands of spectra generated in a mass spectrometry experiment is a significant challenge in the metabolomics field (Da Silva, Dorrestein & Quinn, 2015). As databases and algorithms improve, the ability to annotate the most statistically robust metabolites will be more attainable for any clinical biomarker. This will greatly improve the application of mass spectrometry to the clinical environment, particularly for personalized and precision medicine approaches.",

Azithromycin, constitutively prescribed to CF1 throughout the four years of sample collection, had dynamic fluctuations in this patient through the four years of study. Whether this is due to poor treatment adherence or time since actual patient ingestion cannot be known from the data collected in this study, but the fluctuating abundance of this xenobiotic may have a specific effect on the metabolome and microbiome of the lung. Intravenous administration of an antibiotic results in a more sustained presence in CF sputum, as is shown for trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and linezolid. This indicates that this form of therapy does result in the presence of high amounts of these molecules in lung mucus throughout the two-week treatment course.",

This allowed for a unique opportunity to monitor the changes in sputum microbiome along with metabolome using correlation. The network topology of the correlations between microbial and metabolite relative abundance identified the contrasting microbial communities previously proposed to exist in CF lungs (Conrad et al., 2012). Many molecules were positively correlated to Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas abundance, as well as Streptococcus, Rothia and anaerobes. However, there were no cross correlations between these groups, indicating that separate microbial communities may have separate chemical communities associated with them. Trimethoprim and linezolid were correlated with the Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas, indicating the inherent resistance of these microbes to the intravenous antibiotic treatment (Zhang, Li & Poole, 2000; Betriu, 2001; Lister, Wolter & Hanson, 2009). Ceramide and arachidonyl amides were associated with the Gram-positive and anaerobic community. Combining microbiome sequencing with the ability of LC-MS/MS and molecular networking through GNPS to automatically identify both host, microbial and xenobiotic metabolites represents a powerful clinical tool to monitor the effect of antibiotic therapy on lung chemistry and microbiology.",

Although there was not a universal signature of exacerbation, personalized approaches to biomarker development show promise, as a large number of metabolites were unique to this clinical state. Monitoring an individual through multiple exacerbations could provide statistically robust molecular biomarkers with future predictive value. Here, PAF and ceramide are potentially useful biomarkers as inflammatory lipids indicating the potential onset of a CFPE. Monitoring lipid remodeling through the classical PAF and ceramide pathways may provide information about inflammatory processes occurring prior to and during a CFPE event (Fig. 6). Because mass spectrometry-based metabolomics can be completed in clinically relevant time frames, application of these methods to screen for fluctuations in the abundance of metabolites associated with clinically relevant phenotypes is a powerful approach to personalized medicine. The metabolomics analysis methods applied to this single patient represents a proof-of-principle that personalized metabolomics can be used to study chemical dynamics during exacerbation. Further research concerning the role of CFTR in ceramide induced hyperinflammation associated with exacerbations may lead to novel treatment approaches to reduce the damage caused by a CFPE.",
