The intestinal microbiota contributes to resistance against viral and bacterial pathogens in the lung. However, whether intestinal microbiota composition and associated changes in microbe-derived metabolites contribute to the risk of LRTI following upper respiratory tract viral infection remains unexplored in the setting of allo-HCT. Fecal samples from 360 allo-HCT patients were collected at the time of stem cell engraftment and subjected to deep, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to determine microbiota composition, and short-chain fatty acid levels were determined in a nested subset of fecal samples. The development of respiratory viral infections and LRTI was determined for 180 days following allo-HCT. Clinical and microbiota risk factors for LRTI were subsequently evaluated using survival analysis. Respiratory viral infection occurred in 149 (41.4%) patients. Of those, 47 (31.5%) developed LRTI. Patients with higher abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria were fivefold less likely to develop viral LRTI, independent of other factors (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.69). Higher representation of butyrate-producing bacteria in the fecal microbiota is associated with increased resistance against respiratory viral infection with LRTI in allo-HCT patients.",

This product of microbial fermentation by anaerobic gut bacteria enhances the integrity of the intestinal epithelium10 and modulates enteric tolerance against microbial communities.11 In addition, butyrate contributes to host health in distant organs such as the lung.

Respiratory viruses included influenza (A and B) virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus. Throughout the study period, these viruses were detected by multiplex PCR assay of nasopharynx or bronchoscopy specimens at our institution.",

DNA was extracted and purified from each fecal sample, and the V4 to V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene was PCR-amplified using modified universal bacterial primers.13-15 Purified PCR products were sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina platform.17 The 16S (V4-V5) paired-end reads were merged and demultiplexed. The UPARSE pipeline18 was used to (1) perform error filtering, using maximum expected error (Emax = 1),19 (2) group sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of 97% distance-based similarity, and (3) identify and remove potential chimeric sequences, using both de novo and reference-based methods. Prior to clustering, singleton sequences were removed as part of the protocol. Taxonomic assignment to species level was performed for representative sequences from each OTU; this was achieved by using a custom Python script incorporating nucleotide BLAST,20 with NCBI RefSeq21 as reference training set. We used a minimum E-value threshold of 1e-10 for assignments. Sequence designations and identity scores were manually inspected for quality and consistency in terms of taxonomic structure and secondary matches. Based on our testing and comparisons using mock community data, we have found this approach to yield good robust species-level approximations for our candidate sequences. Given prior observations demonstrating the potential benefits of butyrate as an immunomodulatory compound,11 we hypothesized that the presence of bacteria that produce butyrate and other SCFAs might be associated with protection against viral LRTI. In order to assess this feature in our cohort, we measured the abundance of 61 known bacterial species that produce butyrate, adapted from a comprehensive study that analyzed butyrate-producing pathways in 3184 sequenced bacterial genomes and the microbiomes of 15 healthy volunteers22 (listed in supplemental Table 1).",

Of those patients, 47 (31.5%, 13% overall) were associated with LRTI involvement. The breakdown of diagnosed virus pathogens is shown in Table 2. A total of 594 separate viral pathogens were identified from the 149 patients (through clinical testing of nasal/respiratory specimens). Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most commonly encountered viral pathogen, occurring several-fold more frequently than all other viral pathogens. However, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus were most frequently associated with LRTI involvement (all \u223c30%). Of the 47 cases of viral LRTI, 11 (23.4%) were diagnosed by lower tract specimens obtained by bronchoscopy (supplemental Table 3). In our analysis of clinical and microbiota predictors of viral respiratory infection, we found that patients with higher abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria were less likely to develop viral LRTI. The estimated incidence of viral LRTI at 180 days was 17.3% and 16.1% for the groups in which butyrate-producing bacteria were absent or low, respectively, and 3.2% for the high butyrate-producing abundance group (log-rank P = .005) (Figure 2). In addition, patients with the highest abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria (>1%) were independently associated with a fivefold decrease in risk of viral LRTI (Table 3). Other clinical variables that were independently predictive of viral LRTI were corticosteroid use and preengraftment macrolide use. Of note, other microbiome characterizations, including microbial diversity (inverse Simpson) and abundance of several notably beneficial taxonomic groups, were less associated with protection against viral LRTI (supplemental Table 4).",

We found that patients who harbored a high abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria at the time of stem cell engraftment were less likely to develop viral LRTI in the 6 months following allo-HCT. In recent years, it has been shown that some of the bacterial species constituting the intestinal microbiota contribute to protection against infections through a variety of direct and indirect (immunomodulatory) mechanisms.5-9 In addition, the health benefits of microbiota-associated SCFA are increasingly appreciated, and several butyrate-specific mechanisms have recently been identified that suggest their association with protection from LRTI in our patient cohort. A recent study of mice showed that intraperitoneal butyrate administration reduced persistent lung inflammation during Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, leading to the suggestion that butyrate restores interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the lung by inhibiting histone deacetylase.12 Anti-inflammatory properties have been described in the intestine, where butyrate through the same IL-10-dependent mechanism was associated with heightened tolerance of macrophages toward the residing microbiota.11 Finally, as butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria have been associated with promotion of T-regulatory cells and reduced incidence of graft-versus-host disease, a decrease of butyrate-producing bacteria might be associated with increased graft-versus-host disease and increased exposure to immunosuppressive agents such as steroids, which is a known risk factor for LRTI.24,25",

For example, a significant proportion of butyrate-producing bacteria harbors the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene, which converts acetate into butyrate.26 Beyond SCFAs, we also found that DAT levels in feces were significantly elevated in patients with high abundance of butyrate-producing species. This degradation product of flavonoids is produced by Flavonifractor plautii (previously known as Clostridium orbiscindens) and has recently been associated with ameliorating influenza infection through augmentation of type I interferon signaling.9 These observations strengthen the notion that the potentially beneficial effects of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut extend beyond butyrate alone, and that these communities might be reflected as a marker of immunological resilience.27,28",

First, a broad clinical-radiographic definition of posttransplant viral LRTI was used to maximize detection of otherwise poorly defined events. We used a similar approach as taken previously by Harris and colleagues, which used abnormal radiographic patterns in conjunction with clinical information.14 However, the inclusion of all abnormal radiographic findings into 1 primary end point, regardless of severity of disease, respiratory viral infection, and causative pathogen, could misclassify and inflate or dilute the impact of butyrate-producing species in this cohort. In a sense, this partly mirrors our clinical experience, where it can be difficult to know whether symptoms and/or radiographic findings are related to a viral pathogen identified by clinical testing.",

It is possible that the loss of butyrate producers may reflect some underlying and undocumented differences between patients that also lead to increased susceptibility to viral LRTI. Third, the microbiota data were specifically studied during engraftment, and although we believe that this may be an immunologically crucial time point, subsequent microbiota time points may also be important but were not collected or captured. Finally, although this cohort was representative of the allo-HCT population at our center,13-15 it might not be fully comparable to other transplant centers, where exposure to microbial pathogens, antimicrobial prophylaxis, empiric treatment, and allo-HCT protocols differs.",

Recent studies of this patient group revealed the importance of the phylogenetic composition and diversity of the microbiota at the time of stem cell engraftment and support the notion that the microbiota contributes to optimization of immune reconstitution following allo-HCT.13-15 Interventions that protect the butyrate-producing compartment during allo-HCT, such as reduced exposure to antibiotics that target obligate anaerobic bacteria, such as some \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and metronidazole, might lead to improved outcomes. In addition, our study highlights a new opportunity for development of next-generation pre- or probiotics that enhance the abundance of butyrate-associated species as an adjuvant therapy during transplant hospitalization or following viral respiratory infection. Interestingly, a clinical trial assessing short-term administration of a dietary starch to increase levels of butyrate in patients subject to allo-HCT is currently ongoing (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02763033). However, the underlying mechanisms by which butyrate-producing bacteria provide protection during allo-HCT should be investigated in greater detail, because it still remains unclear whether this relationship is directly causal. In addition, timing of potential treatment is of importance, because the anti-inflammatory effect of IL-10 has been shown to be detrimental in certain clinical situations.29 Experimental studies to define molecular mechanisms of antiviral protection followed by interventional studies that investigate the protective potential of intestinal reconstitution with butyrate-producing bacteria are key to developing microbiota-targeted interventions that could improve outcomes for patients following allogeneic HCT.",
