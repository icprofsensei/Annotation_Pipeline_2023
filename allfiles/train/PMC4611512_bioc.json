In total, 260 ARG subtypes belonging to 18 ARG types were detected with an abundance range of 5.4 \u00d7 10\u22126\u20132.2 \u00d7 10\u22121 copy of ARG per copy of 16S-rRNA gene. The trend of the total ARG abundances in environments matched well with the levels of anthropogenic impacts on these environments. From the less impacted environments to the seriously impacted environments, the total ARG abundances increased up to three orders of magnitude, that is, from 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 3.1 \u00d7 100 copy of ARG per copy of 16S-rRNA gene. The abundant ARGs were associated with aminoglycoside, bacitracin, \u03b2-lactam, chloramphenicol, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, quinolone, sulphonamide and tetracycline, in agreement with the antibiotics extensively used in human medicine or veterinary medicine/promoters. The widespread occurrences and abundance variation trend of vancomycin resistance genes in different environments might imply the spread of vancomycin resistance genes because of the selective pressure resulting from vancomycin use. The simultaneous enrichment of 12 ARG types in adult chicken faeces suggests the coselection of multiple ARGs in this production system. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that samples belonging to the same environment generally possessed similar ARG compositions. Based on the co-occurrence pattern revealed by network analysis, tetM and aminoglycoside resistance protein, the hubs of the ARG network, are proposed to be indicators to quantitatively estimate the abundance of 23 other co-occurring ARG subtypes by power functions.",

It is not just a regional or national phenomenon but a global problem, indicated by the famously typical cases of the rapid dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-positive bacteria and New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-positive bacteria in Asia, Europe and North America (McKenna, 2013). Soil, sediment, surface water, sewage, sludge and animal waste have been considered important reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) because abundant ARGs have been frequently detected in these environments (LaPara et al., 2011; Zhang and Zhang, 2011; Koczura et al., 2012; Burch et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013; Czekalski et al., 2014). Strikingly, recent studies revealed that the exchange of ARGs between bacteria from farm animals/soils and clinical pathogens occurred via horizontal gene transfer (Smillie et al., 2011; Forsberg et al., 2012). This phenomenon emphasizes the clinical importance of the environmental bacteria, that is, the transmission of ARGs from natural environments to clinic establishes the natural resistome as a potential direct source of pathogenic resistance genes (Forsberg et al., 2012). Consequently, the in-depth investigation of the diversity and abundance of ARGs in various environments is central to establishing the overall picture that is essential for management decision frameworks for controlling antibiotic resistance.",

One of the dominant reasons is the lack of a rapid, universal and accurate analysis method for the broad-spectrum detection and quantification of ARGs in environmental samples. Various molecular technologies, such as PCR, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and DNA microarray approaches have been commonly used to determine the occurrence/fate of environmental ARGs and valuable insights have been gained. However, there are several limitations of amplification-based methods (PCR and qPCR), including low-throughput, limited availability of primers, amplification bias, false-negative results due to inhibition in PCR and false-positive results due to nonspecific amplification. High-capacity quantitative PCR arrays have been applied to detect ARGs in manure, compost and soil (Looft et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013) to overcome the capacity limitations; however, it cannot overcome the other drawbacks mentioned above. DNA microarray is a genomic analysis method that can simultaneously detect a large number of ARGs in a single assay (Zhang et al., 2009); the possibility for cross-talk of different probes coupled with low-sensitivity restricts its applications for comprehensive surveys of ARGs in complicated environmental samples (Yang et al., 2013).",

A novel \u2018environmental ARG diagnostic approach', that is, a metagenomic analysis method using the Structured Non-redundant Clean Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (SNC-ARDB) and customized scripts, has been developed in our previous study to facilitate the detection and quantification of a broad-spectrum profile of ARGs (Yang et al., 2013). Combined with network analysis tools, which have been widely used to explore the interactions/associations among entities, such as the species in a food web (Krause et al., 2003), proteins in metabolic pathways (Guimer\u00e0 and Amaral, 2005), coexisting patterns among microbial taxa in soils (Barber\u00e1n et al., 2012), activated sludge (Ju et al., 2014) and human gastrointestinal tract (Zhang et al., 2014), we could also assess the co-occurrence patterns among ARGs in complex environmental samples across spatial gradients. Previous study indicated that ARG composition correlated with microbial phylogenetic and taxonomic structure both across and within soil types, that is, bacterial community composition was the primary determinant of soil ARG contents (Forsberg et al., 2014); therefore, the co-occurrence patterns between ARGs and microbial taxa in multiple environments could help exploring the association of the bacteria and ARGs.",

Subsequently, all the metagenomic sequencing data were searched for ARGs against the SNC-ARDB using BLASTX with E-value \u2a7d1 \u00d7 10\u22125 (Yang et al., 2013). A sequence was annotated as an ARG-like fragment if its best hit in the SNC-ARDB had \u2a7e90% sequence identity and the alignment length was \u2a7e25 amino acids (Kristiansson et al., 2011). The high accuracy for positive hits (>99.5%) of the metagenomic analysis approach using these similarity/alignment length cutoffs has been validated in our previous study (Yang et al., 2013). To save sorting time and avoid human errors in ARG-like sequence classification, we developed a package of customized scripts that could automatically sort the ARG-like sequences obtained from the BLAST results into different types and subtypes of ARGs. Additionally, the number of ARG-like sequences in each subtype can be counted automatically. There are 25 \u2018ARG types', 618 \u2018ARG subtypes' and 2998 non-redundant reference sequences in the SNC-ARDB. For example, \u2018aminoglycoside resistance genes' is one example of an \u2018ARG type', whereas \u2018aadA' is one of the aminoglycoside resistance subtypes and there are three reference sequences belonging to aadA. It should be pointed out that the methodology used in the present study would only detect ARGs that have been annotated in SNC-ARDB. Some novel types of ARGs present in the samples might be missed since the analysis is based on a similarity search. Additionally, SNC-ARDB contains a number of efflux proteins (e.g., acrA and acrB and so on). Although they are present in both antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and cannot be good markers of resistance phenotype, they were usually related to efflux of antibiotic and thus were classified as ARGs (genotype) in previous references (Mikolosko et al., 2006; Szczepanowskei et al., 2009; Nesme et al., 2014) and another commonly used database, The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD, http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca/?q=CARD/ontology/36298). Therefore, efflux pump-related ARGs were still included in the SNC-ARDB to evaluate the antibiotic resistance potential.",

This preliminary filtering step removed those poorly represented ARG subtypes that occurred in a limited number of samples and thus reduced the artificial association bias. A correlation between two items was considered statistically robust if the Spearman's correlation coefficient (\u03c1) was >0.8 and the P-value was <0.01 (Junker and Schreiber, 2008). To reduce the chances of obtaining false-positive results, the P-values were adjusted with a multiple testing correction using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The robust pairwise correlations of the ARG subtypes formed their co-occurrence networks.

The Mann\u2013Whitney test indicated that total ARG abundances were significantly different (P-value: <0.005; Supplementary Table S3) among these four groups and followed the order of Group I<Group II<Group III<Group IV with successive increments of ~0.5\u20131 orders of magnitude. The ARG abundances in faeces and wastewater from livestock farms in Group IV (5.4 \u00d7 10\u22121\u20133.1 \u00d7 100 ratio) were 1\u20133 orders of magnitude higher than those of samples in Group I, such as sediment (4.0 \u00d7 10\u22123\u20133.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 ratio), soil (1.6 \u00d7 10\u22122\u20131.8 \u00d7 10\u22122 ratio), river water (1.7 \u00d7 10\u22122\u20133.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 ratio) and drinking water (1.2 \u00d7 10\u22122\u20134.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 ratio). These data further verified the conclusion that livestock farms were hotspots for ARGs (Zhu et al., 2013). The ARG abundances in Group II (STP AS and BF, STP ADS and STP effluents) and Group III (STP influents and human faeces) were within the ratio range of 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22122\u20132.2 \u00d7 10\u22121 and 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22121\u20134.4 \u00d7 10\u22121, respectively. With regard to a specific ARG type, tetracycline resistance genes also exhibited a similar abundance trend with total ARG abundance among these four groups (P-value: <0.01). It should be noted that these four groups were representative of the typical environments affected by the anthropogenic activities and antibiotic selection pressures at different levels, from the slightly impacted Group I to the most seriously impacted Group IV. The ARG abundance variations closely matched the levels of anthropogenic impact and, presumably, antibiotic selection pressures in the various environments. We should keep in mind that one possible reason resulting in the above grouping pattern might be because of database bias of SNC-ARDB. After all, the metagenomic analysis method using SNC-ARDB only obtain the \u2018broad-spectrum' profile rather than the \u2018full-spectrum' profile of ARGs. Some novel types of ARGs present in the sample might be missed as the analysis is based on a similarity search. Additionally, some types of ARGs might be underestimated owing to the integrity of the databases because not all known ARGs were included in SNC-ARDB.",

However, these previous studies only covered a limited number of well-studied ARG types among the resistance genes of tetracycline, sulphonamide, \u03b2-lactam, vancomycin, chloramphenicol and aminoglycoside. Tetracycline resistance genes and sulphonamide resistance genes were the predominant target ARG types in 90% of previous studies (Supplementary Table S4). With regard to the ARG subtypes, <40 subtypes were covered in the ARGs detection list in previous studies (Supplementary Table S4). In this aspect, the current PCR-based approaches provided a mere snapshot of the ARG profiles in environmental samples. The metagenomic analysis method could be used to investigate ARGs across a broader spectrum without PCR bias and capture a more complete picture of the ARG profiles because 25 ARG types, consisting of 618 ARG subtypes, could be analysed simultaneously. Among these 618 ARG subtypes, 260 ARG subtypes were detected in our samples (Supplementary Figure S4), 1\u20132 orders of magnitude more ARG subtypes than those detected in similar environments reported previously (Supplementary Table S4). Our results indicate that, besides tetracycline resistance genes and sulphonamide resistance genes, the resistance genes of aminoglycoside, MLS, multidrug, \u03b2-lactam, chloramphenicol, bacitracin and quinolone were also very abundant in the different sampled environments. For example, bacitracin resistance genes in river water, multidrug/MLS/quinolone resistance genes in STP influents, MLS/chloramphenicol in livestock faeces, and so on would likely be missed if only the small subset of the ARGs were assayed.",

As shown in Figure 1, the abundance of vancomycin resistance genes in the environments was significantly lower than those of other resistance genes related to the widely used antibiotics (aminoglycoside, bacitracin, \u03b2-lactam, chloramphenicol, MLS, quinolone, sulphonamide and tetracycline). In total, 19 unique subtypes of vancomycin resistance genes were detected in the seven environments but not river water, drinking water and sediments (Supplementary Figure S4). Among these seven environments, the human faeces, STP influent and faeces and wastewater from livestock farms possessed the most abundant vancomycin resistance genes. Previous studies also indicated that a number of vancomycin resistance genes were detected in swine manure samples (Zhu et al., 2013) and human faeces samples (Hu et al., 2013). vanRG even ranked in the top 10 most abundant ARGs in the human faeces samples of Chinese, Spanish and Danish populations. We wish to emphasize that although vancomycin resistance genes have also been found in permafrost sediments, which were never affected by the anthropogenic activities before (D'Costa et al., 2011), and the average abundance of vancomycin resistance genes in the samples of this study was relatively low (1.6 \u00d7 10\u22125\u20131.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 ratio), the findings of their widespread occurrences and abundance variation trend in the present study, that is, human faeces, STP influent and faeces and wastewater from livestock farms possessed the most abundant vancomycin resistance genes, whereas no detection in river water, drinking water or sediments still deserved more attention because they might imply the spread of vancomycin resistance genes because of the selective pressure resulting from vancomycin use.",

This conclusion was also supported by our ARG data from faeces of commercially grown chicks (20 days old) and adult chickens (80 days old). The abundance of ARGs increased from a ratio of 1.62\u20131.53 for chick faeces to 2.74\u20133.11 for adult chicken faeces. The ARGs with enrichment over 10-fold consisted of resistance genes for acridine, bacitracin, \u03b2-lactam, bleomycin, fosmidomycin, multidrug, polymyxin and quinolone (Supplementary Figure S5A). Apart from these eight ARG types, the resistance genes of aminoglycoside, sulphonamide, \u2018others' and trimethoprim also increased beyond from their already high background abundance ratios of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22121, 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22122, 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22122 and 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 to even higher ratios of 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22121, 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22121, 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22121 and 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22121, respectively. Although we did not analyse the types and concentrations of antibiotics existing in the chicken feed and faeces, judging by the practical situation on the livestock farm, there should not be so many types of antibiotics added into the chicken feed/water. The significant enrichment of 12 ARG types raises an interesting question as to why so many AGRs have increased. Similar results were also found in Looft's study (2012), that is, aminoglycoside O-phosphotransferases conferring resistance to aminoglycosides were markedly enriched in pig faeces even though aminoglycosides were not used. This finding suggests an indirect mechanism of selection (coselection) of multiple ARGs, perhaps by co-occurrence on mobile elements conferring resistance to the antibiotics fed (Looft et al., 2012).",

Instead, the abundances of some ARG types, such as resistance genes of bleomycin, fosmidomycin, polymyxin, multidrug, sulphonamide and trimethoprim, decreased greatly and their abundances in adult pig faeces were less than one-tenth of the amounts in young pig faeces (Supplementary Figure S5B).

In other words, the ARG profiles in influents might reflect the average ARG abundance and diversity in the gastrointestinal tracts of urban residents of the STP catchment. The Venn diagram (Supplementary Figure S6) and the grouping pattern demonstrated by the NMDS (Figure 3) clearly confirmed this hypothesis. In total, 68 ARG subtypes belonging to 11 types were shared by the STP influents and human faeces with comparable abundances. The shared ARGs accounted for as much as 67.2% and 100% of the total ARG abundance in STP influents and human faeces, respectively (Supplementary Table S7 and Supplementary Figure S6). It should be noted that the STP influents were collected from Hong Kong, whereas the human faeces samples were collected from residents living in the United States (Turnbaugh et al., 2009). More closely clustered pattern could be expected if the human faeces samples were collected from the residents who lived within the STP catchment area.",

Figure 4b further exhibited the detailed information on the types of shared ARGs and their abundance comparison among human faeces, piglet faeces and chick faeces.

Certain topological properties widely used in network analysis were calculated to describe the complex pattern of the interrelationships among the ARG subtypes (Supplementary Information S5). The modularity index of 0.472 suggested that the network had a modular structure (Newman, 2006). Based on the modularity class, the entire network could be parsed into eight major modules (i.e., clusters of nodes that interact more among themselves than with other nodes, compared with a random association), with 31 of 46 total vertices occupied by the two largest modules: Modules I and II.

One possible explanation for the hubs and related co-occurring ARGs in each module is that they might be harboured in some specific microbial taxa that are shared by different environments. On the other hand, the hubs could act as the ARG indicators to indicate the quantity of the correspondingly co-occurring ARGs. In other words, these two hubs could be used as representatives of 23 unique ARGs subtype (Supplementary Table S12). Supplementary Figure S10 illustrates the correlations between the hub abundance and the co-occurring ARG abundance. Further investigation indicated that the abundance of \u2018hubs' and the correspondingly co-occurring ARGs followed a power function with R2 values ranging from 0.86 to 0.92 (Supplementary Table S13 and Supplementary Figure S11). Validation has been conducted to guarantee the applicability and accuracy of the model by comparing the model predicted value and the detected ARG abundance of co-occurring ARGs (Supplementary Figure S6 and Supplementary Table S14). The validation results imply that the abundance of co-occurring ARGs could be accurately estimated using the hub's abundance via this power function. In addition, the high abundance of these two ARGs in various environments facilitates their applicability as ARG indicators (Figure 2). To indicate the abundance of the other 23 ARGs in samples, a simple and quick qPCR assay of \u2018tetM' and \u2018aminoglycoside resistance protein' as the target genes could be used. This will substantially save on the detection time and labour for monitoring these ARGs in multiple environmental samples. We suggest that this approach be more widely tried and tested.",

Similar to Blautia, Clostridium also took along tetracycline resistance genes (tet32 and tetO) and MLS resistance gene (ermB). Enterococcus was found to be the host of ARG subtypes of erythromycin ribosome methylase, whereas Bacteroides mainly carried tetQ. Compared with the above genera, Escherichia took along more diverse ARGs, including resistance genes of \u03b2-lactam (cfxA3), tetracycline (tetQ), multidrug (acrA, mdtH, mdtL and mdtO) and others (dimethyladenosine transferase). Methanobrevibacter, a typical methanogenic archaea genus (Daquiado et al., 2014), mainly carries tet32, ermB and aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. A few of the ARG hosts have been verified in previous studies, which showed very consistent results (Supplementary Table S16). For instance, tetQ was commonly carried by Escherichia, and Bacteroides (Zhang et al., 2009; Shoemaker et al., 2001; Forslund et al., 2013). Forslund et al.
