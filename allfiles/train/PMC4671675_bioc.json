We investigated whether alteration of oral microbiota is associated with ESCC risk. Fasting saliva samples were collected from 87 incident and histopathologicallly diagnosed ESCC cases, 63 subjects with dysplasia and 85 healthy controls. All subjects were also interviewed with a questionnaire. V3\u2013V4 region of 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced by 454-pyrosequencing platform. Carriage of each genus was compared by means of multivariate-adjusted odds ratios derived from logistic regression model. Relative abundance was compared using Metastats method. Beta diversity was estimated using Unifrac and weighted Unifrac distances. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was applied to ordinate dissimilarity matrices. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare the coordinates between different groups. ESCC subjects had an overall decreased microbial diversity compared to control and dysplasia subjects (P<0.001). Decreased carriage of genera Lautropia, Bulleidia, Catonella, Corynebacterium, Moryella, Peptococcus and Cardiobacterium were found in ESCC subjects compared to non-ESCC subjects. Multinomial logistic regression analyses on PCoA coordinates also revealed that ESCC subjects had significantly different levels for several coordinates compared to non-ESCC subjects. In conclusion, we observed a correlation between altered salivary bacterial microbiota and ESCC risk. The results of our study on the saliva microbiome are of particular interest as it reflects the shift in microbial communities. Further studies are warranted to verify this finding, and if being verified, to explore the underlying mechanisms.",

It is well established that the oral microbiome plays a critical role in the maintenance of a normal oral physiological environment and in development of oral diseases, including periodontal diseases and tooth loss. Although little studied, the oral microbiome may be important in cancer and other chronic diseases, through direct metabolism of chemical carcinogens (e.g. nitrite, ethanol) [9, 10] and through systemic inflammatory effects [11]. We assumed that a stronger underlying association of ESCC risk with oral microbiome profiles would exsit. Although some specific bacterial species in tissue and saliva have been linked to an elevated risk of ESCC by targeted approach,[12, 13] to date few studies have systemically investigated the relation between oral microbiota and ESCC risk. In current study, we aim to investigate the potential association between oral microbiota in saliva and ESCC risk using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing approach, based on a large case-control study conducted in Taixing, an area with a high incidence of ESCC.",

In order to avoid possible confounding which might affect diversity of oral microbiota, i.e. ambient temperatures and dietary habits in different seasons, cases collected during November of 2010 and March of 2011 were excluded (N = 124).

Since saliva collection was performed after endoscopy for ESCC cases, while for control subjects it was performed only after fasting overnight, we could not exclude the possibility of contamination by endoscopy which would affect the diversity of oral microbiota. Therefore, we included 80 subjects with a suspected diagnosis of esophageal dysplasia who also underwent endoscopy during the whole study period as another \u201ccontrol\u201d group in the current study.",

Compared to healthy controls, decreased carriages of several genera in ESCC subjects were found, including Megasphaera, Aggregatibacter, Atopobium, Lautropia, Actinobacillus, Bulleidia, Catonella, Filifactor, Corynebacterium, TG5, Acholeplasma, Moryella, Butyrivibrio, Dialister, Peptococcus, and Cardiobacterium. These differences remained for genera, Lautropia, Bulleidia, Catonella, Corynebacterium, Moryella, Peptococcus and Cardiobacterium, when comparing ESCC vs. dysplasia subjects. Based on relative abundance, the most predominant genera (>5% in the healthy control group) were Prevotella (42.4%, 38.4% and 36.1% in the ESCC, Dysplasia and Control groups, respectively), Streptococcus (21.9%, 14.5% and 16.1%), Veillonella (7.3%, 10.5% and 13.2%), and Porphyromonas (8.9%, 7.0% and 6.5%). Testing for differences in genera abundance revealed an increased level of colonization of members of Prevotella (P\nFDR-adjusted<0.001), Streptococcus (P\nFDR-adjusted<0.001) and Porphyromonas (P\nFDR-adjusted<0.001), and a decreased level of most other genera in the ESCC group compared to non-ESCC groups, although for those genera with a low relative abundance the patterns were not clear.",

The first 10 coordinates explained 53% and 85% of the variance for Unifrac and weighted Unifrac distances, respectively (S2 Fig). Correlations between coordinates and genera were calculated, and a multinomial logistic regression model was applied to compare the first 10 coordinates in three groups. For Unifrac distance, except for coordinates 7\u20139, all other coordinates showed significant differences between ESCC and healthy control group, while only coordinates 3, 4, 5 and 8 were significant when comparing ESCC with the Dysplasia group. Results were similar after adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol drinking, family history of ESCC, MFT, times of tooth brushing per day, daily consumption of pickled vegetables and daily consumption of fresh fruits (Table 4). For weighted Unifrac distances, highly significant differences (coordinates 2 and 3) emerged when comparing ESCC with both healthy control and Dysplasia groups (Table 4). We further visualized the Unifrac or weighted Unifrac distances using the two most significant coordinates (the ones which explained most variances and with small P values) found in multinomial logistic regression analyses (coordinates 1 and 3 for Unifrac distance; coordinates 2 and 3 for weighted Unifrac distance). For both Unifrac and weighted Unifract distances, ESCC and healthy control subjects tended to cluster in opposite directions, while dysplasia subjects were located between the two groups (Fig 3).",

We found that ESCC subjects had decreased overall microbial diversity compared to dysplasia and healthy control subjects. In addition, decreased carriage of several genera, including Lautropia, Bulleidia, Catonella, Corynebacterium, Moryella, Peptococcus and Cardiobacterium, were found in the ESCC cases compared to non-ESCC subjects. Higher relative abundance of Prevotella, Streptococcus and Porphyromonas, but lower or similar relative abundance of most other genera were observed in ESCC group compared to non-ESCC groups. Multinomial logistic regression analyses on PCoA coordinates of Unifrac or weighted Unifract distances also revealed that ESCC subjects had significantly different levels of several coordinates compared to non-ESCC subjects.",

For this study, every effort was made to enroll all of the incident ESCC cases in the study area. The frequency matched healthy controls were randomly selected from the general population. The participation rates for both cases and controls were more than 75%. Since we tried to enroll cases before histopathological diagnosis being made, we were also able to include another control group, i.e. dysplasia patients. The similar directions of associations when using different control groups strengthened the validity of our findings. In addition, histopathological diagnosis of ESCC and dysplasia by a single pathologist, saliva collection after overnight fasting for both cases and controls, and collection of extensive information on potential confounders (e.g. smoking, alcohol drinking, and other lifestyle factors) were among the strengths of the current study.",

                    "text": "Our study also has several limitations. One of the main limitations was that we did not add beads during the process of saliva DNA extraction which might affect the composition and diversity of the oral microbiota. Nevertheless, since the same procedure of saliva DNA preparation was applied in all three groups, the observed differences between groups were still valid, although we could not draw conclusion on those hard-to-break bacteria. As a large fraction of samples did not pass the quanlity control and were excluded, while there might be underlying factors being masked in these subjects, we compared inculed subjects and exclued subjects for the clinical parameters including age, sex, education, smoking status, drinking status, MFT score, times of tooth brushing per day, family history of ESCC and daily consumption of pickled vegetables and fruits, and no significant differences were found. In addition, saliva samples for ESCC cases were collected after endoscopy, which was different from healthy controls. This might raise a concern that the differences of oral microbiota between ESCC cases and healthy controls might be due to contamination during endoscopy. In order to determine whether endoscopy has led (or not) to the changes in the microbiome found in the ESCC population, a small cohort including 30 individuals were enrolled in one of the study hospitals and their saliva samples were obtained both before and after endoscopy. The overall bacterial community composition was analyzed using the same pipeline. No significant difference in bacterial community composition was found between saliva samples collected before and after endoscopy (S3 Fig). Moreover, for subjects in another control group, i.e. dysplasia subjects, saliva samples were also collected after endoscopy. The similar directions of associations when comparing to different control groups somewhat allayed such a concern. Another limitation is that comparison of the composition and diversity of oral microbiota might be biased by the non-consistent sampling seasons among three groups, even if samples collected in winter in ESCC group were excluded due to the difference of temperature and dietary pattern. However, we compared the composition and diversity between different sampling seasons, but did not find any significant difference between different sampling seasons (data not shown). Finally, due to case-control study design, our results could not distinguish whether decreased microbial richness causes ESCC or is an effect of the cancer status, e.g. the oral microbiota may be modified by the confunding effect of restricted food intake due to symptoms from extensive lesions and/or dry month in the cancer group. Currently, we are conducting a prospective cohort study, Taizhou Longitudinal Study,[26] in which saliva samples were collected in baseline survey and can be used to prospectively assess the relationship between oral microbiota and the development of ESCC and other gastrointestinal cancers.",

The most common phyla in our samples were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria. However, our data suggest that the most abundant phylum and genus were Bacteroidetes and Prevotella, and this might be a little different from other studies which showed Firmicutes and Streptococci were dominant in oral microbiota.[30] The shift may be due to the different DNA extraction methods and different broad-range PCR primers applied. An alternative explanation for this inconsistency may be the impact of diet and oral hygiene. It has been reported that the composition of oral microbiota is different between rural and urban districts.[31] De Filippo C. et al.[32] investigated human intestinal microbiota from children characterized by a modern western diet and a rural diet, and found that children in rural Africa showed a significant enrichment in Bacteroidetes and depletion in Firmicutes. Individuals with excellent oral hygiene typically harbor a relatively simple flora dominated by gram-positive cocci and rods, mostly comprised of Streptococci, however in individuals who do not maintain good oral hygiene, the flora shifts to become more diverse and complex and is dominated by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, including Prevotella.[33] In the present study, even the healthy controls had relatively poor oral hygiene (as indicated by high indices of MFT and few times of tooth brushing per day). All the above reasons may contribute or partly explain the differences of the oral microbiota between different studies.",

However, due to low relative abundances of these genera (<0.5%), there is a danger that the observed differences were due to insufficient sampling depth. On the contrary, presence of genus Mycoplasma, which is unaffected by many common antibiotics and reported to be associated with several types of cancer, such as gastric cancer,[34] colon cancer[35] and prostate cancer,[36] was more common in ESCC cases than in healthy and Dysplasia control subjects, although the differences were not statistically significant after FDR adjustment. Higher relative abundance of Prevotella and Streptococcus were also observed in the ESCC group compared to non-ESCC groups. The proportion of these two genera accounted for nearly 65% of the overall community in ESCC subjects, which might to some extent explain the low diversity of oral microbiota in these patients. Although these genera seem to be non-pathogenic to the host, several studies have indicated that they might be associated with oral and upper digestive tract cancers.[37\u201339] Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings.",

We observed a correlation between altered salivary bacterial community structure and ESCC risk. The results of our study on the saliva microbiota are of particular interests given its modifiable nature. However, prospective and longitudinal cohort studies are required to verify this finding, along with functional studies, e.g. metagenomics and transcriptome studies. Establishment of the association between oral microbiome and ESCC risk may lead to significant advances in understanding of cancer etiology, potentially opening a new research paradigm for cancer prevention.",
