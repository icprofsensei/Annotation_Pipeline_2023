We and others have identified taxonomic differences in fecal bacteria between pediatric or adult SpA subjects and healthy controls (2\u20134). However, these studies have not provided a mechanism whereby dysbiosis can result in arthritis. One possible mechanism is through alterations in metabolic pathways. The metabolic capacity of bacteria is an under-appreciated aspect of the human microbiome. In total, bacteria contain over 3 million genes, 100 times the human host (5); they perform a variety of metabolic functions including metabolism of dietary components, drug detoxification, and synthesis of vitamins and essential amino acids (5). Bacteria are not created equal in their capacity to perform these functions, and thus a particular microbiome may be more or less effective than another at carrying out certain activities. To evaluate the functional potential of the microbiome, fecal water metabolomics on children with ERA and controls was performed. The aim of metabolomics is to conduct a comprehensive analysis on the identities of the low molecular weight ions (in our facility, <1,000 Da) present in a sample, so as to obtain insight into function (6). Metabolomics of fecal water, the supernatant obtained following high-speed centrifugation of feces, can discriminate between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and healthy individuals, with some studies showing elevated levels of amino acids and decreased short chain fatty acids such as butyrate (7, 8). Our intent was to identify mechanisms by which the microbiota might predispose or contribute to arthritis in children with ERA.",

PICRUSt takes as input 16S data and imputes metabolic activities, based upon the organisms present in the sample (12). Consistent with what was observed in the metabolomics samples, the number of predicted metabolic functions was significantly higher in control versus patient samples (77 versus 58 million, p = 0.050). There was also an increase in functions associated with Tryptophan biosynthesis (713,868 versus 533,826, p = 0.070), but not in Tryptophan metabolism (82,540 versus 70.962, p = 0.365). Similar trends were observed in cohort two, although the differences were modest and not statistically significant (not shown). Thus, the 16S fecal microbiome sequencing data confirms the relative decrease in Tryptophan metabolism in JIA/ERA patients, relative to controls, as noted in metabolomics analyses.",

The significance of this finding will bear further study. However, it is of interest that despite the modest differences at the taxonomic level, there were differences in the overall community structure (Figure 2); specifically, clustering present with the Unweighted Unifrac test indicate that there are likely differences in the presence versus the absence of several bacteria, although none of these pairwise differences on their own attained statistical significance. Importantly, these differences resulted in higher functional potential in the controls as indicated by the PICRUSt analysis, and thus likely accounted for the metabolomics differences. Thus, the microbiota may have an influence on disease, even without substantial differences in the levels of any single organism.",

The finding of decreased tryptophan metabolites is consistent with a similar finding in the synovial fluid of subjects with RA, as compared to controls with osteoarthritis (16). It is also consistent with data from a mouse model of colitis caused by deficiency in caspase recruitment domain 9, in which levels of fecal indole-3-acetic (IAA) were reduced; in this model, transfer of the microbiota to wild-type mice also resulted in colitis (17). The same study also showed decreased fecal levels of IAA in human subjects with IBD (17). Additionally, a study of mice with dextran-sulfate induced colitis also showed decreased fecal IAA (9). Importantly, we excluded children who had received antibiotics within three months prior to collection of the sample, as antibiotic usage can result in long-lasting effects on the microbiota (18) and can also impact the metabolome, including the tryptophan pathway (19). As recently reviewed (20), antibiotic usage may also increase the future risk of both JIA and IBD, although distant antibiotic usage was not explored in our subjects.",

When exposed to indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO), tryptophan forms L-kynurenine and subsequently 3-hydroxy-kynurenine; it is estimated that approximately 95% of tryptophan metabolism is generated via this route (21).

Ligand binding of the AhR results in disassociation from its chaperone protein and translocation into the nucleus, where it can activate a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines (25). Blockade of the AhR in vitro results in attenuation of cytokine production normally induced by pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor (26). However, AhR are not all created equally with respect to pro-inflammatory potential (27), and 5-hydroxy tryptophan appears to be anti-inflammatory (28), whereas indole itself appears to be pro-inflammatory and is also a particularly strong AhR agonist (29). Thus, it is of interest that patients had lower levels of metabolites that served as cofactors for 5-hydroxy tryptophan synthesis, as well as its downstream products, as well as higher levels of metabolites of kynurenine. None of the metabolites higher in controls appeared to be associated with indole production. Thus, alterations in tryptophan metabolism may affect the plastic nature of effector CD4 T cells away from regulatory and towards pro-inflammatory CD4 T cell subsets (30), providing an environment conducive to JIA/ERA development or maintenance.",

Importantly, this is an associative study, and no definitive causal conclusions can be drawn. In addition, the low numbers of patients in this study, as well as the need for validation of the specific metabolic findings, are acknowledged. However, the replication of the observations that controls had a much greater variety of metabolites in general, as well as specifically within the tryptophan pathway, represents important internal validation. In addition, the two cohorts of ERA subjects were dissimilar from one another with respect to disease duration, medications used, and demographic features (Table 1), yet the findings were similar, speaking to the generalizability of these results. Finally, the possibility of the immunomodulatory therapies themselves resulting in some of the findings, such as the highly significant association with drug metabolism pathways in the second cohort, must be considered. However, the extent of the differences was far more striking among the cohort that was largely na\u00efve to therapy. Further work is required to our findings and also to assess the metagenomics and metabolic effects of immunosuppressive therapy. We are just beginning to understand the functional implications of these alterations, with much more work to be done exploring potential clinical significance and therapeutic implications of abnormalities in the production of important metabolites, including, but surely not limited to the tryptophan pathway.",

The fecal homogenates were ultracentrifuged (14,000 x g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C), and the supernatants extracted with 2 x 2 volumes of ethyl acetate. The solvent extracts were combined and evaporated under N2. The supernatants were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on a silica CHIP C18 reverse-phase column (200 \u03bcm id x 15 cm) as our group has performed previously (33). Specifically, the dried residues were reconstituted in 100 \u03bcl 0.1% formic acid and 5 \u03bcl aliquots were loaded onto a 0.5 cm x 200 \u03bcm ID silica CHIP C18 reverse-phase cartridge which was washed for 5 min with 0.1% formic acid. Trapped metabolites were separated by nanoLC-MS on a 15 cm x 200 \u03bcm ID silica CHIP C18 reverse-phase column using a 20 minute, 0\u201395% linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at 1 \u03bcl/min, followed by a 1 min wash at 100% acetonitrile and column re-equilibration for 4 min with 0.1% formic acid. An Eksigent 415 nanoLC pump was used to provide the gradient. The Chip LC column was contained in an Eksigent Nanoflex\u2122 which maintained it at 45\u00b0C. Column eluate was passed through the nanoelectrospray ionization interface of a SCIEX 5600 TripleTOF (SCIEX, Concorde, Ontario, Canada). Using a duty cycle of 1.2 sec, first, a high resolution TOF-MS spectrum was collected for 100 msec, followed by 50 msec MSMS spectra of the twenty most intense precursor ions. Once an adequate MSMS spectrum had been collected for a given precursor ion, it was placed on an exclusion list for the next 30 sec. Mass calibration using SCIEX APCI standards (APCI Positive and Negative Calibration Solutions, SCIEX, Toronto, Canada) for both positive and negative mode was run between each unknown sample in order to maintain mass calibration of the mass spectrometer (typically 2\u20133 ppm). Mean retention time variation for all metabolites eluting between 5 and 25 min using the nanoLC-MS system was 0.26%.

The power behind this statistical package is its ability to evaluate all combinations of potential biochemical assignments for ions determined to be statistically different in order to identify network modules or pathways. Mummichog, by using all ions including those that are not changed significantly, establishes expected network/pathways associations under the null hypothesis, which is that there are no differences in pathway representation among the two inputted groups (in this case, ERA patients and controls). Over-representation of statistically significant ions in modules and pathways can then be identified as those higher than would be predicted by chance. Thus, the output is modules and pathways that are over- or under-represented in one group relative to another. The input to mummichog was the full set of ions, as well as those that were differentially present between the two groups (1.5 fold or higher difference with p-values of 0.05 or less.) The mummichog program uses the Fisher exact test to compare pathway utilization between the list of select ions versus the full list of ions, removing one hit from each identified pathway so as to penalize pathways with very few hits that might have arisen by chance. Mummichog analysis was performed four times, twice for ions higher in patients (once each for negatively and positively charged ions), and twice for ions higher in controls. Assignment of metabolites to pathways is based upon the KEGG database (10) and their own curation (35), which also included the Edinburgh Human Metabolic Network (EHMN) Reconstruction (11). Sample size was upon the study by Marchesi et al. (2007) (8).",

Following quality control steps, sequence data was processed with the Quantitative Insight Into Microbial Ecology tool suite (36). Sequences were grouped into groups of similar sequences (known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs)) using uclust (37). The resulting OTU table was imported into Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt; (12)). PICRUSt is an open-source bioinformatics software program that predicts metabolic functions based upon 16S rDNA sequence data. Assessment of between-sample diversity (similarity between the sequences of each subject) was performed with the Weighted and Unweighted Unifrac tests (38) and visualized with principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). The Permanova test evaluated whether a categorical variable (JIA/ERA versus control) predicted the sample clustering obtained from the Unifrac tests. Pairwise comparisons of abundance of metabolic functions were performed with the Mann-Whitney U-test.",
