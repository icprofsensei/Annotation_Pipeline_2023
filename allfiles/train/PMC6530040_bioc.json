Microaspiration of the oropharyngeal microbiota represents an important pathway leading to VAP [4, 5]. Most measures to decrease VAP rates aim at preventing the transfer of pathogens from the oropharynx to the lungs [6]. A meta-analysis showed that oral decontamination was the only intervention to reduce mortality in the context of VAP [7]. Reliable markers to predict the onset of VAP do not exist. Continuous surveillance cultures may predict the microbial cause of a VAP for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., and/or other multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria [8, 9] and therefore help with the selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, surveillance cultures do not predict the time of onset of VAP, nor provide essential information for preventive measures [9].",

The human lung microbiome and its role in health and disease has gained greater attention among researchers in the last 10\u2009years [11\u201313]. The lower respiratory tract has historically been considered sterile, but recent evidence supports the concept that a distinct microbiota of the lower respiratory tract is present both in health and in various respiratory diseases [14\u201316]. Some authors argue that the pharyngeal microbiome may have a protective role in respiratory tract infections and that artificial reinforcement of microbiome homeostasis would be an option to prevent invasion of species causing infections [17]. In contrast, during influenza infection, the respiratory microbiome seems to undergo only very discrete changes [18].",

Dysbiosis of microbial communities in the respiratory tract was most pronounced in patients who already had developed VAP [23]. However, no longitudinal study has yet been performed in acutely ill patients using daily oropharyngeal swabs with paired tracheal secretions. Our goal was to describe the longitudinal dynamics of the oropharyngeal and tracheal microbiota and stratify this evolution for the onset or absence of a VAP. Our main study hypotheses were i) VAP is associated with disturbed oropharyngeal microbiota, ii) distinct operational taxonomic units of the Enterobacteriaceae family have a specific dynamic pattern of gaining access to the oropharynx during the course of mechanical ventilation and iii) the causative Enterobacteriaceae may outgrow the commensal members of the microbiome.",

Our study identified two important points: firstly, patients with enterobacterial VAP appear to develop a lower within (=alpha) diversity of the oropharyngeal microbiota compared to non-VAP/H. influenzae VAP patients. A lowered SDI/richness could therefore be indicative of subsequent VAP occurrence caused by Enterobacteriaceae. Secondly, we showed that VAP causative Enterobacteriaceae accessed the oropharynx early during ventilation (day 2), with a small initial abundance. Of interest, this enterobacterial \u2018access\u2019 consisted of a single operational taxonomic unit in 2/3 patients, where the causative bacteria outgrew the residual microbiota and led to VAP. This points to the access of a single clone. These two observations can be used to investigate in a follow-up study with less stringent inclusion criteria whether a defined longitudinal oropharyngeal microbiome pattern between day zero and two of mechanical ventilation may predict VAP.",

Another limitation was the frequent use of antibiotic prophylaxis during the study, which could have had an impact on the composition and the dynamic of the microbiome. Previously it was shown, that long-term macrolide treatment changed the composition of respiratory microbiota and was associated with decreased bacterial richness [27\u201329]. In a previous VAP study though, it was shown that systemic antibiotic administration were not associated with changes in the alpha diversity [23].

Of note, in 50% of patients with occurrence of a single Enterobacteriaceae no VAP was diagosed over the clinical course. Therefore this occurrence alone is not sufficiently predictive.

We think that this finding is generalizable to other settings, as a similar \u2013 monoclonal - colonization of Enterobacteriaceae in the airways of ventilated patients has been reported before [30]. Decreased alpha diversity in lower and upper respiratory tract samples in ventilated compared to healthy subjects has also been demonstrated before [24]. Moreover, a decrease in longitudinal alpha diversity in VAP patients versus ventilated controls has been shown before in tracheal aspirates [23, 31, 32]. Therefore, our data expand this finding to the oropharynx, an anatomical region that is probably key in the natural history of VAP development [4, 5]. Our results support the findings of a recent study in which reduced microbial diversity in mechanically ventilated patients was associated with mortality and was suggested to be a biomarker of prognostic value [33].",
