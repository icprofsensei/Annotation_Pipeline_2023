Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are being explored to help children living with this disease. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successful in some children with ulcerative colitis. However, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect in this patient population is not well understood. To characterize changes in gut microbial and metabolomic profiles after FMT, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, virome analysis and untargeted metabolomics by gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry on stool samples collected before and after FMT from four children with ulcerative colitis who responded to this treatment. Alpha diversity of the gut microbiota increased after intervention, with species richness rising from 251 (S.D. 125) to 358 (S.D. 27). In responders, the mean relative abundance of bacteria in the class Clostridia shifted toward donor levels, increasing from 33% (S.D. 11%) to 54% (S.D. 16%). Patient metabolomic and viromic profiles exhibited a similar but less pronounced shift toward donor profiles after FMT. The fecal concentrations of several metabolites were altered after FMT, correlating with clinical improvement. Larger studies using a similar multi-omics approach may suggest novel strategies for the treatment of pediatric ulcerative colitis.",

The gut microbiota has been suggested as a therapeutic target for IBD, including ulcerative colitis (Shanahan and Quigley 2014). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been established as a useful tool for manipulating the gut microbiome and is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (van Nood et\u00a0al. 2013). FMT therapy has been considered for ulcerative colitis patients, with the first reported FMT in the context of UC described in 1989 (Borody, Brandt and Paramsothy 2014). Since then, FMT for UC has been studied in at least three randomized placebo-controlled trials in adults and hasshown efficacy in inducing remission (Moayyedi et\u00a0al. 2015; Rossen et\u00a0al. 2015; Paramsothy et\u00a0al. 2017).

To our knowledge, the trial described by Kunde et\u00a0al. (2013) is the largest study to date investigating FMT in children with ulcerative colitis. In this open-label, uncontrolled trial, six out of nine patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis showed clinical improvement four weeks after FMT, with three patients achieving clinical remission. In order to understand the microbial and molecular changes associated with successful FMT in pediatric ulcerative colitis patients, we utilized a multi-omics approach to characterize the gut microbial and metabolomic profiles from seven patients from the Kunde et\u00a0al. study.",

The decreased levels of Clostridia in the ulcerative colitis subjects at baseline compared to donors is consistent with previous reports (Michail et\u00a0al. 2012). Colonic inflammation is itself associated with changes in the microbiota, including reduced diversity. Therefore, it is not possible to know whether the changes seen in this study are part of the cause or the result of improvement in colitis. This could be addressed in future studies by performing a similar analysis of the microbiome and metabolome in UC patients before and after receiving treatment with corticosteroids.",

In the non-responders, microbial community structure also changed after FMT but not to the same degree as in responders (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3A;3A; Fig. S5, Supporting Information), suggesting that specific alterations in the gut microbiota are important for successful FMT. Interestingly, another study that reported clinical improvement in three pediatric UC patients after FMT found that microbial profiles changed after FMT, but microbial community structure did not shift toward that of the donor (Kellermayer et\u00a0al. 2015). However, unlike the subjects analyzed here, the patients in that study all received FMT from a singular donor. Interestingly, Bray\u2013Curtis similarity to the donors increased after FMT in two of the three non-responders, despite their lack of response to treatment (Table S1, Supporting Information). This suggests that transfer of donor microbes is not sufficient to induce a clinical response. Response to FMT may depend on both patient and donor factors that have yet to be identified; future studies with larger sample sizes may be able to elucidate these factors and predict the likelihood of clinical response for a given patient\u2013donor pair.",

Three of the four responders developed metabolomic profiles similar to those of their donors after FMT, while the profile of Responder 1 remained stable, even after successful transfer of microbes by FMT. Interestingly, Responder 1 showed less clinical improvement after FMT, with their PUCAI score decreasing from 30 to 15, compared to the other three responders, whose scores fell to 0 after FMT (remission is a PUCAI score < 10). The relatively decreased clinical response in this patient suggests that sufficient metabolomic alteration may be required for effective FMT. Because this subject's microbiota composition shifted toward that of their donor, the successful transfer of microbes by FMT is likely not the only factor affecting the ability of the therapy to alter the metabolomic profile. Conversely, Responder 3 showed a less profound change in microbiota composition after FMT but exhibited a shift toward the metabolomic profile of the donor. This observation suggests that in addition to modifying the composition of the gut microbiome, FMT may also substantially influence its function and metabolism.",

The increased levels of this metabolite in ulcerative colitis patients may be due to preferential growth of cadaverine-producing bacteria, or intestinal damage that increases the availability of substrates for the production of cadaverine. Xanthine, which is part of the purine salvage pathway, increased after FMT. Interestingly, alterations in metabolites in this pathway are associated with changes in regulatory T cell (T reg cell) function and T cell immunoregulation. Larger future studies would be helpful to address whether FMT-associated changes in T cell regulation contribute to reduced colonic inflammation.",

Increased fecal amino acids have been associated with pediatric Crohn's disease, and a recent study showed that the transfer of host nitrogen to gut microbes via bacterial urease expression is associated with gut dysbiosis and inflammation in an animal model (Ni et\u00a0al. 2017). Several amino acids were elevated in baseline samples compared to donors and decreased after FMT, including norvaline, O-acetylserine and trans-4-hydroxyproline (Fig. S8, Supporting Information). However, the levels of most amino acids that were detected varied after FMT. Perhaps unresolved host inflammation supports microbial production of some amino acids, which continues to some extent in patients after FMT.",

Furthermore, animal studies have shown that F. prausnitzii inhibits IL-17 and suppresses Th17 activity (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2014), suggesting an association between this bacterium and reduced mucosal inflammation. F. prausnitzii was present in samples from all four responders after FMT and increased from baseline levels in 3 out of the 4 (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). F. prausnitzii decreased from baseline after FMT in 2 out of the 3 non-responders. This suggests that FMT is associated with the growth of bacteria that contribute to reduced inflammation. F. prausnitzii and other butyrate-producing bacteria have been shown to cross-feed with bifidobacteria to promote butyrate synthesis in the gut, which is associated with improved gut health (Riviere et\u00a0al. 2016). Butyrate is a major fuel source for colonic epithelium (Roediger 1980), and its oxidation is impaired in ulcerative colitis patients (Chapman et\u00a0al. 1994; Den Hond et\u00a0al. 1998). Topical butyrate is effective as an adjunct therapy for UC (Vernia et\u00a0al. 2003), and butyrate enemas have been shown to reduce mucosal inflammation in distal UC, indicating a benefit of increased butyrate levels (Scheppach et\u00a0al. 1992). The anti-inflammatory activity of butyrate in ulcerative colitis has been associated with inhibition of NF-kB activation in lamina propria macrophages, reducing cytokine secretion and inflammation (Luhrs et\u00a0al. 2002).",

In addition to F. prausnitzii, other butyrate-producing bacteria also increased in abundance after FMT, including Anaerostipes and Roseburia (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). Decreased Roseburia levels have been reported in ulcerative colitis patients previously (Machiels et\u00a0al. 2014). The concomitant increase of these groups of bacteria in responders suggests that FMT may promote a cross-feeding interaction with Bifidobacterium spp. to produce butyrate and improve gut health. A recent study of FMT in 34 adult UC patients found an association of sustained remission with known butyrate producers and increased butyrate production (Fuentes et\u00a0al. 2017). Similarly, analysis of short chain fatty acid levels in our samples showed an increase toward donor levels in butyrate after FMT in responders (Fig. \u200b(Fig.7),7), suggesting that enrichment of butyrate-producing organisms is one possible mechanism of this therapy in ulcerative colitis.",

Further study of FMT in pediatric ulcerative colitis may allow for the eventual development of targeted therapies involving alteration of specific components of the gut microbiota in lieu of FMT itself.",
