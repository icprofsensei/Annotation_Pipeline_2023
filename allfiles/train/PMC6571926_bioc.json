In this study, fecal and urine samples from postmenopausal female subjects taking a GTP supplement or placebo for 12 months were compared by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis. The GTP-derived and GTP-responsive metabolites were identified and characterized by structural elucidation and quantitative analysis of the metabolites contributing to the separation of control and treatment samples in the multivariate models. Major GTP and their direct sulfate and glucuronide metabolites were absent in feces and urine. In contrast, GTP-derived phenyl-\u03b3-valerlactone and phenylvaleric acid metabolites were identified as the most abundant GTP-derived metabolites in feces and urine, suggesting extensive microbial biotransformation of GTP in humans. Interestingly, GTP decreased the levels of microbial metabolites of aromatic amino acids (AAA), including indoxyl sulfate, phenylacetylglutamine, and hippuric acid, in urine. However, it did not affect the levels of AAA, as well as other microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids, in feces. 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the fecal microbiome was not significantly affected by chronic consumption of GTP. Overall, microbial metabolism is responsible for the formation of GTP metabolites while GTP metabolism may inhibit the formation of AAA metabolites from microbial metabolism. Because these GTP-derived and GTP-responsive metabolites have diverse bioactivities, microbial metabolism of GTP and AAA may play important roles in the beneficial health effects of green tea consumption in humans.",

                    "text": "Tea (Camellia sinensis) is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water [1]. Green tea, as unfermented tea leaf, contains green tea polyphenols (GTP), which are a series of catechins (flavan-3-ols). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major component of GTP while epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), and epicatechin (EC) are minor components [2]. Like many other polyphenols, GTP are hydrophilic and the substrates of efflux intestinal transporters [3]. These properties limit the bioavailability of GTP by decreasing the absorption in the small intestine and increasing the biliary excretion in the liver. This was confirmed by the fact that only trace amounts of EGCG and ECG were detected in the circulatory system after green tea consumption, and substantial quantities of GTP passed through the small intestine unabsorbed when analyzing ileal fluid collected from ileostomists after the ingestion of GTP [4,5]. Therefore, significant amounts of ingested GTP are subjected to the enzymatic activities of the gut microbial community after reaching the colon [6,7,8]. Human, animal and in vitro studies have shown that the colonic microbiota can convert GTP into a series of phenolic metabolites, which were then present in urine and feces after green tea consumption [9,10,11]. These GTP metabolites in humans were detected from short-term trials (24 h after a single treatment) [12,13,14]. The identification of GTP metabolites from long-term treatment in humans has not been reported.",

Short-term GTP treatment and in vitro studies have shown that GTP can inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus spp., while stimulating the growth of beneficial commensal bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium spp. [15,16,17]. However, the effects of long-term GTP on human gut microbiota composition were not fully examined, with only one study showing no significant change of gut microbial composition after 12-week GTP supplementation [18]. Since a relationship between the role of gut microbiota and the beneficial health effects of GTP has been proposed [19], understanding the bi-directional interaction between GTP and gut microbiota is a key step to unraveling the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects.",

In addition, the high-activity genotype of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) was positively correlated with the post-prandial serum insulin response in the overweight and obese subjects taking the GTP supplement [23].

The distribution of fecal samples in the scores plot of a unsupervised principal components analysis (PCA) model did not show clear separation among the 4 treatment groups, indicating that major components of human fecal metabolome were not dramatically altered after one-year GTP treatment (Figure S1). Nevertheless, subtle changes in fecal metabolome were observed based on the separation of T12 group from T0, P0, and P12 groups in the scores plot of a supervised partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model (Figure 1A). Subsequent analysis of MS signals contributing to this separation in the S-plot from an orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model led to the identification of fecal metabolites that were both increased and decreased by GTP treatment (Figure 1B). A group of hydroxyphenolic compounds, including 5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-valeric acid (If), 3-hydroxyphenyl-valeric acid (IIf), 5-(3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone (IIIf), 4-hydroxy-5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-valeric acid (IVf), and 5-(3\u2032,5\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone (Vf) and 5-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone (VIf), were identified as the most prominent fecal metabolites increased by GTP treatment (Table 1, Figure S2A). Among these GTP metabolites, the structure of 3-hydroxyphenyl-valeric acid (IIf) was confirmed by the authentic standard. Others (If, IIIf-VIf) were elucidated by accurate mass-based elemental composition analysis, their tandem mass (MSMS) fragmentograms (Figure 1C\u2013H), and their reported presence in the fecal samples from the human and animals treated with green tea extracts [24,25].

Two 5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone sulfate metabolites (Iu and IIu), 5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone glucuronide (IIIu), methyl epicatechin sulfate (IVu), and methyl epigallocatechin glucuronide (Vu) were identified as urinary metabolites increased by GTP treatment. Their structures were defined based on accurate mass-based elemental composition analysis, MSMS fragmentograms (Figure 3C\u2013E), and their reported presence in human urine after green tea consumption [25].",

On the other hand, phenylacetylglutamine (VIu), hippuric acid (VIIu), and indoxyl sulfate (VIIIu), three well-known bacterial metabolites of aromatic amino acids (AAA) that were identified all by comparing to authentic standards, were found to be negatively correlated with GTP treatment (Figure 4F\u2013H). Quantitative analysis further confirmed that GTP significantly decreased the level of these microbial metabolites in T12 feces (p = 0.003 for VIu; p = 0.0005 for VIIu; p = 0.0002 for VIIIu) (Figure 4F\u2013H).

The results showed that GTP did not affect the fecal microbial richness since the numbers of detected operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which were based on the average of 21,805 reads per sample (ranging from 5426 to 35,160), did not differ between T0 and T12 samples (p = 0.435, Figure 5A). Both Shannon H indexes and Simpson indexes of T0 and T12 groups showed that GTP treatment did not alter the \u03b1 diversity of fecal microbiome (p = 0.294 for Shannon H index; p = 0.33 for Simpson index, Figure 5B\u2013C). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) on a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix on gut microbial communities also could not separate T0 and T12 groups in the model (Figure 5D). Interestingly, many paired T0 and T12 samples from the same subjects remained close to each other in the model (Figure 5D), suggesting the stability of their fecal microbial profile during one-year GTP treatment. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), which is the analysis of variance using distance matrices and permutation tests, also showed no significant difference between T0 and T12 groups (p = 0.992). The relative abundances of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, the dominating phyla in fecal microbiome (Figure 5E), did not differ between two groups, (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, the false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected Q-value = 0.64 for Firmicutes, 0.64 for Bacteroidetes, and 0.65 for Actinobacteria, respectively). In addition, no significant differences were observed on class, family, and genus levels (data not shown). The status of fecal microbiome was further examined by measuring the levels of major microbial metabolites, including short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid), in feces. The results indicated that GTP treatment did not significantly affect their concentrations (Figure 6A\u2013E). In addition, to investigate whether or not the decreased microbial metabolites of AAA were due to the reduced availability of dietary AAA, the levels of three AAA in feces were determined. No significant difference was detected among all 4 treatment groups (Figure 6F\u2013H).",

In the alimentary canal, unabsorbed EGCG and ECG were hydrolyzed by the esterases in saliva, gastric and pancreatic juices, and microbiota to form EGC and EC, respectively, and release gallic acid [10,11,27,28]. EC can also be formed by the microbial dehydroxylation of EGC [10]. Microbial metabolism of the flavan-3-ol skeleton of EGC, including reductive opening of C ring and subsequent fission of the phloroglucinol moiety of A ring, produced 5-(3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone (IIIf) (Figure 7) [10,12,29]. IIIf could undergo further microbial dehydroxylation at 4\u2032 position on the phenolic ring, forming 5-(3\u2032,5\u2032-trihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone (Vf) [10,29,30]. EC could undergo similar microbial reactions of C ring opening and A ring fission, producing 5-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone (VIf) (Figure 7) [12]. The \u03b3-valerolactone ring of Vf and VIf could be opened through hydrolysis, yielding 4-hydroxy-5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-valeric acid (IVf) [10,12,30]. Microbial dehydroxylation reactions could further convert IVf to 5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-valeric acid (If) and then to 3-hydroxyphenyl-valeric acid (IIf) [10]. Among these 6 fecal GTP metabolites (If\u2013VIf), If has been reported as the major catabolite in rat feces after green tea intake [10], and detected in human feces after red wine consumption [31]. IIIf, Vf and VIf were previously reported to be produced by humans, rats and mice [9,10,30]. However, IIf as a major bacterial catabolite of GTP in human feces has not been reported previously.",

Similarly, absorbed EC was metabolized by COMT-mediated methylation and sulfotransferase (SULT)-mediated sulfation reactions to form methyl epicatechin sulfate (IVu). The presence of methylated EC and EGC metabolites (IVu and Vu), but not the methylated ECG and EGCG metabolites, in urine was consistent with the reported bioavailability of EC (31%) and EGC (14%) in rats, which were significantly greater than that of EGCG (< 1%) [32].

                    "text": "Potential roles of GTP-derived metabolites in reported bioactivities of GTP: Potential beneficial health effects of GTP, including an anti-inflammatory effect, cardioprotection, cancer prevention, neuroprotection, and body weight control, have been documented by numerous in vitro and animal studies [33,34], but the chemical entities responsible for these effects were not well defined. The results of this study clearly showed that microbial metabolites of GTP, mainly phenyl-\u03b3-valerolactones and phenylvaleric acids, are far more abundant than non-microbial metabolites of GTP based on their relative abundances in human urine (Figure 4A\u2013E). Therefore, the microbial metabolites of GTP are more likely responsible for the beneficial effects of GTP. This conclusion is supported by the reported bioactivities of phenyl-\u03b3-valerolactones and phenylvaleric acids in recent studies. Anti-inflammatory activities of phenyl-\u03b3-valerolactones were demonstrated through in vitro studies, in which both trihydroxyphenyl-\u03b3-valerolactone (IIIf) and 5-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactones (VIf) decreased nitric oxide release in murine macrophages [35,36], and 5-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactones (VIf) also decreased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1)- induced nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) transcriptional activity in transfected HepG2 cells [37]. Potential cardioprotective effects of dihydroxyphenyl-\u03b3-valerolactones (Vf and VIf) have also been observed since 5-(3\u2032,5\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone (Vf) significantly decreased systolic blood pressure in a hypertensive rat model [38], and the plasma level of 5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-\u03b3-valerolactone-4\u2032-sulfate was well correlated with flow-mediated vasodilation on healthy human subjects taking cranberry drinks [39]. Moreover, the cancer prevention effect of 5-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl) valeric acid (one possible structure of If), 4-hydroxy-5-(3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trihydroxyphenyl) valeric acid, and 5-(3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trihydroxyphenyl) valeric acid was observed through their inhibitory activity on cancer cells [40]. Despite these promising results, the information on the bioactivites of these phenyl-\u03b3-valerolactones and phenylvaleric acids remains limited. Further studies are needed to understand the disposition (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of these microbial metabolites of GTP inside the body, and their roles in the beneficial health effects of GTP.",

Microbiomic analysis showed that chronic GTP treatment did not influence the overall gut microbiome profile. This result is consistent with the conclusion of a recent human study, in which the subjects consumed no less than 540 mg of EGCG per day for 12 weeks [18]. However, another two short-term GTP human trials have shown that GTP inhibited the growth of Clostridium spp. [16], while it stimulated the growth of bifidobacteria [17]. The dose of GTP in one study (0.4 g/subject, 3 times per day) was comparable to the dose of our study, but the trial only lasted for four weeks, which was much shorter than our study, and the microfloral analysis was conducted with targeted cultures of bacterial colonies, instead of sequencing [16]. In the other short-term study, the subjects consumed 1 liter of green tea drink per day for 10 days, and microbial analysis only examined Bifidobacterium species [17]. Considering the limited coverage of microbial analysis in these two studies, it is reasonable to suggest that short-term GTP treatment might selectively affect a small group of microbial species while long-term GTP treatment may have limited influence on the human gut microbiome, potentially through acclimation or another mechanism. This conclusion is partially supported by the metabolomic analysis in our study since SCFAs and secondary bile acids, the most commonly examined functional metabolites from microbial metabolism in the large intestine, were not affected by GTP. Instead, bacterial metabolites of AAA, including phenylacetylglutamine (VIu), indoxyl sulfate (VIIIu), and hippuric acid (VIIu), were identified as the urinary metabolites that were significantly decreased by GTP, suggesting the existence of selective interactions between AAA metabolism and GTP treatment.",

                    "text": "Potential interactions between AAA metabolism and GTP metabolism: The biosynthesis pathways for forming bacterial metabolites of AAA were well studied. Phenylacetylglutamine (VIu) is formed by the conjugation of glutamine to phenylacetic acid, a bacterial metabolites of tyrosine and phenylalanine [41], while indoxyl sulfate (VIIIu) is formed from the oxidation and sulfation of indole, a bacterial metabolite of tryptophan [42]. Benzoic acid, the precursor of hippuric acid (VIIu), originates from multiple sources, including tyrosine and phenylalanine as well as phenolic compounds in plants [43]. Since digestion, microbial metabolism and post-absorption metabolism are the shared processes in forming microbial metabolites of GTP and AAA in the human body (Figure 7), whether the interactions between AAA metabolism and GTP metabolism occur in these processes is discussed as follows. (1). Interactions might not occur in the digestion since the levels of free AAA in fecal samples did not differ among 4 treatment groups (Figure 6F\u2013H). This observation suggested that the decreases of VIu\u2013VIIIu were not due to the decreases of their AAA precursors released from protein digestion in the intestine. (2). Interactions might occur in the post-absorption metabolism because of partial overlapping in the sulfation to form GTP metabolites (Iu, IIu, IVu) and the sulfation to form indoxyl sulfate (VIIIu). This type of competition on the enzymes and the cofactor of sulfation reactions had been observed between xenobiotics and bacterial amino acid metabolites [44]. However, it might not explain the decreases of phenylacetylglutamine and hippuric acid, which were formed by amino acid conjugations. (3). Interactions likely occurred in the microbial metabolism through both competitive and non-competitive inhibition of bacterial enzymes. Multiple types of reactions, including transamination, oxidative decarboxylation, dehydroxylation, were responsible for producing the intermediates (such as phenylpyruvic acid, 4-OH-phenylpyruvic acid, and indolepyruvic acid) and end products (such as phenylacetic acid, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, indole, and benzoic acid) in the bacterial metabolism of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan (Figure 7) [41,45,46,47,48,49]. In the microbial metabolism of GTP, dehydroxylation occurs in the B ring while oxidation and decarboxylation might occur in the fission of the A ring (Figure 7) [50]. Therefore, competitive inhibition could occur if the same enzymes and reactions were shared between microbial metabolism of GTP and AAA. Moreover, it has been shown that GTP, especially EGCG, can function as the inhibitors of diverse dehydrogenases and decarboxylases [51,52,53]. It is possible that GTP-elicited noncompetitive inhibition may suppress similar reactions in bacterial AAA metabolism.",

Differences in GTP treatment between this long-term feeding study (1.3 g GTP/day for 12 months) and previous short-term studies (such as 6 g GTP in 24 h) may contribute to this discrepancy on GTP-elicited changes in urinary hippuric acid since gallic acid from GTP is a direct precursor of hippuric acid. Besides the increases of phenylacetylglutamine (VIu), indoxyl sulfate (VIIIu), and hippuric acid (VIIu) in urine, the increase of glutaric acid (VIIf) in feces, a known bacterial metabolite, was observed. Interestingly, the increase of glutaric acid in feces was also observed in humans consuming red wine rich in polyphenols [31]. Since tryptophan and lysine have been identified as the precursors of glutaric acid in bacterial metabolism [55,56], whether the increase of glutaric acid in the current study was associated with altered microbial metabolism of amino acids or other specific metabolic pathways requires further studies.",

Interestingly, GTP, especially EGCG, have been shown to be protective against CKD [59] and cardiometabolic diseases [60], and these beneficial effects have been largely attributed to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of GTP. The results from this study suggest that decreasing the levels of uremic toxins might be an additional mechanism behind these protective effects of GTP.

For urine sample analysis, 0.1% formic acid (A) and ACN containing 0.1% formic acid (B) were used as mobile phase. The LC eluant was introduced into a Xevo-G2-S quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOFMS, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) for accurate mass measurement and ion counting. Capillary voltage and cone voltage for electrospray ionization were maintained at 0.1 kV and 5 V respectively for negative-mode detection. Source temperature and desolvation temperature were set at 120 and 350 \u00b0C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as both cone gas (50 L/h) and desolvation gas (800 L/h), and argon was used as collision gas. For accurate mass measurement, the mass spectrometer was calibrated with sodium formate solution with a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 50\u22121000 and monitored by intermittent injection of the lock mass leucine enkephalin ([M \u2212 H]\u2212 = m/z 554.2615) in real time. Mass chromatograms and mass spectral data were acquired and processed by MassLynx software (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) in centroided format. The chemical identities of compounds of interest were determined by accurate mass measurement, elemental composition analysis, MSMS fragmentation, and comparisons with authentic standards (if available).

The intensity of each ion was calculated by normalizing the single-ion counts (SIC) versus the total-ion counts (TIC) in the whole chromatogram. The data matrix was exported into SIMCA-P+ software (Umetrics, Kinnelon, NJ, USA) and transformed by Pareto scaling, and then characterized by multivariate data analysis. Both unsupervised principal components analysis (PCA) models and supervised models from partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and supervised orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were constructed to delineate the relationship among sample groups, as well as the contribution of each MS signal to the principal components (PCs) of the multivariate model. The compounds contributing to the sample separation in the model were identified based on their p[1] and p(corr)[1] values in the S-plot of OPLS-DA model, which represented their weight and reliability on representing the difference among samples, respectively.",
