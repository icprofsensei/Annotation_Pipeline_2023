We recruited and sampled saliva and oral biofilm from a cohort of humans either periodontally healthy or with mild or significant periodontal disease to discern whether there are differences in viral communities that reflect their oral health status. We found communities of viruses inhabiting saliva and the subgingival and supragingival biofilms of each subject that were composed largely of bacteriophage. While there were homologous viruses common to different subjects and biogeographic sites, for most of the subjects, virome compositions were significantly associated with the oral sites from which they were derived. The largest distinctions between virome compositions were found when comparing the subgingival and supragingival biofilms to those of planktonic saliva. Differences in virome composition were significantly associated with oral health status for both subgingival and supragingival biofilm viruses but not for salivary viruses. Among the differences identified in virome compositions was a significant expansion of myoviruses in subgingival biofilm, suggesting that periodontal disease favors lytic phage. We also characterized the bacterial communities in each subject at each biogeographic site by using the V3 hypervariable segment of the 16S rRNA and did not identify distinctions between oral health and disease similar to those found in viral communities. The significantly altered ecology of viruses of oral biofilm in subjects with periodontal disease compared to that of relatively periodontally healthy ones suggests that viruses may serve as useful indicators of oral health status.",

We investigated the composition of human oral viral communities in a group of relatively periodontally healthy subjects or significant periodontitis to determine whether health status may be associated with differences in viruses. We found that most of the viruses present were predators of bacteria. The viruses inhabiting dental plaque were significantly different on the basis of oral health status, while those present in saliva were not. Dental plaque viruses in periodontitis were predicted to be significantly more likely to kill their bacterial hosts than those found in healthy mouths. Because oral diseases such as periodontitis have been shown to have altered bacterial communities, we believe that viruses and their role as drivers of ecosystem diversity are important contributors to the human oral microbiome in health and disease states.",

Viruses inhabiting human body surfaces may be key factors in shaping human microbial ecology (1,\u20137), but the potential role of viral communities in human health and disease remains largely unexplored (2, 8,\u201310). Microbial communities can now be studied in greater detail because of the increased accessibility of sequencing technology and improved analytical capabilities (11). There have been numerous studies of the bacterial communities inhabiting human body surfaces, such as the skin (12, 13) and the gastrointestinal (14, 15), respiratory (16, 17), and genitourinary tracts (18,\u201320) but fewer studies of the viral communities inhabiting these sites. While studies of viral communities have shown that viruses on human body surfaces are diverse (5,\u20137, 21), studies have yet to illuminate how viral community diversity and membership pertain to human health and disease.",

Some have hypothesized that the disease is caused by the host immune response to the presence of specific pathogens (23,\u201327). Historically, microbiological aspects of periodontal disease and dental caries have been studied by culture-based or PCR/hybridization-based methods to detect pathogens collected from subgingival plaque. Bacterial species such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (28), Tannerella forsythia (29), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (30), Streptococcus mutans (31), and Treponema denticola (32) have been implicated as etiological agents of periodontal disease by using these or similar methods (33,\u201335). Herpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have also been looked at in association with periodontitis (36,\u201341). Certain studies have shown an increased presence of HSV-1, CMV, and/or EBV in subgingival plaque at sites of periodontitis (36, 39, 40), while others studies have shown no association (38, 42,\u201344). Now, as our paradigms for understanding the interconnection between microbes and human health change, much of the study of microbes in periodontal disease has shifted toward studying communities rather than individual pathogens (45,\u201350). Rather than verification of the presence of a few viruses present in periodontitis, we are interested in the broader dynamics of the communities of organisms present on and interacting with the gingiva and associated tissues.",

While herpesviruses may be present in the oral cavity, there is a much larger population of viruses present, the majority of which are bacteriophage (6, 21). Many of these phage belong to the Caudovirus families Siphoviridae (generally lysogenic with intermediate host ranges), Myoviridae (typically lytic with relatively broad host ranges), and Podoviridae (typically lytic with relatively narrow host ranges) (52, 53). Communities of oral viruses are highly personalized and vary according to host sex (6, 54). Unrelated household contacts share significant proportions of their viromes, which suggests that substantial environmental influences affect oral viral ecology (21). Because oral viruses have been shown to elicit host immune responses, they could potentially play a role in shaping oral immunity and disease pathogenesis (10, 54). In addition, we previously demonstrated that human oral viruses carry substantial gene functions that may be involved in the pathogenic functions of their host bacteria (6), which suggests a more subtle role for viruses as members of the human oral microbiome.",

We subjected all contigs to BLASTX analysis against the NCBI Nonredundant (NR) database to identify homologous sequences.

The substantial differences in the structural genes identified in contigs from each biogeographic site (40.7% of the contigs from saliva, 12.4% of those from subgingival plaque, and 16.3% of those from supragingival plaque) account for much of the observed differences. These differences are likely explained by a lack of viruses present in the NR database that are homologous to subgingival and supragingival microbiota. Similar differences were not observed for homologues involved in viral replication and integration, where 37.0% of the contigs from saliva had these homologues, 43.8% of those from subgingival plaque had them, and 43.3% of those from supragingival plaque had them (Fig.\u00a01).",

In addition, the abundance of podoviruses from each site was similar but the relative abundance of myoviruses varied considerably by site and disease state. Myoviruses were significantly more abundant in saliva from healthy individuals (Fig.\u00a03A), though siphoviruses remained the most abundant viral type in healthy subjects and in those with disease. In subgingival plaque, however, we found myoviruses to be significantly more abundant in those with periodontal disease than in healthy subjects (Fig.\u00a03B). Myoviruses are generally lytic, and their predominance in subjects with periodontal disease suggests a more active role for viruses in driving bacterial diversity in the subgingival crevice. The myoviruses in subgingival plaque from subjects with periodontal disease were even more abundant than siphoviruses, which was not observed in any other oral microenvironment studied.

We found that viruses of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were highly prevalent in saliva, followed by those of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria (Fig.\u00a05A). In contrast, viruses of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes predominated in oral biofilm, with those of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria representing only a small minority of the viruses identified (Fig.\u00a05B and C). The relative proportions of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes phage were all significantly different (P < 0.05) when the taxonomic compositions of viral communities in saliva and oral biofilm were compared. Many of these differences were also reflected in the taxonomies of the bacterial communities, where Firmicutes predominated in saliva, compared to a relatively even distribution of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in oral biofilm (Fig.\u00a05D to F).",

This suggests that the significant differences in viral communities may be more closely related to the virus families present than to their putative bacterial hosts (Fig.\u00a03B). In saliva, there was a trend to lower levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in orally healthy subjects than in those with disease, although only the difference in Firmicutes levels was statistically significant (Fig.\u00a05A).

We previously demonstrated that there are robust communities of viruses that inhabit human saliva (6) and that many of these viruses are highly persistent over time (54). Because many of these persistent oral viruses are bacteriophage, they could play a role in determining oral bacterial community membership. We investigated the membership of the oral viral community in relatively periodontally healthy subjects and those with significant disease to determine whether there might exist ecological distinctions in the viral populations reflected in oral health status. We examined the viruses present in planktonic saliva and in subgingival and supragingival biofilms to provide a broad overview of different oral ecological niches. Our finding that membership in the biofilm virome is significantly associated with periodontal health and disease is the first statistically supported evidence that oral viral community membership is associated with a human disease condition.",

In this study, many of the phage encountered at all oral sites were predicted to be siphoviruses, which generally have lysogenic lifestyles by integrating into their host genomes. Lysogenic oral viruses live in dynamic equilibrium with their cellular hosts and, as a result, are highly persistent members of the human oral microbiome (54). Myoviruses are often lytic and, because of their increased virulence for their host bacteria, may have a great impact upon local bacterial diversity. Myoviruses were highly prevalent in the subgingival crevice in subjects with periodontal disease (Fig.\u00a03B), suggesting an expanded role in driving bacterial diversity in oral biofilm. In the development of periodontal disease, the surfaces of the gums and bones pull away from the teeth, forming pockets that are generally inhabited by different bacteria. While the profound differences in the subgingival virobiota may merely reflect changes in the bacterial biota that colonize these exposed pockets, the differences in the subgingival plaque virome in subjects with periodontal disease may also have other biological implications. The lytic phage in the subgingival crevice likely help to shape the local microbiota and contribute to the local microbial community structure and alter local biodiversity.",

Similar taxonomic differences were not observed when periodontally healthy subjects were compared with those with disease, suggesting that much of the observed differences in our subjects may have been due to changes in the relative abundance of virus families rather than their bacterial hosts. Because of their substantial coevolution with their bacterial hosts, culture-independent methods based on patterns of nucleotide usage are relatively accurate in predicting the hosts of lysogenic viruses at the genus level (56). However, techniques used to predict bacterial hosts are generally less successful at predicting the hosts of lytic viruses; thus, we opted to characterize lytic viruses only at a high taxonomic level in this study to reduce the potential for inaccuracy.",

Our methods and sequencing depth were designed to characterize the most abundant oral viruses (6) and likely offer limited insight into the less-abundant members of the human oral virome. This analysis included only DNA viruses, and it remains unclear whether the mouth is also inhabited by RNA viral communities. Because of the limited starting volume of saliva and the relatively scarce quantities of DNA recovered, we used multiple-displacement amplification (MDA) before sequencing each virome. MDA may introduce biases into sequence data, particularly when relatively small quantities of starting nucleic acids are used (57). There are no available collections of non-MDA-treated oral viromes for comparison; however, substantial systematic and directional amplification biases would be necessary to reproduce the statistically significant trends found in these viromes. We used two separate techniques to assemble the sequence data, and they showed similar trends in individual-specific, biogeographic site-specific, and oral health status-specific viruses in each subject or subject group. We preferred to create the initial assemblies from each subject rather than use global assemblies from all of the subjects to reduce the potential for chimerism. Although the two methods showed similar trends, only the method that uses assemblies from individual subjects produced statistically significant results (Tables\u00a02 and 3).",

There are conserved viral genotypes in the respiratory tracts of human subjects with cystic fibrosis (2), which could potentially be attributable to shared bacterial ecology. Our data, however, indicate a high level of commonality among bacterial species representation between relatively periodontally healthy subjects and those with more advanced disease but still showed that viruses were significantly associated with oral health status. A study of gut microbial communities in persons with Crohn\u2019s disease showed lower viral and bacterial diversity than in controls (58); however, both could potentially have been explained by antibiotic administration. Only one healthy subject in this study received any antibiotics (Table\u00a01), and thus, antibiotics cannot explain the significant differences between the viral communities found in periodontally healthy subjects and those found in subjects with disease (Table\u00a03). A recent study demonstrated a strong association between (i) host immune status and the use of antiviral therapies and (ii) viral community constituents in human plasma (8), indicating that viral communities respond to drug-mediated perturbations. The effects of such perturbations on human oral viral communities have yet to be reported on.",

Our approach is the first to assess oral biogeographic differences in the viral microbiota of the human microbiome. Because of the substantial biomass necessary to evaluate DNA viruses by our techniques, we had to pool plaque samples from individual teeth in order to have sufficient biomass to examine subgingival and supragingival viral communities. As expected, the viral (Fig.\u00a03B) and bacterial (Fig.\u00a05A) biota of subgingival and supragingival plaque samples had similarities; however, each was quite distinct from that of saliva. The difference in viral ecology between planktonic saliva and biofilm communities is likely attributable to differences in the ecology of the bacteria and archaea that inhabit each individual niche and the various lifestyles observed (Fig.\u00a03). Biogeographic differences in the cellular microbiota may also explain our relative inability to identify sequences homologous to many biofilm-derived viral structural genes (Fig.\u00a01), as the biofilm had abundant bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria (Fig.\u00a05D to F) relative to Firmicutes (highly represented in saliva) and the representation of viruses for these bacteria may be heterogeneous in the NR database. There are several factors that likely contribute to our finding significant associations between viruses, individual subjects, and oral health status, while not identifying similar trends in the bacterial biota. First, the difference in the techniques used (metagenomics versus 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) probably accounted for some of the differences observed, likely resulting in lower resolution for the detection of differences among the members of the bacterial biota. Second, our analysis of viral and bacterial community constituents was based on the relative abundance of community members rather than just their presence or absence. When taking into account only the presence or absence of taxa, both the virobiota and the bacterial biota showed significant subject specificity and associations with oral health status (data not shown). Lastly, many human subjects have bacterial species in common; however, the prophage in these genomes vary considerably (59, 60). The relative host specificity of these prophage, particularly when they are expressed as virions, may account for much of the subject specificity detailed in this report. Therefore, the relatively large proportion of lysogenic siphoviruses identified in each subject and at each biogeographic site would contribute substantially to the subject specificity observed.",

We recently demonstrated that unrelated household contacts are significantly more likely to have oral viruses in common (61), suggesting that they may be exposed to viruses from the same environmental reservoir. Furthermore, oral viruses are significantly associated with the sex of their human host (54), suggesting that host factors such as hormones may play a formative role in human viral ecology. The reservoir of antibiotic resistance is expanded in the mouse gut virome in response to antibiotic perturbation (62). In gut viromes, diet plays an important formative role in the ecology of viral communities (3). While the nature of the perturbations that result in periodontal disease in humans may be variable, our data demonstrate that altered oral viral ecology is an associated feature of significant periodontitis. Viruses of bacteria have the potential to eradicate their hosts or to provide them with beneficial gene functions (6); thus, the predominantly lytic viruses in the subgingival crevice may have the capacity to shape the natural history of the oral microbiome in persons with periodontal disease. While the oral microbiome has been hypothesized to play a role in the development of periodontal disease (63,\u201365), the role of viruses in these microbial communities has not been elucidated. Because of their potential to shape human microbial communities, as well as host immune responses, viruses likely also play an important role in human oral health status.",

Homologous contigs were determined by parsing BLASTX results for known viral genes, including replication, structural, transposition, restriction/modification, hypothetical, and other genes previously found in viruses for which the E\u00a0score was at least 10\u22125. Each individual virome contig was annotated by this technique (Fig.\u00a01); however, if the best hit for any portion of the contig was to a gene with no known function, lower-level hits were used as long as they had known functions and still met the E\u00a0score cutoff. The annotation data were compiled for all of the subjects and used to determine the relative proportion of assembled contigs that contained viral homologues. The phylum of the cellular hosts for each annotated contig was used to determine taxonomic distributions in each subject and at each biogeographic site. The relative abundances of virus families were determined by BLASTX analysis of the SEED database with MG-RAST (72). Analysis of shared homologues in each virome was performed by creating custom BLAST databases for each virome, comparing each database with all other viromes by BLASTN analysis (E score, <10\u221210). Heat maps were generated on the basis of shared homologues across all of the subjects and depicted with JAVA Treeview (73). Heat map data were normalized on the basis of the total number of viral contigs for each virome. PCOA was performed on homologous virome contigs by using binary Sorensen distances and Qiime (74). We also used a separate technique for assembly by constructing global assemblies from all of the reads from all of the subjects and all of the time points with 98% identity over a minimum of 50% read overlap. The contribution of each subject and time point to each assembly was assessed and used to construct heat maps with Java Treeview (73).",

We amplified the bacterial 16S rRNA V3 hypervariable region with the forward primer 341F (CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG) fused with the Ion Torrent Adaptor A sequence and one of 23 unique 10-bp bar codes and reverse primer 514R (ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG) fused with the Ion Torrent Adaptor P1 from each subject and biogeographic site (75). PCRs were performed with Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with the following cycling parameters: 94\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, 53\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, and 72\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s and a final elongation step of 72\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min.

Sequences were assigned to their respective samples on the basis of their 10-nt bar code sequences and analyzed further with Qiime (74). Briefly, representative OTUs from each set were chosen at a minimum sequence identity of 97% with UClust (76) and aligned with PyNast (77) against the GreenGenes database (69). Multiple alignments then were used to create phylogenies with FastTree (78), and taxonomy was assigned to each OTU with the RDP classifier (79, 80).
