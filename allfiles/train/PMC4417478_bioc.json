Both acidogenic and aciduric bacteria, mainly the mutans streptococci (Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus) and lactobacilli, are known to be the primary aetiological agents of dental caries. Thus, a caries-free healthy dentition usually has low levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva and dental plaque. This level, however, can increase if the host frequently ingests sugar or other fermentable carbohydrates, thereby altering the bacterial composition from one that is mutually symbiotic to one associated with dental caries3. Periodontal diseases, on the other hand, are associated with the alteration from more Gram-positive facultative anaerobes found in healthy gingiva to more Gram-negative species that result from plaque accumulation3. Thus, it appears that oral health depends on maintaining a highly diverse, but balanced, bacterial composition. As such, both understanding and monitoring the interactive and dynamic changes in the microbial community are essential for developing preventive measures and promoting oral health.",

Studies by Goodson et al reported that professional dental prophy-laxis significantly reduced total plaque score (clinical evaluation) and, hence, bacterial level, as determined by DNA probe analysis7. Using DGGE, oral microbial changes were able to be categorised following dental prophylaxis8. Taking this procedure a step further, we decided to combine the use of DGGE with 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis to evaluate the effect of standard prophylactic procedure followed by tooth brushing using a therapeutic dentifrice on oral bacterial composition, as determined from supragingival plaque samples taken at baseline (0 h) and 24 h after the procedure.",

Total bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from the sample using the MaterPure\u2122 DNA purification kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI), as previously described5,6,8,9. For all PCR applications, the final concentration of each DNA sample was adjusted to 10 ng/ml. PCR was performed with the GeneAmp\u00aePCR System 9700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A set of universal bacterial 16S rDNA primers, forward prbac1 (5\u2032-CGCCCGGGGC-GCGCCCCG-GGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGACTACGT-GCCAGCAGCC-3\u2032) and reverse prbac2 (5\u2032-GGAC-TACCAGGGTATCT-ACTAATCC-3\u2032)10, which target the hypervariable V4 V5 regions of the Escherichia coli 16S rDNA ribosomal locus, was used with a 40-nucleotide GC-clamp11 added to the 5\u2032 end of prbac1. Each standardised PCR mixture (a total volume of 50 ml) contained 100 ng of total genomic DNA, 0.8 mM of dNTP, 40 pmol of each primer, 4.0 mM of MgCl, 2, 5 ml of 10X PCR buffer II and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (PE Applied Biosystems). The PCR conditions were the same as previously described5,6,8,9. The PCR products were evaluated by electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose gels run at 60 V for 60 min, and the sizes of all amplicons (300 base pairs) were confirmed according to a molecular size standard. A standardised 20 ml of each PCR-amplified product was loaded on the DGGE gel and separated with the Bio-Rad DcodeTM System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A 40% to 60% linear DNA denaturing gradient was formed in 8% (w/v) polyacrylamidegels. PCR products were directly loaded into each lane. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant 60 V at 58\u00b0C for 16 h in 1X Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer (pH 8.5), as previously described5,6,8,9. After electrophoresis, gels were rinsed and stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml) for 15 min, followed by 15 min destaining in water. DGGE images were digitally captured with the AlphaImager 3300 System (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA) and analysed with Fingerprinting II Informatix\u2122 Software (Bio-Rad). Levels of similarity between fingerprints were calculated based on the Dice coefficient of pairwise comparisons. A dendrogram was constructed based on Ward\u2019s method and algorithm for cluster analysis12. Differences in the microbial composition before and after the prophylactic procedure and tooth brushing were assessed by comparing the DGGE profiles of the amplified 16S rRNA gene segments. Significant differences in the number of detected PCR amplicons in the DGGE gels were determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-test. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 17.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL). All P-values < 0.05 were two-tailed and considered significant.",

The coverage and the total number of sequences for the clone library analysed for microbial diversity were calculated according to Good\u2019s coverage estimation16. Estimates of phylotype richness were calculated according to the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE)17. Collector\u2019s curves of observed and estimated richness were calculated in DOTUR15. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index18 was also calculated using DOTUR. Furthermore, \u222b-LIBSHUFF19 was used to determine whether observed differences in 16S rDNA sequence libraries were the result of underlying variability in the microbial populations or an artefact resulting from insufficient bacterial population sampling.

(1) Within the Firmicutes phylum, 24% of sequenced clones fell into the Bacilli class. The most abundant order was Lactobacillales, which was dominated by Streptococcaceae, mainly including S. oralis, S. gon-donii, S. cristatus and S. sanguinis. (2) The phylum Bacteroidetes was found in all four libraries, but varied in abundance. The most abundant group within this phylum was the Prevotellaceae family, mainly observed in the 24-h group from subject 11 (74.29%). (3) Twenty-five percent of all clones were in the Proteobacteria phylum. The most abundant class was b-proteobacteria, as well as g-proteobacteria and e-proteobacteria. (4) Only 32 Fusobacteria clones were identified in both 24-h and 0-h samples from subject 11. These included Fusobacterium and Leptotrichia. (5) Actinobacteria found in all libraries, albeit in low abundance, included the genera Corynebacterium, Rothia and Actinomyces. (6) A total of 9 TM7 clones were obtained from both 24-h and 0-h samples, indicating that the prevalence of this group of uncultivated bacteria was as low as 2.4%.",

Estimates of phylotype richness were calculated according to the ACE17 and the bias-corrected Chao1 estimator21. By randomly selecting 95 100 clones per library, we found that the gap between observed and estimated richness of bacterial phylotypes was smaller at 0 h compared with 24 h, suggesting that additional sampling at 24 h would be necessary to obtain constant estimates of the number of unobserved phylotypes in the clinical sample. Furthermore, \u222b-LIBSHUFF pairwise comparisons of pooled libraries (0 h versus 24 h) revealed that all the libraries were statistically different from one another (P < 0.001) (Table 3). In addition, the statistical test results demonstrated significant differences both in subject-to-subject libraries and 0-h versus 24-h libraries (P < 0.001) (Table 3), suggesting that the observed differences between the paired libraries could have resulted from underlying differences in the dental plaque from which they were derived.",

Here we employed two different molecular-based PCR techniques, DGGE profile and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, which demonstrated a shift in bacterial phylotype distribution, confirming changes in bacterial composition observed in the earlier study8. For example, compared with the post-prophylaxis samples, more high-density bands (DGGE) and bacterial phyla of lower G+C content were observed for Firmicutes and Fusobacteria groups in the baseline plaque samples. Conversely, compared with the baseline plaque samples, more high-density bands (DGGE) and bacterial phyla of higher G+C content were observed for the Bacteroidetes groups in the post-prophylaxis samples.",

The cluster analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed two distinct clusters of DGGE profiles, suggesting that the overall microbial composition had changed within 24 h. Since all subjects in this study were instructed to brush their teeth with the dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan/2.0% PVM/MA copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride after receiving dental prophylaxis, the changes in bacterial composition could not be attributed either to dental prophylaxis or the use of the dentifrice alone. In spite of that, a body of evidence based on clinical studies has shown the 0.3% triclosan (a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent), 2.0% PVM/MA copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride dentifrice has therapeutic effect against bacterial colonisation, gingivitis and the progression of periodontal disease24\u201326. The observed changes in the present study, therefore, could be from the combined effect of dental prophylaxis and the use of the 0.3% triclosan/2.0% PVM/MA copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride dentifrice, suggesting that their combined effect could provide a potentially beneficial effect on balancing the bacterial community in the oral cavity.",

Based on the analysis of 36,043 16S rRNA gene sequences, Dewhirst and others reported six major phyla, including Firmicutes (36.7%), Bacteroidetes (17.3%), Proteobacteria (17.1%), Actinobacteria (11.6%), Spirochaetes (7.9%), Fusobacteria (5.2%) and TM7 (1.9%)29. The phylogenetic distribution observed in this study was similar to their findings, except for spirochaetes. The difference in the findings compared with those of other investigators was not unexpected1,29 given the relatively low prevalence of spirochaete species in saliva, and the fact that only four 16S rRNA gene libraries containing 371 sequences were included in this pilot study. Furthermore, the DNA sequences were based on an average molecular size of 300 base pair PCR products; therefore, interpreting the results of a 16S rRNA gene similarity search based on \u2018first hit\u2019 or \u2018closest match\u2019 may not necessarily represent the actual identity of a bacterial isolate27. Consequently, the sequences of 16S rRNA gene similarity identified in our study can only be confidently identified at the genus, not the species, level, especially the sequences which show <94% similarity. Interestingly, this study showed a relatively moderate value for library sample coverage and high value for diversity index. Since only 100 clones per library of 16S rRNA genes were sufficient to provide valuable insight into the primary membership of microbial communities, we anticipate that additional sampling would increase the phylotype richness in each subject.",

Second, the results from 16S rRNA-based molecular analysis indicated that these changes occurred within three phyla: Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes. It is well known that dental caries and chronic periodontal diseases are associated with polymicrobial colonisation. Although significant variation in oral bacterial community composition has been reported, a greater degree of diversity is associated with good oral health5,6,8. The findings of this study suggest that application of the standard prophylaxis plus brushing with the 0.3% triclosan/2.0% PVM/MA copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride dentifrice may promote a healthier microbial composition in dental plaque. A full-scale clinical trial is needed to further determine the potential effect of the dentifrice, as well as good oral health practices, on microbiota shifts. Understanding the nature of the microbial composition and its response to perturbation, such as prophylaxis, brushing, flossing and other oral health practices, could provide valuable insight for the development of novel preventive dental care programmes and treatment.",
