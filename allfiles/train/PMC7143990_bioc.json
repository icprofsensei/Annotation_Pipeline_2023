Given the growing evidence of gut microbiota being involved in psychiatric (including neurodevelopmental) disorders, we aimed to identify differences in gut microbiota composition between participants with ADHD and controls and to investigate the role of the microbiota in inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Fecal samples were collected from 107 participants (NADHD = 42; Ncontrols = 50; NsubthreholdADHD = 15; range age: 13\u201329 years). The relative quantification of bacterial taxa was done using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Beta-diversity revealed significant differences in bacterial composition between participants with ADHD and healthy controls, which was also significant for inattention, but showing a trend in case of hyperactivity/impulsivity only. Ten genera showed nominal differences (p < 0.05) between both groups, of which seven genera were tested for their association with ADHD symptom scores (adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, time delay between feces collection and symptoms assessment, medication use, and family relatedness). Our results show that variation of a genus from the Ruminococcaceae family (Ruminococcaceae_UCG_004) is associated (after multiple testing correction) with inattention symptoms and support the potential role of gut microbiota in ADHD pathophysiology.",

ADHD has a significant social impact on patients\u2019 lives, causing disruption at school [3], work [4], and in personal relationships [5]. Typically, ADHD has its onset in childhood and can persist into adulthood.

In order to maximize information content and, at the same time, include as many genera as possible, we included only genera with non-zero values in at least 10% of the samples in both groups.

Given the skewed distribution of the microbial relative abundance prior to the association analyses, we investigated linear regression assumptions and identified and removed extreme and influential samples (outliers). Outliers are known to have a significant effect on the regression model (but not on the non-parametric test [32]). Outliers were defined by Cook\u2019s distance above (4/n) (where n is the number of observations) and Leverage value above (3 \u00d7 (k+1)/n) (where k is the number of independent variables, in our case k = 5) [34,35]. Cook\u2019s distance identifies influential values, which do not have to be necessarily the extreme ones; these can be identified by Leverage. Therefore, a sample was excluded from the analysis only if it scored above the threshold for both values.

ADONIS revealed a significant effect of ADHD diagnosis and symptom severity on the variation in the beta-diversity. The variation in beta-diversity was significantly explained by disorder status (N = 88; variance explained = 3.2%; P = 0.033), and inattention score (IA) (N = 102; variance explained = 3.7%; P = 0.014), whereas hyperactivity/impulsivity score (HI) was at trend level (N = 102; variance explained = 2.4%; (P = 0.059). Age, sex, BMI, and medication did not have a significant effect on beta-diversity (Table 2). Additionally, PCoA based on weighted UniFrac distance did not show a clear discrimination of microbial composition between the two groups determined by disorder status (ADHD vs. controls) (Figure S3).",

Due to the variability in the correlation, we carried out a multiple regression analysis including all selected genera in one model (Table S3) and investigated the unique contribution of the associated genera to inattention symptoms. Regardless of correlation structure, removing one of the strongly correlated taxa (Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group or Ruminococcaceae_UCG_005) did not significantly change the results. After controlling for other bacterial taxa (and age, sex, BMI, diff_days, and a random factor for family relatedness), Ruminococcaceae_UCG_004 again showed the highest association with inattention score (B = 43.920, P = 0.001), followed by Ruminococcus_2 (B = 1.525, P = 0.001).

Our results showed general differences in microbiota composition (beta-diversity) between the groups as well as differences at the genus level, where the relative abundance of the Ruminococcaceae_UCG_004 genus was associated with ADHD inattention symptoms. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the association between Ruminococcaceae_UCG_004 and inattention was independent of other (selected) genera. Our results also point towards a potential effect of genera such as Ruminococcus_2 and Ruminococcaceae_uncultured on inattention.",

                    "text": "Our results are in line with the growing evidence that the gut microbiome might be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders. The Ruminococcaceae family and the genera belonging to this family have shown altered relative abundance in individuals diagnosed with several psychiatric diseases, i.e., autism, bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, as well as ADHD [40,41,42,43]. Even though there is a lack of knowledge about the functional role of Ruminoccocace_UCG_004 genus and its effect on the host, the Ruminococcaceae family is well described. This family is commonly present in the mammalian intestinal tract, displaying the ability to degrade cellulose and hemicellulose from plant material [44]. These compounds are subsequently fermented and converted to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can be absorbed and used as energy source by the host [45]. SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) are produced (among others) by strains of Ruminococcus [46], which are known for mucosal colonization [47], and have been shown to play a potential role in autism [48,49] and in ADHD [50]. Furthermore, Ruminococcus_2, became significantly associated with symptoms of inattention in the multivariate analysis (Table S3). This suggests that, even in the absence of significant correlations with other bacteria (Figure S7), there could be a bacterial community interaction pattern that explains more variance than a genus alone on inattention symptoms. Lastly, our lab recently performed a separate study, in which six randomly selected samples from the NeuroIMAGE cohort (same cohort studied here) were used in an animal study of human fecal microbiota transplantation into germ-free wild-type mice [51]. Mice colonized with ADHD gut microbiota had increased anxiety-like behavior and showed significantly altered structural and functional brain characteristics. In this study, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_004 was positively correlated with a specific anxiety measure in the mice. Taken together, these results suggest that genera belonging to Ruminococcaceae family may exert a specific effect on neurobiological processes key to brain development and several psychiatric diseases including ADHD.",

E. gabavorous seems to be the only isolated human gut bacteria showing ability to consume gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) [52,53]. This is relevant because GABA is a naturally occurring amino acid that works as a neurotransmitter. GABA is considered an inhibitory neurotransmitter because it blocks, or inhibits, certain brain signals and decreases activity in the central nervous system and plays a role in neuropsychiatric disorders including ADHD [54,55]. Moreover, there are studies pointing out the relevance of studying the gut microbiome in relation to GABA involvement in ADHD etiology [50].",

Our strengths include the use of a sample with high-quality clinical assessment and of age-matched clinically ascertained controls. The limitations of our study are: i) limited sample size (although it is the largest sample of its kind so far, N = 98) and ii) the fact that we were not able to collect information on lifestyle, dietary patterns (including probiotics), or antibiotic use at the time of feces collection. For the former, we applied two QC steps in order to deal with the big number of variables (genera), their expected small effects and big interindividual variation of the gut microbiota. First, we applied an uncorrected non-parametric approach (to identify differences between two groups, reduce number of variables and prioritize the selection of candidate taxa). Second, we applied an outlier detection step, prior to our regression analysis, in order to reduce the chance of false positives/negatives. For the latter, we were only able to collect information on BMI and while we acknowledge that this is not enough to account for the effects of diet and lifestyle, it is encouraging to see that there was no difference between the groups. Moreover, we looked for and removed samples with a very low bacterial diversity (high proportion of zeros) by applying a 10% genus-based frequency cut-off per sample. This can be used as a proxy for those individuals currently using antibiotics which would show a smaller bacterial diversity.",

(2017) [19] investigated samples that show important overlap (around 40%) with our data set. This paper reported that Bifidobacterium genus showed the largest difference (nominally significant) between the ADHD group and controls. We did not replicate this difference in the current study. The reason for the lack of replication between studies could be due to methodological differences. These include DNA extraction [58], 16S rRNA gene region [59], bioinformatic pipeline, data processing and analysis [60], sample size, and study design. Moreover, the age range (children vs. adults) differences between studies can underscore variation in ADHD symptoms, other non-shared environmental influences and gut microbiome composition [61,62]. Follow-up studies (keeping comparable methods and including dietary patterns, comorbid conditions (of ADHD) and bacterial transcriptomics, metabolomics and metagenomics) are needed to replicate the current findings and to understand the complex biological mechanisms underlying our results.",
