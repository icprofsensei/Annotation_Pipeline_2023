Although the gut microbiome started to return to a \u03b2-diversity profile similar to that of healthy volunteers over time, it remained different from healthy controls. Alternatively, \u03b1-diversity initially increased post-injury, but subsequently decreased during the hospitalization. Injured patients on admission had a decreased abundance of traditionally beneficial microbial phyla (e.g., Firmicutes) with a concomitant decrease in opportunistic phyla (e.g., Proteobacteria) compared to healthy controls (p< 0.05). Large amounts of blood products and RBCs were both associated with higher \u03b1-diversity (p<0.001) and a \u03b2-diversity clustering closer to healthy controls.",

The human gut microbiome plays a vital role in host development and homeostasis, including cellular metabolism, nutrient digestion and absorption, development and maintenance of the immune system, and control of the inflammatory response (3, 4). The distribution of intestinal microbes changes with age and is also influenced by diet and disease (5, 6). The majority of gut microbes belong to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia and are known contributors to the intestinal epithelial barrier (7\u20139). These microbes provide tonic stimulation to the innate immune system, via toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, resulting in increased intestinal motility, reinforcement of epithelial integrity, and increased production of metabolites (10, 11). This process ultimately leads to a preserved distribution of mutualistic and commensal organisms that protect against transiently invading pathogens.",

Recent data also characterize the consequences of an altered distribution of gut microbes, termed dysbiosis. Rapid dysbiosis is seen in critical illness and worsens during a prolonged hospitalization (16). Intestinal dysbiosis has also been attributed to septic complications in critically ill patients, likely due to the critical role that symbiont organisms play in colonization resistance against acquired pathogens (17, 18). Furthermore, in critically ill patients with a prolonged hospitalization, the gut microbial composition dramatically changes causing pathogen communities of extremely low diversity to emerge, triggering further virulence (19).",

Trauma patients are susceptible to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, hospital acquired infection, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome occurring days to weeks after injury (20, 21). Several early clinical studies in small patient populations have demonstrated phylogenetic changes among gut microbial populations following traumatic and burn injury, yet these studies have lacked the power and the inclusion of clinical intervention analysis to be conclusive (22\u201325). Preclinical data from various injury models including polytrauma, burn injury, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) also support the concept that traumatic injury alters the gut microbiome which impacts outcome (24, 26\u201331). Larger clinical studies are needed to address this gap and better understand the microbial changes occurring in the gut following injury especially in the context of early resuscitation.",

The dominant phyla in both healthy controls and the post-injury groups at all time points were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. These two phyla comprised 95% of the bacteria in the healthy control group and total levels of these two phyla were decreased by 14% in the injured patients at day 0. Combined levels of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes further decreased in patients hospitalized longer than 13 days with both phyla comprising 74% of the bacteria present. There were significant decreases in relative abundance at the phylum level seen in Firmicutes at days 0 (p<0.0001), days 1-4 (p=0.0015), days 5-8 (p<0.0001), days 9-12 (p<0.0001), and >13 days (p<0.0001) compared to healthy controls (Fig 3). Conversely, an increased relative abundance in the phylum of Proteobacteria was observed at day 0 following injury and at each time point compared to controls (day 0 p=0.0003, days 1-4 p=0.0166, days 5-8 p<0.0001, days 9-12 p=0.0008, and days >13 p<0.0001; Fig 3). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in Proteobacteria in patients hospitalized for >13 days compared to patients on admission (p=0.001; Fig 3). There was also an overall significant loss in Bacteroidetes in patients with a prolonged hospitalization greater than 13 days compared to patients on admission (p=0.03, Fig 3).",

However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to further characterize this association. To our knowledge, we have compiled the largest prospective study using non-culture based sequencing techniques of injured patients to date. We demonstrated that severe injury alters the gut microbiome within 30 minutes of injury with continued dysbiosis during a prolonged hospitalization. Despite these distinct differences, there was a subpopulation of patients whose microbiome more closely resembled that of an uninjured individual. Patients in this subpopulation received more RBCs and total blood products within the first 12 hours with a greater percentage of patients receiving a MTP compared to patients whose microbiome differed from uninjured individuals.",

Howard et al. found changes in phylogenetic composition and relative abundance within 72 hours of injury in a population of 12 severely injured trauma patients (22). However, they found no difference in composition on admission compared to their controls. Our study had the power to detect a difference; however, it is important to note that we also found a small subpopulation of patients in whom the gut microbiome was not different compared to our healthy controls. Moreover, Howard et al. utilized patients that sustained a trauma but were not found to have injuries as their controls as opposed to our control population of healthy, uninjured volunteers. In this light, it can be speculated that the stress of transport to the hospital has effects on microbial flora in the gut. Future studies might incorporate both this control group and normal healthy individuals to explore this possibility. The findings from our study concerning changes with hospital longevity are also consistent with previous studies performed in critically ill patients with prolonged hospitalization demonstrating dysbiosis and the emergence of low diversity communities (16\u201319).",

This suggests that early massive transfusion may preserve the gut microbiome by increasing gut perfusion. This discovery holds the possibility to inform resuscitative strategies by initiating prehospital transfusion at an early point in time and potentially adjusting resuscitation according to patients\u2019 gut microbial profile. Alternatively, these differences may represent a physiological response from a less injured patient with an intact immune response. However, there was a significantly increased species diversity in patients receiving more blood with a microbial profile more closely resembling that of a healthy control. The finding that increased ISS has similar changes in \u03b2-diversity is congruent with these same patients receiving more blood; however, there was no difference in \u03b1-diversity according to ISS.",

Our data reveal rapid dysbiosis seen on admission following trauma. Injured patients already exhibited elevated levels of pathogenic bacteria (Proteobacteria) at day 0 and loss of beneficial bacteria (Firmicutes) compared to healthy controls. This trend continued during the hospitalization also indicating sustained dysbiosis following injury and hospitalization. As Krezalek et al. have suggested, this supports the development of a pathobiome following injury, critical illness and prolonged hospitalization that could significantly alter patient outcomes and contribute to morbidity and mortality. While their study found that this difference was more pronounced in patients that die later in their hospital stay, whether this is true in the trauma population requires investigation (32).",

Trauma-induced injury to the gastrointestinal system can produce profound effects on the gut microbiome and the immunoinflammatory response with resultant consequences on clinical outcome. Increased inflammation at the intestinal level and decreased antimicrobial peptides appear to influence the pathophysiologic processes following injury (24). Damage to the intestinal wall leads to mucosal barrier inflammation, resulting in higher gut nitrate levels and an abnormal mucosal oxygen gradient (36\u201338). These environmental and metabolic changes lead to proliferation of pathogenic microbes in the Proteobacteria phylum (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli), in addition to pathogenic species from the normally health-promoting Firmicutes phylum (including Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.) (38\u201340). This new unstable microbiome ecosystem that emerges more closely resembles that of an infectious state with low diversity microbial communities (38). Targeting this pathobiome with alternatives to antibiotics (e.g., probiotic adjuncts or virulence directed medications) also has the potential to improve outcomes.",

The resulting ischemia reperfusion injury has been shown to induce changes in ileal and colonic microbiota (41\u201343). Thus, our finding that resuscitation seemingly protects gut microbiota is intriguing. However, the brain-gut axis and central nervous system dysfunction may also impact the gut microbiome through bidirectional vagal pathways between the CNS and the gut, neuroendocrine signaling, immunologic signaling, and the effects of microbe-derived metabolites such as butyrate on the blood brain barrier (27, 44\u201346). In other types of trauma, intestinal permeability allows for translocation of certain types of bacteria, which may be related to ZO-1, occluding, or mucin levels (24, 47, 48) Additional insults during the hospitalization such as subsequent episodes of hypoxia, prolonged exposure to medications (e.g., antibiotics, opiates, vasopressors, steroids, proton pump inhibitors), multiple procedures and trips to the operating room, and periods of inadequate or artificial nutrition can all further disturb the gut microbiota (32). These aberrations may then influence clinical outcomes such as mortality from late onset sepsis and inflammatory disorders, hospital and ICU length of stay, infection rates, and inflammatory disorders.",

Future preclinical studies could elucidate some of the mechanisms involved that may be causing the changes observed in the gut microbiome following injury. In our study, controls were healthy volunteers with some included from hospital personnel. Future clinical studies could expand the control population to include patients sustaining trauma but found to be uninjured. Also, subsequent samples after admission swabs were taken from stool at the time of defecation; this led to inexact time points, which we subsequently pooled. While rectal swabs may provide consistency in the future, it has been shown that rectal swabs have the same integrity of isolated DNA (49, 50). Furthermore, the use of antibiotics was not accounted for in the current study which would almost assuredly influence the gut flora during the hospitalization. The microbiome of antibiotic exposed subjects (trauma patients) is likely different than healthy volunteers not exposed to antibiotics. In addition, massively transfused subjects are known to be depleted of infused drugs, especially antibiotics, which could affect the transfusion-related differences. Of note, no antibiotics were given in the prehospital setting prior to admission to the ED and rectal swabs: therefore, antibiotics likely had little effect admission samples. Future microbial diversity analyses could attempt to account for antibiotic usage.",
