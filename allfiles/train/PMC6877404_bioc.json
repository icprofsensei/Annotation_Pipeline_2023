The variations in progression and severity among patients suggest that the CADASIL phenotype is modified by some genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies have shown the potential roles of gut microbiota in human diseases. We hypothesized that gut microbiota modifies the disease phenotype. We performed gut microbial meta 16S rRNA analysis of fecal samples from 15 CADASIL patients and 16 controls. The microbial \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversities and taxonomy were compared between CADASIL patients and controls and between CADASIL patients with and without an ischemic stroke history. No significant difference in \u03b1- or \u03b2-diversity was observed in either case-control or subgroup comparisons. In the taxonomic microbial analysis, there was a significant increase in abundance of 6 genera and significant decrease in 2 genera in CADASIL patients compared with controls. There was a significant decrease in abundance of 2 genera in CADASIL patients with compared with those without stroke. This is the first study on CADASIL focusing on gut microbiota. Our findings suggest that gut microbiota modifies the onset and progression of CADASIL.",

In contrast, patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a major hereditary small vessel disease caused by mutations in NOTCH3,(3) generally have no common vascular risk factors. Typical clinical characteristics of CADASIL patients are migraines, recurrent ischemic strokes, vascular dementia, and specific white matter lesions with multiple lacunar infarcts.(4) It is well-known that the progression and severity of CADASIL show both inter- and intra-familial variations among patients. Age at onset of the first stroke ranges from 20\u201370 years old, and moreover, some patients remain asymptomatic even after 70 years old.(4,5) These suggest that the CADASIL phenotype is modified by some genetic or environmental factors in addition to NOTCH3 mutation. To clarify the contribution of gut microbiota to cerebral infarction, we focused on the profile of fecal microbiota in CADASIL patients.",

According to previous reports, some of the representative bacteria shown in Table\u00a01 might be associated with stroke onset in CADASIL patients. Firstly, Goodrich et al.(8) reported that the abundance of SHA-98, a member of the Christensenellaceae consortium, was associated with a gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1L1). Interestingly, an SNP in ALDH1L1 was reported to be associated with ischemic stroke in the Framingham Heart Study.(9) Secondly, Parvimonas, a Gram-positive anaerobic coccus, was also of interest according to recent knowledge on the association between periodontal disease and ischemic stroke.(10) Fak et al.(11) reported that bacteria from the oral cavity and gut can be recovered from atherosclerotic plaque, and that the abundance of oral Parvimonas was positively associated with c-reactive protein (CRP) in atherosclerotic patients. Thirdly, the family Lachnospiraceae has been reported to facilitate Treg differentiation and stimulate TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 production by immune cells.(12) TGF-\u03b2 is a key molecule in the pathogenesis of CARASIL, an autosomal recessive small vessel disease caused by HTRA1 mutations.(13) Dysregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling may also be associated with CADASIL according to a report that latent TGF-\u03b2 binding protein 1 was sequestrated into CADASIL-related NOTCH3 extracellular domain deposits.(14) Taken together, the increase of Lachnospiraceae in CADASIL patients is of interest.",

In this regard, it is of note that Inoue et al.(16) reported robust evaluation of gut dysbiosis in type 2 diabetic patients even though the sample size, 12 patients and 10 controls, was as small as our study. By using 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis in combination with functional prediction software Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, they identified not only composition but also functional profiles of gut microbiota associated with diabetes pathophysiology.(16) Then, we additionally performed similar analysis. Although there was no significant difference between CADASIL patients and normal controls, we found 32 KEGG pathways of which abundances were significantly different between CADASIL patients with and without stroke (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01*). To interpret these findings, further studies including fecal metabolome analysis should be necessary. However, of the 32 pathways, lipid metabolism seems of note, because \u017dit\u0148anov\u00e1 et al.(17) recently reported that subfractions of plasma lipid were significantly altered in acute phase of stroke, another limitation was that we did not adjust background factors to compare gut microbiota between groups. Previous report showed that several changes in gut microbiota were associated with age and sex, by analyzing 277 healthy individuals.(18) Moreover, it cannot be concluded whether taxonomic changes between CADASIL and controls or between CADASIL patients with and without stroke were causes or results of the disease. To address these issues, increasing the number of participants and longitudinal analysis of each patient are necessary.",
