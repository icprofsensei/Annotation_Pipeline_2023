While incidence rates for lung cancer have been declining in the U.S. due to reductions in smoking, challenges in early detection have left lung cancer as the leading cause of U.S. cancer death (5-year survival rate 18% on average in the U.S.) (2). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer, is typically treated at the early stages with surgical resection, with or without chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (3); these early stage cancers have better 5-year survival rates (50\u201390%), however a substantial proportion of patients still die of disease recurrence (4). Improvements in early detection with low-dose computed tomography (CT) (5) will inevitably increase the identification of early stage lung cancers and offer more opportunities for curative resection, making it extremely timely to investigate factors contributing to long-term disease-free survival following resection. Better identification of early stage patients at high risk of recurrence can improve survival by indicating which patients may benefit from increased surveillance and/or adjuvant therapy.",

In lung disease, regional changes in the lung environment create permissive niches for bacterial growth, resulting in significant differences in community composition between healthy and diseased lungs (7). Studies have explored the oral or airway microbiome in lung cancer cases compared with controls (8\u201312), noting lower microbial diversity and altered abundance of specific bacterial groups in cases. However, few studies have characterized the microbiome in lung tumor tissue (13,14), and no studies have explored the relationship between the microbiome of resected lung tissue and lung cancer prognosis. Bacteria have many functions that could contribute to cancer initiation and/or progression at local sites, including genotoxic pathways, bacterial metabolite signaling, and induction of host inflammatory pathways (15). Investigation of potential bacterial involvement in lung cancer prognosis may lead to new biomarkers and therapies to improve survival outcomes for lung cancer patients.",

Patients identified on pre-operative workup as having a pulmonary nodule suspicious for lung cancer were consented for collection of blood and snap frozen tissues (tumor and remote lung from the same lobe/segment) in the operating room at the time of their resection. Lung and matching tumor are sterilely cut at the operating room table, transferred to pre-labeled nunc vials and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 minutes of resection. Samples are de-identified for storage at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Since these specimens remain sterile and are immediately frozen, they are ideal for microbiome analysis, as immediate freezing does not impact microbiome composition (16). Less is known regarding long-term (i.e. years) storage at \u221280\u00b0C, which may impact certain aspects of the microbiome (17,18); however, length of storage time in our samples was not associated with overall microbiome diversity and composition (\u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity).",

DNA extraction and amplification steps occurred in two batches (batch 1: 10 samples and batch 2: 28 samples; tumor-normal pairs from same patient kept together), but all samples were sequenced in the same batch. DNA was extracted from tissue using the Mo Bio PowerSoil DNA isolation kit, following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. This protocol uses mechanical bead beating and chemical methods to achieve sample homogenization and cell lysis, ensuring that sample features do not interfere with DNA extraction. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified with the 515F/806R primer pair, which included sequencer adapter sequences used in the Illumina flowcell and sample-specific barcodes (20,21). Each 25 \u00b5L PCR reaction contained 9.5 \u00b5L of Mo Bio PCR Water (Certified DNA-Free), 12.5 \u00b5L of QuantaBio\u2019s AccuStart II PCR ToughMix (2x concentration, 1x final), 1 \u00b5L Golay barcode tagged Forward Primer (5 \u00b5M concentration, 200 pM final), 1 \u00b5L Reverse Primer (5 \u00b5M concentration, 200 pM final), and 1 \u00b5L of template DNA. The conditions for PCR were as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 3 minutes to denature the DNA, with 35 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 45 s, 50 \u00b0C for 60 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 90 s; with a final extension of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. PCR products were quantified using PicoGreen (Invitrogen) and a plate reader (Infinite 200 PRO, Tecan). Each batch included 2 extraction blanks and 10 amplification blanks, all of which did not amplify. Additionally, amplification levels for samples were in the same range for both batches. Sample PCR products were then pooled in equimolar amounts, purified using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter), and then quantified using a fluorometer (Qubit, Invitrogen). Molarity was then diluted to 2 nM, denatured, and then diluted to a final concentration of 6.75 pM with a 10% PhiX spike for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. Amplicons were sequenced on a 151bp x 12bp x 151bp MiSeq run (21).",

Briefly, sequence reads were demultiplexed and paired-end reads were joined, followed by quality filtering as described in Bokulich et al. (23).

A phylogenetic tree was constructed via sequence alignment with MAFFT (26), filtering the alignment, and applying FastTree (27) to generate the tree. One tumor sample without detectable s-OTUs was dropped, leaving 37 samples (19 normal, 18 tumor) from 19 patients for final analysis. The number of sequence reads per sample prior to the Deblur workflow was similar in tumor compared to normal tissue samples (Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 0.61), and marginally higher in batch 1 compared to the batch 2 (Wilcoxon rank-sum p = 0.08) (Supplementary Figure 1). Due to amplification of human mitochondrial DNA in these tissue samples, the majority of sequence reads belonged to human mitochondria and were dropped when not matching to the bacterial 16S database during Deblur. The number of sequence reads per sample after the Deblur workflow was marginally lower in tumor compared to normal tissue samples (Wilcoxon signed-rank p = 0.09), and higher in batch 1 compared to batch 2 (Wilcoxon rank-sum p = 0.001) (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1).",

Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) (33) was used to examine statistically whether overall bacterial composition differed between paired tumor and normal samples, using patient ID as strata. We also compared between-pair distances in overall bacterial composition for tumor and normal tissue sample pairs with distances for all possible pairings of tumor and normal samples from different subjects (i.e. true pairs vs. not true pairs) using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, to determine whether true sample pairs are more similar to each other than random pairings.

Results were consistent when rarefying to an even depth and when restricting to adenocarcinoma histology, restricting to patients in batch 2, excluding stage 3\u20134 cancers, excluding current smokers, or excluding samples with low sequencing depth. Moreover, paired tumor and normal samples were significantly more alike than random pairings of tumor and normal samples from different patients, according to the unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and Jaccard index (all p\u22640.02). Lung tumor samples had higher abundance of family Veillonellaceae, lower abundance of genus Cloacibacterium, and lower carriage of family Erysipelotrichaceae, than paired normal samples (p<0.05; Figure 5; Supplementary Table 7); these taxa were not significant after FDR adjustment.",

This important novel observation suggests that the microbiome of normal lung tissue may be used as a biomarker of lung cancer prognosis, which could guide clinical practice to improve survival outcomes for lung cancer patients. We also observed a clear reduction in bacterial richness and diversity in lung tumor samples compared to paired normal tissue samples, indicating dysbiosis of the lung tumor microbiome.",

We have reported that lower airway brushes of lung cancer patients (n=39) were enriched in Veillonella and Streptococcus compared to benign lung disease patients (n=36) and healthy controls (n=10) (9). A study of lung cancer attributed to household coal burning in China found that sputum samples of lung cancer cases (n=8) had lower diversity and enrichment of Granulicatella, Abiotrophia, and Streptococcus compared with healthy controls (n=8) (10). Similarly, another study from China reported decreased diversity and increased Streptococcus abundance in bronchial brush specimens from cancerous lung sites compared to paired non-cancerous lung sites (n=24) and healthy controls (n=18) (8). A third report from China found family Veillonellaceae and genera Veillonella, Capnocytophaga, and Selenomonas were more abundant in saliva of lung cancer patients (n=20) compared to controls (n=10) (12). A study in Korea observed that Veillonella and Megasphaera were more abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from lung cancer patients (n=20) compared to patients with benign lung mass-like lesions (n=8) (11). A study of Italian lung cancer patients found lower bacterial diversity in lung tumor tissue samples (n=31) compared to non-malignant lung tissue (n=165), and no differences in overall composition (\u03b2-diversity) between the tumor and non-malignant samples (13). Finally, a recent study of lung tissue samples from lung cancer patients (tumor and adjacent normal) and hospital controls observed increased bacterial diversity in tumor and adjacent normal tissue from lung cancer patients compared with the controls (14).",

                    "text": "From this previous literature, it is apparent that the airway and lung microbiome is perturbed in lung cancer patients, which may have implications for prognosis. We observed that greater bacterial diversity and greater abundance of families Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae, and genera Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, [Ruminococcus], and Ruminococcus in normal lung tissue were associated with reduced survival, while greater abundance of Koribacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae were associated with increased survival. Interestingly, the majority of our findings were similar for the recurrence-free and disease-free survival outcomes; this may suggest that the normal lung microbiome is related to both recurrences and new primary cancers. Members of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, particularly Roseburia and Faecalibacterium, are known to produce anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate) (37), making the association of these bacteria with reduced survival unexpected. Bacteroides abundance in the gut has been associated with impaired antitumor immune responses in melanoma patients (38), and may play a similar cancer-promoting role in the lungs. Though our conclusions are limited by small sample size, these valuable preliminary results suggest that bacteria in resected normal lung tissue may serve as biomarkers of recurrence risk in early stage NSCLC. Moreover, if these identified microbiota are determined to be causally related to cancer recurrence in future investigations, they may serve as novel targets for therapeutic intervention (7) to improve recurrence-free survival in lung cancer patients.",

It is not clear from our observational study whether the identified bacterial differences are causally related to lung carcinogenesis, or are merely reflective of disease processes in the lung. However, there are several mechanisms by which the lung microbiota could contribute to lung carcinogenesis, including genotoxic pathways, bacterial metabolite effects, and induction of host inflammatory pathways (15). For example, intranasal administration of lipopolysaccharide (a membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria) in a mouse model of lung cancer significantly enhanced pulmonary inflammation and lung tumorigenesis (39). We previously showed in a human study that airway Veillonella and Streptococcus were associated with upregulation of ERK and PI3K signaling pathways in the airway, pathways regulating cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation which are upregulated in lung cancer patients (9). Interestingly, we have previously reported that these two genera are enriched in the mouths of current smokers compared to never smokers (40), suggesting a further mechanism by which smoking causes lung cancer. Taken together, there is accumulating support for specific bacteria as biomarkers of lung cancer presence; further study of the causal role of these bacteria in lung carcinogenesis may provide therapeutic targets for lung cancer prevention.",

However, our study conclusions were limited by small sample size and lack of a replication dataset, and therefore findings will require confirmation in a larger study. Additionally, though the 16S rRNA gene sequencing assay provides a snapshot of what bacteria are present in the normal and lung tumor samples, localization of bacteria in these tissue samples (e.g. using fluorescence in situ hybridization (41)) could provide additional insight into bacterial mechanisms of action in lung cancer. Continued study of the role of the lung microbiome in lung cancer may yield several promising future applications, including biomarkers of lung cancer risk, recurrence, and prognosis, and therapeutic targets for lung cancer primary and tertiary prevention.",
