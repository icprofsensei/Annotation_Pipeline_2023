While iodixanol cushions and 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm filtration preserved the original composition of nuclease-protected viral genomes, low-force centrifugation and 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filtration removed large viruses. Comparison of unamplified and randomly amplified saliva viromes revealed that multiple displacement amplification (MDA) induced stochastic bias from picograms of DNA template. However, the type of bias shifted to systematic using 1\u00a0ng, with only a marginal influence by amplification time. Systematic bias consisted of over-amplification of small circular genomes, and under-amplification of those with extreme GC content, a negative bias that was shared with the PCR-based sequence-independent, single-primer amplification (SISPA) method. MDA based on random priming provided by a DNA primase activity slightly outperformed those based on random hexamers and SISPA, which may reflect differences in ability to handle sequences with extreme GC content. SISPA viromes showed uneven coverage profiles, with high coverage peaks in regions with low linguistic sequence complexity. Despite misrepresentation of certain viruses after random amplification, ordination plots based on dissimilarities among contig profiles showed perfect overlapping of related amplified and unamplified saliva viromes and strong separation from unrelated saliva viromes. This result suggests that random amplification bias has a minor impact on beta diversity studies.",

Currently, metagenomics is the most powerful tool for studying viral ecology [5\u201311], and its application to host microbiomes has enabled the identification of many new viruses, including ones that infect humans [12\u201316].

                    "text": "Only a small percentage of the total DNA retrieved from human microbiomes corresponds to viral genomes [17\u201319]. Thus, a variety of physical virus-like particle (VLP) enrichment protocols has been employed to increase their relative ratio, enabling deep exploration of viral assemblages [17, 18, 20\u201325]. Most of these protocols combine low-speed centrifugation, 0.22\u20130.45\u00a0\u03bcm filtration, or ultracentrifugation in density gradients to remove cellular contamination and concentrate VLPs, with nuclease treatment for elimination of unprotected genetic material. Unfortunately, viruses encompass a wide range of sizes, morphologies and chemical constituents. These features endow viruses with different resistance levels to chemical and mechanical stressors, making the establishment of a universal protocol for viral genomic purification unfeasible. For example, CsCl density gradients are frequently used for efficient removal of cellular contamination during preparation of viromes [17, 21, 26\u201329]. Unfortunately, this protocol deeply skews viral communities due to strong discrimination against viruses that sediment outside of the typically selected density layer (including most non-tailed bacteriophages) [20, 30\u201334], and due to capsid weakening of certain viruses [20, 32]. Similarly, the use of chloroform to disrupt bacterial membranes also compromises the physical integrity of enveloped and some naked viruses [20, 35]. The extensive preference for 0.22 over 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm syringe filtration has been justified by its better performance at removing small bacteria. However, some studies propose that both strategies efficiently reduce bacterial contamination in host-associated samples [35\u201337], while 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filtration diminished viral DNA yields recovered from human faeces by half in comparison to the use of 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm filters [38]. This may be explained, at least in part, by the filter retention of giant eukaryotic viruses such as those recently found in human samples [39, 40], or large bacteriophages [41].",

Several strategies are alternatively used for the extraction of virions from host tissues, bacterial biofilms or cellular debris, including the application of physical force by sonication, freezing cycles and homogenizers, though their impact on virus misrepresentation has not been investigated in-depth. Procedures for the concentration of viruses such as tangential flow filtration and ultracentrifugation are also critical steps that reduce virus yield by filter clogging [33, 38] or compromise the integrity of some viruses due to the pressure they are subjected to. Furthermore, DNA extraction kits are disturbing sources of DNA contamination in metagenomic studies [43], skewing viral assemblages by eluting small DNA viral genomes better than non-fragmented large DNA viral genomes [7].",

                    "text": "Another controversial source of bias is random amplification, a step that is necessary when the amount of viral genetic material is limiting, preventing NGS, as in the case of extreme environments [44] or many human-associated ecosystems [45]. Three random amplification protocols are widely employed: sequence-independent, single-primer amplification (SISPA, originally called random PCR) [46, 47]; linker amplification shotgun libraries (LASL) [48]; and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) [26, 49]. Each method alters the relative abundance of viruses or provides uneven coverage across sequenced genomes. The SISPA method relies on pseudo-degenerate oligonucleotides, with 6\u201312 random nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end for random priming and ~\u200920 nucleotides of defined sequence at the 5\u2032 end. It has been reported that the annealing bias of the constant part of the primer promotes uneven distribution of sequence reads across the target genome and affects the sensitivity of detection for low-abundance viruses [50]. Pooling SISPA products amplified with different primers provides more uniform coverage patterns [51]. LASL protocol adapted to NGS [52] is another PCR-based method claimed to randomly amplify templates with ultralow quantities [27]. However, LASL requires previous genome fragmentation and DNA-size selection, which makes this approach useless when only a few nanograms of template are available [27]. Additionally, it also exhibits the GC-dependent bias inherent to PCR [27, 53] and overlooks ssDNA viruses [34], though this has recently been overcome with a modified LASL procedure that gives reliable estimates of relative abundance of ssDNA viruses [29]. Unlike SISPA and LASL, MDA is not PCR-based; rather, it amplifies DNA under isothermal conditions [54]. MDA relies on random priming of target DNA with endonuclease-resistant random hexanucleotides and the high fidelity and strong strand-displacement capacity of the podovirus \u03c629 polymerase to amplify DNA templates with ultralow amounts [49]. Although this method provides more uniform coverage profiles throughout human genomes than those obtained by some PCR-based random amplification methods [55, 56], several biases have been associated with this technology, including chimera formation [57], preferential amplification of circular ssDNA genomes [58] and non-uniform amplification of linear dsDNA genomes. This later bias seems stochastic in single-cell genomics [59] but becomes systematic for nanogram levels of template by under-representing local GC-rich regions [60\u201364], as previously reported for PCR-based amplification protocols [27, 53, 65\u201368]. MDA bias is more conspicuous in reactions with higher fold amplification, but in general, >\u20091\u00a0ng of template provides bias affecting a low number of loci in the range of threefold misrepresentation [55, 56, 69, 70]. Modified protocols have claimed to reduce bias by combining MDA with microfluidics [64] or by replacing random hexanucleotides with small oligonucleotides synthesised by enzyme\u00a0DNA primase [71, 72]. This latter approach also ensures zero-background amplification in the absence of DNA input and even-coverage profiles.",

This quantification strategy avoids underestimation of ssDNA viruses, which are poorly detected by staining reagents [30], and overestimation of viruses damaged structurally during stock preservation or purification. The impact of several independent or combined viral enrichment steps and random amplification protocols were also analysed by qPCR.",

This negative bias affecting vaccinia caused a drastic reduction in its relative abundance within the mock community (from 22.1\u201341.8% to 1.4\u20132.0%) (Fig.\u00a01b). Consistently, vaccinia genomes fell to nearly undetectable levels during centrifugation and filtration of mock community 1 (Fig.\u00a01c). Unexpectedly, small viruses (M13, MVMp and PCV2a) were globally more affected by centrifugation, and to a lesser extent by filtration and iodixanol cushion, than other larger dsDNA viruses (lambda, \u03c629 and AdenoV). Differences in centrifugation effects between these two groups of viruses across the five independent experimental replicates were statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.00082, Mann-Whitney Test) but did not notably alter the original assemblage composition, as shown in Fig.\u00a01a, b. In agreement, the combination of these purification steps in mock community 2 reduced the amounts of the small viruses by 6.2\u201310.0-fold. Iodixanol cushion was the protocol step that best preserved the mock community structure, with a minimal loss of virus particles, which was also true for vaccinia WR virus.",

By MiSeq (Illumina) sequencing from the same sample, we obtained nine metagenomes, including an unamplified virome (Unamp1), six viromes obtained after amplification with two commercial MDA kits (GenomiPhi: MDA_G1-4; and TruePrime\u2122: MDA_T1-2) and another two with SISPA (SISPA1-2) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). Bacterial contamination was detected in our viromes by BLASTn searches against a 16S rDNA database, but the percentage of 16S-related reads was at least ten times lower than in saliva microbiomes from healthy individuals (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Figure S1). De novo cross-assembly of reads from these nine viromes produced 2557 cross-contigs larger than 2\u00a0kb, and their normalised abundance was expressed in mapped RPKM. Figure\u00a02a shows the 277 most biased contigs (fold changes >\u200950 or <\u20090.02 relative to Unamp1). MDA viromes derived from 1\u00a0ng template showed similar patterns of biased contigs, with marginal influence by extension time in GenomiPhi amplification (2.5 and 10\u00a0h in MDA_G1 and MDA_G2, respectively) or random priming strategy (GenomiPhi: MDA_G1, and TruePrime\u2122: MDA_T1). In contrast, amplification from 10\u00a0pg of DNA template notably increased the spectra of contigs affected by bias (MDA_G3, MDA_G4, and MDA_T2) and produced divergent patterns of biased contigs. Therefore, amplifications from low DNA input not only introduce more bias but also increase bias variability. MDA bias patterns differed from those found in SISPA viromes, likely due to fundamental differences between isothermal and PCR-based random amplification methods.",

As exemplified by contig_16 and contig_624, MDA provided more uniform distribution of reads across contigs than SISPA, which agrees with the multiple high-coverage peaks found in previously reported SISPA-amplified viromes [51, 91]. However, coverage profiles in MDA-amplified viromes also showed low coverage in regions where unamplified viromes exhibit even profiles. To further analyse coverage evenness, we drew Lorenz curves by plotting the cumulative fraction of the contig covered by increasing read proportions (Fig.\u00a03b). As expected, curves with the smallest difference from the theoretical even distribution corresponded to the unamplified virome followed by MDA, and SISPA viromes, in this order. To quantify coverage evenness over a representative number of contigs, we calculated coefficients of coverage variation for all 38 inspected contigs (Fig.\u00a03c). By this approach, the highest coefficients of variation corresponded to contigs from the SISPA2 virome, which had average values above 1, and differences from other viromes were statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20094.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221212; Mann-Whitney two-tailed tests).

Consistently, Pearson\u2019s correlation values between coverage profiles of amplified and unamplified contigs (Fig.\u00a03d) were lower for SISPA2 than for MDA, and these differences were statistically significant in Mann-Whitney two-tailed tests (p\u2009<\u20096.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213).",

Therefore, pooling of primers has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate bias [51]. Accordingly, around 20% of high-coverage peaks were primer-specific, and some of them were surrounded by sequences with identity to the conserved region of the primer employed (Fig.\u00a04a). However, many other high-coverage peaks were simultaneously obtained by at least two of the three primers used in the SISPA2 virome, suggesting the existence of an alternative source of bias. In agreement, no statistically significant differences were achieved between coefficients of coverage variation for the most abundant contigs mapped with SISPA reads obtained by a single or pool of three primers (Fig.\u00a04c). Moreover, pooling three oligonucleotides failed to improve the correlation index between coverage profiles of SISPA and the unamplified viromes (Fig.\u00a04d). Importantly, we report here that SISPA-induced coverage unevenness is caused, at least in part, by high-coverage peaks in stretches of DNA with low linguistic sequence complexity. Around 30% of these abrupt changes in coverage were not primer-specific but rather corresponded to regions of diminished sequence complexity, as exemplified by contigs shown in Fig.\u00a03b. Regardless of the source of bias, many of the high-coverage peaks were found close to the ends of the contigs, suggesting that these peaks of coverage can also hinder de novo assembly as previously reported [92].",

In agreement with the spectra of the most biased contigs (Fig.\u00a02a), ordination plots showed that viromes obtained after MDA from 1\u00a0ng of template localised closer to the unamplified virome than those amplified from 10\u00a0pg (Fig.\u00a05a).

However, due to sample limitation and the relatively low amount of viral genetic material in comparison to cellular organisms, the combination of viral enrichment and random amplification protocols is necessary for metagenomic studies of viruses in animal-associated environments. Some protocols for the preparation of human viromes skew the proportions of different viruses [20, 93], hampering efforts to go beyond merely descriptive studies. Some published benchmark studies with mock viral communities have assessed the relative impact of certain sources of bias. However, many of them have employed limited sets of viruses that do not reflect the wide range of morphology, size and genome type found in DNA viruses in nature, or used uneven distributions of viruses that might prevent the identification of some bias sources [18, 32, 33, 37, 94\u201396]. In our study, we have focused exclusively on DNA viruses because they outnumber RNA viruses in human microbiota. Thus, we have used a mock community composed of seven diverse DNA viruses to explore the bias introduced by simple enrichment protocols (which avoid some of the well-known sources of bias) and several random amplification approaches that can deal with nanograms of input DNA. Preparation of balanced mock viromes must deal with enormous variability, as protocols for stock preparation and storage can lead to non-infectious viral genomes enclosed in partially disrupted capsids or envelopes. We have followed an original approach to prepare balanced mock viral assemblages based on quantification by\u00a0absolute qPCR after nuclease treatments. This method accurately quantifies viral genomes protected by intact viral particles. The same qPCR method was used to monitor viral gains and losses after four different treatments: low-speed centrifugation, 0.22 and 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm filtration, and ultracentrifugation through an iodixanol cushion.",

The lower impact of 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm filtration agrees with previous studies that reported the use of 0.45 instead of 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filters doubled viral yield [38] and provided a better representation of large viruses such as phycodnavirus, mimivirus and herpesviruses [37, 44, 96, 97]. Regarding bacterial contamination removal, other authors have reported a similar efficiency for 0.22 and 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm filtration [36]. In our hands, two consecutive low-speed centrifugation steps combined with 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm syringe filtration reduced the colony-forming units of three pure cultures of bacteria by >\u200910 million-fold and reduce at least ten times the 16S rDNA content in saliva viromes. Complete physical separation of bacteria and viruses is not possible because of their overlapping sizes, but our protocol provides a good equilibrium between removing most bacteria and including large viruses. A further reduction in centrifugation speed could be explored in future studies to better preserve large viruses such as vaccinia, even more as the increasing output of NGS technologies minimises the negative consequences of tolerating a certain level of bacterial contamination.",

Therefore, increasing template amount to the nanogram range promotes a shift in the type of bias from stochastic to systematic, reducing dissimilarities with the unamplified virome, as shown in ordination plots.

This relatively better performance of MDA in saliva with respect to that observed in mock communities might be explained by the lower proportion small circular genomes in the former, which are usually over-amplified by MDA.

Moreover, Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between unamplified and amplified viromes and their relative location in ordination plots remained unaltered after subtraction of small circular contigs. Our study also demonstrated that MDA induces systematic bias against DNA molecules with extremely low and high GC content, and in turn, over-amplification of contigs with average %GC in the range of 45\u201360%. This type of bias was also identified after SISPA in our studies and has been previously reported for MDA [60\u201364, 102, 103], LASL [27, 53, 104\u2013106] and in general any method based on PCR amplification [67, 68, 107, 108]. Problems with polymerase accessibility or premature chain termination at the beginning of GC-rich secondary structures have been hypothesised as the most likely cause of their under-representation [60, 66]. Due to the high number of contigs affected, this source of bias might represent the major force that separates unamplified and randomly amplified viromes. Here, we propose that the different ability to deal with regions of high or low GC content might explain the observed differences between SISPA and MDA viromes. Thus, SISPA viromes showed a strong negative bias in reads with %GC between 35 and 40%, while MDA based on random hexamers under-amplified sequences with %GC between 58 and 65%. Interestingly, MDA based on random primers synthesised by DNA primase activity (MGA_T1) outperformed SISPA when dealing with DNA molecules of low GC content, and MDA based on random hexamers when dealing with high GC contigs, as previously reported [71]. These features likely contribute to the nearly perfect overlap of the MDA_T1 and Unamp1 viromes in ordination plots. Picher et al. recently showed no differences between the two alternative priming strategies of MDA in high GC content regions [72]. The discrepancy with our results may be due to the use of different denaturation strategies, MDA kit suppliers of MDA based on random priming or template amounts.",

This genome harbours 43% GC content, excluding any relationship with the previously described negative bias towards GC-rich regions.

Comparison of three indicators of coverage evenness (Lorenz curves, coefficients of coverage variation and Pearson\u2019s correlation with the unamplified virome coverage) from 38 abundant contigs revealed a better performance for MDA than SISPA. This result was mainly attributable to the presence of multiple peaks of high coverage detected in many contigs from SISPA viromes. Although some of these peaks have been previously ascribed to preferential annealing of the constant part of the pseudo-degenerate primers [50, 109], only a minor proportion of contigs from our saliva viromes harboured primer-specific peaks.

Low-complexity sequences are usually avoided when designing PCR primers [110] or filtered out in BLAST searches [111] in order to prevent unspecific annealing or matching, respectively. These sequences have also been associated with false-positive peak calls due to collapsed repeats in ChIP-s and other sequencing-based functional assays [112]. In our study, we ruled out methodological issues based on mapping or assembling, as high-coverage peaks were obtained by mapping with Bowtie2 under parameters that forced reads to be recruited only once, and detailed inspection of these regions showed no evidence of collapsed repeats. Furthermore, intrinsic issues regarding the low complexity of the template were also excluded because these peaks were absent in the same contigs mapped with reads from MDA or unamplified viromes. Although further research is necessary to understand the molecular basis of this bias towards low linguistic complexity sequences, we hypothesise that preferential annealing of pseudo-degenerate primers to these template regions might be due to the overrepresentation of primers with low sequence complexity. It is well-known that primers with low sequence complexity show favoured stoichiometry for primer-dimer formation, and these dimers might serve as a template during subsequent rounds of PCR amplification, increasing their relative abundance over primers with higher linguistic complexity. Indeed, we show that >\u200980% of the reads mapping to these high-coverage peaks located in regions with low linguistic complexity contain primer-dimers (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Figure S5). This priming bias, together with the negative bias of genomes with extreme GC content may hamper de novo assembly and contribute to skew the relative contig abundance of SISPA viromes.",

Our inter-subject saliva viromes showed a significantly lower proportion of homologous reads than those shared by intra-sample viromes, regardless of the random amplification strategy used. This explains why ordination plots based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities among contig-abundance profiles showed that pooled saliva viromes obtained with or without random amplification perfectly overlapped in a single cluster, separated from two other non-related saliva viromes. Furthermore, this cluster also included the individual saliva virome from a participant from the pooled saliva sample, even though the pool contained equivalent parts of saliva from six other donors. This result agrees with previous studies that showed clustering of saliva viromes from subjects cohabiting in the same household even though only a small proportion of their bacteriophages were shared [22, 28, 115].",
