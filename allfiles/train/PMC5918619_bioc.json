These conditions disproportionately affect Mexican American women, yet few studies have examined the oral microbiota in this at-risk group. We characterized the 16S rDNA oral microbiome in 369 non-smoking women enrolled in the MD Anderson Mano a Mano Mexican American Cohort Study. Lower bacterial diversity, a potential indicator of oral health, was associated with increased age and length of US residency among recent immigrants. Grouping women by overarching bacterial community type (e.g., \u201cStreptococcus,\u201d \u201cFusobacterium,\u201d and \u201cPrevotella\u201d clusters), we observed differences across a number of acculturation-related variables, including nativity, age at immigration, time in the US, country of longest residence, and a multi-dimensional acculturation scale. Participants in the cluster typified by higher abundance of Streptococcus spp. exhibited the lowest bacterial diversity and appeared the most acculturated as compared to women in the \u201cPrevotella\u201d group. Computationally-predicted functional analysis suggested the Streptococcus-dominated bacterial community had greater potential for carbohydrate metabolism while biosynthesis of essential amino acids and nitrogen metabolism prevailed among the Prevotella-high group. Findings suggest immigration and adaption to life in the US, a well-established mediator of disease risk, is associated with differences in oral microbial profiles in Mexican American women. These results warrant further investigation into the joint and modifying effects of acculturation and oral bacteria on the health of Mexican American women and other immigrant populations. The oral microbiome presents an easily accessible biomarker of disease risk, spanning biological, behavioral, and environmental factors.",

Emerging evidence links poor oral health to increased risk of cardiovascular disease [14,15], rheumatoid arthritis [16], and several cancers [17]. While the specific role of the oral microbiota remains unclear, research suggests bacteria in the oral cavity may influence disease by modulating inflammation and genome stability [18]. The oral microbiome is relatively stable throughout adult life [19\u201321], but inter- and intra-individual variations have been linked to tobacco use [22], diet [23], and oral hygiene [24\u201326]. Differences by geography and culture, which may reflect variation in diet, host genetics, or other factors, have also been observed [27\u201329]. Hence, the oral microbiome is poised to become a promising and easily accessible biomarker, potentially reflecting the intersection of biological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors that we cannot comprehensively measure or quantify in human epidemiologic studies.",

Cohort participants provided written informed consent in the language of their choosing, English or Spanish. Upon enrollment, a baseline in-home interview consisting of questionnaires, measurement of height and weight, and biospecimen collection was conducted. Linguistic acculturation was measured using eight items from the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Hispanics [31]. Specifically, participants were asked how frequently they spoke, read, watched television programs, and listened to radio programs in English and Spanish. Responses were scored for each dimension. Over 85% of participants in the current study were classified as having high Hispanic acculturation; hence, analysis was limited to acculturation in the English dimension only. A query on food acculturation from the Cultural Life Style Inventory [32] was added to the baseline questionnaire in 2006. Physical activity was measured using an instrument derived from the California Teachers Study survey [33]. Further details of the MACS study can be found elsewhere [30].",

Quality filtering allowed for a maximum expected error rate of 0.05. Illumina PhiX control sequences were removed with Bowtie2 [36]. All remaining sequences were subsequently clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with chimera removal using UPARSE [37]. Taxonomy assignment was performed closed-reference against the SILVA database (release 123) at 97% identity, resulting in 7,083,883 total reads (median 18,190 reads/sample). Samples that produced fewer than 4,000 reads were excluded from subsequent analysis. The remaining samples (n = 369) were rarefied to 7,600 reads/sample. UPARSE centroid OTU sequences were queried via Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [38] to identify likely representative bacterial species. A rarefied OTU table with the associated centroid sequences is available in S2 File.

Seventy percent of datasets indicated three as the optimum number of clusters; thus, we generated three clusters for the dataset analyzed here. Differences in demographic risk factors across bacterial cluster were tabulated via contingency table and assessed via Pearson\u2019s chi-square. Differentially abundant bacterial taxa and putative functional content of clusters were determined using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) [44], applying the one-against-all strategy with a minimum logarithmic LDA score (i.e., biomarker effect size) of 2.5 and \u03b1 = 1E-5.

Assigning OTUs at the genus level, we identified a core oral microbiome defined by 18 genera detected in 98% or more of samples (Fig 1A). Consistent with other large-scale studies of the oral microbiota [28,29,47], Streptococcus was the most abundant genus, with mean (SD) relative abundance of 37% (12%). Prevotella_7 (11%), Haemophilus (10%), Veillonella (6%), and Neisseria (5%) completed the top five. Other core bacteria included, in order of relative abundance, Gemella, Rothia, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Granulicatella, Leptotrichia, Bergeyella, Campylobacter, Capnocytophaga, and Oribacterium. Current classification using the SILVA rRNA gene database differentiates Prevotella from Prevotella_7 by OTU content. Taxa abundance was marked by considerable inter-individual variability (Fig 1A and 1B), with core genera accounting for 65.2%-99.7% of sequences/sample in all but one person.",

Of the remaining variables examined, including educational attainment, marital status, country of birth, history of farm work, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and two acculturation metrics representing English linguistic acculturation [31] and the type of food typically eaten at home [32], none were associated with alpha diversity in univariate or multivariate analyses.",

Communities were named \u201cStreptococcus,\u201d \u201cFusobacterium,\u201d or \u201cPrevotella\u201d based on the foremost differentially abundant OTU as identified by LEfSe [44] (Fig 3A and S3 Table).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the oral microbiota in a large group of first and second generation Mexican American women. We identified a core microbiome of 18 taxa common to 98% or more of women and three microbial community types. Women in the three microbiome clusters varied by age and a variety of acculturation-related variables, including country of birth, country of longest residence, age at immigration, years lived in the US, and acculturation score. Among first generation immigrants, we further observed that time in the US and younger age at immigration were inversely associated with taxonomic richness. Collectively, these results support the potential mutability of the oral microbiota in response to cultural adaptation associated with immigration. They further provide a baseline profile for future studies to investigate relationships between oral bacteria and prospective disease in at-risk Mexican American women.",

We observed these and other well-known oral bacteria in our participants, with relative abundance varying by bacterial community type. Of particular note, the \u201cPrevotella\u201d and \u201cStreptococcus\u201d-defined clusters differed in the relative abundance of nearly all core taxa identified in our study. These clusters also differed demographically, with \u201cPrevotella\u201d individuals more likely to have been born in Mexico, to have resided longest in Mexico, and to have immigrated to the US at a later age compared to the \u201cStreptococcus\u201d group. Together, these differences support the potential for a microbial transition associated with immigration and adaptation whereby a \u201cPrevotella\u201d community dominates in recent Mexican immigrants but transitions to the \u201cStreptococcus\u201d signature over time.",

                    "text": "The concept of a microbial transition parallels that of acculturation, a likely contributor to any bacterial shift. Observed differences in English linguistic acculturation score [31,32] support this hypothesis, with the \u201cStreptococcus\u201d signature dominating among more acculturated women. Furthermore, recent evidence indicates acculturation occurs more rapidly in younger immigrants [50], which is consistent with the earlier US arrival observed among women in the \u201cStreptococcus\u201d cluster. Several studies have reported positive relationships between dental care and use of the English language among Hispanics [51\u201353]. While dental history was not available for the current study, Streptococcus species linked with better oral health, including S. mitis and S. oralis [49,54,55], were significantly more abundant in the \u201cStreptococcus\u201d community type. By comparison, the \u201cPrevotella\u201d cluster exhibited higher levels of S. salivarius and Veillonella spp., both of which have been linked to dental caries [54,56]. These observations suggest differences in oral health and/or oral health determinants (e.g., access to dental care) contribute to the relationships observed here. Frequency of dentist visits was only recently incorporated into the MACS questionnaire but appears low; nonetheless, the relationship between dental visits and the oral microbiome could be explored in future studies. Importantly, our work examines the oral microbiota at just a single time point in women enrolled between 2004\u20132011. The influence of birth or immigration cohort effects cannot be excluded.",

Comparing Germans, native Alaskans, and Africans, Li and colleagues observed differential abundances across many common and highly abundant oral bacteria, including Prevotella, Veillonella, and Haemophilus [29]. Takeshita et al. reported similar taxonomic differences in a study comparing the salivary microbiome of South Koreans to the Japanese [28]\u2014two populations with arguably fewer differences in diet and host genetic variation. These studies support the idea of a core human oral microbiome that, despite differences in relative taxa abundance, provides functional consistency and stability across cultures. Data from the Human Microbiome Project support this assertion, with the taxonomic composition of the buccal mucosa exhibiting far more variability than its microbial metabolic pathway content [47]. Hence, while our data suggest acculturation in Mexican American women may be accompanied by compositional changes of the oral microbiota, differences in the overarching function of these communities are likely small. Our own analysis supports this hypothesis as the variation in putative functional pathways between our bacterial community clusters was more modest than their observed taxonomic differences. Consequently, many roads may lead to a \u201chealthy\u201d oral microbiome.",

Presence of pathogens was further reflected in putative functional differences, with bacteria-host interaction and cellular turnover/repair pathways dominating the \u201cFusobacterium\u201d cluster. One-third of our participants presented with this bacterial signature, suggesting periodontal disease or risk thereof may be widespread within our cohort. History of periodontitis was not assessed in the MACS study, but prevalence of this inflammatory disease is higher among Hispanics/Latinos according to national surveys [57]. Consistent with these observations, Mason et al. recently reported greater abundance of Porphyromonas, Treponema, and Fusobacterium spp. in the subgingival microbiota of Latinos as compared to non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks [58]. These disparities may in part be due to chronic inflammation as a result of the physical, psychosocial, and cultural stressors that accompany immigration. Notably, Miranda and Matheny found that acculturative stress was inversely related to time in the US among adult Latinos [59], and women in the \u201cFusobacterium\u201d cluster were more likely to report living in the US less than 10 years.",

Many of these associations stem from links to periodontitis and associated diseases, which may reflect an underlying susceptibility or avenue toward systemic inflammation. Although the directionality of these relationships is often unclear, large cohorts such as MACS provide the opportunity to elucidate the timing of such relationships and explore the oral microbiome as a potential biomarker or etiologic underpinning of disease. Moreover, our study shows that MACS mouthwash samples, initially collected for human genetic studies and kept in frozen storage for up to 15 years, produce high quality microbial sequencing data; hence, studies to examine the oral microbiome and incident disease are underway. Characterizing the oral microbiome in an effort to identify those at highest disease risk will help us better target health interventions to those with greatest need. As a putative comprehensive assessment of biological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors, the oral microbiome may prove to be one of the most informative and easily accessible biomarkers for research in low income, resource poor populations.",
