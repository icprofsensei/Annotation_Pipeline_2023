This study aimed to investigate oral bacterial community diversity and dynamics in paediatric patients with malignancies in relation to the occurrence of oral mucositis. Patients with malignancies (n\u00a0=\u00a037) and reference individuals without known systemic disorders (n\u00a0=\u00a038) were recruited. For patients, oral bacterial samples were taken from mucosal surfaces both at the time of malignancy diagnosis and during chemotherapy. If oral mucositis occurred, samples were taken from the surface of the mucositis lesions. Oral mucosal bacterial samples were also taken from reference individuals. All samples were assessed using a 16S ribosomal RNA gene 454 pyrosequencing method. A lower microbial diversity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and a higher intersubject variability (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were found in patients as compared with reference individuals. At the time of malignancy diagnosis (i.e. before chemotherapy) patients that later developed mucositis showed a higher microbial diversity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and a higher intersubject variability (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared with those without mucositis. The change of bacterial composition during chemotherapy was more pronounced in patients who later developed mucositis than those without mucositis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In conclusion, we found a higher microbial diversity at the time of malignancy diagnosis in patients who later develop oral mucositis and that these patients had a more significant modification of the bacterial community by chemotherapy before the occurrence of mucositis. These findings may possibly be of clinical importance in developing better strategies for personalized preventive management.",

One of the side-effects is the inflammation of mucosal tissues, mucositis, which can involve the entire alimentary tract. Oral mucositis is one of the most frequently encountered forms and commonly occurs 7\u201310\u00a0days after the administration of cytostatic drugs. Oral mucositis presents as mucosal ulceration, bleeding and severe pain, which may require the use of opiates and parenteral nutrition. The mucositis-inflicted tissue damage also provides a port for the invasion of host endogenous bacteria into the circulation, causing bacteraemia and sepsis [1,2]. The patho-mechanisms of chemotherapy-related oral mucositis have not been fully elucidated, although considerable progress has been made during the last decade in defining a cascade of destructive and inflammatory events [3]. However, beyond this paradigm, the association between mucositis and the commensal bacterial microflora is so far poorly understood [4,5].",

Most of the bacterial species cause no harm under healthy conditions. However, in patients with malignancies, the delicate homeostasis between host defence and commensal bacteria could be disturbed by the cancer itself, by the cancer-related secondary immunodeficiency, or by prophylactic antibacterials. The disrupted homeostasis might contribute to the oral mucosal tissue breakdown following chemotherapy. In addition, the chemotherapeutics can be bacteriostatic or bactericidal, thus affecting the oral bacterial community [4,7,8]. However, no clear pattern regarding the changes in the oral bacterial community and occurrence of oral mucositis can be discerned from the literature, most likely due to the limited number of studies published.",

Oral care instructions, including recommendation of a single 2.5\u00a0mg/mL benzydamine-based mouth rinse for the period of chemotherapy, were provided to the patients and parents. All patients were followed during the entire cytostatic treatment. One dose of the antibacterial cefotaxime was given intravenously to each patient as prophylaxis before placing a central venous catheter. The individual chemotherapeutic scheme and antibacterial agents used for treating infections were retrieved from medical charts and information regarding the use of the mouth rinse was gathered from the parents. The occurrence of oral mucositis was recorded and the grade of oral mucositis was scored using the World Health Organisation (WHO) system [12], which grades oral toxic effects into five levels: grade 0, no change; grade 1, soreness/erythema; grade 2, erythema, ulcers, can eat solids; grade 3, ulcers, requires liquid diet only; grade 4, alimentation not possible. A WHO grade >\u00a01, which indicates ulcerative mucositis, was considered as occurrence of oral mucositis in the current study to avoid false-positive diagnosis.",

The Shannon index, which takes both taxa richness and the relative abundance into account, ranges from 0 (one species presents) to about 4.5 (species are relatively evenly distributed). The R package vegan (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=vegan) was used to calculate the Shannon index and significance was tested using the Student's t-test. The intersubject variability between each pair of samples was evaluated on the platform Fast Unifrac [20] using normalized weighted Unifrac distance, which ranges from 0 (100% OTUs shared, two communities are identical) to 1 (0% OTUs shared, two communities are completely distinctive). The Unifrac distance was further interpreted and visualized using the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) on Fast Unifrac. Comparison of each taxon between subject groups or between time-points was made at the phylum level and the most detailed taxonomic level using the R package edgeR [21,22]. The p values were converted to false discovery rate (q value) to correct for multiple testing.

Notably, the taxon Capnocytophaga, which was more abundant in the mucositis group, has been reported to be associated with various tissue infections [30,31]. The accumulation of these bacteria on the mucosal surface may possibly contribute to the progression of mucositis and potentially to bacteraemia. The bacterial community composition of the mucositis group was found to be more heterogeneous than that of the no mucositis group, which is consistent with the view that no single bacterial taxon can be expected to be entirely accountable for affecting the outcome of mucositis.",

This is in line with studies on the microbiota profile of the intestine [32,33] and the oral cavity [4,8] from chemotherapy-treated individuals or animal model. The higher Unifrac distance in patients who developed mucositis is largely driven by the changes of Proteobacteria abundance during chemotherapy, which might be a consequence of antibacterials used to treat systemic infections and additionally a direct antimicrobial effect of cytostatic drugs [23,24]. It also appeared that the no mucositis group was less modified by the chemotherapeutic treatment, which might indicate a beneficial effect of a higher microbial stability. Interestingly, our results show that the complexity of oral bacteria in terms of Shannon diversity does not change after the initiation of chemotherapy in either patient group, which is contrary to a previous study using Sanger-based sequencing [34]. These opposing results are most likely a reflection of the different methods applied. In order to determine diversity it is important to be able to detect low abundant taxa and the 454 pyrosequencing technique has a higher sensitivity in this respect.",

The previously suggested mucositis-associated species, including Enterococcus [8], Escherichia [4], Porphyromonas [7] and Pseudomonas [4], were not statistically confirmed in terms of relative abundance in the present study, which may in part be attributed to methodological differences.

In this study, we identified a distinctive bacterial composition from the mucositis lesions compared with all the mucosal samples from the lip and bucca. Within the dominant bacteria from the lesions, an increased abundance of Lactobacillus,Mycoplasma and Peptostreptococcus was identified. Both Mycoplasma and Peptostreptococcus are recognized as significant pathogenic microorganisms due to their resistance to common antibacterial agents. While bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus are well known for contributing to deep tooth decay in the oral cavity, their facultative anaerobic characteristics and tolerance to oxidative conditions may also account for the growth in the lesions of mucosal tissues. Overall, the increase of these potential pathogens in mucosal ulcers might be the effect of the ulcers representing a different niche in which virulent pathogens can compete successfully with the resident bacteria, in addition to the effect of the empirical antimicrobial therapy administered.",

A more pronounced modification of the bacterial community by chemotherapy was detected in patients who later developed oral mucositis, indicating that oral microbial stability might be beneficial. These findings might contribute to the development of better prophylactic treatments and improved intervention protocols for oral mucositis, tailored to the individual patient.",
