Peri-implantitis and periodontitis are representative polymicrobial diseases that show similar clinical symptoms. To establish a means of differentiating between them, we compared microbial species and functional genes in situ by performing metatranscriptomic analyses of peri-implantitis and periodontitis samples obtained from the same subjects (n\u2009=\u200912 each). Although the two diseases differed in terms of 16S rRNA-based taxonomic profiles, they showed similarities with respect to functional genes and taxonomic and virulence factor mRNA profiles. The latter\u2014defined as microbial virulence types\u2014differed from those of healthy periodontal sites. We also showed that networks based on co-occurrence relationships of taxonomic mRNA abundance (co-occurrence networks) were dissimilar between the two diseases. Remarkably, these networks consisted mainly of taxa with a high relative mRNA-to-rRNA ratio, with some showing significant co-occurrence defined as interacting core taxa, highlighting differences between the two groups. Thus, peri-implantitis and periodontitis have shared as well as distinct microbiological characteristics. Our findings provide insight into microbial interactions in polymicrobial diseases with unknown etiologies.",

In addition, peri-implantitis has been found to progress more rapidly than periodontitis in animal models13. To clarify the cause of differences between the two diseases, studies have characterised their respective microbiomes using culture-independent molecular approaches, including DNA hybridisation and 16S rDNA sequencing14,15,16. However, the causative microbial species in peri-implantitis and periodontitis are disputed. Several studies have reported the predominance of microbial species common to both diseases16, others unique to peri-implantitis sites have also been described10. One possible reason for these conflicting results is the presence of dead and/or inactive microbes in previous studies, which were based on DNA sequencing. Alternatively, microbiome samples from peri-implantitis and periodontitis sites were not obtained from the same oral cavity except in one study15.",

The MV types of peri-implantitis and periodontitis sites were similar, suggesting that the two diseases were associated with similar virulence factors. This raised the question of whether MV types of diseased and healthy sites differ. MV types were assigned to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from samples of healthy periodontal sites20, which were then compared to our data. The MV types observed in our data were distinct from those of healthy sites, as shown by PCoA plots based on assignments made with the VFDB and MvirDB (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S8).

Using data that was functionally assigned with NCBI nr, we first assessed the taxonomic origin of each gene for taxonomic assignment of mRNA clusters (see Supplementary Figs S4B and S5A, Supplementary Table S9, and Supplementary Results). PCoA plots and ANOSIMs showed differences in the species compositions of mRNA and read abundances for rc-rRNAs (Fig. 5A; R\u2009=\u20090.496, P\u2009=\u20091.00E-3 in peri-implantitis and R\u2009=\u20090.588, P\u2009=\u20091.00E-3 in periodontitis samples). Taxa detected in both rc-rRNA and mRNA profiles were defined as viable taxa with in situ function (VTiF), of which 146 and 133 were identified in the peri-implantitis and periodontitis samples, respectively. Wilcoxon test results revealed significant differences in read abundance of each VTiF between rc-rRNA and mRNA clusters (96 and 74 taxa in the peri-implantitis and periodontitis samples, respectively; Supplementary Table S10). Log ratio\u2013mean average (MA)-plots showed that these VTiFs mainly included taxa with high relative mRNA-to-rRNA ratio (referred to as active taxa), with mRNA abundances higher than rc-rRNA abundances (93/96 and 70/74 in peri-implantitis and periodontitis samples, respectively; Fig. 5B and Supplementary Table S10). Relative mRNA-to-rRNA ratios were indicators of the viability and functionality of microbial taxa responsible for disease etiology29,30 in the same way that the 16S rRNA-to-16S rDNA ratio has been used as an indicator of current bacterial activity31. In peri-implantitis samples, Slackia exigua and Eubacterium saphenum showed a relative mRNA-to-rRNA ratio >7; in periodontitis samples, Porphyromonas sp., Prevotella oralis, Campylobacter concisus, Treponema socranskii, and Veillonella sp. showed a relative mRNA-to-rRNA ratio >7 (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Table S10).",

The microbiome of oral cavities comprise ~600\u20131000 species of bacteria alone33. We previously showed by sequencing PCR-amplified 16S rRNA libraries that many microorganisms are responsible for chronic osteomyelitis of the jaw4 and peri-implantitis and periodontitis15. RNA-Seq is a powerful tool for examining the diversity of microbial species and their functional profiles since the obtained data reflect RNA abundance in situ34. We carried out metatranscriptomic analyses of peri-implantitis and periodontitis samples from the same oral cavities to minimise the effects of inter-individual differences. Using this approach, we observed microorganisms common to as well as differing between the two diseases with similar clinical symptoms. Moreover, we found similarities in functional profiles\u2014including metabolic pathways and virulence factors\u2014whereas interacting core taxa were dissimilar between the two diseases.",

Consistent with previous reports15,20, we detected high rc-rRNA abundances of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia in both diseases (Supplementary Fig. S3C and Supplementary Table S2). These species are collectively known as the red complex and are prevalent in deep periodontal pockets and thus strongly associated with periodontitis36. Although microbial transmission from periodontal lesions to implant-adjacent tissues may underlie the onset of peri-implantitis37, samples from both diseases showed distinct microbial compositions (Fig. 1A,B), despite the similarities reported in our previous DNA-based study15. In addition, species common to both diseases with relative abundances of \u22650.5% observed here and in a previous study15 showed partial overlap (19.64% of 11/56 in this study), including P. gingivalis, T. denticola, T. forsythia, and Eubacterium nodatum (Supplemental Table S2), although both studies used the HOMD for taxonomic assignments. These differences could be due to amplicon bias38 and the detection of dead bacteria in DNA samples35.",

It is thus possible that peri-implantitis and periodontitis have distinct microbial compositions but similar functional profiles. Functional assignment of putative mRNA reads revealed that mRNA profiles were similar between the two diseases, with no functional gene differing significantly in terms of mRNA abundance between them according to assignments made with the SEED subsystems, KEGG, and NCBI nr databases (although some disease-specific genes were identified). The diseases shared some of the same SEED subsystems (such as \u2018carbohydrates\u2019 and \u2018protein metabolism\u2019) and KEGG pathways (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4) related to functions essential for microbial viability. However, microbial functional categories associated with the progression of both diseases showed low abundance. The level-1 SEED subsystem \u2018fatty acids, lipids, and isoprenoids\u2019\u2014which is reportedly associated with periodontitis progression40\u2014showed a prevalence of 2.22 and 2.43% at peri-implantitis and periodontitis sites, respectively, while the \u2018virulence, disease, and defense\u2019 subsystem showed a prevalence of 2.22 and 1.84%, respectively, at these sites. These were lower than percentages in environmental sample microbiomes41. We further analysed putative mRNA reads using the virulence-factor databases VFDB and MvirDB (Supplementary Tables S6, S7). Similarities were observed in the mRNA profiles of both disease sites despite being limited to virulence functions (Fig. 3A,B); these included genes encoding elongation factor Tu, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpC), and enolase (Supplementary Table S6). There were no correlations between the mRNA abundance of virulence factors and clinical parameters (data not shown); indeed, the presence of virulence factors may be more important than their relative abundances at disease sites42. Correlations may have been observed if the virulence functions had been highly specific instead of broad.",

Functional pathways in healthy and periodontitis sites have been compared by metatranscriptomic analysis43. In addition, differences in mRNA abundance between healthy and periodontitis sites have been reported for each microbial taxon and for functional and taxonomic profiles of virulence factors20. When the functional properties were clustered in the same manner as enterotypes for enteric bacteria44, they highlighted the microbiological origin of both diseases as well as their contrast with healthy sites. In this study, we compared the MV types of both diseases with those of healthy sites using metatranscriptomic data from a previous study20, and demonstrated that the MV types of peri-implantitis and periodontitis sites were distinct from those of healthy sites (Fig. 4). In microbiomes showing dysbiosis, there was a reduction in microbial functional robustness in the healthy state following changes in MV type, which led to the diseased states. We therefore propose that MV types determined only by assignment of virulence factors can serve as a means of distinguishing between diseased and healthy states.",

We therefore determined the taxonomic origins of functional genes using the NCBI nr database. The red complex species were predominant in terms of mRNA abundance and in the rc-rRNA profile, indicating that they are associated with both diseases. However, there were similarities in the taxonomic profile and origin of each mRNA. The taxonomic profiles of rc-rRNAs differed from those of mRNA clusters in both disease groups (Fig. 5A,B); this was consistent with previous results obtained by comparing microbial compositions between 16S rRNA and mRNA using the same database28. Since the results may have been affected by differences in the databases for the assignment of rc-RNA and mRNA clusters, we focused on VTiFs shared by the rc-rRNA and mRNA profiles and evaluated the functional activities of each VTiF by calculating their ratios of mRNA-to-rc-rRNA abundance. The anaerobic Gram-positive rod S. exigua45 and E. saphenum were highly abundant in peri-implantitis samples. S. exigua DNA was detected at slightly higher levels at periodontitis sites than at healthy sites, while E. saphenum DNA was more abundant at the former46. These two taxa were also more abundant at peri-implantitis sites than at healthy implant sites47. Taxa that were active in periodontitis samples (Fig. 5C) were also detected at periodontitis sites in a previous study48. Our analyses also revealed unclassified bacterial taxa whose functions and virulence are unknown but that highlight the dissimilarity between the two diseases. Our results demonstrate that metatranscriptomic analysis\u2014including taxonomic mRNA classification\u2014can detect active taxa in the microbiome.",

Microbial network analyses can be used to characterise microbial interactions in environments such as soil and oral-cavity samples32,49. The networks were more complex in the peri-implantitis as compared to the periodontitis microbiome (Fig. 6); in the former, the red complex species P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia were associated with each other, whereas in the latter there were limited connections between P. gingivalis and T. denticola. Furthermore, active taxa were prevalent in the networks of both diseases (Fig. 6). In periodontitis samples, the interacting core taxa included E. nodatum, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Atopobium sp., which are reportedly more abundant at periodontal sites than at healthy sites affected with periodontitis21. P. gingivalis and Prevotella nigrescens were among the interacting core taxa in peri-implantitis samples and were found to be more abundant16 while Veillonella dispar was less abundant50 at peri-implantitis sites than at healthy implant sites. Previous data showed that P. gingivalis is a major species in oral biofilm, which can lead to dysbiosis through changes in polymicrobial community composition51. In this study, P. gingivalis was included among interacting core taxa in the peri-implantitis but not in the periodontitis microbiome. Moreover, there were no significant interactions common to the two diseases (Table 2). These network dissimilarities are presumed to be associated with differences in disease etiology.",

The observed similarities and dissimilarities could explain the common symptoms and differences in disease progression, respectively. In microbiomes with dysbiosis, we characterised MV types that were distinct from those of healthy sites and found that the breakdown of microbial functional robustness in the healthy state leads to a diseased state. Our findings provide a basis for the development of treatment approaches specific to peri-implantitis or periodontitis as well as a framework for metatranscriptomic studies of other polymicrobial diseases with unknown etiologies. This, in turn, can lead to a deeper understanding of the relationship between healthy and diseased states at various sites in the human body.",
