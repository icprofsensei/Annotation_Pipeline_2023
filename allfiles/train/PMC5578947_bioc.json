Fecal samples were collected, and gut microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene-pyrosequencing. The physiologic bowel FDG uptake was classified into three groups by visual assessment and measured using the maximum and mean standardized uptake value. We used the total bowel to liver uptake ratio (TBRmax and TBRmean). There was no significant difference in age, BMI, or lipid profiles between groups. To identify specific microbial taxa associated with the bowel FDG uptake while accounting for age and BMI, we performed a generalized linear model. At the genus level, the group with focal or intense FDG uptake in the intestine was associated with low abundance of unclassified Clostridiales. The group with intestinal FDG uptake lower than the liver was associated with high abundance of Klebsiella. TBRmax and TBRmean were negatively associated with abundance of unclassified Enterobacteriaceae.",

Some previous studies have attempted to identify the cause of physiologic bowel FDG activity. Kim et al. demonstrated that 18F-FDG was located in the intestinal lumen by measuring the FDG activity of stool samples [1]. Soyka et al. reported that bowel preparation using a senna-glycoside solution before 18F-FDG PET/CT increased physiologic FDG activity in colonic structures, except for the sigmoid and rectum [2]. They postulated that 18F-FDG secretion was the main cause of physiologic activity. Senna-glycoside increases intestinal secretary activity by activation of chloride channels in the bowel wall. Tohihara et al. reported that physiologic bowel FDG uptake was increased more at the delayed phase than at the early phase in dual-time-point PET/CT imaging [3]. They also suggested that FDG secretion from the bowel wall may be related to physiologic uptake.",

The intestine was divided as follows: third portion of the duodenum, jejunum, ileal loop, ileocecal junction, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. The SUVmean of each segment was measured with a margin threshold of 60% SUVmax [5]. After SUV measurement, we added all the segment values, which indicated the SUVs of the total bowel: TB SUVmax and TB SUVmean. For the measurement of liver SUVmean, we drew 3\u00a0cm VOIs in both lobes of the liver as previously reported [6]. The uptake ratio of TB SUVmax and TB SUVmean to liver SUVmean (TB to liver uptake ratio, TBRmax and TBRmean) was calculated for each subject.\n",

Statistical tests for alpha diversity among groups of 18F-FDG uptake were performed using the t test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test with the mentioned indices. Beta diversity was obtained using the ordinate function of the phyloseq package. For beta diversity analysis, we normalized OTU matrices with a cumulative sum scaling (CSS) approach [16]. To identify factors that could drive groupings of similar communities, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed on the Bray-Curtis matrices generated from beta diversity calculation, and the resulting PCoA plots were visualized using the phyloseq.

The five genera comprised 56.52, 57.37, and 54.42% of groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The unclassified Leuconostocaceae and Mitsuokella spp. were significantly more abundant in group 2 than in group 1 after controlling for age and BMI (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a05.29, 4.46; q\u00a0=\u00a04.02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127, 2.85\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123, respectively) (Table \u200b(Table22 and Fig. \u200bFig.4a).4a). In contrast, the abundance of Klebsiella spp. was lower in group 2 than in group 1 (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.00, q\u00a0=\u00a01.81\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4b).4b). Mitsuokella spp. were also more abundant in group 3 than in group 1 (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a04.84, q\u00a0=\u00a03.85\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122). We found that group 3 had more abundant Fusobacterium spp. than group 1 (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a05.74, q\u00a0=\u00a03.85\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122), as well as the phylum Fusobacteria (Additional file 1: Table S2-2). However, we could not find the significant differences of taxa between group 2 and group 3 in the phylum and genus level (Additional file 1: Table S2-3 and Table S3). Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference in the unclassified Leuconostocaceae and Fusobacterium between group 2 and group 3 although there seemed to be differences in the Fig. \u200bFig.44.\n\n\n",

Zhou, unpublished data, 2013). These diets caused dysbiosis in the gut accompanied by mucosal inflammation and impaired permeability. Another study reported that unclassified Clostridiales were inversely correlated with fat mass in rats fed a HFD and high protein diet (J. Jacobs, unpublished data, 2016). In a human study, Verdam et al. observed that obese subjects had lower uncultured Clostridiales than non-obese subjects [19].",

We observed a prominent abundance of these genera in only a few subjects, so the possibility of incidental findings needs to be considered. These genera belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae.

If bowel FDG activity is related to intestinal permeability, FDG is likely to migrate through a paracellular pathway because intestinal permeability is regulated by paracellular tight junction [25]. Levine et al. showed a good correlation between intestinal glucose secretion and blood glucose concentration in rats [28]. They suggested that glucose moves bidirectionally across the intestine, and that its secretion is a passive process. Recently, Bardhan et al. postulated a paracellular route of FDG and refuted the hypothesis of transcellular transport of FDG [29]. Moreover, they refuted the transcellular hypothesis of FDG via the GLUT transporter suggested by Wang et al. [30]. The GLUT transporters located on the basolateral surface of the mucosal cells are known to export glucose from mucosal cells to the blood in the small intestine. Bardhan et al. suggested that it is doubtful that GLUT transporters also exist in the large bowel and speculated as to whether they can also transport in the opposite direction.",

Quantitative analysis was added to compensate for these shortcomings.

Our data demonstrated that the group with focal or intense FDG uptake in the intestine was associated with low abundance of unclassified Clostridiales. The group with intestinal FDG uptake lower than the liver was associated with high abundance of Klebsiella. We cautiously speculated that increased FDG activity might be caused by an increase in intestinal permeability and reflects impaired intestinal barrier function. Further studies with a larger sample is needed to confirm our speculation. If our hypothesis is true, it will help to determine the etiology of physiologic bowel FDG activity. Moreover, to replace a relatively invasive measurement, 18F-FDG PET/CT can provide a non-invasive method and contribute to widen the research field of intestinal permeability in the clinical or preclinical setting.",
