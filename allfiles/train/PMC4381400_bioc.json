Studies employing culture-independent analyses have shown that CF airways typically harbor complex microbial communities comprised of numerous bacterial species, particularly during the early and intermediate stages of lung disease [1-9]. While these studies have made important contributions toward understanding the dynamics of these communities, they have been limited by cross-sectional design and/or their reliance on analysis of a very small number (often only one or a few) of respiratory samples taken during periods of interest. Samples representing the periodic exacerbations of respiratory symptoms that characterize CF most often have been obtained after the initiation of antibiotics for exacerbation treatment. A more complete understanding of the dynamics of airway microbiota, in particular with respect to changes occurring at the time of pulmonary exacerbation, would benefit from an analysis of serial samples obtained in the days preceding and coincident with exacerbation onset, but prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy for exacerbation. A meaningful assessment of airway microbial community changes during this crucial period can only be made, however, in the context of an understanding of the day-to-day variability of airway communities during periods of clinical stability. Rigorous analyses of the daily dynamics of the airway microbiota around these critical periods are lacking.",

Although clinical management based on antibiotic treatment and intensified airway clearance is usually at least partially effective [10-12], patients fail to return to 100% of baseline lung function in greater than 40% of exacerbations treated with intravenous antibiotics [13]. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the pathophysiologic basis of exacerbations. The identification of microbial signals that correlate with exacerbation would aid efforts to prevent or mitigate the effects of these events and would inform studies investigating the mechanisms by which these factors may drive exacerbation. A prerequisite to understanding how CF airway communities change at exacerbation, however, is a better appreciation of the day-to-day variability in these communities during periods of clinical stability. Unfortunately, no previous studies have investigated CF airway microbial community variability with this level of granularity. To this end, we analyzed the daily dynamics of the airway bacterial communities in persons with CF during periods of clinical stability and at the onset of pulmonary exacerbations, prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy for exacerbation.",

Because the baseline samples from all four subjects were obtained 1 to 3\u00a0weeks immediately preceding the onset of symptoms, it is possible that community variability was already influenced by impending exacerbation even in the absence of clinical symptoms. Analyses of daily samples obtained during periods of clinical stability further removed from exacerbation are warranted to better ascertain the degree of day-to-day variability in bacterial airway communities in CF in general.

Recent studies have demonstrated that microbial communities vary over the spatial landscape of the diseased lung [14-17]. The remarkable level of community stability observed in our study subjects, particularly subject D over the first 10\u00a0days of observation (Figures\u00a02 and \u200band4),4), would not be expected if serial sputum specimens were sampling distinct regions of diseased lungs from 1\u00a0day to the next. This consistency also suggests that measures of lung microbial community structure derived from expectorated sputum are not substantially impacted by \u2018contamination\u2019 from oropharyngeal microbiota. In a recent comparison of multiple body sites, the temporal variability in oral cavity microbiomes was found to be significantly greater than those in vaginal, gut, skin, and anterior nares sites [18]. If sputum samples were significantly contaminated with oral microbiota during expectoration, we would expect to see variability reflecting that observed in serial oral cavity samples. Finer scale sampling of oral sites, analyzed alongside paired sputum samples from the same subject, would further illuminate this issue.",

In three of four subjects, the dominant taxon (Staphylococcus, Burkholderia, and Streptococcus in subjects A, B, and C, respectively) decreased in relative abundance around the time of exacerbation. Although this change did not reflect a decrease in the absolute density of these species, due to day-to-day variability in total bacterial density, this finding is consistent with previous work that demonstrated decreases in the relative abundance of the dominant taxa at the time of exacerbation in another set of subjects [7]. The pathophysiologic implications of this intriguing finding require further elucidation, but suggest a role for less abundant taxa in some pulmonary exacerbations.",

In this regard, we observed no strong correlations between daily symptom scores and day-to-day community variability. However, it is possible that a larger scale study and/or a more refined symptom scoring system might detect such relationships, if they indeed exist. Weighting of symptoms, rather than merely summing the number of symptoms on each day, could reveal correlations with airway community movement that were not detected in this study. Similarly, consideration of other patient-specific features (for example, disease stage) and/or analysis of the temporal relationship between specific symptoms and microbiomic measures may prove worthwhile. Our study was limited to four subjects at a single center. Although samples from three of four subjects contained Pseudomonas, none were dominated by this taxon as is often seen in CF samples. The applicability of these findings to the larger CF population is thus unclear. Finally, we restricted our analyses to predominantly descriptive reports of trends within and between subjects, given the small sample size and correlated nature of the data. Our results indicate the potential for significance given increased power from an expanded pool of subjects.",

The onset of symptoms of exacerbation may be heralded by marked shifts in these communities, even in the absence of viral infection or antibiotic therapy for the treatment of exacerbation. Whether such shifts only occur in a minority of exacerbations, as observed here, is unclear. Monitoring of airway microbial community structures therefore has the potential to identify signatures that could be useful in predicting CF respiratory exacerbations, which, in turn, may enable more prompt and/or appropriate therapy of exacerbation. A better understanding of the changes in airway communities around the time of exacerbations will also inform studies to elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanisms of exacerbation in CF.",

Subjects were part of a larger cohort of CF patients participating in long-term daily collection of sputum for microbiome analysis. The first four exacerbations captured from this cohort were chosen for analysis in this study. Study subjects recorded symptoms and antibiotic use on a daily questionnaire based on the Respiratory Symptoms Domain of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised [22,23]. Symptoms recorded included increased cough, change in sputum, shortness of breath, fever, decreased energy, decreased appetite, and missed work/activities. Evidence of hemoptysis in the specimen was recorded by the laboratory. A symptom score was calculated by summing the total number of positive symptoms, plus hemoptysis, each day. Baseline samples were defined as those obtained during a period of consecutive symptom-free days that culminated in the onset of symptoms of exacerbation. \u2018Exacerbation\u2019 samples were defined as those obtained from the start of consistent symptoms to the day prior to the start of antibiotic treatment for exacerbation [7]. Six consecutive daily sputum samples obtained from subject A served as technical control samples. DNA was prepared from each of these six samples and each DNA samples was sequenced in duplicate on the same sequencing run. These six pairs of replicate control samples served to assess the degree of background variability between and within DNA sequencing runs (Figure\u00a01).",

Movement of the community outside of this zone is likely due to a perturbation that overrides these stochastic events (unstable) [31]. For each time point, the similarity in community composition was calculated between that time point and the next time point as [1\u2009\u2212\u2009Bray-Curtis dissimilarity]. This similarity score, used as a proxy for stability, ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no similarity between communities (implying maximum instability), while a value of 1 indicates no differences between communities (implying perfect stability). We calculated the expected variability in this score due to stochastic processes by randomly permuting counts across the OTU-by-time point matrix for each patient 1,000 times. This generated 1,000 random matrices with neither sample nor temporal selection, while controlling for subject specificity, sampling depth, and global taxon abundance. For each permutation, the stability score [1\u2009\u2212\u2009Bray-Curtis dissimilarity] was calculated at all time points. Finally, 95% confidence intervals based on these 1,000 simulated values at each time point was used to create the stability zone.",
