Until now, only a few next generation sequencing 16S rDNA amplicon based publications with rather small sample sizes studied the effect of those interventions on the subgingival microbiome. Therefore, we studied subgingival samples of 89 patients with chronic periodontitis (solely non-smokers) before and two months after therapy. Forty-seven patients received mechanical periodontal therapy only, whereas 42 patients additionally received oral administered amoxicillin plus metronidazole (500 and 400 mg, respectively; 3x/day for 7 days). Samples were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq 300 base pairs paired end technology (V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rDNA). Inter-group differences before and after therapy of clinical variables (percentage of sites with pocket depth \u2265 5mm, percentage of sites with bleeding on probing) and microbiome variables (diversity, richness, evenness, and dissimilarity) were calculated, a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was conducted, and differential abundance of agglomerated ribosomal sequence variants (aRSVs) classified on genus level was calculated using a negative binomial regression model. We found statistically noticeable decreased richness, and increased dissimilarity in the antibiotic, but not in the placebo group after therapy. The PCoA revealed a clear compositional separation of microbiomes after therapy in the antibiotic group, which could not be seen in the group receiving mechanical therapy only. This difference was even more pronounced on aRSV level. Here, adjunctive antibiotics were able to induce a microbiome shift by statistically noticeably reducing aRSVs belonging to genera containing disease-associated species, e.g., Porphyromonas, Tannerella, Treponema, and Aggregatibacter, and by noticeably increasing genera containing health-associated species. Mechanical therapy alone did not statistically noticeably affect any disease-associated taxa. Despite the difference in microbiome modulation both therapies improved the tested clinical parameters after two months. These results cast doubt on the relevance of the elimination and/or reduction of disease-associated taxa as a main goal of periodontal therapy.",

These microbes live in the human hosts and play important roles in health and disease. A mutual dependence exists between the host and the microbiome. Perturbations in this equilibrium can lead to a dysbiosis and consequently to a diseased host [2]. In case of the periodontium a dysbiosis of the complex subgingival microbiome leads to the formation of periodontal pockets and destruction of tooth supporting tissue in most cases without notification of the host. Approximately 50% of the adult population suffer from moderate or severe forms of periodontitis in the United States [3].",

In a fundamental work by the group of Socransky and Haffajee [4] a microbial succession was postulated describing green, yellow and purple complex bacteria associated with periodontal health, to an orange and ultimately a red complex with pathogens, i.e., Porphyromonas ginigvalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia frequently found in periodontitis. Reduction of these pathogens after mechanical therapy can be improved by adjunctive systemic antibiotics, e.g., amoxicillin and metronidazole and even elimination of other key-pathogens as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans can be achieved [5,6]. For decades dentists used empiric antibiotics to treat periodontitis by eliminating those periodontal pathogens although strong clinical evidence is missing [7]. A recent large multi-center randomized controlled trial (ABPARO study) showed that the additional benefit of empiric adjunctive antibiotics was of questionable clinical relevance [8,9].",

However, in this study only 4 patients of the ABPARO study were investigated using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM), which had limited read length and a relative high homopolymer related sequencing error rate [12]. Other amplicon NGS studies on periodontal therapy using the 454-pyrosequencing technology with similar homopolymer error rates had also rather limited sample sizes [13\u201315] and did not include an adjunctive antibiotic group [13,14].",

Sequence variants in each sample were inferred using the high-resolution DADA2 method, which relies on a parameterized model of substitution errors to distinguish sequencing errors from real biological variation [25]. Denoised forward and reverse reads were then merged requiring at least 15 bp overlap and chimeras were subsequently removed from the data set. To those ribosomal sequence variants (RSV) taxonomic labels were assigned with a naive Bayesian classifier using the Silva v.128 training set [26].

All diversity indices and their changes were compared between both treatment groups by applying Mann-Whitney U tests. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to analyze the change of each diversity index between before and after treatment in the respective treatment group.

This package uses a negative binomial distribution and accounts for overdispersion with varying aRSV read counts. The overdispersion parameter is estimated by comparing the mean aRSV-abundance over all samples. As part of the DESeq2 model the default independent filtering was used to increase the detection rate of differentially abundant aRSVs after false discovery correction [31,33]. To account for dependencies between multiple samples within one patient, it was first tried to specify a model including the patient as a fixed effect. Because of only two sampling time points per patient, before and after therapy, and too many patient parameters to be estimated, this model was over-specified and could not be fitted. To the best of our knowledge, for the DESeq2 package and other common R-packages the option to include a random effect for the patient is not possible. So we decided to regard the repeated samples within each patient as independent, which might lead to biased variance estimates of the log2-fold regression parameters [33,34]. The fitted design formula of this second model was used for further calculations. It contained the main effects of treatment group and time point, and the interaction between both variables as fixed effects. The betaPrior parameter was set to false and a local dispersion fit was selected. The false discovery rate was set to 0.05 and controlled by applying the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to adjust the p-values [35]. Effects on the counts of an aRSV were considered as noticeable if adjusted p-value (padj) \u22640.05. Noticeably differential abundant aRSVs were taxonomically labeled on genus level when possible. If such genera included species previously described by Socransky et al. [4], this genus was allocated to the given complex. The two genera harboring species present in more than one complex, namely, Streptococcus (one orange and six yellow complex associated species) and Campylobacter (one green and three orange complex associated species) were allocated to the complex of higher conformity (Streptococcus to the yellow and Campylobacter to the orange complex, respectively). All figures were created with the R-package ggplot2 [36].",

By removing all RSVs occurring in two or less samples this number was reduced to 1,964 RSVs. Tree-based agglomeration of the remaining RSVs resulted in 379 aRSVs, which included 17 aRSVs belonging to eukaryotes and 2 aRSVs without taxonomic assignment on kingdom level. For further analysis only the 360 bacterial aRSVs were selected that were categorized into 15 uniquely named taxa on phylum level and 120 on genus level. Read counts per aRSV were logarithmically distributed, with only few high abundant and many low abundant aRSVs (S3 Table). No differences between richness (p = 0.401), evenness (p = 0.217), diversity (p = 0.887), and dissimilarity (p = 0.444) could be observed between both groups before therapy. The most frequently found genera were Fusobacterium with 16.44% mean relative read count before therapy (MRRCb) over both groups, Porphyromonas (9.52% MRRCb), Tanerella (5.08% MRRCb), and Fretibacterium (3.33% MRRCb). For inter-sample comparisons of alpha diversity only, reads were randomly sub-sampled to the level of the sample with the least number of reads, which reduced the mean number of aRSVs over all samples from 101.9 to 98.7 aRSVs. To describe possible changes in richness of the microbial community, the number of observed aRSVs in each sample was counted (Table 1). Only in the antibiotic group richness decreased statistically noticeable after therapy (p<0.001). To investigate general changes in aRSV abundances, the Pielou and the Shannon index were calculated. The Pielou index measures the evenness of aRSV abundances with a maximum value of 1 if all aRSV abundances are equally distributed. Evenness did not change noticeably in both groups. The Shannon index, a diversity metric that takes both richness and evenness of the microbial distribution into account, did neither change noticeably in the placebo nor in the antibiotic group after therapy. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures the degree of difference between microbiomes. It is low, if microbiomes show a high aRSV conformity (minimum 0) and high if microbiomes are highly dissimilar to each other (maximum 1). After periodontal therapy dissimilarity increased in both groups, but only in the antibiotic group this increase was statistically noticeable (p<0.001).",

In the antibiotic group 17 of the high abundant aRSVs showed a statistically noticeably different abundance after therapy (only 2 aRSVs taxonomically labeled as Selenomonas and Prevotella exhibited no noticeable difference). Of those 17 high-abundant aRSVs, 15 decreased and 2 increased after antibiotic therapy. Ten of the decreasing aRSVs in the antibiotic group belonged to genera containing species associated with periodontitis (red-complex: 3 aRSVs from the genus Treponema, 2 aRSVs Porphyromonas, 1 aRSV Tannerella; orange-complex: 1 aRSV each from Prevotella, Campylobacter, Fusobacterium, Parvimonas) as described by Socransky and colleagues. Four noticeably decreased aRSVs not allocated to a Socransky complex belonged to the genera: Fretibacterium (2 aRSVs with MRRCb 3.33%, 1.22%), Filifactor (MRRCb 2.39%), and Oceanivirga (MRRCb 1.53%). Finally, one noticeably decreased aRSV was unclassified on genus level (family: Porphyromonadaceae, MRRCb 1.75%). The two high-abundant and noticeably increasing aRSVs were assigned to genera belonging to the yellow and purple Socransky complexes associated with periodontal health, i.e., Streptococcus (MRRCb 2.79%) and Veillonella (MRRCb 2.44%).",

Of those aRSVs, 3 changed statistically noticeably in the placebo and 93 in the antibiotic group. All of the aRSVs that noticeably changed in the placebo group also changed noticeably in the antibiotic group, i.e., Rothia (MRRCb 0.49%; 2.22 log2fold), Pyramidobacter (MRRCb 0.18%; -20.72 log2fold), and Kingella (MRRCb 0.12%; 2.89 log2fold). In the antibiotic group 38 aRSVs with a low abundance at baseline noticeably increased and 55 noticeably decreased after therapy. Roughly half of the aRSVs (16/38), which noticeably increased in the antibiotic group could be associated to a Socransky complex. Most of those aRSVs are linked to periodontal health, i.e., Capnocytophaga (green), Actinomyces, Veillonella, and Selenomonas (purple). However, also some aRSVs of Porphyromonas and Tannerella from the red complex and Campylobacter and Prevotella from the orange complex noticeably increased in the antibiotic group. The 22 noticeably increasing aRSVs that could not be allocated to a Socransky complex belonged mostly to gram-positive phyla like Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. For the 55 noticeably decreasing low abundant aRSVs in the antibiotic group about one third could be assigned to a Socransky complex (21/55). Here several aRSVs belonging to the genus Treponema of the red and Prevotella of the orange complex decreased noticeably. Also, of note is a single aRSV identified as member of the genus Aggregatibacter that showed a fairly strong noticeable decrease of -25.34 log2-fold and on case level, even got eradicated after antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, aRSVs belonging to the genera Capnocytophaga and Eikenella associated with the green complex and Selenomonas from the purple complex decreased noticeably. The remaining two third of low abundant aRSVs were not assigned to a Socransky complex (34/55). This group consists mostly of aRSVs belonging to the phyla Firmicutes (19 aRSVs), Bacteriodetes (5 aRSVs), and Proteobacteria (5 aRSVs).",

Two months after therapy the subgingival microbiome shifted noticeably to a decreased richness and an increased dissimilarity in the antibiotic, but not in the placebo group (Table 1). The PCoA analysis revealed a general compositional separation of microbiomes in the antibiotic group and an absence of such a clear compositional separation in the placebo group (Fig 1). Differences between both treatment groups after therapy became even more apparent on genus and aRSV level (Fig 2) demonstrating the influence of adjunctive antibiotics in initiating a shift of the subgingival periodontal microbiome composition. In contrast, the placebo group therapy did not uniformly affect specific taxa to a statistically noticeable degree, with the exception of only few and low abundant aRSVs. An improvement of clinical variables was noted in both groups after therapy independently of the difference in microbial changes.",

In the antibiotic group the abundance of the most prevalent aRSVs at baseline was reduced after therapy, especially for many annotated genera including species from the red and orange Socransky complexes. Furthermore, usage of antibiotics increased the number of aRSVs assigned to health-associated green, purple, and yellow complex taxa. On the contrary, in the placebo group the abundance of highly prevalent taxa belonging to the red or orange Socransky complex was not noticeably changed. This is in concordance with results of smaller microbiome studies that found no significant changes on taxa level after mechanical periodontal therapy alone [13,14]. However, in the metagenomic shotgun sequencing analysis by Shi et al. [40] several disease-associated taxa were significantly reduced after mechanical periodontal therapy alone. Of note in this study, only selected periodontal pockets that clinically improved after treatment were included in the analysis. This sampling approach differs markedly from ours. These results may show either the influence of changes of the habitat due to the decreasing pocket depth or a microbiome switch that consequently resulted in a resolved pocket. In the study by Bizzarro et al. the taxa level analysis showed that the therapy resulted in a significantly stronger decrease of Porphyromonas, Treponema, and Synergistaceae after 3 months in the antibiotic compared to the placebo group. Additionally, 3 other genera were reduced in the antibiotic group exclusively, i.e., Paludibacter, Fusobacterium, and Parvimonas. Furthermore, Neisseria, Rothia, Capnocytophaga, and Streptococcus increased in both groups, while Veillonella and Haemophilus increased significantly only after antibiotic exposure [15]. We found also a stronger reduction of those described taxa in the antibiotic group. However, the number of significantly differentially abundant taxa after mechanical treatment without antibiotics reported in that study differs from our findings and also from other microbiome studies [13,14]. Bizzarro et al. subsampled at 1400 reads per sample, analyzed only the 21 major genera, and\u2014most importantly\u2014did not correct for multiple testing that might explain the differences to our observations in the placebo group. Other studies analyzing selected bacteria using, e.g., culture [41] or checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization [42] also reported a statistically significant reduction of putative pathogens in the placebo group, which was stronger in the antibiotic group. Our results did also show a reduction of the mean relative abundances of putative periodontal pathogens in the placebo group, which was, however, not statistically noticeable. Of note, patients included in those studies that showed also better clinical results in the antibiotic group, had a much higher proportion of deep periodontal pockets \u22655 mm at baseline compared to our study (approximately 38/44% vs. 19% PPD5mm).",

We used DESeq2 for aRSV level analysis that increased the detection rate for single aRSVs, because microbiomes were not needed to be rarefied for this analysis [43]. DESeq2 performed in the past favorably compared to other tools for identification of differentially expressed genes [34] and has also successfully been used with taxa abundance data [44]. Taken together, the use of modern sequencing techniques in principal allows for detection of low abundant taxa beyond the Socransky complex species [45,46]. Indeed, approximately two third of the decreased low abundant taxa after therapy in the antibiotic group did not belong to the classical periodontal complexes.",

The examined patients had a rather low proportion of deep periodontal pockets (approximately 19% PPD5mm at baseline). A higher taxonomic resolution to species level would be desirable, but due to the limited read length of our currently used technology this was not feasible. It has been shown previously that the choice of the amplified 16S rDNA region (e.g., V3-V4 vs. V4) may influence the number of erroneous sequences using Illumina MiSeq sequencing [47]. DESeq2 does not allow to include random effects, e.g., to account for dependencies between multiple samples from the same patient. Furthermore, a whole-genome shotgun analysis would provide also insights in the functional capacities of the microbiomes. Additionally, a longer follow up would be needed to analyze the stability of the detected microbiome shift.",

Mechanical therapy with placebos did not induce a statistically noticeable microbiome shift. Despite the difference in microbial changes both therapies noticeably improved the tested clinical outcome parameters. This casts doubt on the relevance of the short-term (two-months) reduction and/or elimination of disease-associated taxa as a main goal of periodontal therapy.",
