Large cohort studies can provide further understanding into inter-individual differences, with more precise characterization of the pathways by which the gut microbiota influences human physiology and disease processes. Here, we aimed to profile the stool microbiome of children and adults from two population-based cohort studies, comprising 2,111 children in the age-range of 9 to 12 years (the Generation R Study) and 1,427 adult individuals in the range of 46 to 88 years of age (the Rotterdam Study). For the two cohorts, 16S rRNA gene profile datasets derived from the Dutch population were generated. The comparison of the two cohorts showed that children had significantly lower gut microbiome diversity. Furthermore, we observed higher relative abundances of genus Bacteroides in children and higher relative abundances of genus Blautia in adults. Predicted functional metagenome analysis showed an overrepresentation of the glycan degradation pathways, riboflavin (vitamin B2), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis pathways in children. In contrast, the gut microbiome of adults showed higher abundances of carbohydrate metabolism pathways, beta-lactam resistance, thiamine (vitamin B1) and pantothenic (vitamin B5) biosynthesis pathways. A predominance of catabolic pathways in children (valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation) as compared to biosynthetic pathways in adults (valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis) suggests a functional microbiome switch to the latter in adult individuals. Overall, we identified compositional and functional differences in gut microbiome between children and adults in a population-based setting. These microbiome profiles can serve as reference for future studies on specific human disease susceptibility in childhood, adulthood and specific diseased populations.",

Several studies have reported an association between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome and various gastrointestinal (GI)1\u20139 and non-GI10\u201315 disease conditions in both children and adults. These changes in composition of the microbiome (known as dysbiosis) and their associations with health and disease have led to an increased interest in the complex microbial community of the gut16,17. However, our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and health and disease still remains superficial at best. A fundamental issue hampering progress in this respect is that our lack of knowledge on the composition and variation of the gut microbiome across the human lifespan remains limited. So far, most microbiome studies have been relatively small in terms of sample size and have usually focused on specific diseases and phenotypes, with most publications having used a case-control study design, what makes the analyses more vulnerable to methodological challenges. A better understanding of the variation in microbiome composition (from stool or other sources) and its role in the etiology of chronic diseases can be achieved through the study of large and well-characterized population-based cohorts, which generate rich information on many different physiological parameters, disease status, medication use, dietary intake, and other layers of \u201comics\u201d data from individual participants.",

These studies were, however, limited by low sample sizes. If the field of microbiota dynamics is to move forward, it requires studies in well-characterized general population cohorts of different ages, including studies investigating pediatric cohorts.

The representative read from each OTU was then mapped to the SILVA rRNA database version 12831 using RDP Na\u00efve Bayesian Classifier version 2.1232. OTUs containing less than 40 reads were removed as described by Benson et al.33. This threshold was established based on the correlation analysis of OTU tables of 5 pairs of technical replicates, of which DNA was amplified, sequenced and profiled twice (Supp. Fig.\u00a02). The sequence data was then analyzed for \u03b1-diversity metrics (Shannon diversity Index, species richness and Inverse Simpson Index). Final OTU filtering was performed by removing OTUs with a total read count less than 0.005% of all reads and OTUs observed in less than 1% of the total number of samples of each cohort as described previously34. The final OTU table was divided into 5 sub-tables at different taxonomic levels (in QIIME environment): phylum, class, order, family, and genus.",

Although Shannon \u03b1-diversity was not associated with age in each cohort separately (linear model; GenR: beta\u2009=\u2009\u22120.003, p\u2009=\u20090.91; RS: beta\u2009=\u20090.001, p\u2009=\u20090.63), Shannon \u03b1-diversity was significantly higher in the RS cohort than in the GenR cohort in the combined dataset (p\u2009<\u20092.2e-16, mean\u2009=\u20095.9, sd\u2009=\u20090.74 for RS and mean\u2009=\u20095.58, sd\u2009=\u20090.82 for GenR). Also, the overall compositions (Bray Curtis distances) differed significantly between both groups (Fig.\u00a03B; PERMANOVA; R2\u2009=\u20090.06; p\u2009=\u20090.001). We observed a 2 to 3 times lower abundance of phylum Firmicutes in the GenR cohort as compared with RS (p\u2009<\u20092.2e-16). Furthermore, we observed higher abundances of the gram-negative classes (Bacteroidia, Negativicutes and some classes from phylum Proteobacteria) in children. Regression analysis, in MaAsLin, on the relative abundances of the individual genera showed higher relative abundances of 59 genera in RS compared to GenR and higher relative abundances of 20 genera in GenR compared to the RS cohort (q\u2009<\u20090.05; Supp. Table\u00a03). The largest differences were observed for genera from family Lachnospiraceae including Blautia, Lachnospiraceae, Anaerostipes, Dorea, Fusicatenibacter, Coprococcus, Roseburia, Ruminoclosteridium, Butyricicoccus and Lachnoclostridium that were more abundant in RS, and genera from families Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroidaceae including Bateroides, Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, Barnesiella, Parabacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Odoribacter that were more abundant in GenR (Fig.\u00a03C).

Also, Alistipes and Barnesiella were reported as negatively associated with BMI in all four of these cohorts. Interestingly, the lower Firmicutes abundance observed in the GenR and COPSAC children cohorts compared to RS, LLD and FGFP adult cohorts suggests an age-specific phenomenon is responsible for this difference. However, understanding these differences merit further investigation. Thus, as both our RS and GenR datasets contain many characteristics that are similar to previously published large cohort studies, we conclude that our datasets allow valid investigations into the composition and variation of the gut microbiota across child and adult subjects.",

The lower diversity in GenR suggested a lack of \u2018maturation\u2019 of the gut microbiome in children. However, we did not observe a significant age-related change in alpha diversity within each cohort separately. This might be due to the narrow age-range in both cohorts (9.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32 in GenR, 56.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9 in RS, Table\u00a02). At genus level, the relative abundances of genus Bacteroides were higher in GenR than in RS. Members of the genus Bacteroides are specialized at utilizing both plant and host-derived polysaccharides49\u201352. As compared to other genera, Bacteroides have a large number of genes specialized to metabolize various glycans. They also have environmental sensors that control their expression upon exposure to glycans. The predicted metagenomics data showed indeed higher abundances of glycan degradation pathways in children\u2019s gut microbiome than in adults. In contrast, the relative abundances of the genus Blautia were higher in RS than in GenR. Blautia digest complex carbohydrates like whole-grains53 and its abundance has been shown to be reduced in patients with colorectal cancer54 and in children with type 1 diabetes55. Its abundance has also been reported to be inversely related to bone mineral density in human56. In fact, the relative abundance of Blautia and Bacteroides, has been implicated as a determinant of the so-called \u2018healthy microbiome\u2019 due to differences in the metabolic functions of these genera54,55,57,58.",

The vancomycin biosynthesis pathways were significantly higher in the gut microbiome of children as compared to adults. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide with activity against gram-positive bacteria, while gram-negative bacteria are resistant to this drug because of their distinct cell-wall59,60. On the other hand, biosynthesis of ansamycin was higher in adults than in children. Ansamycin is another antibiotic with activity against gram-positive, as well as gram-negative bacteria61. These findings indicate potential differential anti-bacterial activities between the microbiota of children as compared to adults, which appears to be in line with our observation of higher relative abundances of gram-negative bacteria in the gut microbiota of children. However, the exact role of antibiotic production in modulating the microbiota profiles of children and adults remains to be shown.",

One of the main discussion points involves the fact that stool samples were not directly frozen and immediately stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. For logistical reasons relating to the large scale cohorts recruited, we depended on postal delivery of home-collected stool samples to the research laboratory. Several studies have addressed the effects on microbiota composition when sample collection is performed at room temperature63\u201368, and observed that longer periods of storage at ambient temperature may affect microbiota profile composition and decrease diversity in the samples. We, therefore, analyzed the effects of stool sample collection at ambient temperature in both cohorts. Within our own initial datasets, we addressed this issue by using several approaches and observed increased abundances of Escherichia/Shigella when stool samples were mailed to the research laboratory and received after 3 days (RS) or after 5 days (GenR) in the post. Therefore, to avoid the influence of any delayed processing time, we excluded samples that had been in the mail for longer than 3 days in RS and 5 days in GenR cohorts.",

We, therefore, analyzed the effect of DNA isolation throughout the 391 runs (134 runs for RS and 257 runs for GenR) that were performed in this study and observed a batch effect causing a reduction in average DNA yield per sample in a proportion of the hundreds of runs performed. As we could not trace any clear cause for this technical artifact we introduced a \u201cBatch\u201d variable that allowed us to discriminate between low yield and the high yield runs. This \u201cBatch\u201d variable was significantly associated with overall profiles in the GenR and RS cohorts and was included as technical covariate in all analyses. Another, more general limitation when comparing different cohort datasets, is the accuracy of replication of 16S profiles, since sample collection, sample storage, DNA isolation, PCR amplification, amplified 16S rRNA variable region, the sequencing technique used and downstream bioinformatics may differ between different cohorts. For example, out of 33 associated OTUs with BMI, we could only replicate 6 in LLD and FGFP. In addition, geographical differences and lack of repetition may limit the accuracy of replicating microbiota profiles from different countries. In addition, although (besides using harmonized sample collection and dataset generation) we adjusted for the potential confounders in the analyses comparing children and adults, we should be aware that we cannot totally discard the presence of residual stratification as a consequence of the fact that both populations were derived from different cohorts.",

These changes were associated with predicted shifts in functional properties, including in energy metabolism, antibiotic production and the production of essential B-vitamins. These observations are likely due to the development of human-gut microbiome interactions with age. As both GenR and the RS cohort have been deeply characterized24,25 we here presented two valuable datasets for studying the possible association of the human stool microbiome and, life style, environmental factors, and health and disease outcomes. In addition, as the participants of both cohorts have been genotypes, also association between host genetics and host microbiome could be investigated.",
