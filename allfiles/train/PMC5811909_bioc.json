Relatively recently, aSyn aggregation has also been observed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS).1, 2, 3, 4, 5 aSyn aggregation in the autonomic plexus of the intestine is even hypothesized to represent a main source of the disease.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 In an epidemiological study, a decreased risk for subsequent Parkinson's disease (PD) was shown after complete (but not selective) truncal vagotomy.7 This suggests that the vagal nerve may be critically involved in the aSyn pathology of PD apparently ascending from the PNS to the CNS.8 Furthermore, inflammation and increased permeability of the mucosal lining of the colon have been shown in PD.1, 9 Both conditions are associated with the function of the gut microbiota, whose members might therefore play the roles of \u201cdrivers, perpetuators and mediators\u201d of PD.10 The olfactory bulb is also affected by aSyn pathology in very early stages, reflected by hyposmia.6, 8 Based on these observations, it has been suggested that a currently unknown infectious or otherwise transmissible agent may enter the brain through the nasal cavity and/or gastrointestinal tract and initiate the ascending pathological process to the CNS as postulated in the \u201cdual\u2010hit hypothesis.\u201d11 In animal models, toxins can reach the CNS from the olfactory bulb12 and aSyn aggregation triggered by toxins or bacterial amyloid proteins in the enteric nervous system can spread to the CNS.13, 14\n",

Also, less is known about the microbiome of the nasal cavity.23 Individuals likely to develop PD, who may already display differences in the periphery, have not been studied so far. Increasing evidence points toward a long prodromal phase of PD, that is marked by nonmotor symptoms1, 9, 24 and may start 20 to 30 years before the diagnosis of motor PD. Longitudinal follow\u2010up of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) has shown a high specificity for later development of an aSyn aggregation disorder, including PD, with a high conversion rate.24, 25, 26 Comparisons of PD patients to individuals with iRBD may therefore be informative on the timing of changes, which may influence future research on the role of these microbiota in PD development and progression.",

Only three of these differentially abundant OTUs were found at relative abundances above 1% (OTU_171, OTU_469, and OTU_332), potentially allowing recovery of the genomes by whole metagenome shotgun sequencing. Metagenomic sequencing data (20\u2009Gb) were obtained from two samples (of an HC and an iRBD subject) with high levels of two of these OTUs. One reconstructed genome each was linked to OTU_469 and OTU_171 using the 16S genes predicted in the metagenomic data (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3;3; see Supplementary Information for the method). OTU_469 was classified as an \u03b1\u2010proteobacterium. Assessment of the functions encoded in the genome reconstruction pointed to a fermentatitve lifestyle, auxotrophy for most vitamins, and motility. Interestingly, the genome encoded an endoglucanase with a synuclein\u2010like domain. OTU_171 was found to have 98.9% identity to a genome reconstruction of the cyanobacterium Melainabacterium MelB1,57 and these two shared traits such as a fermentative metabolism, flagellation, and B vitamin synthesis. No cyanobacterial toxin genes58, 59, 60 were found (see Supplementary Tables).",

The nasal microbiota displayed higher variation over the different individuals and most OTUs were only sparsely detected, in accord with earlier observations.23, 63, 64, 65 The strongest grouping factor observed for the nasal microbial community structure was sex. Controlling for this, only few differentially abundant bacterial families were observed in PD patients and most of them were rare. More bacterial families were found to be potentially affected by PD medication than to be different in relation to PD. Therefore, our results, in accord with other recent findings,23 indicate that the nasal microbiome may be relatively uninformative as a source of biomarkers for PD.",

The same analysis revealed influences of medication of oral antidiabetics, which has previously been observed.66 Controlling for this factor in the differential analysis, we confirmed one previous observation16, 17, 19, 20 of differences in microbial abundances in PD, namely the enrichment of Akkermansia sp. in individuals with PD. Enrichment in Akkermansia muciniphila is known to be related to longer gastrointestinal passage times.67, 68 However, we did not find Akkermansia abundances to be related to self\u2010reported constipation. Akkermansia spp. is usually considered to be beneficial for human physiology,69 attributed to strengthening of gastrointestinal barrier function and anti\u2010inflammatory immune stimulation,70, 71, 72 but depletion of the mucus layer by enriched Akkermansia sp. has been linked to higher susceptibility to a pathogen in an animal model.73 Butyrate\u2010producing bacteria have also been associated with opposing effects in PD, including a protective role attributed to the observed decrease in PD patients16 and a causative role attributed to the induction of microglia activation and motor symptoms through short\u2010chain fatty acids in a mouse model.74 In the present study, no depletion of butyrate producers was observed, and predictions of the coding potential of the microbiota based on the classified OTUs indicated no significant differences in any butyrate\u2010producing enzymes (see Supplementary Information). These differences to earlier studies16, 17, 19 indicate the necessity of further studies with direct measurements of short\u2010chain fatty acid levels in stool17 or in situ as well as in larger cohorts. Such studies would also enable the identification of microbiota associated with nonmotor phenotypes.75 Our results, in line with observations in human cohorts76, 77 and animal models,78, 79 point to a relationship between the microbiome and depression, independently of antidepressive medication.",

Free\u2010living cyanobacteria are known to produce a range of neurotoxins, such as Anatoxin and Saxitoxin and the neurotoxin \u03b2\u2010N\u2010methylamino\u2010l\u2010alanine (BMAA),81 which has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases.82, 83, 84 Although the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of BMAA are not yet known,85 no known enzymes for the production of neurotoxins are encoded in the presented genome reconstruction. This observation, together with the depletion in individuals with PD, argues against a role of the OTU as a producer of neurotoxins. This particular strain may, in fact, have a protective role, potentially outcompeting related toxin\u2010producing strains from the same species as widely observed for enteric pathogens.86 Another noteworthy group of proteins are those with similarity to aSyn, of which we found a gene in the metagenomic reconstruction of the so far undescribed OTU_469 that was depleted in PD and iRBD patients and may therefore also exert a protective effect.",
