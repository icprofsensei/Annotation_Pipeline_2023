In particular a decrease in body weight [1\u20135] and body fat loss [1, 3, 4] has been reported in response to GT catechins consumption. Potential underlying mechanisms include the increase in energy expenditure, thereby preserving fat free body mass, and the promotion of fat oxidation [6\u201310]. In addition a reduced fat absorption has been suggested [11], although evidence for long-term effects is lacking [12]. Moreover, a role of gut microbiota has been suggested, possibly in relation to the preservation of fat free body-mass and the increase in energy expenditure [13].",

The bacterial composition is rather stable within adults, whereas there is a large inter-individual variation in bacterial composition, as each individual has its own personal microbial community [14]. Over the past few years animal studies as well as human studies have suggested a role of the indigenous microbiota in body weight regulation [15]. Body fat of germ-free mice increased after gut microbiota transplantation from normal mice, without an increase in food consumption [16], suggesting that the gut microbiota is important in regulation of energy harvesting and fat storage. Moreover, transplantation of the gut microbiota from obese mice into lean germ-free mice led to greater fat deposition than transplants from lean donors [17]. Likewise, when fecal microbiota from obese and lean people was transplanted into germ-free mice, body weight only increased in mice receiving microbiota from obese people [18]. Thus, the microbiota in the intestines of obese individuals may be more efficient in extracting energy from the diet and in storing this energy as fat, resulting in an increase in body weight and body fat percentage. Besides that, gut microbiota may also affect body weight regulation via metabolic signalling of short chain fatty acids through G-protein coupled receptors, to regulate appetite hormones and modulate inflammation [19]. Several studies have actually found a difference in composition of the gut microbiota between normal weight and obese people [15, 20, 21], and have shown that bacterial diversity is reduced in obese compared with normal weight people [22, 23].",

Polyphenols for example, have a weight lowering effect [4, 5, 25], which is thought to be related to a change in the gut microbiota [13]. The gut microbiota is able is to metabolize a part of the polyphenols [26, 27], moreover the cleavage of glycosidic linkages in polyphenols generates glycans that are important as a nutrient foundation for the gut microbiota [28] especially for the Bacteroidetes, as they are supposed to have a higher glycan degrading capacity than Firmicutes. Therefore polyphenols may alter the balance between these two phyla in favour of Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, polyphenols may have a prebiotic effect as Rastmanech et al showed a weight lowering effect of polyphenols in obese subjects [13]. The prebiotic effects of GT catechins on human gut microbiota are still poorly understood; only a few studies have investigated the effect of catechins on the gut microbiota. Most of these studies found that catechin inhibits growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, including Clostridium difficile [29] and Staphylococcus spp. [30, 31], while two studies found that catechins stimulate growth of beneficial commensal bacteria Bifidobacterium spp. [30, 32, 33]. However, the long-term effect of catechins on energy extraction via possible changes in gut bacterial community structure is still unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether green tea induced changes in composition and diversity of the human gut microbiota. Furthermore we investigated whether there was a difference in composition of the gut microbiota between normal weight and overweight subjects at these levels and their possible differences in response to green tea.",

They were instructed to abstain from GT and to use less than 100 ml caffeine-containing beverages per day. Subjects were asked to maintain their food intake pattern. During the four consecutive days before baseline they were asked to record all the food and drinks they consumed, in order to be able to consume exactly the same during the four days before their final measurements at week 12.

They had to consume nine capsules per day: three capsules between breakfast and lunch, three capsules between lunch and dinner, and three capsules in more than 2 hours after dinner. Subjects were instructed not to consume the capsules simultaneously with their meals in order to prevent confounding effects of the macronutrients [35]. GT extract (Sunphenon 70H-T) was manufactured by Taiyo kagaku Co Ltd., Mie, Japan. Dutch BioFarmaceutics B.V encapsulated GT and PL components. The capsules with GT are intended for use as a dietary supplement. When specifying the PL capsules the GT extract was replaced with microcrystalline cellulose (0.27 g per capsule in the GT capsules vs. 0.38 g in the PL capsules). Microcrystalline cellulose is refined wood pulp, and often used in vitamin supplement. The capsules all had the same appearance. Compliance of capsule intake was checked by asking subjects to return all remaining capsules after 6 and 12 weeks. Bioactivity of the GT capsules was tested previously, in a randomized crossover experiment by Hursel et al. [35] in which comparable GT from Taiyo (Sunphenon) was used.",

Fat mass index (FMI) was calculated by fat mass (kg) divided by height (m) squared. BMI, % body fat and FMI were used to define body composition. Waist and hip circumferences were determined in standing position by a tape measure.

Amplification of IS-regions was performed with the IS-pro assay (IS-diagnostics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. IS-pro is a validated technique that combines differentiation bacterial species by the length of the 16S\u201323S rDNA intergenic spacer (IS) region with taxonomic classification by phylum-specific fluorescently labelled PCR primers [37]. The procedure consists of two multiplex PCRs: the first PCR contains two different fluorescently labeled primers. One amplifying the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (FAFV) and the other labeled primer for the phylum Bacteroidetes. A separate PCR with a third labeled primer is performed for the phylum Proteobacteria. Amplifications were carried out on a GeneAmp PCR system9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After PCR, 5\u03bcl of PCR product was mixed with 20\u03bcl formamide and 0.2\u03bcl custom size marker (IS-diagnostics). Fragment analysis of the DNA was performed on an ABI Prism 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). IS-profiling resulted in microbial profiles. Each profile consisted of a set of color-labelled peaks; with each peak related to a specific IS fragment (measured in nucleotides) and the color related to a specific phylum group (FAFV, Bacteroidetes or Proteobacteria).",

However, another long-term study showed that a mixture of EGCG and caffeine was associated with greater weight maintenance, which was supported by relatively greater thermogenesis and fat oxidation [41]. Therefore, it is likely that GT catechins only have beneficial effects on weight maintenance after weight loss [41], and these effects of catechins on body weight after a diet-induced weight loss may occur via a change in bacterial composition. This may as well be an explanation for the fact that we did not observe a difference in bacterial composition when subjects were in energy balance. In general, the gut microbial composition is quite stable in adults; therefore a change in body weight or extreme switches in dietary patterns may be needed to have a significant change in microbial composition [15, 42]. Furthermore, it is possible that the weight lowering effect of polyphenols only occurs in obese people [43], as supplementation with polyphenols in obese subjects with higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was proposed for weight loss [13].",

Although, in these studies associations with several individual bacterial species were found, results on total bacterial composition and diversity were lacking. Furthermore, results of previous studies on catechins and gut microbiota are inconsistent in bacterial species that are associated with catechins. Our study is the first study to compare the human gut microbiota community structure and diversity after GT and PL supplementation by means of a comprehensive profiling method.",

Main limitation of this study is the number op overweight participants.

Moreover, no significant interactions were observed between treatment (green tea or placebo) and time (baseline and week 12). Independently of treatment, we did find a reduced diversity in overweight subjects compared with normal weight subjects. We conclude that green tea supplementation for 12 weeks did not have a significant effect on composition of the gut microbiota.",
