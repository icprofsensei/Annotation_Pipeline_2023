We listed all sets (\u226430) of OTU markers with the error less than the cut-off value and chose the set with the smallest number of OTUs as the optimal set. POD index was defined as the ratio between the number of randomly generated decision trees that predicted sample as \u2018HCC\u2019 and that of healthy controls. The identified optimal set of OTUs was finally used for the calculation of POD index for both the training and testing cohort. And the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained (R 3.3.0, pROC package) for the evaluation of the constructed models, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to designate the ROC effect. The detailed script of microbial marker identification and POD construction can be found in the online supplementary methods.",

Importantly, the POD based on microbial markers validated significant diagnostic potential for early HCC and even advanced HCC. More importantly, the POD successfully achieved a cross-region validation of patients\u00a0with HCC from Northwest China and Central China. The shared microbial markers between cohorts from East China, Central China and Northwest China suggest that even though different regional populations may have different microbial community structures, signatures of HCC-associated microbial dysbiosis could have universal features, which present a similar trend to the gut microbial distribution and characteristics of CRC.18 These results indicated that gut microbiota-targeted biomarkers may become potential non-invasive tools for early diagnosis of HCC.",

We found that faecal microbial diversity was decreased from healthy controls to cirrhosis, but it was increased from cirrhosis to early HCC with cirrhosis. These results indicated a significant global shift in gut microbiota from cirrhosis to HCC and the altered microbial community might play an important role during HCC initiation and development. During the development along the colorectal adenoma\u2013carcinoma sequence, the gut microbiome richness was increased in colorectal carcinoma versus adenoma.32 Thus, greater richness or diversity in the bacterial community is not a sign of a healthy gut microbiota in our cohort, but likely suggested the overgrowth of various harmful bacteria or archaea in patients with HCC.",

Different diseases display relatively characteristic microbial profile.19 Gut microbiota presented a moderate dysbiosis, presenting a decrease of butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens in patients\u00a0with T2D.17 In patients\u00a0with early HCC in our study, the genera Ruminococcus, Oscillibacter, Faecalibacterium, Clostridium IV and Coprococcus, belonging to butyrate-producing bacterial families39 were decreased, while Klebsiella and Haemophilus, producing lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were increased compared with controls. As the major energy source of the intestinal mucosa, butyrate is considered an important regulator of gene expression, inflammation, differentiation and apoptosis in host cells and plays a key role in bacterial energy metabolism and gut health.40 Thus, the decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria may promote intestinal mucosal destruction, thereby contributing to HCC development. The increase in LPS initiates various pathophysiological cascades.41 High levels of LPS activate NF-\u03baB pathway, produce proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1) and lead to liver inflammatory and oxidative damage,42 thereby promoting HCC development.15 Notably, the decrease of Verrucomicrobia is likely attributed to the decrease of Akkermansia in the early HCC. Akkermansia muciniphila is a Gram-negative anaerobic commensal that uses host-derived mucins as carbon and nitrogen source43 and promotes barrier function partly by enhancing mucus production. Akkermansia muciniphila is decreased during obesity and diabetes,44 45 and its daily administration can counteract the development of high-fat diet-induced obesity and gut barrier dysfunction.44 Plovier et al further indicate that a purified membrane protein from Akkermansia muciniphila or the pasteurised bacterium improves metabolism in obese and diabetic mice.46 Recovery of ethanol-induced Akkermansia muciniphila depletion ameliorates alcoholic liver disease.47 In short, the decrease of bacteria protecting intestinal mucosa and barrier function (butyrate-producing bacteria, Akkermansia and so on), and the increase of LPS-producing bacteria in the early HCC, together contributed to HCC development. These data imply that the changed gut microbiota may represent a potential target to monitor and prevent HCC development by the gut-microbiota-liver axis.",

Thus, we propose that gut microbiota-targeted biomarkers may become potential non-invasive tools for early diagnosis of HCC. Systematic investigation of the key bacterial genus or species by metagenomic sequencing may further improve the diagnostic value for HCC. The combination of microbial markers and currently used diagnostic approaches may further benefit HCC populations. The validation of gut microbial markers in much larger cohorts from different ethnic populations or different countries may further promote the efficacy and stability of HCC diagnosis. The ultimate goal would be to identify faecal microbial markers with strong diagnostic power to detect early HCC, which may further achieve early diagnosis and early therapy for HCC.",
