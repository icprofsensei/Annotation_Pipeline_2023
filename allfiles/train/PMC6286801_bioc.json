To address this, the S-Lab at Providence College and the Global Sustainable Aid Project developed a microflush composting toilet system to isolate and treat human waste. Solid waste is composted within a filter-digester bed via an aerobic process involving microbes and invertebrates. Liquid waste may be sanitized by solar disinfection (SODIS) or slow sand filtration (SSF). Here, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of samples from a scaled-down test version of the system to better understand the bacterial component of the toilet system. Immediately after fecal matter was deposited in the test system, the bacterial community of the filter-digester bed at the site of deposition resembled that of the human gut at both the phylum and genus level, which was expected. Genus-level analysis of filter-digester bed samples collected over the next 30 days from the site of deposition showed reduced or undetectable levels of fecal-associated taxa, with the exception of Clostridium XI, which persisted at low abundance throughout the sampling period. Starting with the sample collected on day 4, the bacterial community of the filter-digester bed at the site of deposition was dominated by bacterial taxa commonly associated with environmental sources, reflecting a major shift in bacterial community composition. These data support the toilet system\u2019s capacity for processing solid human waste. We also analyzed how SODIS and SSF sanitization methods affected the bacterial community composition of liquid effluent collected on day 15 from the test system. Untreated and treated liquid effluent samples were dominated by Proteobacteria. At the genus level, the bacterial community of the untreated effluent included taxa commonly associated with environmental sources. In the SODIS-treated effluent, these genera increased in abundance, whereas in the SSF-treated effluent, they were greatly reduced or undetectable. By analyzing operational taxonomic units that were unclassified at the genus level, we observed that SSF appears to introduce new taxa into the treated effluent, likely from the biological film of microbes and small animals that constitutes the key element of SSF. These data will inform continued development of liquid waste handling strategies for the toilet system. Using the test system as an indicator of the performance of the full-scale version, we have shown the effectiveness of the microflush composting toilet system for containing and eliminating gut-associated bacteria, thereby improving sanitation and contributing to better public health in rural and peri-urban communities.",

In particular, Goal 6 is focused on providing clean water and sanitation to communities around the world. Water and sanitation directly impact health and wellbeing, yet 2.1 billion people lack safely managed sources for drinking water, and 2.3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities such as toilets (World Health Organization & United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, 2017). This disparity results in a heavy disease burden on affected communities. According to the World Health Organization, 870,000 people died in 2016 due to inadequate sanitation and unsafe drinking water (World Health Organization, 2018).

The user interface sits above a microflush valve, which uses the small volume (\u223c150 cc) of graywater from the previous user\u2019s hand wash to move both solid and liquid waste into a filter-digester bed. The bed measures 3\u2032 \u00d7 6\u2032 for the household version of the toilet and 4\u2032 \u00d7 7\u2032 for a larger school block version. Liquid waste flows through a series of screens and mesh to a filtrate chamber that lies below, whereas solids are digested and composted in the layered bed by an aerobic process involving microbes and invertebrates (usually the earthworm Eisenia fetida).

For communities with high water tables, there are two options under consideration for sanitization of liquid effluent: solar disinfection (SODIS) or slow sand filtration (SSF). SODIS involves collecting liquid effluent in a clear container such as a recycled water bottle and exposing the container to sunlight. This approach significantly reduces levels of bacteria, including pathogens (Boyle et al., 2008; Caslake et al., 2004). SSF treatment involves migration of liquid effluent through a naturally formed biological film (termed the schmutzdecke) containing microbes and sometimes small animals. This film, which sits atop layers of sand and gravel, removes pathogens, and other contaminants (Elliott et al., 2008; Hijnen et al., 2004).",

In addition, studies of vermicomposting as a waste treatment method have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach for mass reduction and pathogen removal (Hill & Baldwin, 2012; Soobhany, Mohee & Garg, 2017). However, little is known about how the bacterial community composition of the filter-digester bed within the GSAP Microflush toilet changes over time after waste is deposited or how SODIS and SSF treatment impact the bacterial community composition of liquid effluent. To investigate these questions, we analyzed samples from a test system (Fig. 1), which is a scaled down version of the field system described above.

After 24 h, a sample of the treated effluent was transferred to a sterile 500 ml sample bottle and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To test the SSF, liquid effluent was transported to the lab in five gallon closed containers and stored at ambient temperature for <24 h. To begin the filtration process, nine l of water was pushed through the filter to fill the chamber. Then, three l of liquid effluent was pushed through the filter, followed by 33 l of water. Considering the exit rate and void volume of the SSF, we calculated that the liquid effluent would exit the system after 10 h.

To assess positive and negative controls, all samples were analyzed together. Then, filter-digester bed samples were analyzed separately to investigate changes in the bacterial community of the digester over time, and liquid effluent samples were analyzed separately to compare sanitization methods. In all analyses, sequences <248 or >275 bp and sequences with ambiguous bases were discarded. Remaining sequences were aligned against Silva reference database release 123 (Yilmaz et al., 2014). Using UCHIME (Edgar et al., 2011), 2.8% of sequences from filter-digester bed samples and 3.1% of sequences from liquid effluent samples were identified as chimeric and discarded. Remaining sequences were classified using the Ribosomal Database Project 16S rRNA training set version 14 (Cole et al., 2014). For filter-digester bed samples, 42 sequences were classified as chloroplast, mitochondria, archaea, eukaryotic or unknown and removed, whereas 179 sequences were removed during this step for liquid effluent samples. Sequences were then classified into OTUs at a 0.03 cutoff, which means that sequences within an OTU are at least 97% similar to each other. Filter-digester bed samples ranged from 115,835 to 169,829 sequences, and each sample was subsampled to 115,835 sequences.

By comparison, the smallest number of total sequences detected in a sample was 106,154. To further assess possible contamination of materials with bacterial DNA, we determined how many unique sequences occurred in samples and negative controls (Fig. S1). A total of 10 unique sequences were detected in samples (filter-digester bed only, liquid effluent only, or both) and both controls. A total of 10 additional unique sequences were detected in samples and the no template control, but not the kit control, whereas 116 unique sequences were detected in samples and the kit control, but not the no template control. For the kit control, some of these shared sequences may be due to cross-contamination of the kit control with sample material, because the kit control was processed alongside samples. Overall, only 1.1% of unique sequences detected in the filter-digester bed samples are also detected in controls, and only 1.6% of unique sequences detected in the liquid effluent samples are also detected in controls.

Each sample was subsampled to 115,835 sequences. Analysis of filter-digester bed samples clustered the subsampled sequences into 3,049 OTUs, which were classified into 24 phyla and one \u201cunclassified\u201d group that includes all OTUs that could not be classified at the phylum level. Of these 25 groups, seven phyla and the \u201cunclassified\u201d group occurred at a mean relative abundance >2% across all samples (Fig. 2). None of the remaining 17 phyla occurred at a relative abundance >2% in any of the samples, and only Chloroflexi occurred at a relative abundance >1% (in samples from day 10 to day 30).",

The proportion of Firmicutes decreased to 20.9% on day 4 and further decreased to 3.0% on day 10. The proportion of Bacteroidetes increased to 47.3% on day 4, then decreased slightly but remained >40% through day 30. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria increased in abundance from time zero to day 4 to day 10 and then remained stable. Beginning on day 4, we detected three phyla that were not present in the time zero sample: Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes. These phyla were consistently detected in each of the filter-digester bed samples collected from day 4 through day 30.",

The 3,049 OTUs were classified into 287 genera and one \u201cunclassified\u201d group that includes all OTUs that could not be classified at the level of genus. The unclassified group comprised the largest proportion of sequences in each sample and is discussed further below. In the time zero sample, 10 genera occurred at a relative abundance >2%, with 59.2% of sequences clustering into these groups (Fig. 3A). The genera belonged to either Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes. For each genus except Clostridium XI, relative abundance decreased over the subsequent samples until it was <0.02% in the day 30 sample. By contrast, the proportion of Clostridium XI remained above 0.8% in each sample through day 30.",

Overall, this group comprised 35.6% of sequences in the time zero sample. This proportion decreased to 26.5% in the day 4 sample before increasing over the subsequent samples to 62.3%. To investigate this further, we analyzed individual unclassified OTUs. Relative abundance in the following analysis refers to the abundance of a particular unclassified OTU compared to the total number of sequences clustered into the unclassified group during the genus level analysis. In the time zero sample, six OTUs occurred at a relative abundance >2% and included 78.7% of the total sequences in the unclassified group (Fig. S2A). Each of these OTUs decreased in abundance in the subsequent samples until they occurred at <0.15% in the day 30 sample. Beginning with the day 4 sample, new unclassified OTUs were detected. In particular, seven OTUs occurred at a mean relative abundance >2% across the samples collected on and after day 4 (Fig. S2B). These OTUs included 23.5\u201346.4% of the sequences in the unclassified group of each sample; however, none of them were detected in the time zero sample. These data parallel the genus level data and further illustrate a shift in the bacterial community composition of the filter-digester bed over time after fecal matter was deposited.",

Dendrograms of the resulting distance matrices showed that samples from the last three time points cluster together (Fig. S3). The Bray\u2013Curtis distance matrix clustered the day 4 sample with the time zero sample, albeit with a large distance between these two samples, whereas the weighted UniFrac distance matrix clustered the day 4 sample with the last three samples.

The untreated effluent and both treated effluents were dominated by the unclassified group, which comprised 48.9\u201376.0% of sequences and is further discussed below. Five genera (Flavobacterium, Hyphomonas, Algoriphagus, Hydrogenophaga, and Roseomonas) that occurred at a relative abundance >2% in the untreated effluent were detected at a higher relative abundance in the SODIS-treated effluent (Fig. 5). By contrast, these genera were not prominent members of the SSF-treated effluent community, occurring at a relative abundance <0.4%. In addition, two minor members of the untreated effluent community (Methylophilus and Rheinheimera) increased in abundance in the SODIS-treated effluent. The abundance of Methylophilus was unchanged in SSF-treated effluent. We detected only one sequence classified as Methylophilus in the negative controls, therefore we can conclude that the persistence of Methylophilus is not an artifact of contamination. In the SSF-treated effluent, three genera that occurred at low relative abundance in the untreated and SODIS-treated effluent (Ancylobacter, Planctomyces, and Opitutus) were detected at a higher abundance.",

All six of these OTUs were minor members of the SSF-treated effluent, occurring at a relative abundance <0.08%. The SSF treatment appeared to introduce OTUs into the effluent. Five OTUs that occurred in the SSF-treated effluent were either not detected in the untreated and SODIS-treated effluent or detected only at a low relative abundance (0.03\u20130.07%). The abundance of one OTU (Otu0012) was largely consistent across the liquid effluent samples. We detected only eight sequences classified into this OTU in the negative controls, therefore we can conclude that the persistence of this OTU is not an artifact of contamination.",

The phylum-level profile of the time zero sample is consistent with that of the human gut microbiome (Hugon et al., 2015; Turnbaugh et al., 2007), which is expected because this sample was collected immediately after depositing human fecal matter. At the genus level, the bacterial community of the time zero sample is dominated by known human gut microbes such as Bacteroides, Blautia, and Faecalibacterium (Franzosa et al., 2014; Rajili\u0107-Stojanovi\u0107 & De Vos, 2014). With the exception of Clostridium XI, these gut-associated genera are detected at extremely low relative abundance (<0.02%) in the filter-digester bed at day 30, and most are already greatly reduced by day 4. By contrast, Clostridium XI was detected in the time zero sample and all subsequent samples. This group includes the gastrointestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile and other Clostridium species, which are anaerobic spore-forming bacteria (P\u00e9rez-Cobas et al., 2014).",

Persistence of spore-forming Clostridium species has been observed in other studies of composting toilets (T\u00f8nner-Klank et al., 2007), and these species are resistant to chemical treatment of human waste with urea (Vinner\u00e5s et al., 2003). Treatment of human waste with peracetic acid successfully eliminated spore-forming Clostridium species (Vinner\u00e5s et al., 2003); however, application of this chemical may not be practical or desirable for communities using the GSAP Microflush toilet. Not all spore-forming bacteria are associated with disease, therefore detection of Clostridium XI does not necessarily indicate a threat to public health from compost material, but this result highlights the importance of considering persistence of certain species via spore formation in the filter-digester bed.",

These taxa persisted through to the day 30 sample. The six genera are primarily associated with environmental sources rather than the human gut microbiome. For example, Flavobacterium and Algoriphagus belong to Bacteroidetes and have been isolated from soil and aquatic environments (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2011). Pseudoxanthomonas and Rhodobacter belong to Proteobacteria, which increased in abundance over the time series. Pseudoxanthomonas has been found as a dominant taxon in maize stover composted by a process using the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Chen et al., 2015), which are present in the filter-digester bed studied here. These taxa detected beginning on day 4 were likely already established in the filter-digester bed as a result of ongoing maintenance by periodic addition of vegetable scraps.",

The conditions of the filter-digester bed may not be amenable to gut-associated taxa, since many gut bacteria are anaerobes, and the GSAP Microflush toilet is designed to use an aerobic composting process. In addition, bacterial taxa that have become established within the filter-digester bed may outcompete gut-associated taxa that are periodically introduced. In both the test system studied here and the field system deployed in a community setting, the exact composition of the bacterial community of the filter-digester bed will be influenced by how the GSAP Microflush toilet system is maintained and used; for example, how often and what kind of non-fecal material is added to the filter-digester bed. Using the test system as an indicator of the performance of the field system, we have shown how the GSAP Microflush toilet can be used to immediately contain and over time eliminate gut-associated bacteria, thereby improving sanitation and contributing to better public health in rural and peri-urban communities.",

However, this design is not suitable for communities with high water tables due to concerns about contamination of water sources. In these situations, alternative sanitization strategies are needed. Here, we compared the effects of SODIS and SSF on liquid effluent from the test system. Bacterial genera that were abundant in the untreated liquid effluent on day 15 are generally associated with environmental sources such as mud and freshwater. Flavobacterium and Algoriphagus were detected in both the filter-digester bed sample collected on day 15 and the untreated liquid effluent collected on the same day, suggesting that bacteria in the filter-digester bed may enter the filtrate chamber via liquid flowing through the screens and mesh separating these two compartments. The untreated liquid effluent also included Hyphomonas, which is typically associated with marine environments. Its presence may be related to the test system\u2019s location on the coast of Narragansett Bay.",

A previous study of SODIS for application with the GSAP Microflush toilet system showed significant reduction of viable Escherichia coli over 8 h of exposure to sunlight (Mecca, Pellock & Bretz, 2013b). Given this and other studies showing the capacity of SODIS to sanitize contaminated water (Boyle et al., 2008; Caslake et al., 2004), it is possible that bacterial cells in the SODIS-treated effluent are no longer viable, but DNA is recoverable and detected using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods applied here.",

This is expected, because this sanitization method is designed to physically remove bacterial cells from the liquid effluent.

These taxa are likely introduced from the schmutzdecke, which is a naturally formed biological layer of microbes and invertebrates that is the key component of SSF treatment.",

The invertebrate-enhanced aerobic composting process reduces fecal-associated taxa in the filter-digester bed within a few days, with the exception of spore-forming Clostridium species that are detected at low abundance even after 30 days. In addition, the data presented here provide further insight towards the design of alternative strategies for sanitization of liquid effluent in communities with high water tables.",
