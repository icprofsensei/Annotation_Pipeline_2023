A total of 8422 operational taxonomy units (OTUs) were detected, corresponding to 11 phyla, 24 classes, 43 orders, 103 families, 328 genera, and 698 species. On average, we detected 193 species per individual (standard error 1.9, standard deviation 55.1), with a minimum of 58 and a maximum of 346 species. Inter-individual variability was already marked at the phylum level. Figure\u00a02a presents the relative abundances of the 8 phyla observed in more than 10% of study participants. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were detected in all individuals, and Bacteroidetes in all but one individual. Firmicutes was the dominant phylum in the vast majority of individuals (91.8%).\n",

Also significant were chickenpox vaccination, having breakfast, having lunch, diastolic blood pressure, consumption of raw fruits, decreased or increased appetite, and medical record of tooth extraction. Sex and age were able to explain the biggest portion of the observed variance of all the significantly associated variables, albeit with small individual coefficients of correlation (R2\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a04).

The use of prescription drugs, on the other hand, was very limited among MI participants. In fact, the final set of 110 non-genetic variables contained only one drug-related variable (\u201con any type of medication\u201d). Even the use of over-the-counter drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors, was observed in less than 1% of the individuals (i.e., only in 4 individuals). The potential impact of drugs on the gut microbiome, suggested by previous studies [11, 16, 18], was therefore not evaluated in our study.",

Increased \u03b1-diversity was found to be associated with foods generally considered as healthy (fruits, fish), while a decrease was associated with foods for which limited consumption is generally recommended (e.g., fried products). Dissimilarity measure by \u03b2-diversity level was driven by consumption of raw fruits, fried products, ready-cooked meals, and cheese [29]. In the current analysis, we focused our attention on additional environmental influences, lifestyle variables, and biochemical measurements. Age showed a strong positive association with \u03b1-diversity in all models, whereas sex and BMI did not show any consistent association. Interestingly, we replicated a correlation between higher plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and lower microbiome diversity (previously also observed in a Belgian cohort, but not replicated in a Dutch study population [16]). The causality of the observed correlation is unclear. Indeed, much work is still needed to get a better understanding of the interplay between the gut microbiome and liver disease [31].",

In line with previous reports [6, 14, 26], we observed sex and age as the strongest influencers on all \u03b2-diversity indexes, with the lowest association p values and highest proportion of variance explained by these factors. As other co-variates, such as environmental and host-extrinsic, are also known to impact the overall composition [32], we identified factors related to medical history (in particular chickenpox vaccination and teeth extraction), blood measurements (ALT levels and diastolic blood pressure), and lifestyle (such as tendency to have breakfast or lunch and variable appetite) having mild, yet significant, correlations with \u03b2-diversity in MI cohort. We also confirmed the independent effects of diet, in particular the consumption of raw fruits [29]. Interestingly, we could not confirm any significant association between BMI and microbiome diversity, in contrast to the recent population-based observations in the FGFP study [16]. This apparent contradiction could be partly explained by the MI study design [30]: the careful selection of healthy individuals resulted in a more limited distribution of BMI values among study participants (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 24.26\u2009\u00b1\u20093.26\u2009kg/m2; min 18.59 and max 32). This ascertainment bias reduced our power to detect potential correlations between more extreme BMI values and microbiome diversity measurements [33]. Furthermore, an estimation of the explained variance in \u03b2-diversity metrics demonstrated a small individual effect of each variable (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S4), which together explained 16.4% of the variance. This is concordant with previous reports, where a similar proportion of variance (18.7% [16], 16.4% [17|, and 20% [19]) could be explained by demographic and environmental factors. In contrast to what we observed in the MI cohort, prescription medication explained an important fraction of the variance in these other studies (up to 10% [17]), attesting to the uniqueness of our healthy study sample.",

We identified variables associated with overall microbiome composition and with a small number of individual taxa, explaining a non-negligible fraction of microbiome diversity in healthy individuals in the absence of drug treatment. The lack of any significant results in the genome-wide association analyses, on the other hand, indicates that common human genetic variants of large effects do not play a major role in shaping the gut microbiome diversity observed in healthy populations. Future studies should include larger sample sizes and a more comprehensive evaluation of human genetic variation, including rare and structural variants not captured by genotyping arrays. Evaluation of the environmental effects should be optimized for example by longitudinal tracking of study participants. It should be noted that our study, as most previously published works of comparative power, tried to link human genetics and the microbiome by exploring microbiome variation through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This methodology has obvious limitations, since it only allows the study of taxonomic composition and diversity measures, while ignoring variation of gene repertories and species pangenomes, which represent a broader and more refined picture of microbiome variability [36\u201338]. Future efforts evaluating host genetics influence on microbiome composition should thus focus on a refined picture of microbiome variability, obtainable through shotgun metagenomics instead of 16S rRNA gene profiling. Lastly, large-scale microbiome and genomic data should be pooled across cohorts, as recently proposed [39], to accelerate discovery in the field of human-microbiome interactions.",

Participants were selected based on stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, detailed elsewhere [30]. Briefly, they had no evidence of any severe/chronic/recurrent medical conditions. The main exclusion criteria were seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus, travel to (sub-) tropical countries within the previous 6\u2009months, recent vaccine administration, and alcohol abuse. Subjects were excluded if they were on treatment at the time or were treated in the 3\u00a0months preceding enrolment with, nasal, intestinal, or respiratory antibiotics or antiseptics. Volunteers following a specific diet prescribed by a doctor or dietician for medical reasons (calorie-controlled diet or diet favoring weight loss in very overweight patients, diets to decrease cholesterol levels) and volunteers with food intolerance or allergy were also excluded. To avoid the influence of hormonal fluctuations in women during the peri-menopausal phase, only pre- or post-menopausal women were included. To minimize the influence of population substructure on genomic analyses, the study was restricted to individuals of self-reported Metropolitan French origin for three generations (i.e., with parents and grandparents born in continental France). Fasting whole blood samples were collected from the 1000 participants in lithium heparin tubes between September 2012 and August 2013.",

Upon reception at the clinical site, the fresh stool samples were aliquoted and stored immediately at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C. DNA was extracted from the stool as previously published [40, 41]. DNA quantity was measured with Qubit using a broad range assay. Barcoding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using indexed primers targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene as described in [42]. AccuPrime\u2122 Pfx SuperMix (Invitrogen - 12344-040) was used to perform the PCR. PCR mix was made up of 18\u2009\u03bcL of AccuPrime\u2122 Pfx SuperMix, 0.5\u2009\u03bcL of both V3-340F and V4-806R primers (0.2\u2009\u03bcM), and 1\u2009\u03bcL of DNA (10\u2009ng). PCR was carried out as follows: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, 30\u2009cycles of 95\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009s, 55\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, 72\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, and a final step at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Amplicon concentration was then normalized to 25\u2009ng per PCR reaction using SequalPrep\u2122 Normalization Plate Kit, 96-well (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal volumes of normalized PCR reaction were pooled and thoroughly mixed. The amplicon libraries were sequenced at the Institut Curie NGS platform on Illumina MiSeq using the 2*300 base pair V3 kit to 5064 to 240,472 sequencing reads per sample (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 21,363\u2009\u00b1\u200919,087 reads).",

For \u03b2-diversity dissimilarities (Jaccard, Bray-Curtis, and Unifrac matrices), we used permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with 1000 permutations. PERMANOVAs identify variables that are significantly associated with \u03b2-diversity and measure the fraction of variance explained by the factors tested. The variables that were significantly associated (Benjamini\u2013Hochberg FDR\u2009<\u20090.05) with the diversity estimates in the univariable models were included in the respective multivariable models: we used multivariable ANOVAs for \u03b1-diversity and PERMANOVAs for \u03b2-diversity.

Spearman correlations, ANOVA, and PERMANOVAs tests were performed in R v3.5.1. Finally, to search for associations with individual taxa, we implemented multivariate association with linear models by using MaAsLin [55] with default parameters.

After extraction, DNA was genotyped at 719,665 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the HumanOmniExpress-24 BeadChip (Illumina). The SNP call rate was >\u200997% in all donors. To increase coverage of rare and potentially functional variation, 966 of the 1000 donors were also genotyped at 245,766 exonic variants using the HumanExome-12 BeadChip. The variant call rate was <\u200997% in 11 donors, which were thus removed from this dataset. We filtered out from both datasets genetic variants based on a set of criteria detailed in [57]. These quality-control filters yielded a total of 661,332 and 87,960 variants for the HumanOmniExpress and HumanExome BeadChips, respectively. Average concordance rate for the 16,753 SNPs shared between the two genotyping platforms was 99.99%, and individual concordance rates ranged from 99.8 to 100%.",
