Raw 16S sequencing data were downloaded, and processed using Qiime (v.1.9) classical pipeline and Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) picked from GreenGenes v.13_8 (close reference OTU picking). Data from samples with a minimum of 1000 reads were analyzed using a logistic regression, with disease status (Control vs CD) as an outcome, taxa abundance as the main explanatory variable and study, age, gender and the sequencing depth as covariates. The raw p values were corrected by the number of independent taxa (n=162). The same regression model was applied to alpha diversity as assessed by chao1 and Shannon indices.",
