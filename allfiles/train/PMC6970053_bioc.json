The questionnaire included information related to demographics, tobacco and opium use, and body mass index. Endoscopic ultrasonography was conducted and for those with mass or cystic lesions, fine needle aspirates were obtained. The pancreatic tissues were interpreted by an expert pathologist and those with pancreatic adenocarcinoma defined by histopathology were considered pancreatic cancer cases. Participants who had a normal pancreas at the endoscopic ultrasonography exam, aged 40\u00a0years or older, no history of liver or renal failure or cancer, no consumption of a special diet, and did not develop pancreatic disease or any cancer within one year of the initial visit were considered controls. Final diagnoses for the controls were asymptomatic small (<10\u00a0mm) submucosal lesions in the esophagus or stomach, or gallbladder or common bile duct stones without cholangitis. A total of 357 pancreatic cancer cases and 328 controls were identified and saliva specimens were available from 287 cases and 300 controls.

                    "text": "When considering individual taxa, for relative abundance, only one genus had a marginally significant association with the odds of pancreatic cancer, Haemophilus. The OR for an increase of 1% in the relative abundance of Haemophilus was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.98), although the P\u2010value was slightly greater than the Bonferroni\u2010adjusted significance threshold of 0.0038 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0043). However, we saw consistently strong inverse associations at higher taxonomic levels for Haemophilus (ie, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Pasteurellales, and Pasteurellaceae, at the phylum, class, order, and family levels, respectively) demonstrating the overall lower odds of pancreatic cancer at all taxonomic levels. For the presence/absence of taxa, for individuals with presence of the order Enterobacteriales, there was 2.80 times greater odds of pancreatic cancer (95% CI: 1.69, 4.78). This strong association was seen at the family level (Enterobacteriaceae) and at the genus level (unknown genus). Similarly, the presence of the genus Lachnospiraceae G7 was associated with 2.40 times greater odds of pancreatic cancer (95% CI: 1.52, 3.84). Although not statistically significant using a Bonferroni\u2010adjusted P\u2010value significance threshold of .0011, the presence of the family Bacteroidaceae (OR 1.90; 95% CI: 1.29, 2.84) or Staphylococcaceae (OR 1.81; 95% CI: 1.25, 2.62) were both associated with increased odds of pancreatic cancer. When we restricted to individuals who reported never smoking cigarettes or using opium, the association estimates for the statistically significant taxa from both relative abundance and the presence/absence were generally similar (results not shown).",

Lower alpha diversity in fecal samples has been found to be related to inflammatory bowel disease,1 colorectal cancer,38 and Westernization,39 which suggests that increased fecal microbial diversity is a marker of good overall health. Oral microbial diversity may be less indicative of general overall health and for pancreatic cancer, not a marker of disease.",

Methods are being developed to facilitate between study comparisons by using a standard reference set from which to calculate dissimilarities,40 but no ideal standard reference set currently exists. Our beta diversity associations may differ from previous studies because they focused on Western populations. A recent study observed that within one province in China, the factor that explained the largest percent of variability in beta diversity was the district in which the individual lived. In addition, microbial models to predict specific diseases were location specific.41 The beta diversity associations we observed may be specific to the Iranian population or associations may be detected using a standard reference set.",

We found that an increased relative abundance of Haemophilus and its higher taxonomic levels (ie, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Pasteurellales, and Pasteurellaceae) were associated with decreased odds of pancreatic cancer. Two previous studies also observed lower relative abundances of Proteobacteria in pancreatic cancer cases compared to controls15, 18 with one finding an association with Haemophilus.18 The presence of Enterobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae G7, Bacteroidaceae, or Staphylococcaceae were associated with increased odds of pancreatic cancer, although Bacteroidaceae and Staphylococcaceae had slightly greater P\u2010values than the Bonferroni\u2010adjusted threshold. One study found that individuals who had pancreatic tissue sampled after foregut surgery had a higher prevalence of Kluyvera (genus within the Enterobacteriaceae family) compared to pancreatic tissue from deceased controls; however, when comparing pancreatic cancer tissue to deceased control pancreatic tissue, Salmonella, Enterobacter, and Raoultella (genera within the Enterobacteriaceae family) had a lower prevalence. Similar to our results, this study also found a higher prevalence of Bacteroides (genus within the Bacteroidaceae family) in pancreatic cancer tissue compared to deceased control pancreatic tissue.42\n",

The presence of another periodontal pathogen, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, was associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, but not other periodontal pathogens (Tannerella forsythia and Prevotella intermedia).16 The periodontal pathogen association differences could again be related to the distinct population under study since there are differences in oral health in Iran compared to Western populations. One estimate of tooth loss from the Golestan Cohort study, a cohort of adults in northeastern Iran, found extensive tooth loss with men and women having lost an average of 15.9 and 18.7 teeth, respectively.43 In comparison, estimates from NHANES in the United States indicated that adults aged 50 to 64 had on average lost only about 5.7 teeth.44 It is also possible that some associations may differ due to unique oral sampling methods since previous studies have observed clustering by oral site or collection method.45, 46, 47\n",

First, saliva samples were collected from pancreatic cancer cases at the time of diagnosis, so we cannot distinguish whether any microbial associations were related to pancreatic cancer etiology or presence of disease. Second, controls were identified within patients who were also referred for endoscopic ultrasonography, thereby not representing healthy individuals who may have experienced microbial changes from underlying conditions. Third, although we had a fairly large sample size compared to the previous studies, this study was still underpowered for the taxa\u2010specific analyses. Finally, information regarding oral health or tooth loss in this population was not obtained so we are unable to address potential confounding by these factors. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the oral microbiota and pancreatic cancer conducted outside of the United States or Europe.",

The microbial community and taxa\u2010level differences could be related to the presence of pancreatic cancer or the risk of developing pancreatic cancer.
