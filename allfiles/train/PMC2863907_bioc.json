Twenty healthy women were recruited to the study during a routine gynecological visit. Eligible women were between 18 and 40 years old with regular menstrual cycles. Participants self-collected a vaginal swab using a standardized protocol and then were examined by a physician, who collected an additional five swabs from the lateral wall of the mid-vagina. In this study, the self-collected and three physician-obtained swabs were analyzed and compared using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA genes. Vaginal microbial community comparative statistical analyses of both T-RFLP and 16S rRNA gene sequence datasets revealed that self-collected vaginal swabs sampled the same microbial diversity as physician collected swabs of the mid-vagina. These findings enable large-scale, field-based studies of the vaginal microbiome.",

Using these methods, organisms are classified based on phylogenetic differences that are reflected in sequence polymorphisms of their 16S rRNA genes. The use of these approaches obviates the need to cultivate organisms, permits high-throughput analysis of samples, and provides precise and detailed information about the populations present. Using 16S rRNA gene analysis, the species (phylotype) composition and abundance in microbial communities can be readily determined, and similarities and differences among microbial communities can be quantitatively discerned. Despite difficulties in comparing data generated by different so-called \u201cuniversal\u201d PCR primer pairs, each introducing small biases (8, 36), this validated method has become the favored approach to characterizing the mutualistic microbial populations residing on and in the human body, including the gastrointestinal tract (4, 37), skin (4, 10), subgingival crevice (19), and vagina (4, 9, 15, 42). Importantly, the data obtained can be statistically analyzed to test the significance of changes that occur within individuals over time, or between individuals and treatment groups. These methods include terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) (41) and high-throughput pyrosequencing of bar-coded 16S rRNA gene analysis (12, 22).",

Surveys of the vagina are important for a number of reasons. The beneficial effects of the endogenous microbiota on women's health in obstetric and gynecologic outcomes are numerous but poorly understood. A proper understanding of community membership, relative abundance, and variations therein are critical for recognizing potential pathogens and the physiological processes in microbial communities that are protective. Significant alterations or disruptions of the vagina's microbiota, such as in the clinical syndrome bacterial vaginosis (BV), may increase a woman's risk to invasion by infectious agents. The data from several prospective studies indicate that BV is a biological risk factor for adverse outcomes, including the acquisition and transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (5) and the development of pelvic inflammatory disease (26).",

A study of clinician-obtained samples reported by Kim et al. (17) showed heterogeneity in microbial population across the cervix, fornix, and outer vaginal canal within a woman. However, self-collected vaginal swabs of the mid-vagina are the only practical and financially feasible method to use for sampling in field-based longitudinal cohort studies. Frequent sampling by a clinician (weekly or more often) is not practicable, results in lower enrollment rates and higher rates of loss to follow-up. In addition, women often prefer self-collected over clinician-collected vaginal specimens (23). Several studies have shown that self-collection of vaginal swabs is sufficient for the detection of microbial pathogens (23, 29, 32, 40), diagnostic accuracy (31), and morphotype-specific validity in Gram staining (1, 25, 34). The present study sought to evaluate if self-collected swabs of the mid-vagina reflect the same microbial diversity as physician-collected swabs, thus enabling large-scale field-based microbiomic studies of the vaginal ecosystem.",

This approach permits investigation of whether differences in self-collected samples can lead to false identification of microbial species. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed separately for the peak area values for each fragment length with subjects as the treatment factor. The self-collected and clinician-collected samples were combined for each subject in the analyses, so if self-collected samples differed from clinician-collected samples, an insignificant ANOVA would tend to result. For each ANOVA, the intraclass correlation (ICC) for subjects was calculated (18). The ICC can be used as a measure of how well profiles of subjects can be distinguished based on the presence and abundance of a given fragment. For fragment lengths with an ICC near 1, it is expected that self-collected samples will agree with clinician-collected samples, since the subjects differ from each other. Lower ICC values are of particular interest for trying to detect lack of agreement between self-collected and clinician-collected samples, so peak areas for fragment lengths with low ICC values were examined for possible disagreement. Power calculations were also performed to quantify the ability to detect differences between self-collected and clinician-collected samples from these data.",

We used criteria previously described to assess the quality of sequence reads. Briefly, to pass, a sequence read (i) included a perfect match to the sequence tag (bar code) and the 16S rRNA gene primer, (ii) was at least 200 bp in length, (iii) had no more than two undetermined bases, and (iv) had a least a 60% match to a previously determined 16S rRNA gene sequence. Genus level taxonomic assignments were performed by using the RDP Classifier (2), and further species level assignments for Lactobacillus sp. were done using 127 HMM Lactobacillus species models followed by clustering analysis. The relative abundance of taxa within a sample were used to test whether or not self-collected and physician-collected samples belonged to the same distribution. The samples of self-collected (SC) and physician-collected (PC) relative taxa abundances came from the same distribution if the distances d(SC,SC), d(PC,PC), and d(SC,PC) came from the same distribution. Since only one self-collected sample per woman was available, we could not draw any inference about the distribution of d(SC,SC). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that d(PC,PC) and d(SC,PC) were drawn from the same distribution by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (3). To boost the power of the test, we pooled the distances of physician-collected and self-collected across all women. If the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the null of equal distributions, then either SC and PC do not come from the same distribution or the covariances of these samples for different woman were substantially different and pooling of the corresponding distances would be responsible for the test failure. However, if the test failed to reject the null hypothesis, i.e., that pooled d(PC,PC) and d(SC,PC) samples came from the same distribution, then the result of the test was evidence supporting the hypothesis that SC and PC came from the same distribution and that the variance of physician-collected samples and covariance of self-collected versus physician-collected samples were not significantly different across all women.",

A total of 1,450 fragment lengths were present in the data set that included four samples from 20 subjects. Of these 1,450 fragment lengths, 772 had discordant within-subject peak areas as measured by an ICC value less than or equal to zero. Of these 772 fragment lengths, typically the zero or negative ICC value resulted from having nearly every sample with a zero fragment length but a few that were nonzero (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). We examined whether an excess of these nonzero outlier values were due to the self-collected samples. The 772 discordant fragment lengths had a total of 1,482 nonzero fragment length values, of which 312 were from self-collected samples. Thus, 21% of these values were from self-collected samples, less than the 25% than would be expected by chance (z = \u22123.51, P < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that self-collected samples do not contribute disproportionally to outlier samples that are observed for peak area values and support the conclusion that vaginal communities sampled using self-collection are similar to those collected by a physician. Power calculations were conducted (21) based on the number of discordant fragment lengths. Since two primer pairs were used, a sample size of 1,482/2 = 741 was used. For a sample size of 741, a test of a binomial proportion with a null value of 0.25 will have a power of 0.87 to detect a true proportion of \u22650.295. Thus, the number of distinct fragment lengths observed gives high power for detecting small differences from the expected 0.25 fraction of discordant lengths due to self-collected samples.",

An average of 1,650 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained per sample. The taxonomic assignments to the reads obtained for each sample are summarized in Table \u200bTable1,1, where taxon abundance (as represented by the total number of 16S rRNA gene sequences assigned to each taxa) is indicated as the percentage of total reads obtained for each sample. The species composition and abundances of microbial communities fell into six groups, which is comparable to what has been previously reported (42). Communities in groups 1 to 5 were dominated by one or two Lactobacillus sp., while group 6 included a diverse set of taxa belonging to the genera Atopobium, Veillonella, Aerococcus, Prevotella, Gardnerella, Dialister, and Streptococcus spp. among others (Table \u200b(Table1).1). A Ward hierarchical clustering analysis (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1)1) showed that self-collected samples clustered with the corresponding physician-collected samples, indicating that the diversity that is sampled in both sets of swabs is identical. Clusters 4 and 2 are the largest clusters and comprise vaginal microbial communities that are dominated (>90%) by L. crispatus and L. iners, respectively. The high level of similarity between subjects was reflected by subclusters composed of mixed samples from two or more subjects (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). Statistical analysis of the distributions of microbial communities composition and abundance sampled by self-collection and physician collection using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test resulted in a P value of 0.5446, supporting the null hypothesis that the distributions d(PC,PC) and d(SC,PC) came from the same distribution. These analyses further support the T-RFLP analysis and confirm that the vaginal community microbial species compositions and abundances sampled by each method were similar. Detailed comparisons of the microbial communities sampled by physician collected or self-collected for each women are shown in Fig. \u200bFig.22.",

It is hypothesized that the physical and chemical environment control the microbial types present and that the microbiota in turn control the vaginal environment, thus forming a dynamic equilibrium (30). Previous studies have established that several distinct kinds of vaginal communities with markedly different species composition occur in white and black women in North America (41, 42), and Japanese women in Tokyo, Japan (43).

Conceptually, this is important since vaginal communities continually experience various kinds of chronic and acute disturbances caused by human behaviors such as the use of antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives and other methods of birth control, sexual intercourse, vaginal lubricants, douching, and many others. In addition, the structure and composition of vaginal microbial communities are known to be influenced by natural changes in normal healthy women, including aging, time in the menstrual cycle, menstruation, pregnancy, and stress (6, 11, 16, 24). Very little is known about the biotic or abiotic factors that control the dynamics of the vaginal microbiota. Ultimately, resilience to disruptions of the ecological equilibria may be an important factor in protection against infectious agents, sexually transmitted infections and development of adverse obstetric outcomes, including preterm delivery of low-birth-weight infants.",

These changes are not reflected in cross-sectional studies; hence, longitudinal studies with frequent sampling are needed to capture the dynamics of vaginal communities. For example, in a 6-week, daily self-collection longitudinal study (33), it was observed that in 75% of the participants, the vaginal microbiota composition fluctuated over the time course of the menstrual cycle. The epidemiological study concluded that hygiene and sexual behavior were associated with the observed fluctuations. However, because molecular analyses of the vaginal communities were not performed, it was not possible to assess the importance of inherent differences in vaginal community composition. Similarly, Hay et al. noted the rapid onset and resolution (as established by Nugent scores) of BV in a study of 18 women with recurrent BV who self-collected vaginal swabs daily for up to 10 months (13). These studies highlight the dynamic nature of vaginal microbial communities (34) and reveal a potential weakness of cross-sectional sampling, since shifts in the vaginal microbial communities composition can be missed if samples are collected weekly, monthly, or less frequently. In order to observe the frequent fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, field-based cohort studies must rely on self-collection of samples since frequent clinician-obtained samples would not be practical or financially feasible. These studies further highlight the need for prospective field-based studies so that we can better understand the biotic or abiotic factors driving the dynamics of the vaginal microbiota and their association with adverse outcomes.",

Microbial surveys of microbiota, as performed by 16S rRNA gene analyses, require sampling to be quantitative and qualitative, and we provide the evidence that self-collection quantitatively samples the vaginal microbiota. In the present study, we further demonstrate that the insertion of a speculum by a physician is not necessary for the collection of reliable quantitative vaginal swabs from the mid-vagina. Importantly, participant's instructions for the collection of the vaginal swabs were no different than those given to women in other studies evaluating self-collection as a sampling method (1, 23, 25, 29, 31, 32, 34, 40). We believe that self-sampling can be easily implemented for daily or frequent sampling in a home-based setting. Samples can be stored at room temperature or in a freezer depending on the transport medium used for the swab sample, and participants could mail-in or drop off samples weekly to the enrolling center. The results of the present study not only validate self-collection for prospective longitudinal studies of the vaginal microbiota but also enable such studies by minimizing the burden on the participants by obviating the need for clinician-collected sampling.",
