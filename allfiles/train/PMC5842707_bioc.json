Similar findings have been noted in animal models of HD using neural crest cell specific endothelin receptor B (Ednrb) knockout mice [8]. At the genus level, Ednrb knockout mice demonstrated decreased Lactobacillus and increased Bacteroides and Clostridium prior to enterocolitis. These findings suggest that disequilibriumin the gutmicrobiome \u2013 or dysbiosis \u2013 may result in an altered microbial ecosystem that leads to HAEC development.",

One important physiologic role of gut bacteria is the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Complex oligosaccharides and other organic, indigestible fiber matter not absorbed in the upper intestinal tract are fermented by the anaerobic microbial community of the colon, producing SCFAs (primarily acetate, propionate, and butyrate) and gas [9]. These SCFAs, of which butyrate is the best-studied, play a key role in maintaining gut homeostasis and epithelial integrity [10]. Butyrate serves as a principal energy source for colonocytes, regulates host gene expression via histone deacetylase inhibition [11]. This latter role has led to both an increase in IL-10 production and an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting NF-\u0138B signaling [12]. We hypothesized that children with a history of HAEC would have altered fecal SCFA composition, as well as disequilibrium of SCFA-producing microbiota.",

Twenty children were enrolled by four member institutions of the HAEC Collaborative Research Group (HCRG): Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC), Los Angeles, CA; Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; Children's Hospital of Oakland, Oakland, CA. Of these, 10 children had a history of HD without documented enterocolitis, and 10 had at least one episode of HAEC as defined by Pastor et al. criteria [13]. Two of these 20 children were excluded from analysis owing to the presence of a diverting ileostomy and active HAEC at the time of stool collection, respectively. Thus, a total of 9 HD and 9 HAEC samples were analyzed. Medical records were reviewed and parent interview was performed using standardized questionnaires. Data collected included demographics, medical/surgical history, diet in the first year of life, medications including antibiotics, probiotic use, and enterocolitis symptoms. This study was approved by the CSMC institutional review board (IRB no. CR00008054) as a multicenter study, as well as individual approval by all participating sites, and the University of Michigan IRB (HUM00079878). Stool was collected within one week of enrollment and immediately snap-frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C in air-tight containers to prevent the loss of volatile SCFAs. Frozen sample aliquots were shipped to the University of Michigan for SCFA analysis and to CSMC for bacterial DNA isolation.",

As the full fecal microbiome was dominated by non-SCFA-producing bacteria, we identified genera that are known to have butyrogenic [16] and acetogenic [17] strains. While no genus-level changes reached statistical significance (Table 3), 10 out of 12 butyrogenic genera, identified by 16S sequencing, demonstrated elevated OTUs (operational taxonomic units) with a mean increase of 640% in the HAEC group compared with the HD group (Fig. 2A). This mirrored the relative increase in butyrate found on SCFA analysis of HAEC samples. Interestingly, despite a decrease in the proportion of acetate in HAEC samples, 3 of 4 acetogenic genera had increased OTUs in the HAEC group, with a mean increase of 1710% (Fig. 2B).",

While a role for altered colonic microbiota has been suggested by prior studies [5\u20138,18], the mechanism by which changes in bacterial community characteristics might impact susceptibility to or influence the development of HAEC is not clear. In this study, we found an over 4-fold reduction in total fecal SCFA content in children with a history of HAEC compared to those who never had HAEC. This may suggest that the colonic environment associated with HAEC is associated with a microbial community that has reduced capacity to produce SCFAs.

Interestingly, a reduction in butyrogenic bacteria has been shown in infectious and active inflammatory colitis versus healthy subjects, suggesting a role of intestinal dysbiosis and butyrate reduction in colitis development [22,23]. Butyrate has also been shown to ameliorate the impairment of mucosal immunity seen with total parenteral nutrition [24].

However, the absolute butyrate concentration was maintained, thereby making up a larger proportion of the remaining SCFA pool. The significant net loss of acetate may represent decreased acetate production via fermentation, or it may be the result of increased acetate absorption by the colonic mucosa versus increased acetate metabolism by colonic microbiota. Acetate is the most prevalent SCFA in the healthy colon [26]. Bacteria isolated from the human colon have been shown to utilize acetate for the production of butyrate [27]. This might provide an explanation for the reduction in acetate found in children with a history of HAEC. More metabolically active butyrogenic strains, as observed in our study, may have led to lower acetate levels in these patients, leading to a higher proportion of butyrate while decreasing the total concentration of SCFAs primarily via a reduction in remaining acetate.",

This may drive the relative expansion of butyrogenic strains in these patients, which maintain butyrate concentrations, perhaps metabolizing acetate in this process.

Patients with a history of HAEC may have received several courses of antibiotics to treat prior HAEC episodes, which may have influenced the development of an altered colonic microbial community. Post-hoc analysis of SCFA profiles after exclusion of the three patients who had received antibiotics in the HAEC group demonstrated continued reduction in total SCFA content, as well as consistent changes in acetate and butyrate content. Another limitation of this study is the small sample size of each group. While this study is the first to date to investigate SCFA content and related microbiota in humans with HD, a more robustly powered study may have detected more significant changes in SCFA concentrations as well as genus-level microbial shifts. Additionally, this study evaluated fecal microbial changes as a proxy for direct measurement of colonic microbiota. Substantial variation has been reported between fecal and colonic mucosa-associated microbiomes [31]. Though more invasive specimen collection would be required for colonic microbiome and metabolome assessment, such an investigation might reveal more physiologically relevant data. Finally, bacterial 16S sequencing in this study did not allow identification beyond the genus level. The identification of specific species with known capacity to produce SCFAs was therefore not performed, but rather the genera including these strains were identified. Future work might be directed at complete genome sequencing to confirm the ability of specific strains to produce butyrate, acetate, and other SCFAs.",

Actually when we had these samples we had to decide are we going to do a targeted metabolomic analysis or untargeted. We decided to start with targeted because as you mentioned this is a good first step, but what we hope to do is an untargeted analysis and that might generate all kinds of other questions about not just what these bacteria are able to produce but also what the interplay is between the epithelium and the bacteria. Thank you.",
