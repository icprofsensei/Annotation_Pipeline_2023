(4, 5) If adaptation is incomplete, patients will require long-term supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN). The remaining small bowel length is a critical determinant of the ability to wean from PN.(5) However, there is no defined threshold of remaining small bowel length needed to predict PN-independence in infantile SBS. The ability to wean PN in these patients may be complicated by recurrent episodes of diarrhea related to small bowel bacterial overgrowth(6) or pathologic changes within the intestinal microbiome.(7) Prior studies have reported a decrease in bacterial diversity and an increase in the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal microbial community associated with adverse clinical outcomes (7\u20139).

The 35 cm discriminant was chosen as this was the median bowel length for our SBS group. This allowed statistical comparisons of SBS patients with shorter (<35 cm) versus longer (>35 cm) remnant bowel. There were insufficient numbers of patients and distribution of bowel length measurements to evaluate the data using bowel length as a continuous variable. Data are presented as median with interquartile ranges or mean with standard error of the mean (SEM) as appropriate. A cross sectional analysis was performed with the most recently collected stool sample and was used to determine the relative abundance of microbial taxa in all SBS patients. This was then compared with remaining small bowel length. The median time from surgery to collection of the index stool was 3.1 years (IQR 2 to 3.8 years) in the <35 cm group and 1.9 years (1.1 to 4.6 years) in the \u226535 cm group. The Shannon Diversity Index was calculated in all SBS patients, those with <35 cm remaining small bowel, \u226535 cm remaining small bowel and controls. The Shannon diversity index is commonly used to characterize species diversity within a community and accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present. Calculations were performed using the IBM SPSS 24 statistical software package (Chicago, IL, USA). Values were considered statistically significant if the two-tailed p values were <0.05. An additional Bonferroni correction method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons using a p value of <0.017 as statistically significant.",

The median time from surgery to collection of the first stool for the longitudinal evaluation was 0.7 years (IQR 0.2 to 2.7 years). The 76 stool samples collected over the course of two years were grouped according to their enteral intake at the time of stool sample collection. Each sample was then catalogued according to their % enteral nutrition (EN) intake; those receiving <25% EN (29 stools), 25\u201350% EN (27 stools), 50\u201375% EN (12 stools) and >75% EN (8 stools). A single stool was collected from 10 control patients (100% EN) to serve as a comparison. We did not collect additional fecal samples in the control patients over time since there was minimal variability in their microbial community within the age span of this group and preliminary analysis established that their samples reflected a heathy gut microbiome. As nutritional intake changed for patients over time, some individual patients fell into more than one category. A mean relative abundance of each phyla was used to account for multiple stool samples from one patient within each group. SAS software version 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA) was used to generate a linear mixed effects model using the quarterly collected stools from the SBS subjects. In this model, the response variable was relative abundance of Proteobacteria and fixed effects included oral antibiotic use at time of stool sample collection, remaining small bowel length and enteral nutrition intake. Relative abundance of Proteobacteria and enteral nutrition intake were transformed by taking the square root, which improved the model fit. Values were considered statistically significant if the p value was <0.05.",

                    "text": "A total of 88 stool samples were collected from the 14 SBS patients. A median of 36,339 reads were identified per specimen and 2 samples with <9,000 reads were excluded from analysis. Stools were further excluded if they were collected at the time of bacteremia with an identified organism by blood culture. A total of 76 stool samples from 14 patients were therefore studied.There were 332 operational taxonomic units (OTU) identified among all specimens. Bacteria identified in the fecal samples of SBS patients over the study period and healthy controls included those from the six dominant phyla of the intestinal microbiome including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. However, the relative abundance of each phyla was significantly different when compared with controls. All patients with SBS displayed a perturbed microbiota signature with increased relative abundance of bacteria (% \u00b1 SEM) considered to be pathogenic, including Proteobacteria (33.8% \u00b1 8.1% SBS vs 1.5% \u00b1 0.5% Control; p=0.001) and Fusobacteria (2.1% \u00b1 1% SBS vs 0% Control; p=0.01). Further, we detected a significant decrease in phyla considered to be beneficial in the SBS cohort, specifically Bacteroidetes (9.5% \u00b1 4.5% SBS vs 33% \u00b1 7.3% Control; p=0.01) and Verrucomicrobia (3.4% \u00b1 2.9% SBS vs 4.4% \u00b1 1.6% Control; p=0.01). Finally, we found that the composition of the intestinal microbiome differed among SBS patients according to their remaining small bowel length (Figure 1). Specifically, in patients with <35 cm remaining small bowel, Proteobacteria dominated the microbiome with a mean relative abundance of 57.8% \u00b1 12.3%, compared with 15.7% \u00b1 4.9% and 1.5% \u00b1 0.5% mean relative abundance in those with \u226535 cm remaining small bowel (p=0.02) and healthy controls (p<0.01), respectively (Figure 2). Patients with \u226535 cm remaining small bowel also significantly differed from healthy controls in terms of their relative abundance of Proteobacteria (p=0.01). Among the Proteobacteria phylum the ten predominant genera or families were selected for further analysis (Figure 3). Enterobacteriacea dominated a large proportion of the Proteobacteria in both the <35 cm remaining small bowel group (33.5% \u00b1 17.9%) and the \u226535 cm remaining small bowel group (39.1% \u00b1 14.4%), but only made up 5% \u00b1 2.9% of the Proteobacteria in the controls. The control group had a more diverse makeup of Proteobacteria. Conversely, those in the <35 cm group appeared to have a less diverse composition of Proteobacteria. Interestingly, the genus Escherichia/Shigella composed 77\u201399% of the Proteobacteria and 53\u201396% of the total microbiota in three patients with <35 cm remaining small bowel. Escherichia and Shigella are often indistinguishable with 16s rRNA analysis(15). There was a median of 33 unique bacterial taxa identified at the genus level in all patients with SBS, compared to a median of 58 taxa identified among the controls (p=0.002). There were statistically significant differences between the taxa that dominated those with <35 cm remaining small bowel compared to controls, whereas those with \u226535 cm remaining small bowel had unique taxa in addition to sharing similar taxa to both healthy controls and those with <35 cm (Figure 4). Additionally Bifidobacteria and Veillonella, which are both considered to be ubiquitous inhabitants and early colonizers of the normal gastrointestinal tract(16), occupied <0.01% of the intestinal microbiota in the patients with <35 cm remaining small bowel. In marked contrast, Bifidobacteria made up 15.5% \u00b1 7.5% (p<0.01) and Veillonella comprised 16% \u00b1 5.6% (p<0.01) of the microbiota those patients with \u226535 cm remaining small bowel. There were no significant differences in richness defined as the number of species present in a sample when the patients with SBS were grouped according to bowel length (<35 cm SB median richness 31.5, IQR 30.3\u201335; \u226535 cm SB median richness 34, IQR 30.8\u201340; p=0.52). Bacterial diversity was determined by calculating the Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) at the genus level. All patients with SBS had a median SDI of 1.47 (IQR 1.13\u20131.87). When segregated by remnant small bowel length, those with <35 cm remaining small bowel had a median SDI of 1.19 (IQR 1.02\u20131.4) and those with \u226535 cm remaining small bowel had a median SDI of 1.69 (IQR 1.48\u20132.15). Those with the least remaining small bowel length were less diverse than the control group (Median SDI 2.51, IQR 1.99\u20132.64, p=0.005), but were not significantly different from those with \u226535 cm remaining small bowel (p=0.07). There was no significant difference in diversity between the healthy controls and those with greater remaining small bowel length (p=0.06). Detailed information regarding individual patients and their remnant small bowel length, estimated percent remaining small bowel length and key clinical factors including their nutritional status, anthropometric data and relative abundance of Proteobacteria are provided in Table 3.",

We found that the % EN was inversely related to the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (p<0.001). In a multivariate model examining the effect of EN, antibiotic use, remaining small bowel length, and time, we found that again the % EN was significantly inversely related to the relative proportion of Proteobacteria (p<0.01), with no additional significant contribution from antibiotic use, remaining small bowel length, or time. Therefore, in our population the % EN was the single most significant factor for predicting of the relative abundance of Proteobacteria. As patients tolerated increasing enteral nutrition, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria declined (Figure 5).",

The two patients with the greatest increase in IL-8 also exhibited the greatest relative abundance of Proteobacteria (98.6 and 78.6%), had <35 cm remaining small bowel, and only tolerated <5% EN. One of the patients was a term infant who developed SBS secondary to malrotation with midgut volvulus on the second day of life and had 8 cm of remaining small bowel. The other patient was born at 35 weeks gestation following an in-utero volvulus secondary to complex gastroschisis with a resultant 30 cm of remaining small bowel. Both of the patients were maintained on PN since the time of their initial surgery (3.1 and 1.8 years, respectively).",

Significant differences in the intestinal microbiome of pediatric SBS patients has previously been reported (7\u20139, 17). However, our data suggests that functional differences can be discerned among SBS patients related to their intestinal length and gut microbial signature. Children with the shortest intestinal length tended to have stunted linear growth with enhanced body fat stores. In addition, those with the shortest remnant bowel had less tolerance for enteral nutrition, a greater relative abundance of the pathogenic bacteria, Proteobacteria, and significantly decreased bacterial diversity. Accounting for clinical and nutritional variables using mixed models, we found that the amount of enteral nutrition was the most important determinant of Proteobacteria abundance. These findings suggest that while remnant small bowel length is related to the ability to tolerate enteral nutrition, the amount of enteral feeding directly affects the composition of the intestinal microbiota.",

                    "text": "Proteobacteria composes only a minor proportion of the healthy human gut flora, which is normally composed primarily of the Firmicute and Bacteroidetes phyla(18). A higher prevalence of Proteobacteria has been found in the intestine of hosts who consume a high fat, high carbohydrate and low fiber diet,(19) chronically malnourished children in developing countries(20, 21), and in certain adult disease states such as obesity(22), inflammatory bowel disease(23) and type 2 diabetes mellitus(24). Therefore, the intestinal microbiome composition is closely linked to the enteral diet. It is considered that Proteobacteria and other proinflammatory bacteria may play a role in disrupting the intestinal epithelial barrier allowing for bacterial translocation and upregulation of pro-inflammatory molecules contributing to a chronic low-level state of inflammation(18, 25, 26). Enhanced systemic inflammation in association with Proteobacteria were revealed in our population, as the two patients who displayed elevated IL-8 levels and had >75% of their microbiota occupied by Proteobacteria. These patients had the most severely shortened remnant bowel, and each received <5% of their calories enterally. We identified evidence of linear stunting within the group with <35 cm remaining small bowel. We also identified a significant difference in caloric intake between our two groups, with those with \u226535 cm remnant small bowel receiving more calories. This difference in caloric intake may help explain the evidence of linear stunting, however there was no difference in weight Z scores between the two groups indicating adequate calories to maintain a normal weight for their age and sex. Further, anthropometric and skinfold thickness measurements indicated that weight maintenance is at least in part accounted for by increased fat deposition in these subjects. Also, those with <35 cm were almost entirely dependent on PN. Parenteral nutrition has lower caloric targets when compared with enteral nutrition due to factors such as diet-induced thermogenesis and incomplete absorption of luminal nutrient. There may be multiple factors that contribute to linear growth failure, including critical illness or patients unable to receive adequate nutrition in the newborn time period (27). Prolonged nutritional deficit will eventually affect linear growth and deplete lean muscle mass. This phenotype is strikingly similar to a PN-independent murine SBS model in which body fat is replaced preferentially over lean body mass following a 50% proximal small bowel resection(28). This observation would suggest that independent of parenteral nutrition, intestinal resection alone is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of perturbed body composition.",

                    "text": "Despite supplementation with PN, pediatric SBS patients may be at risk for chronic malnutrition due to the inability to tolerate enteral nutrition which plays a key role in structural, protective and metabolic functions in the host intestine. Enteral nutrition importantly acts as a stimulus for the release of growth hormones and signaling molecules that help to influence adaptation along with anabolic growth.(29) The microbiota also plays a role in neuroendocrine functions which influences nutrient metabolism, appetite, and intestinal transit time.(30) Piper et al(31) identified microbial differences among SBS patients who were classified as having good or poor weight gain. Similar to our patients with <35 cm remnant small bowel, those with poor weight gain in their patient population were depleted in Firmicutes. This was hypothesized to affect metabolic enzymes needed for nutrient utilization, but there was no difference in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria between the two groups. Linear growth failure has been reported in pediatric patients with SBS,(32, 33) but has not previously been linked to changes in either the intestinal microbiome or remnant small bowel length. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate this association and explore potential mechanisms that may involve both lack of enteral nutrition and alterations within the intestinal microbiome.",

We propose that this creates a pseudo-starvation environment within the intestine, which then become colonized with pathogenic bacteria that may disrupt the epithelial barrier, thus promoting a chronic inflammatory state. This is associated with decreased gut hormonal signaling that further disrupts normal anabolic growth contributing to poor linear growth and decreased lean muscle mass. However, we further suggest that with the gradual increase in intestinal adaptation and enteral tolerance, the microbiome may return to normal which in turn may mitigate these metabolic consequences.",

The sample size in our patient cohort is small, but given the relative rarity of SBS, our patient cohort is similar in size to other studies published from other large pediatric centers.(7, 8, 17) We admit to the somewhat arbitrary cut off value of 35 cm for purposes of creating two groups within our SBS patients. It was chosen since it was the median small bowel length and afforded statistical comparisons with relative equal distribution between SBS patients with shorter and longer remnant bowel. The literature reports critical lengths ranging from 15 to 50 cm of remnant small bowel length as being important for gaining enteral autonomy(34, 35). Larger studies are needed to identify the precise cut off for the critical length of the remaining small bowel. We further recognize that it is difficult to establish cause and effect in regard to the alterations of the intestinal microbiome and the presence of linear stunting. Our population was studied after linear stunting was already established, since stunting occurs during the first two years of life. It is also unclear for how long colonization with pathogenic bacteria results in downstream effects of certain disease states such as metabolic diseases or systemic inflammation. Additional genetic factors such as parental height could have contributed to the growth potential of these children. Unfortunately, we did not have parental height data available to assess whether this relationship. This study lends support for further research to characterize the longitudinal changes in the intestinal microbiome, linear growth and metabolic effects in patients with SBS diagnosed in the newborn period. As more of these children are surviving into adulthood, more studies will be essential to understanding the pathogenic changes that occur in the intestinal microbiome of pediatric SBS patients over time and the clinical health effects of intestinal dysbiosis.",
