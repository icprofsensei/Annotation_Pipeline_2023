Following the completion of the National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project, there have been numerous studies identifying and cataloging the microbiome in physiological and pathological states including gastrointestinal diseases, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer (Whiteside et al., 2015). The female urinary tract is non-sterile, as bacteria were detected in urines from asymptomatic people using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and/or an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) (Fouts et al., 2012; Wolfe et al., 2012; Hilt et al., 2014; Pearce et al., 2014). Additionally, studies have shown that standard culture missed 90% of the bacteria detected by EQUC (Hilt et al., 2014; Pearce et al., 2014). Similar to the influence of microbial communities in other niches, alterations to the urinary microbiome may have an effect on urinary tract disorders. Emerging evidence indicates that shifts in the normal microbiome of the bladder may play an important role in pathophysiology of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) (Siddiqui et al., 2012; Pearce et al., 2014; Nickel et al., 2015; Karstens et al., 2016; Abernethy et al., 2017; Thomas-White et al., 2017).",

OAB symptoms affect social, psychological, occupational, domestic, physical, and sexual aspects of life and lead to a heavy cost (Stewart et al., 2003). Some OAB symptoms are clearly due to neuromuscular issues and muscarinic receptors, but some individuals with OAB do not respond to anti-muscarinic receptor, botox, or other treatments (Gormley et al., 2015), which suggests that their symptoms might arise from other causes or that the causes are complex. Therefore, it is an urgent need to further investigate the pathogenesis of OAB and identify new therapeutic target.",

The urinary microbiome might play similar roles, given the well-known connection between central nervous system and bladder function (Tadic et al., 2010). OAB patients had higher levels of depression, anxiety and embarrassment than asymptomatic people (Kinsey et al., 2016). Bradley et al. found that female veterans with anxiety symptoms were more likely to have bothersome urgency incontinence and/or frequency symptoms (Bradley et al., 2014). It was reported that OAB patients with depression had more severe urinary incontinence symptoms, greater bother and more impact on quality of life compared to those without depression (Lai et al., 2016). There have been some studies on the urinary microbiome of OAB/UUI (Hilt et al., 2014; Pearce et al., 2014; Karstens et al., 2016; Curtiss et al., 2017; Thomas-White et al., 2017), but no previous study researched the urinary microbiome considering psychological disorders. Our primary purpose was to characterize the female urinary microbiome associated with OAB in China and investigate relationships between the microbiome and psychological factors.",

Patients must complain of urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes, in accordance with the 2002 ICS definition of OAB (Abrams et al., 2002). Asymptomatic controls must have no prior diagnosis of OAB or interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, no pelvic pain, and no evidence of urinary infection. Subjects with a history of urethral stricture disease, urinary retention, pelvic radiation, tuberculosis cystitis, cyclophosphamide cystitis, genitourinary cancer, urinary stones, neurogenic bladder, a documented positive urine culture in the past 6 weeks, or a post-void residual volume \u2265150 mL were not eligible. The Medicine Institutional Review Board of Southern Medical University approved this study, and written informed consents from all participants were obtained. All participants were required to finish Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS, standard score \u2265 50 indicates anxiety) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS, standard score \u2265 53 indicates depression). Many studies investigated the urinary microbiome based on the collection of mid-stream urine into a sterile container (Siddiqui et al., 2012; Lewis et al., 2013; Thomas-White et al., 2017). However, the collection of mid-stream urine cannot avoid contamination from the distal urethra, vulva, or vagina. Sterile alternatives like transurethral catheter and suprapubic aspirate might be more adequate and elaborate for scientific exploration of the bladder microbiome (Wolfe et al., 2012; Hiergeist and Gessner, 2017). Therefore, 50 ml of urine from each participant was collected through transurethral catheterization in this study. Twenty milliliter of the specimen was tested by standard cultivation to exclude UTI. The rest of specimen (30 ml) was kept at 4\u00b0C, and immediately shifted to laboratory within an hour for centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min. The pellets were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing.",

However, the microbiome of OAB group displayed greater variability, and could be divided into three clusters. The mean relative abundances of various bacterial phyla and families in each group were listed in Table \u200bTable22 and summarized in Figures 2B,C. The most frequently detected phylum was Firmicutes (42.7% OAB, 56.4% control), followed by Proteobacteria (25.0% OAB, 14.3% control), Actinobacteria (19.8% OAB, 6.8% control, P = 0.048) and Bacteroidetes (8.1% OAB, 14.3% control). At the family level, Bifidobacteriaceae (P = 0.012) was significantly more abundant in the OAB group. Venn diagrams demonstrated that 375 families (Figure \u200b(Figure3A)3A) and 689 genera (Figure \u200b(Figure3B)3B) were shared between the two cohorts. The bacterial compositions of all samples at different levels were shown in Supplementary Figure 1.",

We found that OAB patients with anxiety or depression reported significantly higher scores on OABSS (Table \u200b(Table3,3, P all <0.05). The alpha diversity indices (Observed species, Chao1, Simpson, and Shannon indices) were markedly lower in depression cases than in non-depression cases (Table \u200b(Table3,3, P all <0.01). Higher score on SDS inversely correlated with both Shannon index (r = \u22120.516, P = 0.003, Figure \u200bFigure5A)5A) and Chao1 (r = \u22120.458, P = 0.011, Figure \u200bFigure5B).5B). LEfSe algorithm was also applied to identify the specific genera that were differentially represented in different psychological status in OAB patients. Based on LEfSe resluts, Burkholderia, Cryocola, Agrobacterium, Methanobrevibacter, Collinsella, and Psychrobacter were relatively more abundant in the non-anxiety cohort compared to the anxiety cohort (Figure \u200b(Figure5C).5C). In contrast, Sneathia, Porphyromonas, Gallicola, Leptolyngbya, Alicyclobacillus, Helcococcus, and Actinobaculum were significantly enriched in the OAB patients with anxiety (Figure \u200b(Figure5C).5C). Compared to the depression cohort, more Actinobaculum, Pedobacter, WAL_1855D, and Clostridium were found in the non-depression cohort (Figure \u200b(Figure5D5D).",

The bacterial diversity and richness were decreased in the OAB urinary microbiome. Furthermore, 7 genera were increased and 13 were reduced compared to the control samples. We also found negative correlations between the depression score and both bacterial richness and diversity in the OAB patients, which inferred that psychological factors might play an important role in the urinary microbiome.",

                    "text": "There have been some studies on the urinary microbiome of OAB/UUI. Hilt et al. identified bacteria associated with OAB by EQUC, and found that Aerococcus and Actinobaculum were isolated only from OAB urine (Hilt et al., 2014). Another study analyzing urinary microbiome collected from women with UUI and asymptomatic controls found that the microbiome from UUI displayed decreased Lactobacillus and increased Gardnerella abundance by sequence analysis, and nine genera were more frequently cultured from the UUI cohort by culture techniques (Pearce et al., 2014). Karstens et al. identified statistically significant differences in the relative abundance of specific bacteria in urine from women with UUI compared to controls using high throughput sequencing (Karstens et al., 2016). They also found that lower microbial diversity was associated with increased symptom severity in women with UUI. Our study shared some results with the above studies, such as increased genera (e.g., Aerococcus and Staphylococcus) and decreased genera (e.g., Prevotella and Lactobacillus) in the patient group. Hilt's group has evaluated the urinary microbiomes of hundreds of women with OAB/UUI and a smaller but substantial number of asymptomatic controls (Hilt et al., 2014; Pearce et al., 2014). It seems pretty clear that there are some bacterial species (including Aerococcus) associated with urinary symptoms and not with asymptomatic controls. However, there were several differences between these studies. An obvious difference was that Gardnerella, a genus representing one of the major urotypes in above previous studies, had low relative abundance in both cohorts in our study, similar to another study from China (Liu et al., 2017). Differences could be partly due to different clinical characteristics. Previous studies included populations with more severe urinary symptoms than our study. In addition, differences in reference databases used which can cause differences in the types of bacteria identified might also contribute to the discrepancies. Our study used the GreeneGenes database for taxanomic assignment, whereas other studies used the SILVA database. Another reason might be that the ethnic group in our study was different from that in the previous studies above. Notably, the gut microbiome was compositionally affected by geographical and ethnic factors (Prideaux et al., 2013). Future study focusing on whether there are differences in the urinary microbiomes between different racial types is needed.",

However, the bacterial evenness was not significantly different between the two groups, indicating that the shift in diversity was caused by the reduced richness. The urinary microbiome of asymptomatic women was found to be more diverse, and richer in Lactobacillus compared to the OAB group. A more diverse and Lactobacillus-dominated urinary microbiome might play a potentially protective role, which is consistent with arguments of other studies (Brubaker et al., 2014; Pearce et al., 2014). The profile of urinary microbiome in interstitial cystitis was also found to be less diverse and less likely to contain Lactobacillus species (Abernethy et al., 2017). This suggests that the intriguing possibility that specific microbial patterns may be linked to specific symptoms, regardless of diagnosis, which provides a great enlightenment for future researches of the urinary microbiome and the algorithms for the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.",

As determined by PCoA, there are overlapping regions where a subgroup of samples from OAB and controls are located. It suggests that some samples of OAB patients are very similar to controls, but some urinary microbiomes from OAB patients are quite distinct. Although, it was not statistically significant, the OAB patients whose urinary microbiomes were obviously different from the controls reported higher scores on OABSS, SAS, and SDS than in patients similar to controls. Moreover, different psychological conditions were associated with different severities of symptom and characteristics of urinary microbiome (Table \u200b(Table3).3). Similar to UUI (Pearce et al., 2014), this could be due to internal heterogeneity in the OAB population. The status of the urinary microbiome and mental factors should all be taken into consideration for clinical phenotyping of patients. The careful phenotyping of patients gives a better understanding of heterogeneous pathology, and provides the basis for precise and personalized medicine, such as targeted therapy through removal of specific pathogens and the restoration of normal microbiome supplemented by psychotherapy.",

Among the urine samples collected from chronic LUTS patients, 75% showed evidence of infected urothelial cells, which might stimulate the apoptotic process in urothelial cells and increase exposure of the underlying mucosal layer to irritative stimuli (Horsley et al., 2013). Low-count bacteriuria and intracellular bacterial communities were more prevalent among OAB women when a lower cut-off threshold (102 CFU/mL) was used (Khasriya et al., 2010). We identified 20 bacteria with significantly differential relative abundances between OAB microbiome and control microbiome. Of the 7 bacteria that had increased relative abundance in OAB urinary microbiome, some (Proteus, Staphylococcus, and Mycoplasma) are commonly seen in patients with UTI. This suggests that a persistent low grade infection by bacteria that are not commonly detected by standard culture could potentially be responsible for the OAB symptoms. It is a new dogma that the urine is not sterile and that many uropathogens are not detected by the standard culture method. The microbiome might be a new paradigm in urogenital infections and diseases, and influence the future classification of UTI.",

Evidence suggests that the axis is a complex bidirectional communication network between the gut microbiome and host, by which microbiome can modulate brain function, and conversely, chronic psychological stress may compound the degree of dysbiosis (Bailey et al., 2011). The urinary microbiome has similar potential. Interstitial cystitis was considered as a central sensitization syndrome with impaired inhibition of descending pain pathways (Ness et al., 2014). For idiopathic OAB patients, central sensitization may also help explain the pathogenesis (Reynolds et al., 2016). A study disclosed that different sets of bacterial taxa in urinary microbiome were increased in the psychosocial-predominant and neurologic-predominant groups of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (Shoskes et al., 2016). In our study, we identified significant correlations between measurements of depression severity and alpha diversity in women with OAB. The data indicates that OAB patients with depression have further reductions in bacterial diversity and richness. Furthermore, some bacterial genera differed significantly between OAB patients with and without anxiety or depression. It is an important finding that requires further studies to establish whether a brain\u2013bladder\u2013microbiome axis exists. It may become possible to manipulate brain status to regulate the urinary microbiome for purposes of treating urinary diseases, and vice versa, in the future.",
