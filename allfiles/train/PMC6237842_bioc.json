Screening for ASD typically relies on the modified checklist for autism in toddlers \u2013 revised (MCHAT-R), a parent-based survey with a positive predictive value less than 20% (Siu et al., 2016). In 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force determined that insufficient evidence existed to recommend continued ASD screening. Non-specific screening tools may lead to over-referral, contributing to wait times that exceed 12 months for diagnostic evaluation using the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual (DSM)-5 criteria (Bisgaier et al., 2011). This wait can delay initiation of critical intervention services at a time of marked brain development.

For instance, children with ASD are typified by hyperserotonemia (Chamberlain and Herman, 1990), elevated oxidative stress markers (Chauhan and Chauhan, 2006), and alterations in immune factors that can lead to neuroinflammation (Corbett et al., 2006; Goines and Van de Water, 2010; Onore et al., 2012). Such disturbances may facilitate disruptions in neuropeptides, including glutamate, GABA (El-Ansary and Al-Ayadhi, 2014), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Connolly et al., 2006). Evidence suggests that environmental risk factors also play a role in ASD development (Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2006). Microbial dysbiosis and altered metabolic substrates are two examples of environmental features implicated in ASD (MacFabe, 2013). At its core, however, ASD appears to be driven by genetic traits that confer \u223c50% heritability, with 90% concordance in monozygotic twins (Tick et al., 2016).",

Third, ever-changing diagnostic criteria create a challenging landscape for patient characterization. Fourth, overlap between ASD and other cognitive/behavioral phenotypes necessitates comparisons with \u201ccontrol\u201d participants exhibiting non-ASD developmental delay (DD). Finally, nearly all studies rely on single molecule types. To date, most ASD biomarker studies fail to overcome these challenges.

Given the array of genetic and environmental risk factors that typify ASD, \u201cpoly-omics\u201d approaches that integrate genetic, epigenetic, and metagenomic methods appear well-suited. Indeed, initial studies of both coding (Kong et al., 2012) and non-coding (Mundalil Vasu et al., 2014) transcriptional elements in the peripheral blood of children with ASD have demonstrated predictive potential for identifying ASD. Our pilot study demonstrated that many of these same RNA elements could be detected in saliva of children with ASD (Hicks and Middleton, 2016; Hicks et al., 2016). As a non-invasive approach, collecting saliva boosts sample sizes through increased participation rates, while facilitating interrogation of the microbiome (Frye et al., 2015).

Participants were recruited from Penn State (n = 250), SUNY Upstate (n = 191), and UC Irvine (n = 15). 238 children had a clinical diagnosis of ASD, based on DSM-5 criteria. This criterion was chosen to accommodate the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in clinical practice (Anderson, 2015), at an age when initial ASD diagnoses typically occur (Mandell et al., 2005). ASD participants were enrolled following developmental assessment by a trained clinician (e.g., developmental pediatrician or developmental psychologist). ASD participants were compared with 218 control participants: 134 children with typical development (TD) and 84 children with non-ASD DD. TD and DD participants were enrolled following yearly well-child visits or specialist developmental assessment, respectively. For DD participants, absence of ASD was confirmed through negative MCHAT-R and/or clinician assessment with DSM-5 criteria.

Pooled saliva was collected by applying the highly absorbent swab at two sites: (1) the base of the tongue (near the sublingual ducts); and (2) bilaterally between the gums and buccal mucosa (proximal to the parotid ducts). Saliva collection was completed in 5\u201310 s. Scraping of the buccal mucosa and teeth was generally avoided. RNA was extracted from whole saliva with a standard Trizol method (Hicks and Middleton, 2016). Whole saliva was employed rather than exclusive isolation of epithelial or exosomal RNA because each fraction provided complementary information about host and microbial transcription (Park et al., 2006; Michael et al., 2010). For example, exosomal RNA may arise from cranial nerve signaling (which could be disrupted in cases of speech apraxia, or food texture sensitivity), while epithelial RNA may reveal information about transcriptional control within cells. RNA was sequenced at the SUNY Molecular Analysis Core using an Illumina TruSeq Small RNA Prep protocol and a NextSeq500 instrument (Illumina; San Diego, CA, United States) at a targeted depth of ten million, 50 base, single-end reads per sample. Human RNA reads were aligned to the hg38 build of the human genome using Partek Flow (Partek; St. Louis, MO, United States) and the SHRiMP2 aligner. Quantification of aligned RNA reads was performed based on RefSeq annotation, miRbase 21 mature and precursor annotation, and piRNAbase annotation. Microbial transcripts were mapped to the NCBI RefSeq genome database using k-SLAM (Ainsworth et al., 2017). Microbial transcripts were employed in favor of a 16S approach to simplify and streamline nucleic acid extraction and analysis, and facilitate downstream clinical application. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated the potential for microbial RNA to differentiate children with ASD (Hicks et al., 2018).",

While it is possible that the modest difference in age between the ASD and non-ASD groups may have confounded the analyses, the children incorrectly classified displayed similar age, sex, and race as those who were correctly classified. Thus, the algorithm showed no bias toward demographic or medical factors within the study cohort. It also suggests the test may be broadly applicable without exclusion of medical or demographic subgroups. Conditions that might impact salivary RNA (e.g., asthma, gastrointestinal disturbance, BMI) and conditions that are more common in children with ASD (sleep difficulties, ADHD) also did not appear to bias ASD prediction.",

The results do not imply that these genomic regions are commonly altered in children with ASD (and the lack of genomic sequencing in our cohort prevents identification of common CNVs or syndromic cases). Instead, variations in non-coding RNA abundance may arise in response to dysregulation of several neurobiologic systems that have been previously reported in ASD literature. For instance, several miRNAs in the panel target mRNAs from ASD-candidate genes, including miR-410/FMR1, miR-10a/PTEN, miR-92a/TSC1, and miR-106a/SCN2A. An additional member of the RNA panel, SNORD118, may play a critical role in ribosomal function and protein translation (Jenkinson et al., 2016): a study of 40 patients having leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts identified bi-allelic mutations in SNORD118.",

Individual miRNA targets also demonstrate pathway interactions for critical immune components (NF Kappa B and Toll-like receptor signaling; Supplementary Table S5). Given this immune enrichment, host transcripts may be directly linked to ASD dysbiosis. This is supported by the finding that four human RNAs and eight microbes cluster based on salivary abundance (Supplementary Figure S2). Some microbes in the panel may contribute to ASD neurobiology through effects on host metabolism [Oenococcus oeni/pyruvate (Wagner et al., 2005); Pasteurella multocida/ammonia (Hamilton et al., 1996)] and gastrointestinal inflammation [Clostridiales (Frank et al., 2007)].
