To test this hypothesis, we compared the nasopharyngeal microbiome of 135 previously healthy infants with acute respiratory infection due to human rhinovirus (HRV; n = 52) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; n = 83). The nasopharyngeal microbiome was assessed by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA. Respiratory viruses were identified by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. We found significant differences in the overall taxonomic composition and abundance of certain bacterial genera between infants infected with HRV and those infected with RSV. Our results suggest that respiratory tract viral infections are associated with different nasopharyngeal microbial profiles.",

The host immune response to respiratory viruses may also depend on the prevalence of certain bacteria [4, 6]. Likewise, the presence of certain bacteria has been associated with a more clinically severe presentation of viral ARIs in some studies and with the development of childhood asthma in others [3, 4]. In view of all these, it has been previously suggested that a virus-specific bacterial profile in the respiratory tract could potentially be characterized [7].",

Furthermore, modifications of the infant respiratory microbiome could be an approach to respiratory morbidity prevention [2]. Because these modifications may be virus specific, better characterizing the changes in the respiratory microbiome after the most common viral ARIs in infancy is important.",

This pattern contrasts with the nasopharyngeal microbiome in healthy infants <6 months of age that we and others have previously described, in which Haemophilus tends to be less common and Staphylococcus is one of the most predominant genera [3, 10, 12, 13]. Interestingly, early-life colonization with Haemophilus influenzae has been associated with a proinflammatory immune response and the development of childhood asthma [4, 6, 14]. In addition, we found differences in the abundance of various bacterial genera, including a higher abundance of Staphylococcus and a trend toward a higher abundance of Haemophilus in RSV-positive infants, and in the overall bacterial composition between infants with HRV and RSV ARIs. Thus, it is possible that virus-specific compositional shifts in the nasopharyngeal microbiome contribute to worse outcomes after early-life ARIs.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the nasopharyngeal microbiome profile of infants with RSV and HRV ARIs, the most common respiratory viral pathogens in early life. Only 1 other study has directly compared the nasopharyngeal microbiome between children with respiratory viruses by using next-generation sequencing [15]. In their study, Hyde et al demonstrated that, in children up to 2 years of age, an increased detection of H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis distinguished children with HRV/RSV coinfection and those with only one of these two respiratory viruses [15]. In line with our findings, they also found that H. influenzae was commonly detected in children with RSV-only ARIs but not in those with HRV-only ARIs. Their study population importantly differs from ours in including older children who were hospitalized with LRTIs, who had prior wheezing, and/or who had a history of prematurity.",

We also acknowledge several limitations. First, the changes in the overall taxonomic composition or in the abundance of bacterial genera may have preceded the viral ARIs. However, other studies have shown that respiratory viruses are indeed capable of causing alterations in the composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiome [1, 3]. Second, the changes we observed could be the result of residual confounding from measured (eg, postnatal exposure to antibiotics or ARI severity) or unmeasured (eg, coinfection with other respiratory viruses or certain immunizations) variables. We conducted several exploratory analyses to assess the potential confounding effect of measured variables, obtaining similar results to those of our main analysis, which makes this unlikely. Last, we were unable to analyze the different bacteria below the genus level and therefore were unable to identify specific species associated with HRV or RSV ARIs. Despite these limitations, our study adds to the small but increasing literature on the interactions between respiratory viruses and the development and modification of the infant respiratory microbiome.",
