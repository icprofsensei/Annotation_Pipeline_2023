Fungi are important constituents of the mucosa and respiratory tract, but fewer culture-independent datasets regarding these organisms are available. Whether there are resident fungal communities in the respiratory tract of most individuals is unknown. The lung has a microbiome that shifts in health and disease (1\u20133). Complex microbial communities affect human physiology, shape the immune response (4), and may play an important role in lung diseases (1, 2). Studies of the lung microbiome are at an early stage, and most attention has focused on bacterial communities; however, the mycobiome\u2014referring primarily to the fungal biota in a habitat\u2014is also an important component of the human microbiome (5). Findings regarding the lung mycobiome have been reported for a small number of individuals after lung transplantation and in individuals with cystic fibrosis (1, 2). Whether a distinct lung mycobiome exists in immunocompetent hosts without accompanying lung disease is currently unknown. Alterations associated with immunosuppression or lung diseases have also not been explored in depth.",

Causes of COPD in HIV are poorly understood. Although smoking is clearly important, it is not the only risk. We see pulmonary function abnormalities in never smokers and in animal models without smoke exposure, and HIV is an independent risk factor for COPD (6\u201310). Although there may be common pathways involved in COPD in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals, underlying triggers of these pathways may differ. It is likely, given the multiple microorganisms already implicated in COPD pathogenesis in the HIV-uninfected population, that microbial populations may be related to development of COPD in this immunocompromised population. Fungal communities in the respiratory tract of HIV-infected individuals with and without COPD have not been examined using next-generation sequencing techniques. Given the increased susceptibility to fungal infection seen in HIV, it is possible that alterations in these communities are related to pulmonary disease.",

The genus Candida, represented by more than 90% of the ITS reads, was clearly dominant in OW compared with BAL (Figure 1B). There was also a higher prevalence of Candida in IS as compared with BAL (Figure 1D). Conversely, there were fungal species that were predominant in BAL as compared with OW (Figure 1B), including Ceriporia lacerata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Penicillium brevicompactum. These organisms have been reported to cause opportunistic lung infection (28\u201330), demonstrating that they may be present in the lungs as commensals. None of these species were detected in the corresponding bronchoscopic control samples, indicating that environmental contamination is an unlikely explanation for their overrepresentation in BAL.",

This model examines whether distribution of organisms in the lung results from dispersal from the mouth or from active environmental selection in the lungs (3, 31). We identified organisms overrepresented in BAL (Figure 2A) and IS (Figure 3A) by using 95% binomial confidence intervals as the criteria. Although most OTUs were shared between oral and lung communities (falling between the 95% confidence intervals in the neutral model), 39 fungal species were disproportionately more abundant (falling outside the upper confidence interval) in the BAL and 203 species in the IS, as compared with the OW (see Table E1).",

Using our three statistical methods (random forest, logistic regression, and metastats), nine species were overrepresented in BAL of HIV-infected individuals as compared with HIV-uninfected individuals (Pneumocystis jirovecii, Junghuhnia nitida, Phlebia tremellosa, Oxyporus latemarginatus, Sebacina incrustans, Ceriporia lacerata, Pezizella discrete, Trametes hirsute, and Daedaleopsis confragosa) (Figure 2B). We also looked at the impact of degree of immunosuppression within the HIV-infected individuals. Two species were associated with a CD4 less than 500 cells per microliter, compared with those with CD4 cell counts greater than 500 cells per microliter: Zasmidium nocoxi and Teratosphaeria jonkershoekensis (see Figure E2A).

Because cumulative pack-years smoking is a well-established risk factor for COPD and showed a nonsignificant trend to be higher in HIV-infected individuals with COPD, we excluded its direct effects on mycobiome composition by running statistical methods twice with and without the features of pack-years included, and only kept those fungal species that were selected in both models as those that were associated with COPD in HIV infection exclusively. Logistic regression failed to identify any species associated with COPD in the HIV-infected cohort as compared with HIV-infected individuals with normal lung function. Random forest and metastats overlapped in the identification of 12 species (S. incrustans, J. nitida, P. jirovecii, Phlebia setulosa, Glomus mosseae, Lachnum rhytismatis, Hydnobolites cerebriformis, Rhizoscyphus ericae, Z. nocoxi, C. lacerata, Steccherinum ochraceum, and Phaeophleospora eugeniae) (Figure 2C). As in the analyses of HIV infection, species of interest were not detected in bronchoscopic control samples, and Pneumocystis was confirmed by PCR.",

Lung function, however, did seem to be associated with six fungal species, based on the two successful statistical analyses used both with and without adjustment for pack-years (Figure 3C). Among these species, Exophiala oligosperma has been reported in immunocompromised patients with respiratory disorders (34). Low CD4 cell count (see Figure E2C) had no associated species, whereas marijuana use (see Figure E2D) had two associated species (Clavispoa lusitaniae and E. oligosperma).",

We also found that fungal communities in the lung resembled those in the mouth, which may also occur from microaspiration that occurs even in an immunocompetent host without accompanying lung disease. The overlap seen in this study could be caused, at least in part, by contamination during bronchoscopy when the instrument passes through the oral cavity to the bronchi, or by detection of lung organisms in the mouth that arise via coughing or exhalation. The neutral model clearly indicates that there are also organisms overrepresented in the lung compared with the mouth, and detection of organisms, such as P. jirovecii, a known lung pathogen not part of the oral flora, provides strong evidence that a mycobiome specific to the lung does indeed exist.",

In our mycobiome study, two fungal species that were overrepresented in HIV were known lung pathogens associated with immunosuppression (P. jirovecii and C. lacerata) (28, 37). Pneumocystis is a leading cause of pneumonia in HIV-infected and other immunocompromised individuals (38), and low levels of the organism have previously been detected in the respiratory tract of HIV-infected individuals using targeted PCR (39).

COPD is an important cause of respiratory impairment in HIV-infected persons, and HIV infection is an independent risk factor for COPD (6, 13, 40). Pulmonary infections could stimulate replication of HIV in the lungs, augment pulmonary inflammation, and cause lung destruction by release of proteases, thereby leading to or worsening COPD (41). Previous studies examined the bacterial lung microbiome in HIV-uninfected individuals with advanced COPD and found profound changes in the microbiome associated with lung dysfunction (42, 43). No previous studies have examined the role of the microbiome or mycobiome in HIV-associated COPD. We postulated that the respiratory mycobiome in COPD may play a role in HIV-associated COPD given the increased susceptibility to fungal infection seen even in treated HIV.",

Pneumocystis detection was previously reported in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals with COPD in studies using PCR (21, 39, 44). Pneumocystis also results in COPD-like changes in rodent and nonhuman primate models (8, 45). Pneumocystis colonization has been postulated to contribute to COPD by stimulating inflammation and release of matrix metalloproteases, which can damage the lung (8, 39). The current findings, using novel technology and analysis methods, provide additional support of the role of Pneumocystis in HIV-associated COPD.",

C. lacerata, for example, now known to be an opportunist basidiomycete causing pneumonia, was once regarded solely as an agent of white rot on wood (28), and plant pathogenic fungi, such as Aspergillus flavus, can result in a life-threatening infection in animals, including humans (46).",

Interestingly, we found that IS shared little similarity with BAL. Even when we performed this analysis with our entire cohort including HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals with and without COPD, we observe the same distribution pattern. These data demonstrate that, although there is some overlap with both the OW and the BAL, IS has a distinct community structure. IS and BAL are collected using different methods and may reflect different features of the lower airways. Sputum induction results in a sample from a larger region of the lung as compared with BAL, which only samples a subsegment. In addition, IS may include material from larger airways than BAL and may contain a higher biomass because it is not diluted by saline. IS may also contain a higher proportion of contamination from the mouth. The question of which sample is most appropriate for use depends on the question to be answered, but the samples do not seem to be interchangeable.",

                    "text": "We detected fewer fungal reads and fewer fungal genera in the 18S data compared with the ITS data. The eukaryotic rRNA gene consists of 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal subunits, separated by two ITSs, named ITS1 and ITS2. Both 18S and ITS can be used for sequencing of fungi (5). The 18S rRNA gene is more conserved across different fungal species and is thus used for determination of phylogenetic distance between OTUs, whereas the ITS region is more diverse across species and used for assignments at lower taxonomic levels (19, 47). We performed amplification of both genes to maximize strengths of each method. The 18S rRNA gene gave higher PCR-positive rates, but fewer fungal reads compared with the ITS, because the 18S primers cross-react with host rRNA even though they were designed with mismatches at the 3\u2032 end (19). Consequently, approximately 90% of the raw 18S sequencing reads were human. Considering the high conservation of the 18S rRNA gene in Eukaryota, this high proportion is not surprising. Human 18S reads thus reduced the sequencing depth of fungal 18S reads.",

We could not determine the causal role of alterations in lung fungal communities in development of HIV-associated COPD, but prior animal studies have shown that Pneumocystis colonization results in COPD-like changes in both an HIV-like nonhuman primate model and in an immunocompetent, smoke-exposed rodent model (8, 45). Differences between the populations could have affected our results, although we took steps to minimize these differences. For example, we excluded individuals with other chronic comorbidities or who were currently using antibiotics, and adjusted for smoking history. Also, the data on smoking status and marijuana use are based on patient self-report, which can have a recall bias or self-report bias. Although it would be interesting to compare results of culture techniques with the current findings, we were unable to do so. In addition, many organisms, such as Pneumocystis, have no established culture system and can only be identified through sequencing, thus we are unable to confirm viability of the organisms detected. We also were unable to compare bacterial and fungal communities in the lung because of the low number of fungi common to both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals. Finally, although we took steps to minimize contamination in sample collection and to exclude contaminants in analyses, it is possible that some of the species detected represent environmental contamination, although they did not match control samples.",
