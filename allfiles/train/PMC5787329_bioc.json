These 60 patients were distributed randomly (with allocation ratio 1:1) using randomized block procedure to one of four treatment orders (A, B, C, or D) by a computer-generated allocation schedule (Random Allocation Software) in which A was specified as the butyrate group, B was given to the inulin group, C was the inulin + butyrate group, and D was appointed as the placebo group. Fifteen patients were in each group. Group A took 6 capsules of 100 mg NaBut (BodyBio, USA) and 10 g/d of starch powder as placebo. Each capsule was consumed before and after each meal 6 times per day as recommended by the manufacturer. Ten grams of inulin powder was divided as 2 sachets containing five grams in each. Group B consumed 10 g/d of HP inulin supplement powder (Sensus, Borchwef 3, 4704 RG Roosendaal the Netherlands) as well as six starch capsules as placebo. Group C was appointed to the concomitant use of NaBut capsules and HP inulin powder (10 g of inulin powder + six capsules of sodium butyrate), while group D (control group) received six 100 mg starch capsules as well as 10 g of starch powder as placebo which were matched to study supplements in terms of color and size. All the participants consumed allocated supplements for 45 consecutive days. A local physician carried out randomization of the participants between groups. After the provision of supplements, the physician had no relationship with the study patients or involvement in other study processes. Based on consumed medical drugs (glucose lowering and anti- hyperlipidemia drugs) and disease duration all the patients were classified in the study. All of the patients were inquired to maintain their previous habitual lifestyle, physical activity, and dietary intake during the intervention. A health center staff member called on each patient weekly to minimize their withdrawal and certify the consumption of the supplements. All subjects were visited every 15 days during the trial period.\n",
