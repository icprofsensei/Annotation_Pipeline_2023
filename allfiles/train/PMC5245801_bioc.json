In addition to a direct connection via the vagus nerve, it may be possible that gut bacteria interact with the brain through production of neurotransmitters, hormones, and other metabolites [5].",

Numerous studies in animal models have documented behavioral changes following manipulation of the intestinal microbiota, including effects on behavior associated with stress [6], anxiety [1, 7\u20139], and depression [5, 10]. Validating animal models of the enteric microbe-gut-brain axis in human populations has reported modest associations and has been limited by small sample sizes and lack of consistency in assessment of psychiatric and microbial outcome measures. Although underpowered, these studies in human cohorts suggest a potential role for the intestinal microbiota in anxiety, depression, stress, cognitive reactivity, and eating disorders [11\u201315].",

Our goal, therefore, was to determine whether the associations between the intestinal microbiota and psychological measures hold across the spectrum of severity of our target psychological dimensions in healthy individuals.

Forward and reverse primers incorporated single-nucleotide phase shifts of six different lengths each, to improve the quality of the sequence data generated.

Purification of PCR products was carried out after each amplification using the HighPrep PCR clean-up kit (MagBio, Lausanne, Switzerland) with a DynaMag-96 side magnet (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Equimolar 16S rRNA PCR products were then quantified and pooled for sequencing. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq desktop sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA) by the High-Throughput Sequencing Facility in the Carolina Center for Genome Sciences at the UNC School of Medicine.

In brief, the participants had a mean (SD) age of 29.0 (7.9) years and were within the normal or healthy weight range for adults [41]. On average, their scores indicate normal or minimal levels of anxiety (BAI), depression (BDI), and stress (PSS) and are in line with, or lower than, those of similar non-clinical samples [18, 42\u201344].

Seminal work by Sudo et al. (2004) on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity showed that GF mice have exaggerated stress response when compared to conventionally raised mice [6]. GF mice also have reduced anxiety-like behavior compared to conventional mice [1, 7\u20139], which can be reversed via early-life colonization with intestinal bacteria [1, 7]. Anxiety-like behavior can also be increased in mice with pathogenic infection [58\u201360] or transferred between mice with a characteristic anxiety phenotype and non-anxious GF mice using microbial transfer [61]. Probiotic formulations, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium infantis, have been shown in animal models to reduce depressive and anxiety-like behavior at effect sizes similar to antidepressant treatment [5, 10], and prebiotic human milk oligosaccharides may reduce stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and stimulate changes in microbial diversity [62]. Furthermore, using GF mice, it has recently been discovered that the intestinal microbiota is necessary for appropriate and dynamic regulation of myelin-related genes [63]. Altogether, these findings, together with ours, suggest that changes within the intestinal microbiota may be of central importance to the development or maintenance of depression and anxiety\u2014but that the effects are only observed in more extreme expressions of the traits.",

Mixed evidence has emerged from investigations comparing the intestinal microbiotas of individuals with major depressive disorder to healthy controls, with one study failing to find significant between-group differences in microbial diversity or taxonomic composition [64], while the other found increased diversity and significant taxonomic differences at the phylum, family, and genus levels [11]. In patients with acute anorexia nervosa, which is frequently comorbid with depression, work from our laboratory has shown that microbial diversity was both associated with depression and significantly lower than in healthy controls [12]. Composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota may also be associated with temperament in young children, but how such links may evolve during the development of adult personality is unclear [65].",

Studies have reported improvement in measures of depression, anxiety, cognitive reactivity, and stress levels in healthy volunteers after placebo-controlled supplementation trials of prebiotic or probiotic formulas [13\u201315], but these supplements may not be associated with observable compositional changes to the intestinal microbiota. As probiotic supplementation has been found to have little effect on the composition of the intestinal microbiota, changes in mood or behavior may be mediated by the metatranscriptome (i.e., functional activity of enteric microbes) rather than the intestinal microbiota community composition [66, 67].",

Another ongoing randomized controlled trial is examining the potential benefit of minocycline (a tetracycline antibiotic) treatment as an adjunctive treatment for individuals with moderate to severe depression [68]. Yet because these intervention studies use microbial strains that are not permanent members of the enteric microbiota, it is possible that any evidence of behavioral change is not due to changes to the intestinal microbiota but rather more direct mechanisms of action.",

Our goal was to see if this phenomenon translates to subthreshold psychological variation in healthy individuals. This would inform us as to whether the link between enteric microbial communities and behavior is found in all individuals\u2014across the full spectrum of a trait (e.g., depression/anxiety)\u2014or is only detectable in individuals at the extreme end of the distribution such as those suffer from a psychiatric illness. To this end, we designed this study explicitly to investigate the relationship between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and continuous measures of psychological traits in healthy individuals. Our findings are in line with an emerging trend in microbiome research: little taxonomic association with healthy variation. Associations between microbial composition and diversity and a wide range of variables reflecting anthropometry, lifestyle, diet, disease, and medication were recently examined in two large European cohorts (Flemish Gut Flora Project: n = 1106; Dutch Lifelines-DEEP: n = 1135). In addition to the high levels of inter-individual variation reported, findings suggest that, while many factors may be associated with microbial variation, any individual factor would have a very modest effect size [56, 57]. These papers did not measure psychiatric variables as broadly or deeply as we did, in which we have demonstrated that effect sizes for healthy cohorts with regard to psychological measures are likely also very small.",

With respect to psychopathology, our sample was, on average, healthier than other non-clinical samples of young adults and had less variability on psychiatric measures than would have been expected. As such, restriction of range on psychiatric measures may have played a role in the lack of significant associations with microbial markers. In addition, our analysis focused on taxonomic and diversity measures of 16S rRNA sequencing data, which describes microbial composition but does not account for metabolic activity or functional impact of intestinal bacteria. We may have seen different results with RNA-seq or whole-genome metagenomic shotgun sequencing, longitudinal sampling, or had we analyzed microbial communities from intestinal biopsies. Our sample comprised adult females (age range: 19\u201350 years), which may differ with respect to these outcome measures from adult males or individuals in younger or older age brackets. Additionally, we excluded participants who had undergone any GI surgery with the exception of appendectomy or cholecystectomy. Recent studies reporting the influence of the appendix and bile acids and salts on the composition of the intestinal microbiota highlight the limitation of including of these surgeries in our study [69, 70]. As we are unable to determine what proportion of our study population had undergone an appendectomy or cholecystectomy, we cannot predict the effect of these surgeries on our results. However, given the relatively low population base rate of these surgeries, and given that our study does not report any significant associations, we believe that excluding subjects with these surgeries would not impact our results or conclusions. Lastly, our study did not take into account that diet or food allergies may influence our observations. Indeed, associations between the enteric microbiota and food intolerance have been reported [71] and changes in diet can alter the composition of this complex community of microorganisms within 24 hours [72].",
