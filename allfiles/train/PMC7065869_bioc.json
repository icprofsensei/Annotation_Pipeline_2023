Recently, more evidence suggests that eosinophils play an important role in some patients with COPD and eosinophilic COPD is recognized as a distinct phenotype of the disease.[2] High numbers of eosinophils reportedly appear in up to 28% of cases of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD).[3] Compared with COPD cases with low numbers of eosinophils, the eosinophilic phenotype of COPD has several unique features.[2] Patients with eosinophilic inflammation have fewer allergies although exacerbations are more frequent. Most importantly, eosinophilic COPD responds best to corticosteroid treatments.[4\u20136] While inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) can increase the risk of pneumonia in non-eosinophilic COPD,[7] patients with eosinophilic COPD show better improvement according to the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)[8] and a shorter hospitalization time after using corticosteroids.[9] The long-term use of ICSs has also been shown to significantly decrease exacerbation frequency in eosinophilic stable COPD.[10]",

The levels of inflammatory mediators (interleukin [IL]-8 and IL-6) in the plasma before and after treatment were also analyzed to determine the effects of treatment. In addition, the corticosteroid sensitivity of patients with AECOPD was quantified in vitro using isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to study the degree of IL-8 inhibition produced by increasing concentrations of dexamethasone (Dex). We hypothesized that differences in the induced sputum microbiota are associated with the amount of blood eosinophils and responsiveness to ICSs treatment.",

An equal volume of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) buffer (Solebao) with DTT was then added into the sputum. The mixture was filtered by a nylon gauze (74\u200a\u03bcm). The filtered samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10\u200amin. Then the cells were resuspended in PBS buffer and were made into the sputum smear. They were stained by the Wright's Giemsa method (Reagan, Beijing, China). Finally, total and differential counts of inflammatory cells were performed under an optical microscope, and the percentages of neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes were calculated. The quality of induced sputum was assessed by sputum smear. Samples were considered unqualified if the squamous epithelial cells were >20%. The remaining sputum samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C within 1\u200ah of collection until further processing.",

Bacterial and viral infections are common triggers for AECOPD. Reportedly over 50% of acute exacerbations are caused by bacterial pathogens and around 25% are caused by viral infections.[34] The bacterial population in the lung is found to be closely related to the use of antibiotics and corticosteroids, as well as clinical factors and eosinophilic airway inflammation.[14\u201316,21] However, most prior studies have relied on culture-based methods to identify the pathogenic bacteria.[35] Modern sequencing techniques allow more detailed studies on the microbiome diversity and composition.",

This was similar to previous studies showing that microbiome diversity decreased during acute exacerbations and increased during stable periods.[16,20] The decrease in diversity during acute exacerbations may be related to the accumulation of certain dominant pathogenic bacteria, which inhibit the growth of other bacteria. Treatment increased microbiome diversity by decreasing the amount of pathogenic bacteria and restoring the lung microbiome to a stable state.",

A decrease in the microbial richness reflects a decrease in the total bacterial load. The microbiome composition also changed in both groups. In the Eos group, the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria increased after treatment whereas Acidobateria and Chloroflexi decreased. In the Noneos group, only Fusobacteria increased, and the relative abundances of Acidobateria and Chloroflexi were higher than those in the Eos group. These changes in eosinophilic patients may be relevant to disease recovery.",

The different patterns of airway microbiota and their reaction to treatment between the Eos and Noneos group further suggest the implication of these mechanisms in the pathogenesis of the disease. In the present study, the microbial diversity increased in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic patients following treatment, while the microbial richness and relative abundance of Bacteroidetes increased only in the eosinophilic patients. This suggests that the eosinophilic patients were more responsive to treatment and may recover more rapidly than patients with non-eosinophilic AECOPD.",

Increased airway and systemic inflammation with increased neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils are characteristics of AECOPD.[33] Inflammatory mediators such as IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are also significantly increased in AECOPD. IL-8 is a chemokine produced by macrophages and other cell types such as epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. High levels of IL-8 can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage. A study by Zhang and Bai[38] found that the level of IL-8 increase in patients with AECOPD was closely associated with increase in blood eosinophils. In the present study, levels of inflammatory mediators, including IL-8 and IL-6, were found to decrease more significantly in eosinophilic patients than non-eosinophilic patients under similar treatment according to the AECOPD treatment guideline. It appears that the degree of inflammation is more easily controlled in eosinophilic patients than non-eosinophilic ones following similar treatments.",

Studies have found that glucocorticoids can produce an inhibitory effect on neutrophil apoptosis, while accelerating eosinophil apoptosis under in vitro conditions,[45] thereby reducing eosinophil-associated inflammation in the airways. In the present study, PBMCs were isolated from patients with AECOPD and their IC50-Dex for IL-8 inhibition was determined as a marker for corticosteroid sensitivity in vitro. The percentage of inhibition of IL-8 following Dex treatment was found to be significantly higher in the Eos group compared to the Noneos group, which confirms the results from previous studies showing that eosinophilic patients are more sensitive to glucocorticoids.[4\u20136]",

The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria increased after treatment in the eosinophilic patients whereas Acidobateria and Chloroflexi decreased.
