Until recently, the diversity of the cutaneous microbiota was mainly investigated for bacteria through culture based assays subsequently confirmed by molecular techniques. There are now many evidences that viruses represent a significant part of the cutaneous flora as demonstrated by the asymptomatic carriage of beta and gamma-human papillomaviruses on the healthy skin. Furthermore, it has been recently suggested that some representatives of the Polyomavirus genus might share a similar feature. In the present study, the cutaneous virome of the surface of the normal-appearing skin from five healthy individuals and one patient with Merkel cell carcinoma was investigated through a high throughput metagenomic sequencing approach in an attempt to provide a thorough description of the cutaneous flora, with a particular focus on its viral component. The results emphasize the high diversity of the viral cutaneous flora with multiple polyomaviruses, papillomaviruses and circoviruses being detected on normal-appearing skin. Moreover, this approach resulted in the identification of new Papillomavirus and Circovirus genomes and confirmed a very low level of genetic diversity within human polyomavirus species. Although viruses are generally considered as pathogen agents, our findings support the existence of a complex viral flora present at the surface of healthy-appearing human skin in various individuals. The dynamics and anatomical variations of this skin virome and its variations according to pathological conditions remain to be further studied. The potential involvement of these viruses, alone or in combination, in skin proliferative disorders and oncogenesis is another crucial issue to be elucidated.",

                    "text": "Skin represents the main barrier between external, potentially aggressive agents and inner, more vulnerable structures. Apart from the physical protection based on epidermis cohesion and more particularly to its cornified layer, the presence of a complex ecosystem plays a well-documented role in preventing adherence and invasion by either bacterial or fungal virulent agents through biological competition and occupation of favorable ecological positions. Indeed, skin harbors various physiological populations of micro-organisms including commensal or symbiotic bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, overall known as skin microbiota [1]. Numerous non pathogenic skin bacteria were historically described through culture isolation methods and the wide diversity of this cutaneous flora was recently confirmed by molecular approaches [2]. More specifically, the complexity of the skin bacterial microbiota was mostly analyzed through deep sequence analysis of the universal 16S small subunit ribosomal gene in procaryotes. Conversely, the skin viral microbiota was more rarely investigated partly because most skin-associated viruses are not cultivable and do not display such consensus sequences that can be targeted by high input molecular methods. There is now a growing corpus of evidence that healthy-looking human skin also harbors resident or transient viruses. The validity of this concept was extensively demonstrated for cutaneous beta and gamma human papillomaviruses (\u03b2 and \u03b3-HPVs) that are commonly present on the superficial layers of the skin in most individuals [3]\u2013[5]. Indeed, in this setting, several studies have reported the genetic diversity of cutaneous human papillomaviruses using consensus PCR targeting L1 gene [6] or more recently through sequencing rolling circle products [7], [8]. Furthermore, functional metagenomic methods were recently applied to cutaneous samples and led to the description of new human virus species belonging to the Polyomaviridae family. One of the most striking illustrations of these findings is the recent identification of the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), primarily isolated from an aggressive neuro-endocrine skin tumor [9], [10], the Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), but subsequently detected on the skin surface of most healthy individuals, as well as on normal or pathological skin of patients with benign or non\u2013MCC malignant skin conditions, thus raising the question of its genuine involvement in skin oncogenesis [11]\u2013[13]. More recently, two additional representatives of the human polyomavirus (HPyV) genus, named HPyV6 and HPyV7, were identified on the skin surface of healthy individuals [12].",

In three samples (100067, 100069 and 100070), sequences previously reported from environmental metagenome studies were detected. The relative proportion of bacterial sequences according to their phyla taxonomy is displayed for each sample in Figure S1.",

Bacterial microbiome studies were mostly based on 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomics since the 16S rRNA gene contains both consensus regions targeted by PCR and variable regions allowing direct taxonomic assignment whenever possible and phylogenetic studies if required. In the present study, in order to characterize the skin viral microbiota, HTS, a highly comprehensive method based on random sequencing of the entire DNA present in a given sample was applied to superficial skin samples collected by cutaneous swabbing. This method was previously successfully used for studying environmental media, intestinal microbiota and, more recently, human blood samples [19]\u2013[22]. However, HTS requires large amounts of DNA and comprehensive reference genome sequences for microbial populations, a prerequisite that might raise some concern regarding its application to skin samples. In our study, difficulties regarding the template DNA amount in skin swab samples were circumvented by a first round of whole genome amplification using multiple displacement amplification (MDA), a technique known for its ability to introduce low bias for linear DNA amplification [23]. Nervertheless, this method may favor the amplification of circular molecules which might have led to an overestimated proportion of circular DNA genomes (Polyomaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Circoviridae) as illustrated by the high proportion of eucaryotic viral sequences detected in the two samples 100066 and 100069. Eventually, sequences analysis was restrained to taxonomic assignment with no attempt to obtain any data regarding functional analysis. Also, the contribution of each species was not corrected by genome sizes: such standardization would have lowered by several orders of magnitude the contribution of bacterial species compared to viral species. Thus, comparison of frequencies should be made within bacteria or viruses.",

Indeed, most of the bacterial sequences belonged to four dominant phyla, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Previous molecular analysis of the skin bacterial microbiota have emphasized that bacterial diversity depends on the body site with additional interpersonal and temporal variability [24]. More specifically, surface areas could be divided in dry, moist or sebaceous environments regarding skin physiology and it was demonstrated that these conditions are likely to influence the composition of the bacterial microbiome [25]. In our study, inter-individual variations are obvious when considering the relative proportion of bacterial sequences within the 6 skin samples tested (Fig S1). The samples were all collected from the face of the patients, which can be considered as a sebaceous environment, and Propionibacterium and Corynebacterium spp (Actinobacteria)-related sequences, theoretically expected in such an environment, were indeed detected. Additionally, our study identified numerous sequences from Staphylococcus spp and Streptococcus spp (Firmicutes) and Proteobacteria phylum that are more likely to be found in dry and moist skin environments respectively [18], [24]. This discrepancy may be explained by technical limitations of 16S rRNA studies with variable performances according to the phyla under scope whereas HTS metagenomic randomly targets all genomic material with a higher sensitivity and is probably less liable to such variations. In addition, the domination of the 16S based criteria in bacterial taxonomy compared to other molecular characters to date less represented in databases may also contribute to this observed discrepancy.",

These concepts are supported by our study in which many reads corresponded to Malasseziales species whereas Saccharomycetales related reads were rare.",

Conversely, our results suggest that archaea sequences can be detected on skin surface although the low number of reads raise concerns about the relevancy of these data that need to be confirmed by further investigations. Alternatively, since superficial skin is permanently exposed to surrounding environments as illustrated by the detection of numerous reads related to sequences previously reported from environmental metagenomic studies, we could not rule out contamination by environmental sequences or DNA present in the reagents. Interestingly, sequences from Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp species that are in our experience common contaminants of our pipeline did not contribute significantly to the results, most likely because of the abundance of the skin microbiome.",

First, the initial DNA enrichment step through phi29 MDA might have favored amplification of circular DNA genome as suggested by the recovery of some plasmid sequence.

Indeed, the presence of resident HPVs on normal skin was reported for both Beta- and Gammapapillomaviruses [27], [28]. Our results confirm these data and provide evidence for an asymptomatic carriage of numerous HPV strains (up to 17) on each individual skin sample. This skin carriage may reflect a viral shedding from cutaneous micro-reservoirs that might be hair bulbs, since such high prevalence and multiplicity was mainly described in forehead hair bulb studies [29]. Furthermore, we identified 13 new Gamma-HPV strains including 9 strains for which the whole genome sequence was further confirmed by the Sanger method allowing the description of 6 new HPV species (Fig. 3). This suggests that the diversity of the resident cutaneous gamma-HPV group might be actually larger than previously described [30]. Chronic asymptomatic shedding of HPVs from skin surface is a well-known feature and most of these viruses are considered as innocent bystanders with no significant tissular damages resulting from their replication which is mainly supported by keratinocytes differentiation.",

Such a viral ecosystem was suggested by previous reports on MCPyV, HPyV6 and HPyV7 [12], [13] but no systematic metagenomic study was carried out with high performance methods on normal-appearing skin. In the present study, a correlation was observed between the amount of reads and the MCPyV viral load (evaluated by qPCR in original samples), as illustrated by the relative coverage rates of assembled whole genomes from the six skin samples under scope (Fig. 2). This observation supports the concept of metagenomic approaches being broader and at least as sensitive as specific target amplification and allowing an exhaustive coverage if the corresponding sequences are present at sufficient levels [31]. Of note, these results were obtained with a mean depth per sample of 8.6\u00d7106 reads, which is far lower than the depth currently permitted by the improvements of Illumina technology that can reach 108 reads. Whole genome comparison of the six MCPyV strains described in our study revealed high sequence similarities to each others and the strain derived from the healthy skin of the MCC patient did not present any specific characteristic. Furthermore no genomic mutation nor deletion were identified suggesting the likely episomal nature of the viral sequences detected in all cases.",

As for MCPyV, full genome sequences of HPyV6 and HPyV7 identified in this study only demonstrated minor single nucleotide polymorphisms when compared to published data.

Skin bacterial populations are either transient or symbiotic and are likely to provide protection against more virulent organisms, thus resulting in a function of surrogate immune sentinel. A similar function of skin viral microbiota may be hypothesized but warrants to be further investigated. Indeed, resident viruses may act protectively against other bacterial, fungal or viral pathogens through either direct (phages) or indirect (by maintaining a high level of efficiency of skin immune cells) pathways. Similarly, the influence of disturbances in skin bacterial and fungal populations has been emphasized in skin disorders involving local skin immune system dysregulation including seborrheic dermatitis, acne, atopic dermatitis, or psoriasis [36], [37], and the influence of such variations of the viral flora on skin homeostasis and alterations may also be worth considering. Although most cutaneous HPVs and the more recently identified cutaneous HPyVs can be considered as resident symbiotic organisms on normal skin, some of them are associated with skin diseases like HPV5 or HPV8 or HPV50 involved in epidermodysplasia verruciformis or squamous cell carcinoma [38]. Also, numerous HPVs and MCPyV are associated to pre-malignant and malignant skin conditions in immunocompromised as well as in immunocompetent patients [39], [40]. The hypothesis of the viral skin flora being affected by the immune status of the host is consistent with our experimental data featuring a higher viral diversity of both HPV and HPyV species in the patient with MCC, a rare malignancy mostly affecting elderly and immunocompromised populations [41]. Indeed, despite the limited number of cases under scope precluding any statistical analysis, 17 different HPV strains as well as most of the HPyVs previously suspected to have a cutaneous tropism (MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7 and HPyV9 ) were identified only on the MCC patient's skin, suggesting that the relationship between skin conditions and/or immunologic status on one hand and the skin virome composition on the other hand should be further investigated.",

Despite a limited number of patients under scope, it demonstrated an unexpected high diversity of DNA viruses on the normal appearing skin with a large interpersonal variability. These viruses are represented essentially by various species of betapapillomaviruses and gammapapillomaviruses, polyomaviruses and circoviruses. Although viruses are generally considered as pathogen agents, our findings highlight the complex viral flora at the surface of the non pathological skin of all individuals. The dynamics and anatomical variations of the skin viroma and their potential variations according to pathological conditions remain to be further studied. It should be also investigated if these viruses, alone or in combination, could represent potential triggers of skin cell proliferation and oncogenesis.",

These skin specimens were initially obtained in spring 2009 to compare MCPyV strains detected on the normal skin from healthy subjects and a patient with MCC [11]. Swabs were suspended in 400 \u00b5L of phosphate buffer. DNA was extracted from 300 \u00b5L of this suspension with an automatic EasyMag apparatus (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France) and amplified by the bacteriophage phi29 polymerase based multiple displacement amplification (MDA) assay using random primers.

The comparison of the single reads and contigs to already known genomic and taxonomic data was done on the generalist nucleotidic (nt) and proteic (nr) databases maintained locally. The aforementioned databases were scanned using the BlastN and BlastX algorithms provided by Paracel Blast (Striking Development), a software capable of executing searches on multiple non-shared-memory processors simultaneously. Binning (or taxonomic assignment) was based on the best hit among reads with a significant e-value (generally 10\u22123).",
