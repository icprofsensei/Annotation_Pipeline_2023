In the United States, 23% of children are already overweight or obese when entering kindergarten (2) and maternal obesity is consistently one of the most powerful predictors of pediatric obesity (3). There is abundant evidence that the microbiome has multiple effects on the physiology and immunology of both mothers and infants. Although the founding individual microbiota composition in newborns largely reflects the maternal transfer during birth, the postnatal assembly of the human microbiota plays an important role in resistance to pathogen invasion, immune stimulation, and other important developmental cues early in life (4\u20136). Alterations in intestinal microbiome composition and biodiversity have been correlated with the development of obesity (7, 8), asthma (9), allergies (10), inflammatory bowel disease (11) and, more recently, type 1 diabetes (12). Accumulating evidence suggests that exclusive breastfeeding is protective against pediatric obesity (13). However, the breastfeeding-derived protection against offspring obesity is not universal across all lactating mothers (14) and the mechanisms that account for this protection remain poorly characterized. Although it is well established that the intestinal microbiome of breast- and formula-fed infants differs dramatically, surprisingly little is known about how compositional differences in breast milk affect the development of the early infant gastrointestinal tract.",

These effects include the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) via colonic fermentation and regulation of host genes that regulate intestinal permeability, energy retention, and autoimmunity (15). In addition, hormones derived from HM, such as leptin and insulin, retain biological activity in the infant gastrointestinal tract and may be important additional factors that contribute to intestinal barrier function and the development of the intestinal mucosa, as well as the colonization patterns of the infant intestinal microbiome (16\u201318). Existing evidence shows that the probiotic and hormonal content of HM is correlated with maternal intestinal microbe colonization patterns (19) and differs between normal-weight (NW) and obese women (20); however, there is limited information that describes how HM leptin and insulin influence the development of the infant intestinal microbiome.",

All aspects of this study were approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board, and the study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01693406. Women were excluded if they had type 1 or type 2 diabetes, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, or a planned cesarean delivery, or if they or their infants were prescribed antibiotics in the 2 wk after birth. Nevertheless, 1 mother in this study gave birth via cesarean delivery; this infant was included in the study and tables given that our sensitivity analyses showed that the results were not altered when this infant was dropped from the analyses. This study included only mothers with a prepregnancy BMI (in kg/m2) <25 for the NW group and >30 for the obese group on the basis of self-reported prepregnancy weight. Study personnel visited mothers in the hospital within 48 h of delivery. Infant sex, birth weight, and mode of delivery were obtained from medical records. At 2 wk postpartum, participants traveled to Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado (Aurora, Colorado) for a clinic visit during morning hours, and mothers fasted from midnight the previous night. At these visits, maternal height and weight were measured and venous blood and HM samples (detailed below) were collected. Infant weight was obtained and the percentage body fat was measured in duplicate by air-displacement plethysmography (PEA POD; COSMED).",

Breastfeeding exclusivity was calculated as the percentage of feedings during the previous 7 d that consisted of breast milk. At this time, a midfeeding breast-milk sample was collected from mothers in a fasted state. In short, approximately halfway through a feeding (on the basis of normal feeding time and maternal sensation of milk removal and breast softening), the infant was removed, the nipple and areola were wiped clean by using a sterile gauze pad soaked in sterile water, and \u223c20 mL was expressed by using a One-Hand Manual Breast Pump (Ameda). Milk was immediately placed on ice and transported back to the laboratory. Skim milk was generated by spinning milk at 10,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. Aliquots of skim and whole milk were then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. The percentage of milk fat was measured by creamatocrit with the use of digital calipers, and fat (g/L) was estimated by using the following approximation: kcal/L = 290 + [66.8 \u00d7 creamatocrit (%)] (26). Lactose was measured by enzymatic digestion and colorimetric detection of galactose (BioVision), and protein was measured by a modified version of the Bradford method (27). HM caloric density was calculated as the summation of fat, protein, and lactose assuming 9, 4, and 4 kcal/g, respectively. Leptin was measured in the skim fraction by using a high-sensitivity ELISA (R&D Systems), and insulin was measured in the skim fraction by using a radioimmunoassay (Millipore). Previous studies have shown that leptin may be retained in the lipid layer (28), whereas others have suggested that skim milk preparations are the most stable for HM leptin analyses (29). It is still possible that the leptin concentrations measured in this study were underestimated due to lost leptin in the lipid fraction; however, our skim milk preparation was applied consistently across all samples, allowing us to make valid comparisons within the cohort. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of whole milk was determined by using the TAC Assay Kit (Abcam). Clinical study data were collected and managed with the use of REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Colorado Denver (30).",

On receipt, microbial DNA was extracted from infant fecal samples by using standard protocols and the PowerFecal DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio). Stool samples were also subjected to SCFA extraction by mixing weighed frozen feces with acidified water (pH 2.5) containing 1 mmol ethylbutyric acid/L as an internal standard and sonicated for 10 min then incubated at room temperature for 10 min.

Human sequences were removed by comparison to the Homo sapiens HG19 reference genome, and the remaining sequences were annotated by using the MD5 nonredundant database (36). Results are presented for annotations against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthologous (KO) hierarchy (37). The KO annotations presented in this study are structured according to a directed acyclic graph hierarchy with 4 levels (38). The top level (L1) consists of the following 5 categories: metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processing, and human diseases. The second level (L2) divides the 5 functional categories into finer subcategories. The third level (L3) corresponds directly to the KEGG pathways, and the fourth level (L4) consists of the leaf nodes, which are the functional terms. We mapped KO annotations using the MG-RAST API [http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/api.html (accessed August 2014)]. Sequence annotations were downloaded and analyzed by using the R package \u201cmatR\u201d version 1.0.0 (39).

Consistent with these observations, HM insulin was positively associated with Gammaproteobacteria at the order level (Enterobacteriales, P = 0.04; Supplemental Table 5) and at the family level (Enterobacteriaceae, P = 0.04; Figure 3, Supplemental Table 5).

We next interrogated the L3-level KO annotations significantly associated with concentrations of HM leptin and insulin and identified individual genes (i.e., KO L4) implicated as pediatric biomarkers of gastrointestinal health (47, 48). Specifically, we found that HM leptin and insulin were inversely associated with a protease of unknown catalytic function (K08303) as well as inorganic pyrophosphatase (K01507), a critical regulator of pyruvate metabolism. Figure 5A shows that HM leptin was inversely associated with genes that regulate pyruvate formation, including pyruvate kinase (K00873), acetate kinase (K00925), and enolase (K01689). Similarly, HM insulin (Figure 5B) was inversely associated with genes that regulate pyruvate formation, including formate C-acetyltransferase (K00656). Fecal bacterial protease and pyruvate kinase have previously been implicated as biomarkers of gastrointestinal permeability (48) and inflammation (49). Collectively, these results suggest that early exposure of the offspring to HM leptin and insulin was associated with changes in the metagenomics profile of the infant intestinal microbiome that may promote gastrointestinal barrier function and attenuate intestinal inflammation, as shown in Figure 6.",

The natural transition from a neonatal to a more mature microbiota is governed in part by the induction of Gammaproteobacteria, a dominant class established during the first week of life in newborns that diminishes over time (50). Other studies in infants as young as 12 d of age have suggested that the composition and temporal pattern of the intestinal microbiota were sequentially dominated by Proteobacteria, gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria), and Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides (51), which subsequently give rise to the Bacteroidetes phylum (50, 52). Our cohort fits into this generalized pattern, exhibiting a relatively high abundance of Proteobacteria (>35% in infants born to NW mothers) along with a dominating prevalence of Firmicutes (>40%) at 14 d.",

However, in newborn mice, Gammaproteobacteria are essential for driving early inflammation necessary for protection against excessive inflammatory and autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders later in life (55). Consistent with these findings, the production of LPS by Gammaproteobacteria provides a hormetic stimulation that improves early development and function of innate immune responses (56, 57), sometimes referred to as a \u201cpriming\u201d or \u201ctrained immunity\u201d effect (58). It is intriguing to speculate that an early reduction in this pioneering, hormetic bacteria could contribute to long-term health risks of allergies, autoimmunity, and possibly even the metabolic syndrome in infants born to obese mothers (59).",

HM insulin plays a critical role in normal intestinal development and maturation (18, 62) and can exert direct physiologic effects on the infant via binding with insulin receptors that are localized along the intestinal tract (63). Our data showed that HM insulin at 2 wk of age was independently and positively associated with microbial diversity and the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) and negatively associated with Lactobacillales (Streptococcaceae). The potential mechanism or mechanisms linking HM insulin to infant intestinal microbial colonization patterns, independent of maternal BMI, may include the following: 1) a direct role of insulin to regulate enterocyte maturation (64) and/or 2) the ability of oral insulin to increase glucose concentrations in the gastrointestinal lumen (64, 65). Enterobacteriaceae are a family of glucose metabolizers, which suggests that HM insulin may act as a positive selective force to enhance Gammaproteobacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) colonization. As noted above, our results showed that infants born to obese mothers had reduced concentrations of Gammaproteobacteria, despite the higher concentrations of insulin in HM from obese mothers.",

In addition, TAC in HM is associated with concentrations of HM leptin (68), suggesting that TAC could be involved in microbial colonization due to changes in reactive oxygen species production that selectively control genes in aerobic bacteria (69). Our investigation of TAC activity in HM did not find a significant difference in TAC between NW and obese mothers despite higher concentrations of leptin in HM from obese mothers.",

                    "text": "Our metagenomic analyses showed that HM leptin and insulin were both associated with suppressing genes that encode putative bacterial proteases. Bacterial proteases have been linked to inflammatory bowel disease pathophysiology by increasing intestinal permeability (48), which suggests that HM leptin and insulin may improve intestinal integrity indirectly by negatively regulating bacteria that can increase permeability. Our results also showed that leptin was associated with suppressing gene sets that regulate pyruvate metabolism, including the novel biomarker of intestinal inflammation, pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate kinase is a critical enzyme in the glycolytic pathway that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate and ATP, and fecal pyruvate kinase is a biomarker of low-grade inflammation in pediatric irritable bowel disease (47). The increased SCFA acetate in the stool of infants of obese mothers may also enhance the anti-inflammatory potential in the infant by preventing overgrowth of pH-sensitive pathogenic bacteria (70) and by providing a readily available fuel source for colonocytes (71). Data from humans suggest that systemic SCFAs regulate intestine-derived satiety hormones and lipid metabolism in obesity (72); however, the relevance of such findings in early infant metabolism is largely unknown. Taken together, our metagenomic and SCFA results support a hypothesizedmechanism whereby exposure to leptin and insulin in HM during the first 2 wk of life is associated with improved intestinal barrier function and reduced intestinal inflammation, in part by suppressing pyruvate metabolism, acetate production, and proinflammatory mediators encoded by the infant intestinal microbiome (Figure 6).",

In addition, metagenomic sequencing provided a more in-depth view of the compositional and functional changes in the early infant gastrointestinal tract in exclusively breastfed infants. The limitations of this study include a modest sample size that limited the detail to which we could compare differences in bacterial composition and the number of statistical tests we could perform. In addition, it is possible that our estimates of milk fat and total calories were either an under- or overestimation on the basis of our midfeeding sampling; however, leptin and insulin concentrations in milk do not change over the course of a feeding (73, 74), suggesting our HM insulin and leptin analyses were not affected by our sampling methodology. This study was also cross-sectional in nature and thus long-term implications of differences detected at 2 wk require further investigation. Finally, our analyses did not include measurements of oligosaccharides and other prebiotic and probiotic features of HM that have been shown to contribute to the developing microbiome (75). Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to document that HM insulin and leptin correlate with estimates of neonatal intestinal microflora and colonic fermentation in exclusively breastfed infants. Long-term studies will be necessary to identify whether these early effects on the microbiome contribute to future metabolic and disease risk in infants of mothers with obesity.",
