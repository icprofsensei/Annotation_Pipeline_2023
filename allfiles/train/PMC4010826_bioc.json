The increased risk is due to disruption of the indigenous microbiome and a subsequent decrease in colonization resistance by the perturbed bacterial community; however, the specific changes in the microbiome that lead to increased risk are poorly understood. We developed statistical models that incorporated microbiome data with clinical and demographic data to better understand why individuals develop CDI. The 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from the feces of 338 individuals, including cases, diarrheal controls, and nondiarrheal controls. We modeled CDI and diarrheal status using multiple clinical variables, including age, antibiotic use, antacid use, and other known risk factors using logit regression. This base model was compared to models that incorporated microbiome data, using diversity metrics, community types, or specific bacterial populations, to identify characteristics of the microbiome associated with CDI susceptibility or resistance. The addition of microbiome data significantly improved our ability to distinguish CDI status when comparing cases or diarrheal controls to nondiarrheal controls. However, only when we assigned samples to community types was it possible to differentiate cases from diarrheal controls. Several bacterial species within the Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonadaceae were largely absent in cases and highly associated with nondiarrheal controls. The improved discriminatory ability of our microbiome-based models confirms the theory that factors affecting the microbiome influence CDI.",

These include digestion, immune system stimulation, and colonization resistance. The microbiome\u2019s role in colonization resistance, which is the ability to prevent and limit pathogen colonization and growth, is key for protection against Clostridium difficile infections. However, the bacteria that are important for colonization resistance have not yet been elucidated. Using statistical modeling techniques and different representations of the microbiome, we demonstrated that several community types and the loss of several bacterial populations, including Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae, are associated with CDI. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the microbiome in mediating colonization resistance and may also direct the design of future multispecies probiotic therapies.",

Antibiotic use, proton pump inhibitors, and advancing age, which are all known to influence the composition of the gut microbiome, are all risk factors for CDI (3,\u20138). However, no one has developed a set of microbiome-based biomarkers for CDI to complement these risk factors. Therefore, characterizing the differences in the microbiomes of individuals with and without CDI is essential for understanding the changes within the microbiome associated with CDI. This knowledge would also potentially lead to novel targeted therapies, as the typical treatments of metronidazole and vancomycin feed the cycle of disrupting the gut microbiome. For the estimated 25% of cases of CDI-characterized recurrent infection, the most effective treatment has been fecal microbial transplant (FMT), which has a 92% success rate in limiting further recurrence (9). The remarkable success of FMT, which restores the normal microbiome, underscores the importance of understanding the role of the microbiome in providing colonization resistance.",

First, the microbial community composition of an individual can be distilled into a single parameter (i.e., alpha diversity) to describe the community in terms of richness or diversity. For instance, it has been shown that individuals with diarrhea tend to have a less diverse community composition than healthy individuals (10, 11). Unfortunately, such results do not lend themselves to subsequent mechanistic investigations and do not provide a therapeutic avenue, since it is difficult to predict whether an antibiotic will increase or decrease an individual\u2019s diversity. Second, cross-community comparisons (i.e., beta diversity) have been made to relate the similarity of microbial communities between individuals (e.g., the UniFrac method and Bray-Curtis index). In humans, these metrics are useful in tracking an individual\u2019s recovery from antibiotic therapy (6); however, they have had limited use in discriminating between treatment groups (see, e.g., reference 12). Using beta diversity metrics, it is again difficult to develop a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the community structure and disease or to provide a therapeutic avenue to change a community structure. Finally, in an approach similar to that of genome-wide association studies, comparisons of the relative abundances of individual bacterial populations can be made between groups of individuals (10, 13). This approach does not account for the possibility that mixtures of populations can be protective or causative or that different mixtures can have the same phenotype in different individuals. Here we propose a comprehensive modeling approach that incorporates clinical metadata to identify collections of bacteria that can be associated with health and disease. A similar approach was recently used to model the microbiome to identify microbiome signatures of psoriasis; however, clinical data for the subjects was not included (14).",

The structures of cases and diarrheal controls were additionally significantly different from one another by AMOVA (P = 0.02), although to a lesser degree. In order to identify the differences between these experimental groups, we first looked at their levels of overall bacterial diversity. Previous studies have shown that the bacterial diversity of subjects with initial and recurrent CDI is markedly lower than that of healthy subjects (10, 11). Measuring diversity using the inverse Simpson index, we found that hospital-acquired samples had a 2-fold-lower diversity than those of the nondiarrheal controls but were not significantly different from each other (Fig.\u00a01A). A model based on the inverse Simpson index alone significantly differentiated nondiarrheal controls from either cases or diarrheal controls (Fig. 1B to D), although this model performed no better than the base model alone. When we incorporated the inverse Simpson index into our base models, differentiation of cases from nondiarrheal controls was significantly improved (AUC = 0.922, P = 0.0072), and differentiation of diarrheal controls from nondiarrheal controls was also significantly improved (AUC = 0.900, P = 0.0009). Cases and diarrheal controls were indistinguishable when we used models that incorporated the inverse Simpson index. We performed the same analysis using the Shannon diversity index and observed similar results.

Types 6, 5, and 2 were also low in nondiarrheal controls and lacked several OTUs found primarily in that group (Fig.\u00a02A). Furthermore, type 2 or 6 was highly enriched in either Enterococcus species or Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. Types 9, 7, and 11 also were found in a high proportion of nondiarrheal controls and were more abundant in OTUs found predominantly in the nondiarrheal control group. These group-specific taxonomic features that we have identified may be involved in susceptibility or resistance to CDI.",

To accomplish this, we first identified those bacterial populations that were differentially represented in each of the three comparisons using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm (13); these analyses excluded C.\u00a0difficile (OTU 19). Briefly, LEfSe uses (i) the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test to identify taxonomic features that characterize the differences between our study groups and (ii) linear discriminant analysis to evaluate the effect size of each feature. Within each comparison, the OTUs with the largest effect size in each group and comparison were included in the respective base model (Fig.\u00a03A).",

We selected 5 OTUs that were enriched in the cases and 5 that were enriched in the nondiarrheal controls (based on the most extreme differences) and included their relative abundances as independent variables in logit regression. The relative abundances of these specific OTUs discriminated quite well between cases and nondiarrheal controls (AUC = 0.950) (Table\u00a0S1). Additionally, the combined base-microbiome model significantly outperformed the base model (AUC = 0.985, P < 0.0001). Subjects having CDI were significantly more likely to harbor Enterococcus species (OTU 2), Lachnospiraceae (OTU 14), and Erysipelotrichaceae (OTU 22) and significantly less likely to harbor Bacteroides species (OTU 5) than nondiarrheal controls.

Furthermore, the base plus microbiome model was not significantly different from the base clinical model (AUC = 0.709, P = 0.0652). Unlike with the bacterial community type analysis, we were unable to identify specific structural differences that could distinguish between cases and diarrheal controls in this model.

The nondiarrheal controls were more likely to have higher levels of several Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae OTUs. These taxa are commonly associated with a healthy microbiome. We used the 5 most enriched OTUs in each of the diarrheal control and nondiarrheal control groups to create a logit model to differentiate between the two (Fig.\u00a03D). These OTUs significantly differentiated the two control groups (AUC = 0.981). The inclusion of both clinical data and these OTUs provided considerable discrimination between the two groups compared with the base model alone (AUC = 0.983; P < 0.0001).

We developed classification models to differentiate whether individuals had C.\u00a0difficile infection or non-C.\u00a0difficile-associated diarrhea based on clinical and microbiome data. The microbiome was incorporated into these models using three approaches: diversity indices, community types, and defined bacterial subsets. These approaches of representing the microbiome allowed us to describe the communities at various levels of resolution. When differentiating between the cases and diarrheal controls, incorporation of community types provided the only significant improvement in detection between these two groups of patients. The inverse Simpson index and the utilization of specific OTUs did not differentiate these two groups. For the comparisons of nondiarrheal controls to cases or diarrheal controls, inclusion of the microbiome data significantly enhanced our ability to differentiate the groups regardless of the approach we used to represent the microbiome. The highest AUCs were observed when we differentiated between hospitalized patients (either cases or diarrheal controls) and community residents (nondiarrheal controls), with AUCs consistently greater than 0.9 when both clinical and microbiome data were considered. Specifically, representing the microbiome using specific sets of OTUs was the best approach for differentiating between hospitalized patients and community subjects. These findings stress the importance of not just one individual bacterial population or one metric of the community (e.g., diversity) but rather collections of bacterial populations or overall community types in detecting disease state. They also suggest the presence of gut dysbiosis in patients with diarrhea. These results demonstrate that knowledge of bacterial communities, not just single species, and in combination with clinical factors may be beneficial in generating epidemiological models of disease.",

                    "text": "It was notable that, among our three comparisons, the cases and diarrheal controls were the most similar. First, the base model to differentiate the two groups was unable to perform significantly better than a null model (P = 0.19). Second, the inverse Simpson diversity index revealed similar levels in both groups (P = 0.85). Third, many community types characterized by high numbers of cases were also more likely to contain diarrheal controls than nondiarrheal controls, which tended to cluster separately from both diarrheal groups. Finally, our OTU-based analysis did not identify any OTUs as being significantly enriched in the diarrheal controls relative to the cases. Because of the similarity in community structures and in clinical risk factors for CDI, results suggest that many of the diarrheal control subjects may actually be susceptible to CDI and have not yet been exposed to C.\u00a0difficile. This implies that any perturbation resulting in diarrhea may also contribute to CDI. This hypothesis is particularly relevant within a hospital setting, where C.\u00a0difficile spores are abundant and where there are numerous potential causes of diarrhea, including antibiotics (independent of CDI), infection, chemotherapy, and dietary changes.",

                    "text": "Our models that compared cases to nondiarrheal controls showed that Bacteroides species, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae were enriched in controls and that Enterococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and some Lachnospiraceae were enriched in cases. These results confirm those of previous related studies (10, 16,\u201318). Members of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae are the primary butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract. Butyrate has been associated with inhibition of C.\u00a0difficile growth in vitro (19), inflammation suppression, and the health of colonic cells. Thus, butyrate as well as other short-chain fatty acids may represent one mechanism of colonization resistance. Comparison of the sequences within our Bacteroides OTU (OTU 5), which was enriched in our nondiarrheal controls, to sequences in an annotated 16S rRNA gene database showed that they were highly similar to Bacteroides\u00a0uniformis and Bacteroides\u00a0acidifaciens. B.\u00a0uniformis was previously shown to ameliorate metabolic dysfunction caused by diet-induced obesity via changes in metabolic and immune responses (20). Because obesity is a risk factor for CDI (21), it is possible that B.\u00a0uniformis also provides protection against infection by C.\u00a0difficile. B.\u00a0acidifaciens was demonstrated to increase IgA+ B cells in the large intestine (22), which may also limit the growth of gastrointestinal pathogens such as C.\u00a0difficile. Overall, this shift in community structure is thought to be associated with a change in colonization resistance. Murine models of CDI have shown that similar changes in community structure render normally resistant mice sensitive to colonization by C.\u00a0difficile (23, 24). Similarly, a mixture of 6 bacterial species that included a member of the Bacteroides genus and a member of the Lachnospiraceae, both of which were found to be significantly enriched in our nondiarrheal control population, was sufficient to clear C.\u00a0difficile in a murine model of recurrent CDI (17).",

This hinders one\u2019s ability to consistently associate specific bacterial populations with disease. Instead, others have developed the concept of communities or enterotypes (25,\u201327). Although the biological interpretation of these clusters is controversial, our study demonstrates that categorizing individuals into community types or utilizing subsets of the bacterial community improves our ability to identify individuals that belong to specific disease states. Similar approaches have been used to associate specific community types with the composition of one\u2019s diet, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, Trichomonas vaginalis infection, vaginal pH, and ethnicity (25, 27,\u201332); however, these studies have not combined the subject\u2019s clinical information and community type to evaluate disease state.",

Thus, we are limited in our ability to assess the contribution of the microbiome toward risk or prevention of CDI. We also cannot determine the length of time that cases were colonized by C.\u00a0difficile prior to sample collection. The aim of this investigation was not to enhance CDI diagnostics but to use a model-based framework to characterize features of the microbiome that are associated with CDI and health. Our approach suggests that knowledge of an individual\u2019s microbiome composition is useful in distinguishing disease from health. However, prospective studies are needed to validate microbiome-based biomarkers of CDI risk. Identification of such risk factors will be possible only if samples are collected before the development of CDI. Furthermore, previous modeling has shown that albumin levels, white blood cell counts, creatinine levels, age, and increased leukocyte count can be used to predict CDI severity and mortality (4, 9, 33). It is possible that the incorporation of microbiome data can also be used to improve predictions of disease outcome. However, in the current investigation, we did not collect sufficient CDI severity data to address this possibility. As we have demonstrated in this study, there are distinct microbiome signatures that are associated with CDI. Understanding which community-wide changes are responsible for the loss in resistance to colonization leading to CDI is critical for future risk models and therapeutics.",

The inpatient samples were collected from October 2010 to January 2012 at the University of Michigan Hospital, Ann Arbor, MI. All enrollees granted patient consent. Inpatient subjects were not pregnant, they were suspected of having an initial episode of CDI (not recurrent CDI), and their stool sample was diarrheal. Within 24\u00a0h of stool collection, these specimens were screened for C.\u00a0difficile using the C.Diff Quik Chek Complete assay (Techlab, Blacksburg, VA). This rapid membrane enzyme immunoassay tests for the presence of both the C.\u00a0difficile antigen glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and the C.\u00a0difficile toxin proteins A and B. If this test resulted in a positive or negative result for both GDH and toxin proteins, the sample was classified as a case or as a diarrheal control, respectively. If the test was positive only for GDH, a PCR screen for the C.\u00a0difficile tcdB gene, which encodes the toxin B protein, was performed (34). To confirm the results of the clinical lab, we additionally performed PCR on all inpatient samples using C.\u00a0difficile-specific 16S rRNA gene primers as described elsewhere (35). Nondiarrheal, C.\u00a0difficile-negative samples were collected between January 2011 and January 2012 from individuals residing in the area surrounding Ann Arbor, MI. Subjects were excluded if they had had any signs of diarrhea in the previous 7\u00a0days or were pregnant. Once enrolled, individuals collected a stool sample using the provided home stool specimen kit.",

The V35 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the 454\u00a0GS FLX pyrosequencing platform and curated using mothur as previously described (36, 37). We sequenced and processed a mock community in parallel with the samples sequenced for this study (37). The observed error rate among the mock community samples was 0.009%. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a 3% distance cutoff (38). Taxonomic assignments were determined by using a naive Bayesian classifier with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) training set (version 9) with an 80% bootstrap confidence threshold. To mitigate against the effects of uneven sampling, all samples were rarefied to 1,450 sequences per sample (37). Among the samples with more than 1,450 sequences, the number of sequences per sample varied from 1,450 to 17,120, with a mean of 6,091 sequences/sample, a median of 5,986, and a median absolute deviation of 1,296. The OTU corresponding to C.\u00a0difficile (OUT 19) was identified by checking the representative sequence against the NCBI nucleotide database with BLASTn.

For continuous variables (e.g., age and weight), one-way analysis of variance was utilized. For categorical variables, Pearson\u2019s chi-square\u00a0test or Fisher\u2019s exact test was performed when expected cell frequencies were less than or equal to 5. The principal intent of the analyses was to assess whether the addition of microbiome data added to case differentiation, and as such, nested logit models were constructed with clinical data, with and without the incorporation of microbiome data. We utilized three approaches to capture the biodiversity of the gut microbiome. First, the inverse Simpson index was calculated for each sample and treated as a continuous variable in the models (39). Second, we assigned each sample to a different community type and used the type as a categorical variable in the model. These community types were identified by partitioning around medoids (PAM) of a Jensen-Shannon divergence distance matrix calculated from the microbiome data\u00a0(27). The randomForest package in R (http://cran.r-project.org/), with the number of trees set to 1,000, was used to differentiate the composition of each cluster. Third, we built models using the relative abundances of a subset of the OTUs observed across the individuals. These OTUs were selected using LEfSe based on the comparisons of cases versus diarrheal controls, cases versus nondiarrheal controls, and diarrheal controls versus nondiarrheal controls (13). OTUs demonstrating the greatest differences (at a 0.25-percentile cutoff at both ends) were used as continuous variables in our logit models. The 0.25-percentile cutoff was selected to restrict the number of significant OTUs in order to build the models and avoid overfitting. Differences between nested models were compared using the test for the equality of ROC areas (15). Analyses were conducted in Stata/MP 12.1 and R version 3.0.1.",
