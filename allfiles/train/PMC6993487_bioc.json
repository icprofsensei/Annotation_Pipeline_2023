However, due to their limitations, the traditional techniques were replaced by molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing (Sanger method) [1]. Although these target-dependant molecular techniques had the credits in the discovery of many viruses, many new and novel human viruses are not yet revealed [2]. Therefore, innovative approaches that overcome the limitations of conventional methods for the detection of viruses in clinical samples are needed [3]. In 1998, the word metagenome was first used to define the collection of uncultivable microorganisms in a soil sample [4]. Now, this term is used to describe the characteristics of the recovered information from genomes directly from a sample [5\u20137]. Metagenomics approach based on NGS has been used to detect different infectious agents in different samples [8]. The first application of metagenomics study in virus discovery was the analysis of virus particles in soil samples from marine sites in San Diego [9]. Now, the metagenomics approach is used widely in different research areas, including marine ecological research, plant and agriculture, human genetics and diagnosis of human diseases [10]. Virologists were the first to use the metagenomics approach to detect viruses, causing different diseases in humans such as respiratory tract infections, acute flaccid paralysis in children, and gastroenteritis [8, 11, 12].",

It is responsible for approximately three million deaths each year, causing high morbidity and mortality rate globally [14, 15]. Although at least 25 different bacteria and protozoa can cause diarrhoea, more than 75% of cases found to be caused by viruses [16]. Viruses that can cause gastroenteritis include rotavirus, norovirus, enteric adenovirus, human astrovirus, and Sapporo virus [17, 18]. Currently, the diagnostic methods used to detect viruses in stool samples are sequence-dependent molecular amplification techniques such as PCR, which cannot identify a pool of viruses and completely new viruses in clinical samples. Therefore, a novel approach that is sequence-independent such as viral metagenomics approach using NGS is desirable and should be developed for viral diagnosis and to overcome the unresolved cases of gastroenteritis.",

This study is the first of its kind in Kuwait to perform metagenomics analysis using NGS to detect various viruses causing gastroenteritis in stool samples from infants and children with signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis. Stool samples from 94 patients with gastroenteritis and healthy children were first analysed for the presence of viruses by metagenomic approach using NGS. The results showed that cDNA libraries generated an average of 280,768 reads of 150-bp paired-end reads. Among the total reads, 29% of the reads were originated from the host (human), 27% of the reads were obtained from the bacterial genome, while only 5% of reads were derived from viruses. In comparison to our results, Yang and colleagues identified a higher average (91.6%) of host (human) genome reads, and 61.5% were from the bacterial genome in the clinical samples [19]. However, Madi and colleagues identified an average of 64% of the host (human) genome reads in respiratory samples [20]. In our study, the viral reads were higher in comparison to other studies; Yang and colleagues identified only 3.1% of viral reads [19], while Madi and coworkers identified a lower average of viral reads (2%) [20]. On the other hand, other studies of viral metagenomics in stool samples have recorded better viral reads; 76% [21], 35.6% [22], and 23% [23].

However, rotavirus A was the third predominant virus detected in stool samples (16.2%) followed by norovirus GII (11.6%). By a study in southern Brazil to investigate viruses causing gastroenteritis in hospitalised pediatric patients, the results showed that out of 225 fecal samples tested, human adenovirus was the predominant virus (16%), while 8% of the samples were positive for norovirus, and 6% were positive for rotavirus [24]. Additionally, many studies have shown that human enteric adenovirus types 40 and 41 (HAdV-40, AHdV-41) are an important cause of gastroenteritis [25\u201328]. In contrary to our study, updated estimates on diarrhoea-related childhood revealed that rotavirus is the leading cause of diarrhoea among children worldwide [29\u201332]. A previous study in Kuwait has investigated the prevalence of viruses causing gastroenteritis in stool samples from children aged up to five years with acute gastroenteritis using an electron microscope and enzyme immunoassay. The results showed that rotavirus was the primary (40%) virus causing diarrhoea among children in Kuwait [33, 34]. Concerning norovirus, other studies have also demonstrated that norovirus GII is the predominant genogroup known to cause gastroenteritis in children [35\u201338].",

Adenoviruses were detected as co-infection viruses in 20.9% (9/43) of the positive samples. According to several studies conducted in Korea, Japan, Albania, and Venezuela, mixed infections of enteric and non-enteric adenoviruses are common and might play a role in acute gastroenteritis [39\u201343]. The clinical importance of mixed viral infection is an unresolved question. However, mixed viral infections have biological and epidemiological implications. Viruses in mixed infections may interact synergistically or antagonistically altering the concentration of either or both viruses and accordingly affecting the outcome of the disease. We speculate that some viruses which are causing gastroenteritis to depend on other viruses for their pathogenicity. However, this concept requires further investigations.",

In our study, the results showed that 60.7% of patients were positive for viruses causing gastroenteritis disease. Of the positive patients, 53% had mixed viral infections. Mixed infection of adenovirus and rotavirus was the predominant (27.4%). A similar percentage of mixed infection of human adenovirus and rotavirus (27.2%) was reported in a study conducted in Albania to assess the occurrence of human adenovirus in children with acute gastroenteritis symptoms [42]. In our study, rotavirus was the most predominant virus detected by multiplex Real-Time PCR as a single infection (19.6%). However, this percentage is lower than the percentage of rotavirus recorded previously in Kuwait [33, 34]. We speculate that the reduced incidence of rotavirus among children is due to the implementation of rotavirus vaccine in Kuwait.",

The divergence between the results obtained by multiplex Real-Time PCR and metagenomics approach could be explained by the fact that multiplex Real-Time PCR is a standardised technique that is routinely used for the detection of the commonly known viruses associated with gastroenteritis. On the contrary, the metagenomics approach is a newly introduced technology in Kuwait and requires further standardisations and validations in order to use it as a routine diagnostic test. The question is how to intercept metagenomics analysis results by NGS in term of what is clinically relevant for patients requires further investigations. Although metagenomics did not detect all multiplex Real-Time PCR positive samples, it did provide several advantages over the multiplex Real-Time PCR assay. For instance, the metagenomics approach detected several known and newly discovered viruses among children with gastroenteritis for the first time in Kuwait that could not be identified by the multiplex Real-Time PCR method. Moreover, the metagenomic approach had the advantage to detect different genogroup of viruses, for example, adenovirus, enterovirus and norovirus genotypes. Also, unlike multiplex Real-Time PCR, the metagenomic approach can detect completely new viruses.",

We showed that metagenomics analysis holds promise as a diagnostics tool, where multiplex Real-Time PCR could not identify many viruses known to cause gastroenteritis but were detected by metagenomics approach. Although metagenomics has provided a powerful tool for detecting the newly discovered viruses that cause gastroenteritis, the detection of these viruses is not sufficient to prove causality. Based on these findings, we cannot rule out these viruses as the cause of acute gastroenteritis in infants and children. Therefore, further studies in the immediate future with a larger sample size of healthy controls and causes of AGE are needed to evaluate their clinical significance.",
