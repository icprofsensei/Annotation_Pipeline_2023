Here, we investigated the presence of microbes in the nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) and their potential association with breast cancer. We compared the NAF microbiome between women with a history of breast cancer (BC) and healthy control women (HC) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The NAF microbiome from BC and HC showed significant differences in community composition. Two Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) showed differences in relative abundances between NAF collected from BC and HC. In NAF collected from BC, there was relatively higher incidence of the genus Alistipes. By contrast, an unclassified genus from the Sphingomonadaceae family was relatively more abundant in NAF from HC. These findings reflect the ductal source DNA since there were no differences between areolar skin samples collected from BC and HC. Furthermore, the microbes associated with BC share an enzymatic activity, Beta-Glucuronidase, which may promote breast cancer. This is the first report of bacterial DNA in human breast ductal fluid and the differences between NAF from HC and BC. Further investigation of the ductal microbiome and its potential role in breast cancer are warranted.",

Epidemiologic studies suggest that the human microflora contributes to 16% or more of worldwide malignancies1,2,3. Increased cancer risk is associated with the presence of chronic, persistent, and dysregulated inflammation1,3,4. Many of the studies on microbes in relation to cancer have focused on the gut microflora. For instance, infection with Helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative bacterium that selectively colonizes the gastric epithelium and induces gastric inflammation, is correlated with a higher incidence of gastric cancer5. Further, emerging evidence suggests that infection with Fusobacterium nucleatum, a common member of the oropharyngeal flora and a pathogenic agent involved in gingival and periodontal disease, is associated with the development of human colorectal cancer6,7. Bacteria present near the tumor site are part of the tumor microenvironment. On one hand, the microbiome might promote malignancy by inducing chronic inflammation, by altering the balance of host cell proliferation and death, and by triggering uncontrolled innate and adaptive immune responses8. On the other hand, certain microbes might play a preventative role in breast carcinogenesis by affecting levels of estrogen or by promoting antitumor immunity and immune surveillance9.",

However, the presence of six to eight ductal openings at the surface of the human nipple allows microbes from the environment, skin, and mouth (through sexual activity and breast feeding) to access the breast ductal system11.

The relative differences amongst the nipple skin communities were calculated using the Bray-Curtis index and graphically visualized using Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), whereby a shorter distance between points indicates increasing similarity in microbial composition. Though the skin varies according to body site18 and is expected to randomly vary across individuals, we hypothesized that the nipple skin microbiome would be independent of breast cancer history. The nipple skin microbiome from HC (n\u2009=\u20098) and BC (n\u2009=\u20095) did not cluster separately and did not have a significant difference in bacterial composition (Adonis, p-value\u2009=\u20090.945) (Fig. 1a). The rarefaction curves, which plot the number of unique species as a function of the number of reads sampled, reached a plateau for the nipple skin samples as well as for the other sample types (post-Betadine skin and NAF), indicating that our sampling depth provided sufficient coverage to capture most members of the bacterial communities (Figs 1b).

The nipple skin was treated with Betadine to avoid contamination of NAF samples with normal nipple skin flora. We found that Betadine leaves a small residual flora that is detected by the extremely sensitive methodology used in this study. As a baseline control, we collected post-Betadine samples of the nipple skin to characterize the residual microflora. Reads from the post-Betadine skin swabs were clustered into OTUs and classified to the genera level. We calculated the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and performed PCoA to visualize community-wide differences amongst the post-Betadine skin swabs. The post-Betadine skin microbiome from HC (n\u2009=\u20095) and BC (n\u2009=\u20097) did not separate into distinct clusters (Adonis, p-value\u2009=\u20090.478) (Fig. 2a), and the bacterial diversity between the two groups were not significantly different (nonparametric t-test, p-value\u2009=\u20090.151) (Fig. 2b). The post-Betadine swab microbiome is primarily composed of bacteria belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria (average 49.4%), Firmicutes (average 23.8%), and Bacteroidetes (average 13.0%) (Fig. 2c). None of the OTUs was significantly different between the post-Betadine skin samples collected from HC and BC (Kruskal-Wallis test, Supplemental Table S2). As expected, the post-Betadine nipple skin microbiome from HC vs. BC was not significantly different by comparing community composition, by comparing species diversity, or by comparing relative OTU abundances, indicating that the post-Betadine controls are independent of breast cancer history (Fig. 2).",

Both NAF and milk are secreted by the epithelial cells lining the breast ducts. Breast milk contains bacteria that are orally transmitted to the breastfed infant with a key function to populate and establish the neonate\u2019s gastrointestinal flora14. The bacteria present in milk belong mostly to the phylum Firmicutes (Staphylococcus, Clostridium, Lactobacillus), Actinobacteria (Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium), Proteobacteria (Ralstonia, Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Bradyrhizobiaccea), and Bacteroidetes (Prevotella)13,14,30. Similarly, in NAF samples from both HC and BC, we found Clostridium and Prevotella, as well as an unclassified genus from the Sphingomonadaceae family. Thus, the NAF and milk microbiomes exhibit some overlap.",

Ductal spaces may be populated by bacteria from oral sources, resulting from sexual activity or breast-feeding. An entero-mammary pathway by which some bacteria from the gut could reach the mammary gland via an endogenous route has been postulated by others31. Alternatively, it is tempting to speculate that skin bacteria from the nipple surface might reach the breast ducts through the ductal orifices via retrograde migration since the nipple skin and NAF microbiome had no significant OTUs by paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test. However, amongst the samples from HC, the nipple skin and the NAF had significantly different community composition. Additional studies with larger sample sizes are required to investigate this preliminary trend.",

First, the genus Alistipes (Otu00009) was present only in the NAF from BC, and was absent in the NAF collected from HC. Alistipes has been included among other bacteria to have an increased relative abundance in colorectal cancer32. Another organism of interest, an unclassified genus from the Sphingomonadaceae family (Otu00007), was relatively more abundant in NAF from HC than from BC. The consensus sequence from this OTU was queried against the NCBI \u201crefseq_rna\u201d using the default BLAST algorithm (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)33. The OTU matched two strains of Sphingobium yanoikuyae (NR_113730.1 and NR_11524.1) with 100% identity. Notably, in our previous study, four out of the eight OTUs enriched in paired normal compared to estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast tumor tissue belonged to the Sphingomonadaceae family with Sphingobium yanoikuyae having the greatest statistical significance9.",

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been associated with breast cancer35. It is interesting that a microbe capable of degrading aromatic hydrocarbons, such as estrogen, would be comparatively higher in the healthy state and lower in the estrogen-dependent breast tumor36. This may be especially relevant because the sex hormones have far higher concentration in the nipple aspirate fluid than in the serum16. In the present study, the metabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons by Sphingomonadaceae may have a protective role and account for the greater abundance of these organisms in the NAF from healthy women, a possibility that warrants further investigation.",

Notably, the NAF OTUs predictive of Beta-Glucuronidase levels (Table 1) were different from those reported in colon cancer, which are Enterobacteriaceae family members and some Firmicutes genera40. This preliminary finding hints at the potential role of bacterial Beta-Glucuronidase in relation to breast cancer.

One way estrogen is excreted is by conjugating it with glucuronic acid, making it water soluble for excretion41. When glucuronidate-conjugated estrogen reaches a site rich with Beta-Glucuronidase from microorganisms or from inflammation (human lysosomes contain Beta-Glucuronidase), the enzyme reverses the conjugation and leaves biologically active estrogen to accumulate at the site42. In a rat model for breast cancer, inhibition of Beta-Glucuronidase with calcium D-glucarate reduces breast cancer incidence by lowering endogenous levels of estradiol43. Some have even postulated the use of calcium D-glucarate supplementation to reduce the cancer risk of some individuals44. There are no previous reports of elevated Beta-Glucuronidase in breast ductal fluid. Our preliminary finding provokes an intriguing hypothesis that bacterial Beta-Glucuronidase may deconjugate glucuronidate-conjugated estrogen present in breast tissue.",

The epithelial cells that line the breast ducts act as a barrier to the outside world and, unless breached, separate the NAF microbiome from that of the tissue. In addition, the ductal epithelium has the capability to sense microbial-derived signals through Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) expressed at their surfaces45. While previous studies have demonstrated that the activation of the TLR2-MyD88 pathway in mammary and gastrointestinal epithelial cells leads to tumor growth and promotes carcinogenesis45,46, TLR5 activation with flagellin inhibits cancer cell growth and mediates potent anti-tumor activity in breast cancer36. Interestingly, Sphingobium yanoikuyae is motile with a single polar flagellum47, providing a ligand for the TLR5 pathway. Further work is warranted to investigate the potential interaction of the breast ductal microbiome and the immune response as it relates to breast cancer.",

Next, the nipple was de-keratinized using a mild abrasive gel (Nuprep, D.O. Weaver & Co., Aurora, CO) followed by the application of Betadine\u00ae solution (Purdue Products, Wilson, NC) to sterilize the skin surface. After the preparation with Betadine, a sterile cotton swab was used to collect a post-Betadine nipple skin sample. The entire procedure was performed with open surgery level sterility with the surgeon wearing a scrub suit with cap, gown, shoe covers, mask, and gloves. To elicit NAF, a suction cup fitted with a 20 ml syringe was used to create negative pressure. NAF was collected with a sterile cotton swab. For HC, collection of NAF was attempted on both breasts, but for BC, only the contralateral breast was sampled since the ductal system for the breast that had previously been treated for breast cancer would be interrupted. Sampling was performed by the same clinical research team at one location and all the samples in the analysis were collected by one physician. The protocol for NAF collection has been included in Supplemental Method.",

Samples were extracted in batches, with random selection to avoid any batch effects. We used empty Eppendorf tube controls running along all preparations to evaluate potential contamination. Isolated gDNA was submitted to Second Genome Inc. for 16S-V4 rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. DNA from each sample was amplified using Caporaso primers tailed with sequences to incorporate flow cell adapters and indexing barcodes. The sequence for the forward primer (F515) was 5\u2032AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGACGTACGTACGGTGTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA3\u2032. The sequence for the reverse primer (R806) was 5\u2032CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATXXXXXXXXXXXXACGTACGTACCGGATACHVGGGTWTCTAAT3\u2032. The reverse primer (R806) contained a 12-nucleotide error-correcting Golay code for sample identification. The XXXXXXXXXXXX represents a unique barcode sequence, the V represents either A, C, or G, M represents A or C, and W represents A or T49. Amplified products were concentrated and purified by solid-phase reversible immobilization and then quantified by electrophoresis using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples meeting the post-PCR minimum concentration were loaded into MiSeq Illumina for cluster formation and then sequenced for 250 cycles using primers designed for paired-end sequencing9. The paired-end reads were uploaded to the sequence read archive with the accession number SRP071608.",

The majority of the sequence processing was performed based on the Schloss MiSeq standard operating procedure using Mothur51. Briefly, paired sequences were merged into contigs followed by exclusion of sequences that had ambiguous base pairs, homopolymers longer than eight, or a read length greater than 275bp. Remaining sequences were trimmed using a 10bp sliding window with an average quality score of 28 and a minimal trimmed length of 200bp. Remaining high quality sequences were aligned to SILVA v11952. PCR errors were reduced using pre.cluster, and chimeras were detected and removed by UCHIME53. Subsequently, the high quality sequences were classified using Mothur\u2019s implementation of the RDP classifier against the reference training set v1454. Sequences classified as Mitochondria, Chloroplasts, Archaea, Eukaryotes, or unclassified at the kingdom level were excluded. Remaining sequences were clustered at a distance of 0.03 (97% sequence similarity) using average neighbor clustering algorithm. After classifying the consensus taxonomy for each OTU, singletons were removed. To account for the presence of contaminating microbial 16S rDNA sequences in extraction kits and laboratory reagents, we removed all OTUs detected from control empty Eppendorf tubes. A final count of 15 NAF samples, along with 13 nipple skin, and 12 post-Betadine skin samples survived strict quality processing and subsequent background subtraction. The 15 NAF samples, nine from HC and six from BC, had a total of 31,968 reads distributed among 143 OTUs with a table density of 0.102. The 13 skin samples, eight from HC and five from BC, had a total of 31,679 reads distributed among 127 OTUs with a table density of 0.108. The post-Betadine skin samples, five from HC and seven from BC, had a total of 26,172 reads distributed among 119 OTUs with a table density of 0.114. Clinical information of the 12 patients whose NAF samples passed quality filtering and background subtraction is shown in Table 2. The table for the number of NAF samples attempted, collected, amplified, and passed quality filtering across clinical information are shown in Supplemental Table S6.",

Finally, 918 random sequences were chosen for the comparison between the nipple skin and the NAF samples, which had nine pairs collected from the same breasts: six from HC and three from BC. All Principal Coordinate Analyses (PCoA) were based on a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity using evenly sampled (rarefied) OTU abundances. To test for community compositional differences, we used analysis of variance (Adonis) from R\u2019s vegan package55, which also noted that Adonis test is less sensitive to dispersion effects and is a more robust alternative to either analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) or multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP). To compare community-wide differences between paired nipple skin and NAF samples, the strata parameter was applied to restrict permutations within the patient variables and not across55. To test for differentially abundant OTUs between HC and BC samples, we employed a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. As for comparing the OTU abundances between paired NAF and nipple skin, we instead used a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The alpha-level cutoff was 0.05 and false discovery correction was not applied for comparing the OTU relative abundances. Observed OTU metric was used for alpha diversity calculations with ten permutations of random sampling at each sequencing depth. Taking the observed OTUs at the final sequencing depth, we performed a nonparametric t-test using Monte Carlo permutations to compare the diversity between samples from HC vs. BC. As for comparing the bacterial diversity between paired NAF and nipple skin samples, we instead used a paired two-tailed t-test. All statistical analyses were performed in R 3.2.356.",

The analysis is limited to bacteria whose genome, and therefore all of their genes and gene contents, are known. Due to the closed reference OTU picking, only 12 NAF samples, six from HC and six from BC, had sufficient 16S reads remaining. Next, we used PICRUSt package to computationally predict the gene contents from the 16S rRNA region, and subsequently, the pathways related to these genes28. Using PICRUSt, the picked OTUs were normalized to their copy numbers and their pathway abundances inferred from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)58. PICRUSt identified a total of 328 KEGG pathways and 6909 bacterial genes, of which we pre-selected 18 pathways to reduce false discovery rate from multiple hypothesis testing; the pathways were selected based on previous nutritional and microbiome studies in relation to colon cancer20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27. The selected 18 pathways were normalized to the sample with the lowest abundance, which was at a sampling depth of 26359.
