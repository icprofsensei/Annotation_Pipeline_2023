Underweight and normal weight participants had different oral microbiota communities than overweight and obese participants. These associations remained significant when females were analyzed as a separate group, but not when males were analyzed as a separate group. The differences were based on the types of bacteria present but not the abundance of those bacteria. Oral microbiota of underweight and normal weight participants were defined by the presence of Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and unclassified Clostridiales. With respect to sweet liking, alpha diversity (Chao1) was positively associated with liking of the 2.4% sucrose solution (tertiles) in female adults and female children.",
