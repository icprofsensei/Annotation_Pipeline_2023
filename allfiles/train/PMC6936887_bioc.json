Large scale studies of this type are enabled by the advent of highly multiplexed 16S next-generation sequencing, for which efficient sample extraction techniques are needed. Two of the most common sample types studied are soil (environmental studies) and stool (human microbiome studies). These studies of the environmental and human microbiomes are challenged by the fact that soil and stool are extremely difficult sample types due to their high abundance of inhibitory substances, which are co-purified and have the potential to inhibit enzymatic reactions.",

These kits have been adapted to high-throughput processing methods, including 96-well plate-based as well as magnetic bead-based protocols which allow automation on a wide variety of platforms. High-throughput bead beating homogenization allows rapidlysis by a combination of mechanical and chemical methods. Inhibitors are removed by a specialized precipitation step, after which DNA purification can be carried out in 96-wellplate formats. This technology enables high-throughput processing of stool and soil samples for downstream applications such as PCR amplification and 16S rDNA sequencing.",
