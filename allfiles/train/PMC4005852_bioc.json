To measure the diversity among subjects or storage conditions, a single rarefaction was performed at a sequencing depth of 4000 so that all samples were included in analyses. Distance matrices containing all pairwise comparisons were created for unweighted (presence/absence) dissimilarity values using the UniFrac phylogenetic method\n[13]. Principal coordinates were computed for the unweighted distance matrices and used to generate Principal Coordinate Analysis plots (PCoA). The non-parametric method, adonis\n[14], was used to identify significant differences in phylogenetic distance variation by subjects and by storage condition. The Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) for clustering of samples was also carried out on the unweighted distance matrices\n[8]. A two-sample t-test was used to test for differences between the within and between group variances, with p-values adjusted by Bonferroni correction.

Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted UniFrac distances, a phylogeny-based distance metric, indicated that samples clustered by subject (Figure\u00a0\n2A, p\u2009=\u20090.001), rather than by storage condition (Figure\u00a0\n2B, p\u2009=\u20090.497). Hierarchical clustering of unweighted UniFrac distances further substantiated these findings (Figure\u00a0\n2C), revealing three distinct clusters by subject and not by collection method. Consistent with these findings, the gut microbial community composition varied significantly less within subjects than between subjects (Figure\u00a0\n2D, p\u2009=\u20092.89e-89).

Multiple studies have tested storage durations (up to six months) and storage temperatures ranging from 20\u00b0C to \u221280\u00b0C; most studies\n[4,15,16], though not all\n[17,18], have found that these fecal collection methods did not significantly influence the gut microbiome diversity and taxon distribution. Two other studies reported that storage at \u221220\u00b0C for up to 53\u00a0days influenced specific taxa, including Bacteroidetes abundance\n[19] and the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio\n[20], however, we did not observe these trends in our study.",

RNAlater is used to stabilize and protect RNA from degradation in tissue during long term storage and has been shown to also be suitable for DNA preservation\n[21]. However, we observed that fecal samples were very hard to disperse evenly in RNAlater during processing and that DNA purity was lower. Low-quality DNA can interfere with downstream applications including PCR amplification\n[22], a possible reason for the trend toward reduced Shannon indices. Two studies showed that storage in RNAlater is suitable for PCR amplification of bacterial DNA\n[5,6]. While the first study showed that total DNA yields from RNAlater samples were higher compared to refrigeration storage and liquid nitrogen freezing, the impact on Shannon indices was not described\n[5]. Using gorilla fecal samples, the second study reported that DNA purity and Shannon indices were not significantly different between RNAlater samples and samples stored at \u221230\u00b0C\n[6]. RNAlater storage increases the potential utility of stored fecal samples, so further study is warranted to determine the conditions of collection for which this reagent is suitable.",

These cards are commercially available and inexpensive. The small size and flat shape also makes the card easier to include in packages to be sent to participants, compared to bulkier Eppendorf tubes. Study subjects can easily collect samples on the cards. Because the cards are widely used in colorectal cancer screening\n[23], potential participants might also be more accepting of collecting samples in this way. A possible drawback of the Hemoccult Sensa\u00ae card is that it contains a chemical reagent used to detect blood in the stool\n[24] which could possibly affect gut microbiome. However, we found no evidence of a significant difference in gut microbiome in fecal samples collected by this method. Findings that results were unaffected by three-day storage at room temperature of the collection cards or Eppendorf tubes suggests that participant home-collection and mailing of these samples is suitable for epidemiological studies.",
