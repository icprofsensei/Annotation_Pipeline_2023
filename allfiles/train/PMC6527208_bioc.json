Our team developed an intravaginal ring (IVR) that delivers tenofovir (TFV) (8\u201310 mg/day) alone or with levonorgestrel (LNG) (20 ug/day). We evaluated the effect of IVRs on the vaginal microbiota, and describe how the vaginal microbiota impacts mucosal PK of TFV. CONRAD A13-128 was a randomized, placebo controlled phase I study. We randomized 51 women to TFV, TFV/LNG or placebo IVR. We assessed the vaginal microbiota by sequencing the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes prior to IVR insertion and after approximately 15 days of use. We measured the concentration of TFV in the cervicovaginal (CV) aspirate, and TFV and TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) in vaginal tissue at the end of IVR use. The change in relative or absolute abundance of vaginal bacterial phylotypes was similar among active and placebo IVR users (all q values >0.13). TFV concentrations in CV aspirate and vaginal tissue, and TFV-DP concentrations in vaginal tissue were not significantly different among users with community state type (CST) 4 versus those with Lactobacillus dominated microbiota (all p values >0.07). The proportions of participants with CV aspirate concentrations of TFV >200,000 ng/mL and those with tissue TFV-DP concentrations >1,000 fmol/mg were similar among women with anaerobe versus Lactobacillus dominated microbiota (p = 0.43, 0.95 respectively). There were no significant correlations between the CV aspirate concentration of TFV and the relative abundances of Gardnerella vaginalis or Prevotella species. Tissue concentrations of TFV-DP did not correlate with any the relative abundances of any species, including Gardnerella vaginalis. In conclusion, active IVRs did not differ from the placebo IVR on the effect on the vaginal microbiota. Local TFV and TFV-DP concentrations were high and similar among IVR users with Lactobacillus dominated microbiota versus CST IV vaginal microbiota.",

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally and is linked to an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission [2, 3]. Almost half of all pregnancies worldwide, estimated to be over 100 million annually, are unintended [4\u20136]. Products that offer protection against multiple STIs (e.g. HSV-2 and HIV-1), or both STIs and unintended pregnancy, termed multi-purpose prevention technologies (MPTs), are urgently needed to reduce these global health burdens. Women have overwhelmingly indicated they prefer an MPT product over single-indication products [7]. CONRAD and our collaborators developed two MPT intravaginal rings (IVRs) which release tenofovir (TFV) alone (active against HIV-1 and HSV-2) and TFV in combination with levonorgestrel (LNG) (contraceptive) for at least 90 days [8, 9], and performed a phase I study in healthy women [10].",

BV is present in approximately 29% of United States women [11, 12], 55% of women in sub-Saharan Africa, and up to 70% of female sex workers in South Africa ][13, 14]. Approximately 85% of women with BV are asymptomatic [11]. Data support that BV is likely a cofactor in HIV-1 acquisition (reviewed in [15]) and therefore, assessment of the vaginal microbiota is part of the safety evaluation of HIV-1 prevention products, particularly topical vaginal products. Furthermore, recent subset analyses of women randomized to topical TFV 1% vaginal gel in the CAPRISA 004 cohort and from the FAME 04 cohort among women using TFV 1% vaginal gel or TFV vaginal film found that women with non-Lactobacillus dominated vaginal microbiota had reduced mucosal concentrations of TFV and the active metabolite, TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP), potentially reducing the efficacy of these single agent, peri-coital, topical microbicides [16, 17]. The effect of the microbiota on TFV pharmacokinetics (PK) when TFV is administered topically, but continuously, via an IVR, has not been investigated. We describe the vaginal microbiota among healthy women, before and after the use of an IVR releasing TFV alone or in combination LNG for approximately 15 days. Given the high prevalence of BV and dysbiotic states in the vaginal microbiota of young African women [13, 14], the target users for these IVRs, the data reported in the manuscript are relevant to further development of MPTs.",

The study visits and procedures have been previously published [10] and are summarized in S1 Table. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to any study procedures. Participants were healthy, 18\u201345 years old, had a body mass index of less than 30 kg/m2 and reported no use of exogenous hormones and regular menstrual cycles. All women underwent screening at visit 1, to detect the presence of exclusionary factors (e.g. Nugent score of 7\u201310 [18], active HSV-2, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, HIV-1, Hepatitis B). We instructed participants to refrain from vaginal intercourse and place nothing in the vagina during IVR use. During the study, development of symptomatic BV was exclusionary, but asymptomatic BV after screening was not exclusionary. At visit 4, in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (menstrual cycle day 7 \u00b1 1 day), we obtained a vaginal Copan ESwab (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA) for microbiota analyses, and then participants initiated IVR use. The IVR was removed approximately 15\u201318 days after insertion, at visit 7. At that time, we obtained another vaginal Copan ESwab for microbiota analysis, two vaginal biopsies for TFV and TFV-DP concentration measurements, and a CV aspirate for TFV concentration.",

Among these 38 participants, 12 TFV and 15 TFV/LNG IVR users had Lactobacillus dominated microbiota, while 7 TFV and 4 TFV/LNG IVR users had CST IV microbiota. As shown in Table 3, and Fig 4a, there was no significant difference in the mean log TFV concentration (ng/mL) between women with CST IV versus those with Lactobacillus dominated CSTs (p = 0.66). Furthermore, the log10 relative abundance of Garderella vaginalis or Prevotella spp. was not significantly correlated with the log10 of the TFV concentration in the CV aspirate (q values 0.47 for both taxa) (Fig 5). The proportion of participants with a CV aspirate TFV concentration of > 200,000 and > 500,000 ng/mL was similar in each cohort (p values 0.23 and 0.43, respectively). All TFV containing IVR users had a CV aspirate concentration of 10,000 ng/mL or higher at the end of treatment (range 0.08\u201321.2 * 106 ng/mL). Using Bayesian logistic regression model with CST IV versus Lactobacillus dominated CSTs as the outcome variables and a spline function of log10 TFV as the predictor variable, we determined that, although CST IV was commonly associated with any dilution degree of TFV, making the overall model non-significant, an enrichment of Lactobacilli was found with TFV concentrations in the range of 1.6\u20136.3 x 106 ng/mL.",

We previously reported no significant differences in tissue concentrations of TFV and TFV-DP between the proximal and distal tissue biopsies [10]. Evaluable PK (at least one of two tissue samples) and microbiota data were available for 13 TFV and 16 TFV/LNG IVR users, contributing 50 vaginal tissue samples with Lactobacillus dominated microbiota. The CST IV cohort included 7 TFV and 4 TFV/LNG IVR users who contributed a total of 21 tissue biopsies. The mean log10 TFV vaginal tissue concentration in samples with CST IV microbiota was not significantly different from the mean log10 TFV concentration in vaginal tissue from participants with Lactobacillus dominated CSTs (p = 0.07) (Table 3, Fig 4B). As with TFV concentrations in the CV aspirate, we modeled the association between TFV tissue concentrations and CST. TFV tissue concentrations ranging from 15.8\u201375 ng/mg were associated with Lactobacillus dominated CST, however the overall model was not significant. Only one participant, randomized to the TFV/LNG IVR, with CST IV, had vaginal tissue TFV concentrations which were lower than 10 ng/mg in both vaginal biopsies. All other participants had vaginal tissue TFV concentrations of 10 ng/mg or higher (range 15\u2013760 ng/mg) in vaginal tissue biopsies.",

These conclusions were supported by analysis of the relative and absolute abundances of vaginal bacterial phylotypes and vaginal bacterial bioburden. The majority of IVR users maintained their CST throughout IVR use. Specific aaCSTs, categorized for this population, were also maintained by the majority of IVR users, indicating that IVR use did not affect the structure of the vaginal microbiota. There was no evidence that IVR use increased the incidence of BV and no signals that IVR use caused any detrimental impact on vaginal microbiota. These reassuring safety data are in accordance with previous data, albeit using less sensitive culture and gram stain methods, showing no significant changes in vaginal bacteria among a cohort of healthy, sexually active women using the contraceptive IVR [32\u201336] for up to 12 months. A pilot study of 6 women with recurrent HSV-2 used 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to demonstrate that an acyclovir containing IVR had no adverse impact on vaginal microbiota during 14 days of use [37]. Using mixed methods analyses, we found that the proportion of women with Lactobacillus dominated microbiota (CST I, II, III and V) significantly increased and the proportion of women with anaerobe dominated (CST IV) microbiota significantly decreased with TFV/LNG IVR use. Although the sample size was small, these findings support that topical micro-dose LNG does not adversely affect vaginal microbiota. The findings are also in accordance with data from women using the etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol contraceptive IVR, which showed increases in Lactobacillus spp. with IVR use [38].",

In addition, we examined correlations between individual species which are common in BV associated microbiota and have been associated with subclinical changes in mucosal immunity and inflammation [39], namely Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella spp., and the concentration of TFV in CV aspirate. A recent secondary analysis of women randomized to topical TFV 1% vaginal gel in the CAPRISA 004 cohort [40] found that a non-Lactobacillus dominated microbiota (CST IV) reduced the efficacy of TFV 1% vaginal gel in preventing HIV-1, even after adjusting for behavioral and demographic covariates [17], but did not alter the efficacy against HSV-2. TFV concentrations in the CV aspirate were significantly reduced among TFV 1% gel and film users with CST IV microbiota [16, 17]. TFV-DP concentrations in vaginal tissue were also reduced in the film users in the FAME 04 study [16]. This is potentially of concern for episodic, peri-coital, single agent regimens. On the contrary, we found no significant differences in tissue TFV-DP concentrations among IVR users with Lactobacillus dominated versus CST IV microbiota. Further, we showed that TFV-DP tissue concentrations did not correlate with any of the most abundant 58 individual bacterial phylotypes.",

However, a feasible hypothesis to explain the differences between our findings, i.e., no change in mucosal TFV concentrations with BV associated microbiota, and findings from peri-coitally dosed TFV regimens [16, 17], is that the TFV- containing IVRs release TFV continuously, rather than episodically, at approximately 8\u201310 mg/day [10]. The continuous, 24 hour, controlled and sustained release of TFV by the IVR, unlike the bolus, immediate release of TFV by the gel or the film, provides sufficient active molecules that penetrate into the CV mucosa and are converted into the active metabolite, TFV-DP [10]. Even if some of the TFV is degraded by bacteria in the lumen of the vagina, as has been modeled in vitro [17], our data support that the continuous release of TFV is enough to maintain protective concentrations of the active metabolite in the tissue inside the target cells.",

High TFV-DP concentrations were correlated with TFV concentrations of at least 10 ng/mg of tissue [21, 47, 48]. Our data support that the TFV and TFV/LNG IVRs deliver sustained high TFV concentrations to the vaginal tissues similar to concentrations seen with TFV gel in phase I PK studies, and should be protective, regardless of vaginal microbiota composition. This is reinforced by tissue levels of TFV\u2019s active metabolite, TFV-DP. The benchmark of 1,000 fmol/mg for TFV-DP levels in tissue comes from PK and efficacy studies of TFV 1% gel in macaques, demonstrating that TFV gel, when applied 30 minutes [49] or even 3 days [50] prior to simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge, protected all or the majority of macaques. Although these benchmarks were based on TFV 1% gel, we found that study participants, regardless of their underlying microbiota, had mean and median TFV-DP tissue concentrations that were 2 to 8 times higher than the 1,000 fmol/mg benchmark.",

Our cohort (n = 50 IVR users, with 41 TFV containing IVR users) was the same size as the cohort (n = 41) of TFV gel or film users evaluated by Hillier et al [16] and was similar in ethnic and racial background.

Given the inter-individual variability in the results, the small sample size is a limitation. However, unlike the large cohort (n = 688) reported by Klatt et al [17], our study and the FAME 04 sub-analysis [16] provided quantification of TFV-DP concentrations in genital tissue biopsies, which was not feasible in the larger CAPRISA 004 cohort [17].

These data support that the IVRs did not adversely change vaginal microbiota composition and structure during 2\u20133 weeks of use. Importantly, high local levels of TFV and TFV-DP were achieved with the IVRs among women with a diversity of vaginal microbiota, including BV associated bacteria. We propose that these IVRs will fill an important gap as MPTs that women, particularly those in less developed countries, can utilize to protect themselves from HIV-1, HSV-2 and unintended pregnancies.",
