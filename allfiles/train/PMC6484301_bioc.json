Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial\u2010epithelial co\u2010cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced \u03b1\u2010diversity but increased \u03b2\u2010diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides\n.\nCoprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade\u2010related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial\u2010epithelial co\u2010cultures, RE patient\u2010derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u03b2 expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE.",

In 2002, Pietro Delia5 reported that use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus could prevent the occurrence of diarrhoea in patients receiving radiotherapy. Later, Crawford and Gordon6 revealed that germ\u2010free mice were markedly resistant to lethal RE. And after faecal microbiota transplantation, the intestinal function and survival rate were significantly improved in irradiated mice.7 These reports suggest a human\u2010microbiome link upon irradiation and provided an insight into potential radio\u2010protective therapeutics.",

Species accumulation boxplot showed that the gene richness approached saturation as a function of sample size, indicating the number of samples was sufficient to resolve most of the genera present (Figure S1). Then we investigated the richness and evenness of gut microbiota in patients with RE (RE group, N\u00a0=\u00a010) compared with patientswho did not have RE (non\u2010RE group, N\u00a0=\u00a08). \u03b1\u2010diversity of RE patients was markedly reduced as indicated by Simpson and Shannon indices (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.006 and 0.004 respectively, Figure \u200bFigure1A,B).1A,B). Similarity of microbiome community structures was further compared by Unifrac analysis of distance matrix with 10\u00a0000 permutations (Figure S2). Boxplot indicated a significantly higher \u03b2\u2010diversity of RE patients (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.000, Figure \u200bFigure1C,D).1C,D).

At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes was the most predominant gut microbiota, contributing 38.59% and 54.12% in RE group and in non\u2010RE group respectively, followed by Proteobacteria (37.10% and 15.97%) and Firmicutes (24.01% and 29.66%) (Figure \u200b(Figure2A).2A). The relative abundance of Proteobacteria in RE patients was significantly higher (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.028), while less abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes did not reach statistical significance. At the class level, a significant increase was observed in the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in the RE group (32.41% vs 11.46%, \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.039, Figure \u200bFigure2B).2B). Upon closer examination of taxonomic data, we noted that RE group was enriched with order Enterobacteriales (26.63% vs 8.55%, \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.038) and Oceanospirillales (0.059% vs 0.095%, \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.039) from the Gammaproteobacteria class. At the family level, eight families were presented at significantly altered proportions (Figure \u200b(Figure2C,2C, \u03c1\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in RE patients compared to non\u2010REs.

Genus\u2010level analysis was more informative (Figure \u200b(Figure2D).2D).

Other minor genera significantly less\u2010abundant in RE patients were Blautia (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.010) and Ruminococcaceae_UCG\u2010003 (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.048).",

It revealed 79 discriminative features (LDA score\u00a0>\u00a04, Figure \u200bFigure3A,B).3A,B). Members of Bacteroides, Bacteroidaceae and Plebeius were enriched in non\u2010REs, whereas Megamonas,\nNovosphingobium and Prevotella were enriched in RE samples. The latter three could thus be used as biomarkers to identify RE patients. A cladogram represented the structure of faecal microbiota and the predominant bacteria was shown in Figure \u200bFigure3C.3C. It provided the relationship between taxa at different taxonomic levels. For example, Desulfovibrionaceae (family) was under Desulfovibrionales (order) which was under Deltaproteobacteris (class).",

The results showed that 595 distinct OTUs were shared by all the RE patients over irradiation, 180 distinguished pre\u2010RT patients and 58 distinguished post\u2010RT patients (Figure \u200b(Figure4A).4A). The core set was characterized by genera Prevotella_9, Bacteroides, Serratia, Roseburia, Prevotella_2, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, Veillonella, Sutterella and Megamonas. Most of these genera were differentially distributed (Figure \u200b(Figure4B,C).4B,C). Diversity (as measured with Simpson and Shannon indices) was decreased in patients who later suffered RE over radiotherapy, although no significant difference was observed (Figure \u200b(Figure4D).4D). Genus Coprococcus was obviously significantly enriched in pre\u2010RT samples (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.034, Figure \u200bFigure4E\u2010upper).4E\u2010upper). LEfSe analysis further revealed two discriminative features (LDA score\u00a0>\u00a04, Figure \u200bFigure4E\u2010lower);4E\u2010lower); members of Coprococcus and Desulfovibrio were enriched in the pre\u2010RT samples.

No grade 4 or 5 was recorded. Relative to those with mild toxicity, patients with severe enteritis had a significantly reduced \u03b1\u2010diversity (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.034, Figure \u200bFigure5A)5A) but a non\u2010significantly increased \u03b2\u2010diversity (Figure \u200b(Figure5B).5B). Patients at grade 3 RE had lowest \u03b1\u2010diversity and highest \u03b2\u2010diversity among all the RE patients, indicating a potential trend of gradual microbial response to radiation inflammation.

Why some patients develop severe RE while others do not is a long\u2010standing and \u2010perplexing question. In this study, we for the first time identified alterations in gut microbial profiles following RE development using high\u2010throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Within limitation of the small patient cohort, we demonstrate that (a) patients with different grades and phases of RE have their own characteristic gut microbiota, and (b) the radiation\u2010induced dysbiosis in turn promotes inflammatory responses in the host.",

For example, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was markedly altered prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed diarrhoea.21 Patients with acute post\u2010radiotherapy diarrhoea had profound increase in Actinobacteria and Bacilli, and decrease in Clostridia.22 In our study, unique microbial signatures were observed at the tested grades and phases of RE. Patients with RE had a significantly altered microbial diversity and composition over irradiation. Genus Serratia, Bacteroides and Prevotella_9 were more abundant in RE patients, while Bacteroides was markedly reduced. Furthermore, we found a RE grade\u2010related microbial signature. There was a lowest \u03b1\u2010diversity while a highest \u03b2\u2010diversity of gut flora in grade 3 RE patients, as well as significantly different abundance of several selected genera between patients with severe or mild enteritis. More striking findings were associated with changes in gut microbiota before radiation. Patients who later progressed to RE had obviously enriched Coprococcus before irradiation and decreased \u03b1\u2010diversity after irradiation. These results may be related to differences in the severity of local mucosal inflammation, or changes in epithelial permeability or barrier. Factors which were not investigated here might also play a part.

                    "text": "We did some preliminary in vitro experiments to explore whether and how the microbiota affected the radiation\u2010associated tissue damage. Incubating colonic epithelial cells with faecal bacteria from patients with severe RE impaired cell layer integrity, increased cell layer permeability and stimulated cytokine secretion and NF\u2010\u03baB activation. Thus the dysbiotic microbiota might in part directly induce barrier dysfunction and inflammatory response on the epithelial cells. Otherwise, microbiota significantly differed following local radiation treatment. And these changes paralleled with the cytokine profile in patients with or without RE. It was suggested the host immune response upon irradiation shapes the microbial community structure. When cells are exposed to radiation, leucocytes infiltrate into the irradiated normal cells. Various signalling pathways are activated, accompanied with secretion of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, shedding of mucosa, disruption of barrier and initiation of coagulation cascade.23 For example, pathway analysis on the gene expression profiles has identified\u00a0radiation\u2010induced time\u2010, dose\u2010 and even segment\u2010dependent up\u2010regulation of TNF\u2010\u03b1, claudin\u20102, MMP7 and EDA2R.24 Radiation also provokes increase in MPO activity and CXC chemokine levels.25 Activation of these pathways suggest that colon sustains severe mucosal inflammation and barrier disruption, and might influence and disturb the balance of microecology. We previously demonstrated that loss of Syndecan\u20101 in the inflamed intestine impaired normal intestinal barrier and led to bacterial translocation through mucosa.14 Winter et al26, 27 found that host\u2010derived nitrate in response to mucosal inflammation conferred a growth advantage to commensal Escherichia coli or pathogenic Salmonella enterica in the mice intestine. Taken together, although it is tricky to\u00a0decipher\u00a0the question of cause and effect, these data are still sufficient to confirm that the unique radiation\u2010induced dysbiosis is closely associated with inflammatory response.",

                    "text": "Our results suggested that the pre\u2010existing changes in gut microbial ecology may serve as a predictive marker to identify patients who are more likely to progress to RE during pelvic irradiation, in agreement with Wang et al's proposal.21 Moreover, our data suggested possibility to prevent or treat RE by targeting the gut microbiota. In mouse model, gavage of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG before radiation repositioned COX\u20102 expression through TLR\u20102/MyD88 signalling and reduced epithelial apoptosis and crypt loss from radiation injury.28 In patients, prevention of radiotherapy\u2010induced mucositis by probiotics has been investigated in several clinical trials.29, 30 Although the results were inconsistent, and strong evidence is lacking, there was still some promising data. Chitapanarux's randomized study included 63 patients treated with pelvic radiotherapy concurrent with weekly cisplatin chemotherapy. As compared with placebo, treatment with live Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Bifidobacterium bifidum resulted in improved stool consistency and less usage of anti\u2010diarrhoeal medication.31 In Urbancsek's larger randomized trial with 206 irradiated patients, supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus led to less frequently needed anti\u2010diarrhoeal drugs.32 Furthermore, L. Fuccio33 systemically reviewed clinical trials including the above two. However, no significant differences were confirmed between probiotic supplementation and\u00a0placebos. Despite the few available trials and the presence of significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity might limit the analysis, encouraging results have been indeed observed in some patients. Because not all probiotics exert favourable effects, possibly owing to variability of probiotics and patient characteristics, the importance of identifying the classification of patients and the ideal type and dose of bacterial strains need to be addressed in further high\u2010quality clinical trials. Moreover, cancer patients are generally at risk of disease\u2010 or treatment\u2010related immunosuppression. Microbial preparation may induce detrimental effects in these individuals; note some published reports of septic complications because of probiotics.34 Therefore, safety concerns about the use of probiotics should also be carefully investigated.",
