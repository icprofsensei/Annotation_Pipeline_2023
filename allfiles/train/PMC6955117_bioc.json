Patients on their first and second recurrence had an excellent clinical response rate, and only one patient on the FMT group that was suffering from a first recurrence did not meet the study criteria for resolution at 72\u2009h after FMT; the same patient had a retransplant, and clinical resolution was achieved without recurrence at six months. These results challenge the fact that FMT should be considered after the second recurrence since there was an overwhelming response rate in patients with the first recurring episode without severe adverse effects. This might be related to lower dysbiosis during the first and second recurrences.",

The second factor was that we did not analyze the totality of the samples from both groups and this possibly had selection bias, and finally that the amount of Lactobacillus spp. that was used for enrichment in relation to the quantity of the whole microbiota was too small to make a significant difference.",
