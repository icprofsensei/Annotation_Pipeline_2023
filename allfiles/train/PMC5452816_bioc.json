Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection potentially offers a less invasive alternative for lung microbiota sampling. We compared lung microbiota samples retrieved by protected specimen brushings (PSB) and exhaled breath condensate collection. We also sought to assess whether aerosolized antibiotic treatment would influence the lung microbiota and whether this change could be detected in EBC. EBC was collected from 6 conscious sheep and then from the same anesthetized sheep during mechanical ventilation. Following the latter EBC collection, PSB samples were collected from separate sites within each sheep lung. On the subsequent day, each sheep was then treated with nebulized colistimethate sodium. Two days after nebulization, EBC and PSB samples were again collected. Bacterial DNA was quantified using 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR. The V2-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Quality control and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering were performed with mothur. The EBC samples contained significantly less bacterial DNA than the PSB samples. The EBC samples from anesthetized animals clustered separately by their bacterial community compositions in comparison to the PSB samples, and 37 bacterial OTUs were identified as differentially abundant between the two sample types. Despite only low concentrations of colistin being detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, PSB samples were found to differ by their bacterial compositions before and after colistimethate sodium treatment. Our findings indicate that microbiota in EBC samples and PSB samples are not equivalent.",

The inconvenience and perceived discomfort of participating in this kind of research may deter healthy volunteers and may not be a safe option for patients with advanced lung disease. This study set out to evaluate a less invasive method for collecting lung microbiota samples by comparing samples taken via protected specimen brushings (PSB) to those taken via exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection. We found that there was less bacterial DNA in EBC samples compared with that in PSB samples and that there were differences between the bacterial communities in the two sample types. We conclude that while EBC and PSB samples do not produce equivalent microbiota samples, the study of the EBC microbiota may still be of interest.",

We sought to assess the feasibility of using EBC in sheep to study the lung microbiota composition.

In a previous study, we examined the effect of intravenous CMS on the lung microbiota (9). While we did identify changes in the lung microbiota composition, the longer-term systemic antibiotic treatment used in that study also likely affected the gut microbial populations. Immunological links between gut and lung immunities, the gut-lung axis, raise the possibility that such changes may have indirectly influenced the lung microbiota (14). In this study, we delivered nebulized CMS, since this has been shown to lead to lower colistin plasma concentrations than injected CMS (15), enabling us to discern the direct effect of antibiotic treatment on respiratory bacterial communities.",

Some biases were identified (see Data Set S2 in the supplemental material). Three species were incorrectly identified at the species level (Acinetobacter baumannii was misidentified as Acinetobacter\nrhizosphaerae, Clostridium beijerinckii was misidentified as Clostridium butyricum, and Neisseria meningitidis was misidentified as Neisseria cinerea). Two of the bacterial species which were present in low numbers in the original community were not identified at any taxonomic level, namely, Actinomyces odontolyticus and Bacteroides vulgatus. Their absence is likely due to the fact that they were in low abundance rather than the inability of our protocol to amplify and identify them, as they have previously been identified using the same protocol on a nonstaggered version of the same mock community (10). We were also previously able to identify Enterococcus faecalis at the genus level, whereas in this study, it could not be identified except potentially as OTU 10, Bacilli (class). This discrepancy, combined with the fact that E. faecalis is in low abundance in the staggered mock community, leads us to believe that this identification is incorrect.",

Therefore, as well as mock community controls, DNA extraction kit reagent controls were produced. DNA was extracted from samples in four batches and a reagent control was included with every batch. The bacterial OTUs identified in the extraction kit controls did not occur consistently in samples from the same batch (Fig. 1). Samples were clustered by DNA extraction batch (P < 0.001 by analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA]), and 30 OTUs were found to be indicative of specific batches (see Data Set S3). However, when these OTUs were removed from the data set, samples still clustered by extraction batch (P = 0.014 by AMOVA), indicating that clustering was not entirely due to the presence of these OTUs. It is possible that some of these OTUs may be found naturally within the sheep respiratory system (e.g., Micrococcus luteus, a common colonizer of the human upper respiratory tract). Therefore, we decided not to remove these OTUs from our data set. Since samples were randomly assigned to extraction batches, clustering by batch would be unlikely to lead to false-positive statistical results. However, there is the possibility that the presence of contaminating organisms may increase the heterogeneity and thereby also increase stochastic noise.",

As well as containing a larger quantity of bacterial DNA, PSB samples also contained bacterial communities that were significantly different from those of the EBC (anaes) samples (P = 0.011 by AMOVA) (Fig. 4). This may be explained by the difference in variation between the two groups (P = 0.026 by homogeneity of molecular variance [HOMOVA]). Bacterial communities from PSB samples were also found to be significantly richer (P = 0.006 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test), but there was no significant difference in diversity (P = 0.48 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test). One OTU designated Pseudomonas veronii, which was the 4th most abundant OTU in PSB samples, was found to be significantly more abundant in PSB samples (PSB samples [mean \u00b1 SD], 3.9% \u00b1 1.3%; EBC, only one sequence read found in one sample; Metastats q value = 0.046). The P. veronii OTU was not found in any of the PSB controls, indicating that its presence is not likely due to contamination. This indicates that the EBC samples do not simply contain a subset of the most abundant OTUs from PSB samples. An additional 36 low-abundance OTUs (<1% abundant on average in either group) were found to be significantly different between the two groups by Metastats.",

We compared the quantities of bacterial DNA and the bacterial communities from samples taken by PSB and EBC collection in six sheep at two sampling points. EBC was collected from both conscious and anesthetized animals. During mechanical ventilation, the animals were intubated, meaning that the exhaled breath collected was derived only from the lower respiratory tract. By comparing these samples to those taken from conscious animals, it should be possible to analyze the extent of contamination by bacteria from the upper respiratory tract in EBC (cons) samples. We found that EBC samples contained significantly less bacterial DNA than the PSB samples and that PSB samples clustered separately from EBC (anaes) samples by the composition of their bacterial communities. EBC (anaes) and EBC (cons) samples did not cluster separately from one another.",

In comparison, when PCR assays for 10 common respiratory pathogens were performed on EBC and sputum samples from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, the results were found not to correlate well (17).

This dilution could explain the far lower concentrations of bacterial DNA we identified in EBC samples in comparison to those from PSB samples. It is also likely that PSB would be more efficient for sampling biofilms adhered to the lung mucosa, which could explain some of the differences observed between the two sample types. The difference between the bacterial communities found in PSB and EBC samples may also be partially explained by how EBC is formed. The exact origin of EBC is still under debate, but it has been suggested that differences observed between BAL and EBC samples could be explained by the fact that different compartments of the lung are sampled (22). While it might be assumed that EBC would be derived from both the central and peripheral airway compartments, which would perhaps explain the differences between these samples and PSB samples, Bondesson et al. concluded that the majority of EBC is in fact derived from the central airways (23). Without a better understanding of how EBC is formed and what influences its composition, we are unable to account for the differences we observed between the two sampling types.",

In a previous study, we found that the relative proportion of Gram-negative bacteria in the lung microbiota (excluding Pseudomonadales) was reduced after injected CMS treatment (9). However, members of Pseudomonadales generally increased in relative abundance or remained stable after treatment. Therefore, it is interesting to note that while in this study we did not find a significant reduction in the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria in PSB samples (data not shown), an OTU belonging to Pseudomonadales (P. veronii) was significantly increased in these samples after CMS treatment. It is possible that, even at low concentrations, the colistin may have had some effect on the lung bacteria or that the sampling strategy may itself in some way lead to changes in the lung microbiota, but at the moment, this is purely speculative. All samples were randomized prior to DNA extraction and PCR amplification; therefore, the observed differences were not due to samples from one time point being processed separately from those from the other time point.",

This treatment was repeated 6 h later. Two days after the first CMS dose was administered, EBC (cons), EBC (anaes), and PSB samples were again collected as described above. Sheep were killed by barbiturate overdose and exsanguination and blood samples were collected. Blood was centrifuged at 2,500 \u00d7 g for 5 min and the serum was removed and frozen on dry ice. Immediately postmortem, 20-ml aliquots of PBS were used to collect BAL fluid. The urea concentrations in plasma and BAL fluid were used to calculate the dilution factor of lung epithelial lining fluid in BAL fluid (25).",

The quantitation of colistin in ovine BAL fluid essentially follows the method previously published by Marchand et al. (26). Briefly, colistin sulfate (item no. 17584 [mixture of A and B isoforms]; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, Ml, USA) was dissolved in H2O to 1 mg/ml and a series of 7 calibrant solutions were created by diluting the stock solution into blank BAL fluid to cover the range from 100 to 0.07 \u03bcg/ml. Polymyxin B (Sigma-Aldrich, Irvine, UK) was used as an internal standard and was dissolved in water to 300 \u03bcg/ml. Two microliters of internal standard was added to 200 \u03bcl of each of the calibrant solutions and to 200 \u03bcl of each of the test samples. Eight hundred microliters of a solution of H2O and 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid was added to each of the samples/calibrants, and each was partially purified by binding to a DSC-18 SPE cartridge (Sigma-Aldrich, Irvine, UK) and eluted with 400 \u03bcl methanol (MeOH) and 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid. The eluted fractions were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 50 \u03bcl of H2O and 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid for subsequent analysis.",
