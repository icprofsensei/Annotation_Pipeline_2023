All children and adolescent acute leukemia patients will undergo chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen. Fortunately, survival rates for most pediatric cancers have improved at a remarkable pace over the past three decades, and the overall survival rate is greater than 90\u00a0% today. However, significant differences in survival rate have been found in different age groups (94\u00a0% in 1\u20139.99\u00a0years, 82\u00a0% in \u226510\u00a0years and 76\u00a0% in \u226515\u00a0years). ALL accounts for about three out of four cases of childhood leukemia. Intensive chemotherapy treatment coupled with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotic use could potentially have a long-term effect on the resident gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome. The composition of GI microbiome and its changes upon chemotherapy in pediatric and adolescent leukemia patients is poorly understood. In this study, using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences we profile the GI microbial communities of pediatric and adolescent acute leukemia patients before and after chemotherapy treatment and compare with the microbiota of their healthy siblings.",

We assessed the GI microbiota composition in pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL during the course of chemotherapy by comparing stool samples taken before chemotherapy with stool samples collected at varying time points during the chemotherapeutic treatment. The microbiota profiles of both patients and control sibling groups are dominated by members of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium. At the genus level, both groups share\u00a0many taxa in common, but the microbiota diversity of the patient group is significantly lower than that of the control group. It was possible to distinguish between the patient and control groups based on their microbiota profiles. The top taxa include Anaerostipes, Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus2 with relatively higher abundance in the control group. The observed microbiota changes are likely the result of several factors including a direct influence of therapeutic compounds on the gut flora and an indirect effect of chemotherapy on the immune system, which, in turn, affects the microbiota.",

                    "text": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease of the bone marrow in which early lymphoid precursors proliferate and replace the normal hematopoietic cells of the marrow [1]. The lymphoid progenitor cells in patients with ALL are affected by the disease, leading to an impaired immune system typically observed at the time of diagnosis. ALL is the most common type of leukemia in children in the United States accounting for 26\u00a0% of all cancers in children up to 14\u00a0years of age and for 75\u00a0% of all pediatric leukemia cases [2]. All children and adolescents diagnosed with ALL will undergo chemotherapy as part of their treatment plan, and their health can be severely compromised due to the treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Chemotherapy can damage healthy cells in the lining of the digestive system and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances are often induced in response to chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutic and antibiotic treatment has a detrimental impact on the host microbial ecosystem, which is essential for host mucosal protection [3]. The cytotoxic effects of these treatments lead to additional immunosuppression, which entails episodes of febrile neutropenia and potentially life-threatening bloodstream infections. Further, use of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics disrupts the GI microbiome\u2019s ecological balance [4]. Medium-term gastrointestinal health outcomes of chemotherapy and disruptions of the intestinal microbial ecology include vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and Clostridium difficile infection-associated diarrhea (CDAD). To varying degrees, survivors of children and adolescents treated for cancer experience a range of long-term growth and developmental, organ function, fertility and reproduction and psychological adverse outcomes. The growing population of survivors of pediatric cancer reflects a highly vulnerable group of individuals who will probably experience adverse health-related and quality-of-life outcomes during their subsequent lifetimes, as a result of their curative cancer treatment [5\u20138]. There is increasing evidence that the composition of the GI microbiome may affect, and is modulated by, the human immune system [9]. Perturbed GI microbiomes have been associated with decreased immune competence, detrimental metabolic changes (e.g. obesity and malnutrition), susceptibility to GI infections and inflammatory syndromes [10, 11]. Likewise, several microbiome studies have examined the impact of antibiotics on the microbiota of individuals using 16S rRNA gene sequencing alone [12\u201316] or combined with metatranscriptomics [17]. These studies have demonstrated that administration of antibiotics can perturb this microflora temporarily and in certain cases permanently. Antibiotic-mediated alteration of the gut microbiome can converts the global metabolic profile to one that favors C. difficile germination and growth [18]. Furthermore, chemotherapeutics have a detrimental effect on the intestinal microbial composition, coinciding in time with the development of chemotherapy-induced mucositis [19]. There is, however, a limited understanding of the GI microbiome composition of pediatric and adolescent leukemia patients and the impact, if any, of contemporary chemotherapeutic treatments. The rationale for this study is to define and compare the GI microbiota composition of pediatric and adolescent leukemia patients with their healthy sibling controls via analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. And also, to assess the changes in microbiota structure of pediatric and adolescent leukemia patients during chemotherapy by comparing the samples taken before and after chemotherapy at varying time points during the chemotherapeutic treatment. Our results provide significant information on GI microbiota composition in immunocompromised children and indicate that the baseline microbiota of immunocompromised children was substantially different from their healthy siblings. It creates the potential for the better management of GI and systemic complications associated with immunodeficiency and other disease conditions of this type. Furthermore, characterizing the GI microbiota dynamics following chemotherapy treatment will address what alterations happen to the GI microbiota during and following chemotherapy regimens and can correlate with response to treatment.",

The study cohort consisted of 51 participants, made up of 23 matched patients and a healthy sibling and five unmatched patients. Five patients who did not have enrolled healthy siblings were also included in the cohort. Three subjects not complete the study: two withdrew and one subject was deceased. Subject demographics by age and gender are shown in Table\u00a01. All study participants were enrolled in the Hyundai Cancer Institute, Children\u2019s Hospital Orange County (CHOC Children\u2019s), California, USA. Human subject protocol and consent forms were established, and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at CHOC Children\u2019s and the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Stool samples were collected at the completion of each treatment stage during the\u00a0patient's stay at the hospital, referred to as \u201csampling visits\u201d. Samples marked \u201cvisit 1\u201d were collected at the time of diagnosis before any chemotherapy was administered, and thus provided baseline microbiota for each patient. As such, patient\u2019s samples were collected before chemotherapy, during induction chemotherapy (chemotherapy given to induce a remission), consolidation chemotherapy (chemotherapy given once a remission is achieved) and during maintenance therapy (chemotherapy given in lower doses to assist in prolonging a remission). All healthy sibling controls were sampled once, aligning with the time period before chemotherapy began on the patient (Additional file 1: Table S1), however, four siblings samples were collected at two time points, which were excluded from the analysis. All patients with ALL enrolled in the study received antibiotic prophylaxis with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim during treatment and steroid prophylaxis at the induction stage. Incidental use of antibiotics and occurrence of infections in the month before each visit were recorded. Additional file 1: Table S1 provides details of the sampling visits for each patient over the period of enrollment.",

These primers included the i5 and i7 adaptor sequences for Illumina MiSeq sequencing as well as unique 8 bp indices incorporated onto both primers such that each sample received its own unique barcode pair. This method of incorporating the adaptors and index sequences onto the primers at the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) stage provided minimal loss of sequence data when compared to previous library construction methods that would ligate the adaptors to every amplicon after amplification. This method also allows generating sequence reads which were all in the same 5\u2032-3\u2032 orientation. Using approximately 100\u00a0ng of extracted DNA, the amplicons were generated with Platinum Taq polymerase (ThermoFisher, catalog no: 11304-011) and by using the following cycling conditions: 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min for an initial denaturing step followed by 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for a total of 35\u00a0cycles followed by a final extension step of 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 7\u00a0min then stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Once the PCR for each sample was completed, the amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, catalog no: 28104), quantified using Tecan fluorometric methods (Tecan Group, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland), normalized, and then pooled in preparation for cluster generation followed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing using the dual index 2x300 bp format (Roche, Branford, CT) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.",

Chimeric sequences were identified using the UCHIME [25] implementation in mothur; these sequences were removed from the downstream analysis. The resulting sequence set was clustered at different sequence identity thresholds (90, 95 and 97\u00a0%) using CD-HIT [26] to generate Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs); OTU representatives were assigned taxonomy using the mothur implementation of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier [27]. While the RDP classifier has a goal of generating genus-level taxonomic assignments, not all sequences could, however, be confidently assigned taxonomy to the genus level (using the bootstrap confidence threshold of 80\u00a0%); we denote these sequences by appending the tag unclassified to the end of their taxonomic assignment (one of phylum, class, order, or family levels).",

However, microbiome studies that investigate the role of bacteria in human disease have focused primarily on inflammatory bowel disease, which is caused by a chronic inflammatory process. Previous studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a contraction of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and an expansion of Proteobacteria [31]. Lachnospiraceae (which comprises the Clostridium XIVa and IV groups within the order Clostridiales) and Roseburia (butyrate-producing bacterium) were greatly reduced, in acute leukemia patients compared to a healthy sibling (Fig.\u00a01), but the Bacteroides are increased in patients compare to sibling\u00a0controls. Bacteria producing butyrate play a major role in the composition of the mucus layer, as butyrate is an important energy source for intestinal epithelial cells and plays a role in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis [32]. Several intestinal bacteria produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), with butyrate being the most thoroughly investigated. Butyrate is produced by F. prausnitzii and Clostridium XIVa and has been shown to have profound anti-inflammatory effects [32\u201336]. The observed reduction in Lachnospiraceae and Roseburia in acute leukemia patients may increase the risk of developing chemotherapy induced mucositis and other GI complications in childhood leukemia patients.",

As part of this, we evaluated differences in diversity for three cases: (a) diversity at Visit 2 (after chemotherapy) versus diversity at Visit 1 (before chemotherapy), (b) diversity at the final visit versus diversity at Visit 1, and (c) the average diversity for visits after Visit 1 versus diversity at Visit 1. For each of these comparisons, we used a paired (one sample) t-test to assess whether the difference in diversity was 0 or greater than 0. As shown in Fig.\u00a04, while the diversity increase was not significant for case (a) with a p-value of 0.318, the increase for subsequent visits were significant, with p-values of 0.00026 and 0.00643 for cases (b) and (c) respectively.",

The lymphoid progenitor cells in ALL patients are affected during the disease, leading to the impaired immune system typically observed at the time of diagnosis [21, 37]. It is known that microbiome community structure is determined by both host and environmental factors [38]. If any one of these factors is greatly perturbed, a drastic composition shift in the composition of the microbiome can be expected.",

                    "text": "Several microbiome studies have demonstrated that administration of antibiotics can perturb this microflora temporarily and in particular cases permanently [12\u201315, 39]. Antibiotic-induced shifts can increase susceptibility to C. difficile infection [18]. Similarly, mucosal barrier injury, characterized by both inflammation and cell loss in the epithelial barrier lining of the gastrointestinal tract, is one of the most debilitating side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment [39, 40]. However, the composition of GI microbiota in pediatric and adolescent leukemia patients and the microbiota changes after contemporary chemotherapy has not been investigated. Our study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to address a population of pediatric and adolescent patients with acute leukemia and to compare these patients with their sibling controls. This characterization of the GI microbiota in pediatric and adolescent patients with acute leukemia has provided significant information on GI microbiota populations in immunocompromised individuals and opens up the potential for developing novel diagnostics based on stool tests as well as developing therapies to improve the dysbiotic condition of the microbiota at the time of diagnosis and in the earliest stages of chemotherapy. This creates the potential for the better management of GI and systemic complications associated with immunodeficiency and other disease conditions of this type. Furthermore, characterizing the GI microbiota dynamics and immune response following chemotherapy treatment will address what alterations happen to the GI microbiota during and following chemotherapy regimens and may be correlated with response to treatment. We anticipate expanding this study to get more detailed information on microbial profiles that are associated with or that lead to the development of various infections including C. difficile and persistent diarrhea. Further, we may find that the composition of the microbiota may ultimately be used as an indicator as to how well a patient may respond to different chemotherapy treatments.",
