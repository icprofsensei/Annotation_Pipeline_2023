The inferred metagenomic pathways enriched in the CHB yellow tongue coating patients were mainly those involved in amino acid metabolism, which was consistent with the metabolic disorder. The abundances of bacteria from Bacteroidales at the order level were higher in the CHB white tongue coating patients (19.2% vs 27.22%, respectively, P = 0.011), whereas Neisseriales were enriched in the yellow tongue coating patients (21.85% vs 13.83%, respectively, P = 0.029).

                    "text": "Tongue diagnosis is a characteristic diagnostic method of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with a long history. TCM believes that the tongue is an important window for changes in the body, which are closely related to the zang and fu (internal organs), meridians, qi and xue (blood) and body fluids. Therefore, changes of the tongue can help doctors distinguish syndromes and guide diagnoses, which has great significance for clinical treatment via TCM. Different tongue coating colors in TCM have different treatment principles. Tongue diagnosis has the advantages of convenience and intuitiveness and represents first-hand information for TCM doctors that should not neglected. However, the physiological and pathological changes that contribute to the TCM tongue diagnosis have not been elucidated. According to TCM theory, the formation of tongue coating is closely related to wei-qi (spleen and stomach). Reports have noted that micro-ecological changes in the local flora are important manifestations of pathological tongue images[1]. As part of the human microbiome, the oral microbiota can interfere with the gut microbiota and is associated with multiple diseases[2]. The microbiota can produce metabolites and active ingredients that participate in the regulation of host metabolism and immunity and is closely related to the pathological processes of many diseases. Some reports have found abnormalities in the microbiota or metabolites in pathological tongue coatings[3,4]. However, integrated analyses of the pathological tongue coating microbiotas and metabolites have rarely been reported. As an important diagnostic factor, elucidating the \u201cintension\u201d of the material basis of tongue coatings and providing the scientific basis for individualized treatment and clinical syndrome differentiation have great significance in TCM.",

                    "text": "Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major infectious disease that may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In China, CHB is a huge health burden, and 60% and 80% of China\u2019s liver cirrhosis and HCC patients, respectively, are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)[5]. Intestinal bacteria are widely involved in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases, which can affect liver homeostasis based on energy absorption and storage, interfere with bile metabolism, participate in immune regulation and affect other processes[6]. Some studies have shown that dysbiosis of the oral microbiota may be involved in the development of HBV-induced chronic liver disease. Moreover, key oral-derived phylotypes may invade the gut as opportunistic pathogens and alter the composition of the gut microbiota, and cirrhotic patients have a more limited salivary defenses and worse inflammation than healthy patients[7]. In China, many patients with chronic liver disease are treated with TCM, which has been reported to decrease the incidence of liver cancer in a recent 15-year follow-up study of 21020 newly diagnosed CHB patients[8]. Changes in the tongue are important for TCM diagnoses[9,10], and CHB patients have different tongue coating phenotypes, which most commonly manifested as a yellow or a white tongue coating. These tongue coatings lead to different treatment strategies in TCM. Therefore, we speculate that microbiota differences may exist between CHB patients with different tongue coatings.",

A PCA plot based on the OTU distributions showed that the overall compositions of the tongue coating microbiota were not significantly shifted by age, gender, BMI and antiviral treatment (Supplementary Figure 1). However, the PLS-DA plot showed a clear separation between the CHB patients and the healthy groups, and the CHB yellow tongue coating and white tongue coating patients were also well separated (Figure \u200b(Figure1B).1B). A Venn diagram showed that 1569 OTUs were common in all samples and that 705 and 741 OTUs were unique to the CHB yellow tongue coating and white tongue coating patients, respectively (Figure \u200b(Figure1C).1C).

Indeed, an increasing number of studies have found that many diseases, including atherosclerosis[15], rheumatoid arthritis[16], diabetes[17] and liver cirrhosis[18], are accompanied by disorder of the oral and intestinal microbiotas. Although the oral and gut communities share little taxonomic resemblance, the oral and intestinal microflora have general dynamic characteristics[19], the oral bacterial populations seed the gut[20], and the observed bacterial structures in the oral cavity or intestine can predict each other[21]. Because tongue diagnosis has the advantages of intuition and simplicity, some scholars have recently discovered the importance of the tongue image for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of diseases[22,23]. The oral microbiota varies according to the different sampling sites with a high diversity[24], but as the tongue texture and tongue color form an important basis for diagnosis and treatment in TCM[25]. The treatments adopted for patients with white and yellow tongue coatings are different, thus, the tongue coating oral microbiotas were selected for analysis in our study, and the samples were grouped by the color of the tongue coating.",

Our recent study found that the gut microbiota was significantly altered in CHB patients with low Child-Pugh scores[27]. Evidence is accumulating that the intestinal microbiome has good clinical prospects as a target for the treatment of chronic liver disease. Chinese scholars transplanted the intestinal flora of healthy volunteers into HBeAg-positive CHB patients with long-term antiviral treatment, and this approach showed a good effect on HBeAg seroclearance[28]. However, few studies have been performed on the oral microbiotas in CHB patients. In one of the limited reports, Ling et al[29] noted the decreased diversity of the oral microbiotas in supragingival plaque samples from patients with HBV-induced chronic liver disease. However, in this study, the richness and diversity of the tongue coating did not differ between the CHB patients and healthy controls. Ren et al[30] used 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and metagenomic sequencing to examine oral microbial compositions and their functional variations in children with halitosis. They found that the tongue coatings of the subjects with halitosis had greater bacterial richness than those of the healthy subjects, but the number of OTUs and the Chao levels were slightly lower in the saliva samples from the subjects with halitosis than in the healthy subjects. The microbiotas among individuals and habitats are highly personalized in the oral cavity[31]. Therefore, we concluded that the data differences in data might be due to the use of different sampling sites.",

                    "text": "Taxonomic and predicted function differences were found between the CHB yellow and white tongue coating patients in the LEfSe analysis. The CHB yellow tongue coating patients had specific clinical and microbiota characteristics that were distinct from those of the white coating patients. First, the CHB patients with yellow tongue coatings had significantly higher viral titers but lower ALB levels than the white coating patients (P < 0.05). The remaining indicators of liver function, including TBIL, DBIL, ALT, AST, ALP, GGT and PT, exhibited elevated trend in the CHB yellow tongue coating patients. Because a yellow tongue is an important indicator for the diagnosis of CHB damp heat syndrome, the results are consistent with studies showing that the CHB damp-heat syndrome patients have higher ALT and AST levels[32], which indicats that these patients have greater liver damage. The correlation analysis between bacteria and metabolites also confirmed this outcome. The relatively dominant bacterial families in the CHB yellow tongue coating (Neisseriaceae and Gracilibacteria_bacterium_oral_taxon_873) were negatively correlated with the S-adenosyl-L-methionine level. S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which is also known as SAM or AdoMet, is a donor in the methylation reactions of all mammalian cells but is found most abundantly in the liver. Patients with chronic liver disease have reduced AdoMet levels, and reduced hepatic AdoMet levels can contribute to the development of oxidative stress, steatohepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)[33]. In addition, according to TCM, a yellow tongue coating is a manifestation of TCM hot Syndrome, which has been reported to be involved in inflammation or an immune regulation imbalance in the host[34,35]. Jiang et al[3] compared the yellow and white tongue coating microbiomes with those of gastritis patients and found that yellow dense tongue coating bacteria were associated with TCM hot syndrome-related inflammation such as halitosis, tonsil infection and periodontal inflammation. Therefore, we therefore hypothesized that the patients with CHB yellow tongue coatings might have had more inflammation, although this speculation requires further confirmation. Second, the yellow tongue coating subjects showed similarities at the phylum level with a gut disorder in patients with cirrhosis, which was manifested as a reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria content[18,26,36]. The LEfSe analysis suggested that Neisseriaceae was enriched in the yellow tongue coating patients and was positively correlated with the serum HBV-DNA level. Ling\u2019s research reported that members of Neisseriaceae were significantly more abundant in the oral microbiota of liver cirrhosis patients than in those of CHB patients[29]. Lv et al[37] found that Neisseriaceae, which are opportunistic pathogens, were enriched in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients. Third, according to the LDA score, the inferred metagenomic pathways that were enriched in the CHB yellow tongue coating patients were mainly those involved in amino acid metabolism, and the detected metabolites were mainly essential amino acids, including L-proline, L-valine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-lysine, glutamate and L-tryptophan, and were generally present in larger amounts trend in the yellow tongue coatings. The relationship between amino acid metabolism and the CHB patients with yellow tongue coatings is unclear, and relevant literature reports are limited. However, one report noted that people with the TCM damp-heat syndrome people with HBV-related chronic liver diseases, whom mainly manifested yellow greasy tongue coatings, had increased leucine, phenylalanine and valine expression in urinary metabolomic studies[38], which indirectly explained the severe disordered amino acid metabolism in CHB patients with the yellow coating. Finally, this study found that membrane transport (secretion system) and cell motility (bacterial motility proteins) were enriched in the yellow coatings, which indicated that the CHB yellow coating patients might be more susceptible to bacterial colonization. The functional analysis of tongue coating flora and metabolites in CHB white tongue coating patients lacked correspondence, the underlying reason might be the microbiotas functionality in the CHB white tongue coating patients were most likely related to genetic information processing, which association with metabolites is relatively little.",

The tongue coating bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3 region was amplified and sequenced with the Ion Torrent PGM\u2122 sequencing platform. The metabolites in the tongue coatings were examined using a LC-MS platform. The microbiota results were analyzed using Metastats analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis test and LEfSe analysis. The functionality of the microbiota was assessed using PiCRUST and compared among groups. The metabolomics enrichment analysis was performed with MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca). We correlated the microbiota with the clinical indices and metabolites and visualized the results with Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients > 0.3 and P < 0.05 in Cytoscape.",

Distinct from those of the white coating patients, the CHB yellow tongue coating patients had specific clinical and microbiota characteristics. The microbiota of the CHB patients with yellow tongue coatings had similarities with a gut disorder in patients with cirrhosis at the phylum level, which manifested as a reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria content. Neisseriaceae, which is a dominant bacterial family enriched in yellow tongue coating patients, was positively correlated with the serum HBV-DNA level. The inferred metagenomic pathways enriched in the CHB yellow tongue coating patients were mainly those involved in amino acid metabolism, whereas the detected metabolites were mainly essential amino acids and generally were present in larger amounts than in the white tongue coatings.",
