While pathogenic viruses may cause severe infections, non-pathogenic viruses may serve as potential markers for the level of immunosuppression. However, neither the complexity of the virome in different compartments nor the dynamics of the virus populations posttransplantation are yet understood. Therefore, in this study the virome was analyzed by metagenomic sequencing in simultaneously withdrawn bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and plasma samples of 15 LTRs. In seven patients, also follow-up samples were investigated for abundance and dynamics of virus populations posttransplantation. Five eukaryotic and two prokaryotic virus families were identified in BAL, and nine eukaryotic and two prokaryotic families in plasma. Anelloviruses were the most abundant in both compartments, followed by Herpes- and Coronaviruses. Virus abundance was significantly higher in LTRs than in healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.001). Up to 48 different anellovirus strains were identified within a single LTR. Analyses in the follow-up patients revealed for the first time a highly complex and unique dynamics of individual anellovirus strains in the posttransplantation period. The abundance of anelloviruses in plasma was inversely correlated with that of other eukaryotic viruses (Pearson correlation coefficient r = \u22120.605; p<0.05). A broad spectrum of virus strains co-exists in BAL and plasma of LTRs. Especially for the anelloviruses, a high degree of co-infections and a highly individual and complex dynamics after transplantation was observed. The biological impact of these findings and their relation to clinical variables remain to be elucidated by future analyses.",

So far there is only limited insight in the viral part of the microbiome, the human virome. Viruses may cause severe infections in immunocompromised individuals, such as transplant recipients [3\u20136]. Lung transplant recipients (LTRs) receive high level immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, severe infections with viruses of the Herpesviridae family as Cytomegalovirus (HCMV), or with respiratory viruses may occur and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation [3,7]. Also non-pathogenic viruses replicate at high levels in immunosuppressed persons. Especially Torque Teno Viruses (TTV) and other members of the Anelloviridae family, which are highly prevalent in the human population, extensively replicate under immunosuppression [5,8]. These non-pathogenic viruses have recently gained particular interest as first data shows that the TTV-level may reflect the extent of immunosuppression after lung transplantation and may be a useful marker for optimizing immunosuppressive therapy [9\u201312].",

The rest of the reads were mapped against 49087 viral complete genomes obtained from the NCBI GenBank [21] nuccore database [15,18]. We estimated the abundance of each viral strain in every individual, expressed as reads per million. Given the high correlation between duplicates (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.898; p<0.001), we decided to use the average abundance of each strain for further analyses. Reads not mapping to any of the above genomes were considered to be of unknown origin.

In plasma of healthy controls, only two eukaryotic viral families were identified, Anelloviridae and Herpesviridae (Fig 1C) as well as the two mentioned prokaryotic families.

Similar numbers of different strains per genogroup were found in the patient BAL and plasma samples. Only for genogroup 3 a significantly higher number of strains was found in plasma than in BAL (p<0.05; Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Fig 2B).

In both compartments various eukaryotic viruses were detected, and similar to what was shown previously, always anelloviruses were the most abundant ones [26,27], followed by members of the Herpesviridae family [5,26]. This is of particular importance given that herpesviruses contribute significantly to clinical complications after transplantation, by causing severe infections and by serving as trigger for rejection processes [28]. Other respiratory viruses identified especially in the BAL, such as coronaviruses and rhinoviruses, are important pathogens which may also contribute to rejection of the transplanted lung [29,30]. In both body compartments also prokaryotic viruses, especially Myoviridae and Siphoviridae (Caudovirales order) were found. Similarly, DeVlaminck et al. [5] found that Caudovirales were highly abundant after transplantation. While different studies show that presence and variety of different bacteriophages in the gut may contribute to human health or disease [31] such clinical effects are not clear for bacteriophages found in blood or lung. In the plasma samples, sequencing reads aligning to some viral families were identified, whose clinical significance in these patients is not fully understood. Given the low number of reads, their presence should be confirmed in further studies.",

However, anelloviruses, and in particular TTV, have gained substantial interest in the last years as it was shown that the plasma TTV-load may reflect the level of immunosuppression after transplantation. Also the present findings showed a clearly lower TTV abundance in healthy individuals compared to LTRs who receive drug-induced immunosuppression. The TTV-load, measured by a PCR assay covering the vast majority of TTV strains, is currently considered as a potential marker for guiding immunosuppressive drug therapy after transplantation [8,33,34]. However, so far no detailed and comprehensive analyses of the anellovirus populations present in the transplanted host and its dynamics over time have been performed. By using NGS and metagenomic analyses we here reveal for the first time that there is a highly complex pattern of anellovirus populations and kinetics in different body compartments.",

Further analyses are required to clarify whether individual virus strains are better adapted to a particular environment within the body, as has been reported for bacterial populations [35]. Similar to other studies, TTV strains of genogroup 3 were the most common in both compartments [36,37], which raises the question whether these anellovirus strains are better adapted to the human host than others or whether they circulate more frequently in most populations.",

They may be present at undetectable levels already before immunosuppression, or they are acquired before transplantation during the patients\u2019 course of CF or COPD. Also a part of the strain populations may derive from anellovirus strains transferred to the host by the donor lung [27]. In any case, these data further suggest that there is little or no cross immunity between the different anellovirus strains [36].",

So far it is unclear what drives these dynamics and leads to such large changes in the individual level of replication of the individual virus strains over time. Also for HCMV it was revealed in the last years that different genotypes show a complex and not understood replication pattern over time after lung transplantation [38,39]. It remains to be evaluated whether host factors or virus specific factors drive such dynamics and what this may mean for the clinical development of the patients. Interestingly, Blatter et al. [34] recently reported that TTV from different genera are associated with different outcomes in pediatric lung transplantation. It remains to be investigated whether particular strains are also associated with acute rejection or other longer-term outcomes.",
