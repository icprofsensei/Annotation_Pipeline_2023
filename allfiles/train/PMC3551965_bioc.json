The distal gut of Bangladeshi children harbored significantly greater bacterial diversity than that of U.S. children, including novel lineages from several bacterial phyla. Bangladeshi and U.S. children had distinct fecal bacterial community membership and structure; the microbiota of Bangladeshi children was enriched in Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, and Oscillospira and depleted in Bacteroides relative to U.S. children (although similar to Bangladeshi adults). Furthermore, community membership and structure in Bangladeshi children was significantly less stable month-to-month than U.S. children.",

It is thought that the human indigenous gut microbiota may potentially serve a critical role in this disorder [4]. To date, the human gut microbiota has been characterized in depth using molecular approaches from individuals in only a few low-income areas of the developing world [5]. Recent work highlights the importance of geography in explaining the gut microbiota composition of adults and children [6], [7] and underscores the need to select additional geographic settings in an effort to characterize the global extent of human-associated microbial diversity [8]. Furthermore, the influence of geography on the temporal stability of the composition of the gut microbiota within healthy individuals has not previously been examined, in part because of the difficulty in obtaining serial samples from a consistently healthy reference population in areas with high rates of environmental enteropathy or other gastrointestinal conditions.",

Patient medical history, socioeconomic characterization, house location, and nutritional status were recorded by the ICDDR,B field team. Episodes of diarrheal illnesses and associated diagnosis and treatments were also recorded for each child. A monthly surveillance non-diarrheal fecal specimen was collected from each child. Field staff instructed caregivers to ask the child to defecate on a plastic sheet and to collect material from the top of a fresh stool pile that had not contacted any other surface. All fecal specimens were stored in stool collection vials and transported on ice to ICDDR,B within 2\u20134 hours after collection. Fecal samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Stools were screened for bacteria (including enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, Shigella flexneri, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella sp., Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Plesiomonas shigelloides), viruses (rotavirus, astrovirus, adenovirus), and parasites (Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, Hymenolepis nana, and hookworm) using standard culture methods, microscopy, and antigen detection tests (see [9] for the complete list of tested agents and detailed methods).

Thermal cycling consisted of 3 min at 94\u00b0C, and 25 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94\u00b0C, 45 s at 51\u00b0C, and 5 min at 72\u00b0C, followed by 10 min at 72\u00b0C. Gel electrophoresis was used to visualize the PCR products, and products from two to four replicate amplification reactions were pooled for each sample. PCR amplicons were gel purified and the DNA concentrations were quantified using the Quant-iT\u2122 PicoGreen\u00ae dsDNA reagent and kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Following quantitation, the amplicons were pooled in equimolar ratios and sequenced using the 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium platform (Roche, Branford, CT).",

To avoid redundancies in the final reference database, we clustered these 503 representative sequences and the Greengenes reference set with UCLUST at a similarity threshold of 97%. The 153 sequences that failed to cluster at this threshold setting were combined with the Greengenes reference sequences to form a combined Greengenes-Bangladesh reference database. This new Greengenes-Bangladesh reference database was aligned against the Greengenes core set alignment and a modified PH Lane mask was applied to trim the sequences to the V1\u2013V3 region and then clustered at a 99% similarity threshold. The most abundant sequence within each OTU was selected as the OTU representative sequence. The resulting final Greengenes-Bangladesh reference database contained 63,774 representative OTUs.

Pyrosequencing reads within the 97% similarity threshold were identified with UCLUST (800,465 query reads binned into 1,831 reference OTUs). 45,205 query reads that failed to cluster with reference sequences at this similarity threshold were binned into 2,609 new OTUs. The most abundant sequence within each new or reference OTU was chosen as the OTU representative sequence. Because novel sequences were discovered in the Bangladeshi near full-length dataset (as described below), one benefit of using this hybrid reference database and de novo clustering approach was that OTU clusters were first seeded with high-quality reference sequences; the de novo clustering allowed the binning of novel reads (instead of discarding them). The PyNAST alignment algorithm [16] was used to align OTU representative sequences against the Greengenes core set alignment with a minimum alignment length of 150 and a minimum identity of 75% (35 OTU representative sequences failed to align). The OTU representative sequences were screened for chimeras with the Chimera Slayer algorithm and the BLAST fragments approach in QIIME, and the intersecting set of flagged sequences from both methods (1,848 representative sequences) were excluded from the alignment and downstream analysis. The PH Lane mask was applied to the alignment to retain the conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene and omit the hypervariable regions for phylogenetic inference. Based on this alignment of OTU representative sequences, a phylogenetic tree was inferred using FastTree software [17]. Taxonomy was assigned to each OTU representative sequence using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier trained on the Greengenes full-length reference database (gg_99_otus_4feb2011_aligned.fasta) [18], [19]. The taxonomic assignment of each sequence was truncated at the most specific taxonomic level with a confidence score of at least 80%.",

Rarefaction, to a subsampling depth (determined by the minimum number of sequences in a sample from a single time point) of 6,596 reads/sample (unless otherwise noted) and 5 iterations, was performed on all samples to standardize the sequencing effort. Alpha diversity was measured with the Chao1 (richness), Phylogenetic Diversity (branch length-based diversity [20]), Shannon entropy (OTU-based diversity), and observed species metrics. Alpha diversity means and statistical significance tests were calculated in Excel and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM). Beta diversity was evaluated with UniFrac, a community dissimilarity metric based on the fraction of unique branch length observed in pairs of communities in a common phylogenetic tree [21], [22]. The phylogenetic distance (UniFrac distance) is calculated as the fraction of unshared branch lengths between the pair of communities.

The age-matched U.S. children (3 Chinese-Americans, 1 European-American) lived in upper-middle class households and consumed typical Western diets. Compared to the daily diet of the Bangladeshi children, the typical diet of the U.S. children was more diverse and included carbohydrates, vegetables, and various sources of animal protein.",

Overall, the Bangladeshi children exhibited greater diversity, including greater evenness, than the U.S. children, as revealed by the individual rarefaction and rank abundance curves (Figure 1A and Figure S1B) and the Shannon Equitability Index (0.70 \u00b1 0.01 for Bangladeshi children and 0.63 \u00b1 0.01 for U.S. children; P<0.0001, two-tailed t-test with unequal variance; Figure 1B).

In unweighted UniFrac PCoA, the first principal coordinate (PC1) captured 30% of intersample variance and revealed a sharp distinction between the gut microbiota of Bangladeshi and U.S. children (Figure 2A). This difference was significant with a non-parametric permutation analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) test, analogous to the univariate ANOVA (analysis of variance) test, where R\u200a=\u200a0.96 (p<0.001). Parallel results were obtained with weighted UniFrac analysis, where PC1 (55%) and PC2 (14%) resolved differences between Bangladeshi and U.S. children (Figure S3A), and with Bray-Curtis analysis (Figure S3B). When nine U.S. adult samples from three previously published studies [11], [25], [26] were included in the unweighted and weighted UniFrac analyses, the country clusters remained distinct (Figure S3C). Distinct clusters also distinguished U.S. adults and Bangladeshi adults (R\u200a=\u200a0.65; p<0.001), and U.S. adults and Bangladeshi children (R\u200a=\u200a0.76; p<0.001; Figure 2B and Table S1A).",

Similar unweighted UniFrac PCoA findings were attained at different OTU thresholds (90%, 95%, and 99%) (data not shown). All children were distinct from each other (ANOSIM pairwise comparisons generated an R>0.5; p<0.05) except Bangladeshi child 9F when compared to Bangladeshi child 12 M or Bangladeshi child 13 M (Table S1B). The observation that the three Chinese-American children clustered separately from the only European-American child in the cohort may be due to dietary or genetic factors. Clustering associated with gender (R\u200a=\u200a0.07; p<0.05), age, seasonality, collection month, nutrition status, and mother's education level was not observed, although the number of individuals in this study was small and may have precluded the identification of significant differences based on these variables (Figures S5A and S5B; additional data not shown). Averaged, unweighted UniFrac distances supported observations from previous studies indicating that inter-individual variation is greater than intra-individual variation (Figure 3A) [38]. Unweighted and weighted UniFrac analysis revealed a tight clustering pattern between pairs of biological or technical replicates (Figures S4 and S5C). The variation between replicate pairs (measured by unweighted UniFrac distances) was significantly less than intra- or inter-individual variation (Figure 3A). Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that the gut microbiota of children in Bangladesh and the United States is distinct, and that children in these two locales show both compositional individuality and temporal stability in their distal gut microbiota. Further studies and additional subjects are necessary to confirm these results.",

Within the phylum Bacteroidetes, the genus Prevotella was the most prevalent genus in Bangladeshi children and adults, while the Bacteroides genus was the most prevalent in U.S. children (Figure 4 and Figure S6B). After Bacteroides (41%), the most abundant taxa in U.S. children included the family Ruminococcaceae (7%) and the genera Faecalibacterium (6%), Dialister (5%), and Roseburia (4%) within the phylum Firmicutes (Figure 4A). U.S. and Bangladeshi children were both colonized by Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a prominent butyrate-producer. Dialister invisus, a Gram-negative, obligate anaerobe was highly abundant in U.S. child 10 M (Figure S6B). All of the Verrucomicrobia-associated reads found in the U.S. children were classified as Akkermansia muciniphila (2%) (Figure 4A). U.S. children 10 M and 13 M were particularly enriched in this species. After Prevotella (14%), the most prominent taxa in the Bangladeshi children included the family Ruminococcaceae (11%), the order Clostridiales (10%), and the genera Butyrivibrio (8%) and Oscillospira (6%) of the Firmicutes phylum (Figure 4B). Other relatively abundant taxa in Bangladeshi children included the putative order RF39 within Tenericutes (7%), the genus Bifidobacterium within Actinobacteria, and the lineage YS2 related to Cyanobacteria (1%). As with the U.S. and Bangladeshi children, the Ruminococcaceae family (8%) and the putative order RF39 (7%) were prevalent in Bangladeshi adults (Figure 4C). Like Bangladeshi children, Bangladeshi adults also featured the putative order YS2 (1%), the order Clostridiales (4%), the genus Bifidobacterium (2%), and the genus Butyrivibrio (4%).",

The taxa shared by Bangladeshi and U.S. children consisted of Blautia, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus, Clostridiaceae-associated Clostridium, Lachnospiraceae-associated Clostridium (here and below, such lineages contain sequences misidentified as Clostridium and lack other named sequences), unclassified Clostridiales, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia (Figure 5). The three taxa that were found only in the U.S. children included Ruminococcaceae-associated Clostridium, Erysipelotrichaceae-associated Clostridium, and Holdemania. The taxa exclusive to the Bangladeshi children were affiliated with the phyla Bacteroidetes (Prevotella, unclassified Bacteroidales), Firmicutes (Sarcina, Mitsuokella, unclassified Clostridiales-FamilyXIII IncertaeSedis, Lactobacillus, Butyrivibrio), Tenericutes (Catenibacterium, p-75-a5, Bulleidia), Proteobacteria (Succinivibrio, Acinetobacter), and Cyanobacteria (unclassified YS2) (Figure 5). The most abundant Lactobacillus species present in the Bangladeshi children were L. salivarius, L. ruminis, L. gasseri, and L. crispatus. Besides the Lactobacillus genus, Butyrivibrio was also identified as being exclusive to Bangladeshi children. Of the thirteen taxa found in Bangladeshi children, but not U.S. children, Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Butyrivibrio, Catenibacterium, and unclassified YS2 were also present in Bangladeshi adults (Figures 4C, \u200b,5,5, and \u200band66).",

The two OTUs with relative abundances that were significantly higher in U.S. children than in Bangladeshi children were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The two OTUs that were significantly more abundant in the Bangladeshi children were classified within Butyrivibrio and Clostridiales (Table 3). That these two OTUs could not be resolved to a finer level of taxonomy (unassigned by the Greengenes database) is indicative of the presence of novel or unclassified species in the Bangladeshi children. This point is further underscored by the observation that 27 of the 185 novel OTUs from the set of near full-length sequences, shared less than 95% sequence similarity with any publicly-available sequence (Table 4 and Figure 7). The availability of near full-length sequences enabled species-level classification of a small proportion of the Prevotella OTUs found in the Bangladeshi children (data not shown). Only 216 of the 947 near full-length Prevotella sequences were classifiable at the species level (at a 99% similarity threshold) to a publicly-available, named sequence. Of these 216 classified, near full-length Prevotella sequences, 90% matched Prevotella copri and 7% matched Prevotella stercorea, two types of Gram-negative, anaerobic rods [39]. Representing 2% of the 216 sequences, Prevotella ruminocola has a predominant role in digesting hemicelluloses and pectin [40]. Overall, these results demonstrated that features shared with Bangladeshi adults \u2013 a preponderance of Prevotella and Butyrivibrio, and a lack of Bacteroides, among other taxa \u2013 contributed heavily to the compositional differences between Bangladeshi child distal gut microbiota and the microbiota of U.S. children.",

Intrapersonal monthly variation correlated inversely with age in the Bangladeshi child cohort, although the small number of children in this study prevents a robust analysis of this issue (Figure S7A). This age-related correlation was not observed among the U.S. child cohort (p>0.05). At the phylum level, a greater degree of variation in relative abundance was observed between the consecutive monthly samples from the Bangladeshi children compared to the U.S. children (Figure S8). Comparing the average unweighted UniFrac distance for only consecutive time points (rather than all time points, as above) between the two groups underscores the greater intra-individual temporal variation in the Bangladeshi children relative to the U.S. children (0.52 versus 0.39 respectively; p<0.001) (Figure S7B). Temporal autocorrelation was modeled to ensure that the time interval between samplings did not bias the unweighted UniFrac distances (Figure S7C).",

Three of the four U.S. children (U.S. children 12F, 14F, and 13 M) experienced more than 10% change in the relative abundance of their Bacteroides population for three out of five monthly transitions (Figure S9A). The most dramatic shift in the Bacteroides population occurred between the second and third months for U.S. child 14F, when the population sharply increased from 24% to 69% (a change of 45%). Large fluctuations in the relative abundance of Prevotella were observed in two of the Bangladeshi children, 12 M and 13 M (Figure S9B). Interestingly, Bangladeshi child 12 M, the only stunted child in the cohort (height-for-age Z-score<\u22122.0), experienced the highest Prevotella fluctuations from month to month with absolute differences ranging from 42% to 57%.",

Our results are similar to previous observations of higher bacterial diversity in children living in rural Burkina Faso compared to children from urban Italy [6]. Our findings also align with those of a 2012 study revealing that Venezuelan Amazonas and rural Malawian adults had higher bacterial diversity compared to U.S. adults living in metropolitan areas [7]. Notably, a 2011 study demonstrated that healthy Bangladeshi children (ages 2\u20133 years) had higher microbial diversity relative to malnourished children [5]. As an aside, we found that inter-individual variation in the fecal microbiome of these subjects is greater than intra-individual variation, a finding that is supported by a Human Microbiome Project study involving the largest cohort to date (242 individuals) [38].",

In an effort to focus exclusively on variation in the distal gut microbiome during states of health, we carefully selected the four Bangladeshi children for our study (9F, 13F, 12 M, and 13 M) according to stringent and consistent criteria, including an absence of diarrhea or confirmed enteric infectious disease for 8 consecutive months in total. Of the existing ICDDR,B cohort of \u223c420 children, only six children (including the four we studied) met these criteria. It is possible that our selection of children based on the absence of recent diarrhea and enteric infections is associated with the observed high diversity of their distal gut microbiota; diversity is thought to confer resilience by ensuring functional redundancy and ecosystem stability [44], [45], [46]. This explanation is supported by a 2012 study in which a cohort of healthy Bangladeshi children exhibited higher bacterial diversity compared to their siblings recovering from acute diarrheal illness [47]. Further studies involving more subjects are necessary to understand how the gut microbial diversity of Bangladeshi children with recent intestinal illness would compare to that of healthy children in Bangladesh or the U.S.",

With respect to the possibility of a contributing or causal role, the diverse microbiota of these Bangladeshi children may decrease susceptibility to pathogen invasion by preventing access of pathogens to the appropriate target cells or tissues [48], competing for nutrients [49], secreting antimicrobial peptides [50], and/or modulating the immune system [51]. Compared to conventional mice, strains of mice with low gut microbiota diversity are more susceptible to Salmonella enterica colonization and enterocolitis [52]. Reduced gut microbiota diversity has been implicated in several morbidities such as inflammatory bowel diseases [53] and diarrhea [54]. In our study, Bifidobacterium was enriched and Lactobacillus was exclusively found in Bangladeshi children. Numerous studies have investigated the properties of specific strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria that prevent pathogen invasion through competitive exclusion, production of antimicrobials, and other mechanisms [55]. Stecher et al. hypothesize that closely-related species may increase the likelihood of gut colonization by newly-incoming species due to favorable conditions that maximize growth for both the resident and incoming species [52]. This concept could potentially enable a more targeted use of probiotics to prevent gastrointestinal infections in Bangladeshi children who live in slum settings.",

                    "text": "Dietary factors may be particularly important in explaining the observed differences in the composition of the distal gut microbiota between the Bangladeshi and U.S. children. The diet of the Bangladeshi children was carbohydrate-rich and heavily dependent on rice, bread, and lentils with rarely any meat. Their U.S. counterparts consumed typical Western diets including animal fat and protein in addition to carbohydrates and vegetables. In a 2009 study of U.S. adult twins (ages 21\u201332 years) consuming typical Western diets, obese individuals exhibited a higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio than lean individuals [56]. Therefore, based on weight assumptions (weight data were not collected in our U.S. cohort), one would predict that the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in the U.S. children would be higher than the ratio in the Bangladeshi children. However, in our study, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio was 1\u22361 in the U.S. children, and the ratio was 3\u22361 in the Bangladeshi children. Perhaps this departure from expected results is attributable to age or geographical differences. Another possibility is that our results support the idea that the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio varies widely across healthy individuals, as was observed in the recent study of the gut microbiota from 242 U.S. adults (ages 18\u201340 years) [38]. A larger survey of Bangladeshi and U.S. children is necessary to understand the proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in relation to their metabolic pathways. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Prevotella dominated the gut microbiota of the Bangladeshi children while Bacteroides dominated the U.S. microbiota. These results show striking similarities to the findings of a 2010 study comparing the fecal microbiota of children from Burkina Faso who consume diets high in carbohydrates and low in protein with that of children from Italy who consume typical Western diets rich in meat, dairy, and carbohydrates. Prevotella were highly abundant in the microbiota of the children living in Burkina Faso, in contrast to the children in Italy whose microbiota was dominated by Bacteroides\n[6]. A Bacteroides-dominated gut community is significantly associated with long-term diets rich in animal protein and saturated fat, while a Prevotella-dominated community is associated with a plant-based diet high in carbohydrates and lacking in meat and dairy products [57]. Parabacteroides (present in U.S. children 12F, 14F, and 13 M), Alistipes (present in all four U.S. children), and other taxa that co-occur with a Bacteroides\u2013dominated signature (Figure 6) are particularly adept at fermenting carbohydrates and protein to extract energy [57], [58]. Conversely, Catenibacterium (present in all 4 Bangladeshi children) and other bacteria that co-occur with a Prevotella-dominated gut community (Figure 6) degrade mucin and simple sugars [57], [58]. Although our study examined only a small number of subjects, our results support an association between diet and gut microbiota. Our findings also underscore the importance of characterizing gut microbiota composition in subjects residing in varied geographical contexts [6], [7]. For example, features of diet are shared between residents of Burkina Faso and Bangladesh, whereas other factors (confounded with diet in comparisons to Western populations) such as host genetics, rural versus urban, are not.",

To date, most previous studies have focused on the temporal variation of the microbiota of infants and adults from developed countries. In these previous studies, dramatic perturbations in the gut microbiota observed over multiple time points have corresponded with significant changes in diet or antibiotic usage [11], [26], [59]. In our study, consecutive monthly samples from the Bangladeshi children exhibited a greater degree of variation in the relative abundance of phyla compared to the monthly samples from the U.S. children. Since the Bangladeshi and U.S. children were closely monitored and did not receive antimicrobial therapy for 8 or 9 consecutive months, the higher temporal variation observed in the Bangladeshi children is likely not attributed to antibiotic usage. Although diet was not controlled for in either group, in general, Bangladeshi children from low-income families have access to a smaller variety of foods compared to U.S. children from affluent families. Hence, variability in the diet probably does not contribute to the larger degree of temporal variation observed in the gut microbiota of Bangladeshi children. One potential, alternative explanation is that a high level of temporal variation may result from more frequent or intensive exposure to bacteria in the environment due to unhygienic conditions, resulting in subclinical perturbations to their gut microbiota. Additional data are needed to test this hypothesis.",

Recruiting subjects and collecting multiple samples from each individual in the setting of this study is a difficult process, but subsequent studies should control for socioeconomic, genetic, and dietary variables. To begin to understand the role of the gut microbiota in relation to these and other factors, adequately-powered studies directly comparing the gut microbiota of different groups of subjects differing by only one or two of these variables are warranted. Moreover, a large-scale, randomized controlled trial involving targeted interventions would provide a better platform for unraveling these interactions. Extending these experiments to relevant animal models would help in examining possible causal relationships.",

While it is not possible to pinpoint causal relationships underlying the compositional differences between the microbiota of these Bangladeshi and U.S. children, dietary, genetic, and environmental factors are all likely to play a role. These results may help direct the design of future studies and contribute to a much-needed foundation for the future implementation of strategies for manipulating the microbiota of children to enhance and restore health.",

(A) The rarefaction curve for all near full-length sequences for the 15 time points from subjects Bangladeshi child 12 M, Bangladeshi child 13 M, and Bangladeshi child 13F (Table 1). The blue line represents the observed species richness. The red line represents the range of estimated OTU richness as predicted by the Chao1 non-parametric estimator and indicates that the total OTU richness is much higher than observed with our available near full-length 16S rDNA clone library sampling. The error bars on the Chao1 estimator correspond to the lower and upper bound 95% confidence intervals. (B) Weighted UniFrac PCoA was used to represent the similarity between our near full-length sequencing and V1\u2013V3 pyrosequencing efforts. Near full-length sequences filtered to the V1\u2013V3 region in silico were compared to V1\u2013V3 pyrosequencing reads from subjects, Bangladeshi child 12 M, Bangladeshi child 13 M, and Bangladeshi child 13F. (C) The average pairwise weighted UniFrac distance between filtered, near full-length and V1\u2013V3 data from the same sample was quantified. This average distance was compared to the average distance between either V1\u2013V3 or filtered near full-length data from different samples of the same individual. The mean weighted UniFrac distance is shown \u00b1 SEM, and p-values were calculated by a two-tailed t-test with unequal variance.",
