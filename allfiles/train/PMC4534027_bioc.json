It is paramount to develop optimal biostabilization of stool samples during collection and assess long-term storage for clinical specimens and epidemiological microbiome studies. We evaluated the effect of collection media and delayed freezing up to 7\u00a0days on microbial composition. Ten participants collected triplicate stool samples each into no media as well as RNAlater\u00ae with and without kanamycin or ciprofloxacin. For each set of conditions, triplicate samples were frozen on dry ice immediately (time = 0) or frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C after 3-days and 7-days incubation at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Microbiota metrics were estimated from Illumina MiSeq sequences of 16S rRNA gene fragments (V3\u2013V4 region). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) across triplicates, collection media, and incubation time were estimated for taxonomy and alpha and beta diversity metrics.",

Next generation sequencing approaches have provided powerful tools to study associations of the human microbiome with disease. Interesting associations of microbiota and disease have been reported [1\u20133], but their etiologic significance has not been assessed in well-powered case\u2013control or prospective epidemiological studies. To move the field of human microbiome research forward both for clinical purposes and in epidemiological research, validated methods are needed for collecting specimens that represent, as closely as possible, the true in vivo parameters and to understand any technical variation that can be introduced. For large population-based microbiome studies, specimen collection methods must be acceptable to participants and, most importantly, tolerant of suboptimal field conditions. If optimal collection and storage conditions (i.e. immediate freezing and storage at \u221280 \u00b0C) are not possible, systematic bias can be introduced in preprocessing steps [4]. Therefore, it is imperative to minimize possible artifacts by developing and validating collection methods than can be easily implementable for both clinical uses and for large field-based epidemiologic studies.",

Specimens collected in the field may often spend various amounts of time at room temperature, followed by shipment on frozen gel packs (4 \u00b0C) or dry ice to a central laboratory for processing or storage. Fecal samples may not be representative of the whole gastrointestinal (GI) tract or specific loci within the GI, but a recent study showed that it is the relative abundance of taxa that differs rather than the lack of representation in stool as compared to mucosa-associated microbiota [5]. For screening purposes stool could be used to detect and quantify putative bacterial species as biomarkers of microbiota associated carcinogenesis as in the case of colorectal cancer [6\u20138].",

However, few studies have evaluated the pre-analytical steps focusing on stability of the microbiome in stool samples collected under field conditions. Very few reports have focused on the impact of preservation medium, time and temperature on the microbial community structure and other microbiota metrics of alpha and beta diversity [9]. RNAlater\u00ae has been suggested as the preservative of choice to conserve the stability of nucleic acids, both DNA and RNA, in tissue and other biospecimens [10\u201314]. However, the sufficiency of RNAlater\u00ae alone to prevent differential growth of bacteria during typical delays in field studies is unknown. Addition of antibiotics that prevents either RNA transcription or protein translation may improve biostabilization. Previous reports have yielded inconsistent results for the effects of room temperature storage on DNA and RNA stability for microbial analysis [15\u201319] As the microbiome field is advancing from descriptive to longitudinal or prospective studies, it is important to systematically evaluate the collection methods and the media used to biopreserve the microbiome integrity in stool. In this report, we describe a systematic evaluation of the effects of preservation media and storage conditions on the composition of the fecal microbiota as analyzed by 16S rRNA gene profiling (V3-V4 region) using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The objective of this study was to evaluate RNAlater as a biopreservative for large, population-based studies; a biopreservative for human microbiome analyses of stool samples that remain unfrozen for as long as seven days.",

These metrics included relative abundances of the major phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria), four alpha-diversity metrics (Shannon, Chao-1, PD_WT, richness), and beta diversity represented by PCoA scores (Table\u00a01). For all 14 microbiome measurements, ICCs were significantly larger than 0 (P\u22641.0\u00d710\u22123). As shown in Table\u00a01, RNAlater\u00ae alone yielded the highest ICCs in all but one of the 14 metrics. However, with only 10 subjects, none of the pairwise comparisons was statistically significant. Mean values of the PCoA scores closely resembled beta diversity estimates based on weighted UniFrac (0.92 for RNAlater alone) and unweighted UniFrac (0.76 for RNAlater alone).",

Our study found that human fecal specimens collected in RNAlater\u00ae yield highly reproducible microbiome composition (beta diversity) estimates, even if they were held up to 7 days at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) prior to freezing. Despite this, detection and relative abundances of rare taxa were altered by delayed freezing, irrespective of media, which highlights the potential for bias if specimens are not handled optimally.",

Of all the conditions tested, two antibiotics, kanamycin (through inhibition of protein synthesis) and ciprofloxacin (through inhibition of DNA replication) showed promising results when used at bactericidal concentration (data not shown). The current study built on these findings by supplementing RNAlater\u00ae with a bactericidal dose (300 \u03bcg/ml) of more than 10-fold the minimal inhibitory concentration of these two antibiotics, which we compared to RNAlater\u00ae alone. We found that adding antibiotics to RNAlater\u00ae did not yield more stable microbiota metrics in feces left at room temperature for 3 or 7 days. In fact, RNAlater\u00ae alone had the highest ICC values for all major phyla for day 3 and was consistent over time (day 7). Irrespective of delayed freezing, the high reproducibility of independent replicates observed for overall composition of the bacterial communities (PCoA plots) suggests that relatively few replicates are needed with RNAlater\u00ae alone as the collection media. This finding has major implications with regard to large epidemiologic studies since the cost of collecting and storing multiple aliquots could be substantially reduced.",

The no media condition also had inferior ICCs, which was severe for reproducibility of relative abundance for Bacteroidetes (ICC 0.71), and also notable for alpha diversity estimates and some beta diversity estimates (PCoA scores). It is possible that the thawing process of stool stored without collection media affect the integrity of members of the phylum Bacteroides.

However, these studies focused on measuring the quality and quantity of extracted DNA [24], the effect of room temperature on stool with no preservation media [25], the robustness of pyrosequencing using stool samples stored in different conditions and DNA extraction methods [15], or the effect of temperature incubation (including freezing) on measures of bacterial communities in sputum [26]. Lauber et al. reported on the stability of stool biospecimens for microbiome analysis using 16SrRNA gene sequencing. In that study, the stool samples were left at room temperature without storage media for up to two weeks and found the condition satisfactory for microbial community analysis even after this prolonged period [9]. However, because no storage media were tested in that study, it is not possible to evaluate if the differences we observed were stable over time. In addition, while we did not test the stability over time without storage media, our results also show stability of microbial community composition for up to 7 days in RNAlater\u00ae. Different mechanisms may contribute to stability. In Lauber et al., the stool was aliquoted using cotton swabs with no preservation media and only DNA was analyzed. The cotton swab may have acted as a desiccant for the stool, thus preventing further bacterial growth during the incubation period. In our study, the RNAlater\u00ae solution, being a liquid media, may diffuse more easily to the core of the specimen given proper mixing, and is believed to act as both DNA and RNA stabilizer and inactivate nucleases when specimens are thawed before extraction. In addition, RNAlater\u00ae is design to enable measures of RNA transcripts and thus increase its utility for future epidemiologic studies.",

Without question, more research is needed on other factors that can affect statistical power and bias, including handling, storing, and thawing of specimens, microbial cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction, robustness of sequencing platforms, and classification and quantification of microbial taxa. The inclusion of mock communities that are site-specific would be necessary in future studies of the microbiome, especially those using clinical specimens, to validate the methodology in the analysis of microbial communities.

Assessment of bacterial composition and specific bacterial functions can be used as a powerful tool to understand their role in health and disease risk. As a step to help move the microbiome field to epidemiological studies, herein we evaluated parameters of microbiome stability and effects of delayed freezing and collection media on bacterial community structure based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Our data suggest that RNAlater\u00ae alone effectively preserves the composition of the fecal microbial community for up to 7 days at room temperature, implying that it could be used for population-based studies in field settings. The high ICC observed suggests that fewer replicates can be collected thus saving costs and storage space. Independent validation is needed, as is expansion to understand extreme environments and possible artifactual effects on microbial gene expression.",

Sequence reads were filtered using the QIIME pipeline with the following criteria to optimize the quality and integrity of the data: i) removal of primer sequence, ii) truncation of reads not having an average quality of 20 over a 30 bp sliding window based on the phred algorithm [32, 33], iii) removal of trimmed reads having less than 75 % of their original length, and iv) removal of the paired reads that were discarded for having less than 75 % original length. QIIME (version 1.6.0) [31] was used for all further sequence processing steps, including quality trimming and demultiplexing. Quality trimming in QIIME was performed using the following criteria: 1) no ambiguous base calls, 2) truncate sequence before 3 consecutive low quality bases and re-evaluate for length, 3) minimum sequence length of 150 bp after trimming, and 4) remove sequences with less than 60 % identity to a pre-built Greengenes database of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Oct, 2012 version) [34]. Further data processing included clustering similar sequences with less than 3 % dissimilarity using UCLUST [35] and de novo chimera detection and removal in UCHIME v5.1 [36]. Paired reads were stitched together with \u201cN\u201d between each sequence and processed as one sequence in the analysis. The sequence reads were then clustered at 97 % nucleotide sequence identity in QIIME. A closed-reference Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) picking protocol with USEARCH against the Greengenes database was employed. Sequence reads that did not match the Greengenes database were excluded from further analyses. Of the 1,869,502 amplicon sequences processed, 94.4 % (1,765,159) hit a reference sequence at greater than or equal to 97 % sequence identity.",

These metrics included relative abundances of the major phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria), four alpha-diversity metrics (Shannon, Chao-1, PD_WT, richness), and beta diversity represented by PCoA scores [37]. Briefly, richness, which is the total number of unique OTUs, does not take relative abundance of OTUs into account. Chao1 is bias-corrected for singleton OTUs [38]. Shannon index is a conservative alpha diversity estimate that adjusts for the relative abundance (proportion) of each taxon. Shannon index is defined as (negative) the sum over taxa of the product of the relative abundance of each taxon times the natural logarithm of its relative abundance. That is, where H is Shannon index and pi is the proportion of total species represented by species i, H=\u2212\u03a3[(pi)*ln(pi)] [39]. PD_WT is a measure of alpha diversity that reflects phylogenetic divergence among OTUs within a sample. In order to compare microbiota diversity between individuals at the same sequence depth, a random sample of 5000 OTUs was drawn without replacement from each sample 20 times.",

We calculated the ICCs using the R package \u201cICC\u201d estimated on a mixed effect model [41]. For each ICC, we tested if ICC=0, i.e. the measures are random across technical replicates, using permutations. A high value of ICC (between 0 and 1) indicates a high reproducibility of the measurement across technical replicates. We tested whether the ICCs were different among the three media conditions using permutations. We also quantified the percentage of overall microbiota variability explained by subjects by calculating a distance-based coefficient of determination R2 estimated using an R package \u201cvegan\u201d [42]. The analysis was repeated for both unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance matrices separately for each condition and time point.",

For each microbiome measurement, we first averaged technical replicates at time 0, 3 and 7 separately for each media condition and then calculated the ICC comparing the technical averages at time 3 vs. 0 and 7 vs. 0. Then, we tested whether the ICCs were similar across time and under different media conditions. Although we had specimens immediately frozen with no media as a control comparison, most of this analysis was based using the appropriate media frozen immediately after collection as the main control. Similarly, we quantified the overall temporal stability (comparing day 3 vs. day 0 and day 7 vs. day 0) by calculating R2 using weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices for each condition. Although we had specimens immediately frozen with no media as a control comparison, most of this analysis was based using the appropriate media frozen immediately after collection as the main control. We tested whether the ICCs were different among the three media conditions using permutations. To test the association between ICC and relative abundance of the many taxa, a linear regression model was fitted to the log relative abundance of all taxa that had minimum relative abundance of 0.1 %.",
