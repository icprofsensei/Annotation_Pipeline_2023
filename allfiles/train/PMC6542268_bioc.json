For this test, we chose the Bray-Curtis distance metric to study the conservation of specific OTUs. Compared to NP (p = 0.02; t-test) and BALF samples (p = 0.001; t-test) obtained from other individuals, an individual\u2019s NP sample more closely resembled their own BALF sample (Figure 3). The Bray-Curtis distance metric (utilized above) factors in the relative abundance of bacteria present in a sample. To determine if the presence or absence of bacteria differed between NP and BALF samples, we utilized Sorensen similarity calculations. Compared to unpaired NP/BALF samples, paired NP/BALF samples are more similar (p = 0.0006).",

In addition, NP samples had a higher abundance of bacteria from the genus Staphylococcus (NP 14.6% vs. 4%; adjusted p = 0.002). In contrast, NP samples contained lower abundance of three genera within Family Prevotellaceae including: Prevotella 7 (NP 0.8% vs. 9.4%; adjusted p = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22125), Prevotella (NP 0.2% vs. 2.9%; adjusted p = 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22127), and Alloprevotella (NP 0.6% vs. 8.5%; adjusted p = 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22126). At the genera level, Moraxella (BAL 0.2% vs. NP 7.7%, adjusted p = 0.003) and Haemophilus (BAL 1.7% vs. NP 10.1%, adjusted p = 1) abundance were higher in NP samples, while Streptococcus abundance was similar in both BALF and NP samples (NP 37.3% vs. 36.1%; adjusted p = 0.8).",

Previous studies have utilized upper airway samples as a surrogate of lower airway samples. However, adult studies comparing upper and lower airway microbiota demonstrate differences between the two1,2,20, suggesting that upper airway samples do not represent the lower airway microbiota. Due to ethical concerns surrounding the collection of lower airway samples in healthy \u2018normal\u2019 children, samples were collected from children undergoing clinically indicated outpatient bronchoscopy (Table 2). While similar bacteria were found in both the upper and lower airway, other bacteria were only reported in one location. One such bacteria, Prevotella, was significantly more abundant in BALF than in NP samples. Similar findings have been reported in adult microbiota studies that examined oral swabs, BALF and gastric fluid2, suggesting that other locations (mouth, GI tract) may contribute to the microbial make-up of the lower airway. Furthermore, in children with cystic fibrosis, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus was higher in the lower airway compared to the upper airway, further suggesting that NP samples are not always good surrogates for the lower airway microbiota3,21. It was recently demonstrated that within young children with airway disease, combining OP and NP samples reflected BALF samples better than utilizing only OP or NP samples alone.5 It may be possible that if we had analyzed OP swabs as well, we would have seen Prevotella in higher quantities in the upper airway. Future studies have been planned to utilize both methods of upper airway sampling in our pediatric studies.",

Interestingly, the relative abundance of Streptococcus was similar in both locations. Bronchoscope contamination or carryover from the upper airway can occur and influence BALF samples. While Streptococcus abundance was similar between the two types of samples, there was a lack of similar abundance of other OTUs. Therefore, we believe upper airway contamination of lower airway samples did not occur in our population. To determine if the route of bronchoscope entry influenced the BALF results, we compared the two routes of performing bronchoscopy (through a laryngeal mask airway and trans-nasally) finding no difference in OTU richness (p = 0.41; nonparametric t-test) or community diversity (p = 0.17; non-parametric t-test) between the routes of bronchoscope introduction. Principal coordinate analysis of weighted Unifrac did not show distinct clusters for route of entry, and Monte Carlo permutation testing did not find a significant difference in the distance between laryngeal mask BALF and trans-nasal BALF samples as compared to the distance within laryngeal mask samples (adjusted p = 0.52 ) or trans-nasal samples (adjusted p = 0.21).",

Because power calculations for microbiota analysis have not been standardized, determining the number needed to reach significance can be challenging.. We divided samples into quartiles based on age in an attempt to examine if age impacted richness, diversity and/or changes in relative abundance but we did not find significant differences. A larger sample size would help further define and verify individual communities of bacteria across the various age groups thereby determining if borderline significant data is actually significant. While we attempted to standardize our sampling methods as much as possible, the procedures were clinically indicated; therefore, the route used to introduce the bronchoscope (laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or nasal) and which lung lobes to sample were selected by the performing physician. However, we collected the NP sample prior to bronchoscopy to limit possible contamination of lower airway bacteria on the upper airway during scope removal. Also, during analysis we compared BALF samples obtained via laryngeal mask airway (LMA) versus nasal entry and did not find a difference, suggesting that the route of entry did not impact sample analysis. Because we could not control which lobe(s) were sampled, BALF may only represent the area(s) of the lung sampled and not the entire lung. Our finding that diversity is greater in BALF than NP samples was previously reported in children with cystic fibrosis3. It is possible that the bacterial load differs between these two sampling methods thereby resulting in differences in diversity. Due to low sample volume, we were unable to perform qPCR on our samples to determine overall bacterial load. Future studies will focus on measuring bacterial load. Contaminating DNA can be a challenge in samples with low microbial biomass22 therefore we extracted DNA from controls and excluded OTUs detected in our negative controls (supplemental Table 1) to prevent reporting bacterial contaminants.",
