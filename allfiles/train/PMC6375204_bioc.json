Analysis of the carboxyl terminal residues of these peptides indicated that neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G were responsible for their generation, and accordingly, these patients had higher levels of proteolytic activity from these enzymes in their sputum. The CF pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa was correlated with the abundance of amino acids and is known to primarily feed on them in the lung.",

Differences in alpha-diversity were tested using the Student t test. Beta-diversity of the mass spectrometry data was calculated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and visualized with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) through our in-house ClusterApp software (an interface for the R statistical software). Hierarchical clustering and silhouette plots were used to group the samples optimizing within group cohesion and between group separations. The reproducibility of the clustering was tested with jackknifing inter-quartile ranges visualized in three-dimensional PCoA space, for different rarefaction values (100, 1000, 1,000,000). Additionally, the groups detected by unsupervised clustering were subjected to permutation analysis of the multivariate data variance (PERMANOVA) using 999 permutations. Beta-diversity of the microbiome data was calculated using the weighted UniFrac distance [23] in the Qiita software (qiita.ucsd.edu), with hierarchical clustering and silhouette plots used to identify the clustering patterns in the PCoA.

A random forests regression model of the metabolomic data and target FEV1% (i.e., highest FEV1% in previous 52\u2009weeks) demonstrated that 19% of the data variance was explained by this measure of lung function and the correlation between the predicted and measured values was statistically significant (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S4).

The variable importance plot (VIP) of this classification then identified which molecular features were most strongly contributing to the separation. MS/MS spectral matching against known library spectra in the GNPS database enabled putative annotation of these molecules. Our annotation rate in this dataset was 10.4% (771 nodes out of 7434; maximum FDR\u2009=\u20090.003). A metabolite with the sixth strongest classification was annotated as a tripeptide with the sequence Asp-Ile/Leu-Phe. Seven of the top 20 differential metabolites annotated through GNPS were connected to peptides in the molecular networks, including a putatively annotated peptide Glu-Ile/Leu-Ile/Leu-Ile/Leu, which was the second strongest classifier (Fig.\u00a03). There were three large peptide molecular networks in the data that represented related di-, tri-, and tetra-peptides more abundant in meta-cluster 2. This indicated that the two metabolome clusters identified in the sputum samples were separated due to the contributions of various small peptides to the overall data. The abundance and diversity of these peptides contributed to the differences seen in overall Shannon diversity between the microbiome and metabolomic data. Furthermore, the free aromatic amino acids Phe and Trp were also observed to be differentially abundant between the two groups (Fig.\u00a03, Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S5), although it must be noted that not all amino acids can be detected in our protocol due to insufficient retention on the C18 column used in this study. Antibiotics were also detected in the sputum metabolomic data; however, the relative abundance of these molecules in the two-metabolome clusters were not significantly different (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S5).",

The most abundant peptides were derived from E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, calprotectin (S100-A9), the lipopolysaccharide-binding BPI-like 1 protein, histone-like N-methyltransferase SETD2, lactotransferrin, and a number of other housekeeping and neutrophil-associated proteins (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Table S3). Their abundance was tested for significance between the two metabolome clusters using the Mann-Whitney U test. Calprotectin (p<\u20090.0001), LMBR1-protein related to lipocalin (p<\u20090.0001), thymosin beta-4 (p<\u20090.0001), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (p<\u20090.0001), neutrophil-gelatinase-associated lipocalin (p<\u20090.0001), lactotransferrin isoform 2 (p<\u20090.0001), E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (p<\u20090.0001), bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (p<\u20090.0001), and neutrophil elastase (p\u00a0=\u20090.00058) were all significantly more abundant in the peptide-rich meta-cluster 2 coming from patients with more severe disease (Mann-Whitney U test; Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S6). Annotated human proteins were verified using the MS-GF+ peptidomics workflow, and the same most abundant proteins were detected [21] (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Table S4). Searching against the P. aeruginosa peptidome with MS-GF+ identified 97 unique proteins with a total of 100 peptide hits.

In protease nomenclature, cleavage of the scissile bond occurs between the P1 and P1\u2032 amino acids. We generated a sequence motif by comparing the frequency of amino acids in the P1 position (found at C-terminus of cleaved products from the sputum peptidome) and the P1\u2032 position (found at the N-terminus) to the frequency that these amino acids exist in the human proteome (Fig.\u00a04A). Using a significance cut-off of 0.05, Val, Phe, and Met were enriched in the P1 position while Gly, Ser, Thr, Lys, Asp, Tyr, and His were found with high frequency in the P1\u2032 position. Amino acids below the x-axis were rarely or never found in these positions. We assayed a subset of the sputum samples (n\u00a0=\u200989) with synthetic substrates that have Val or Phe in the P1 position, directly adjacent to a cleavable fluorescent reporter molecule, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). Meta-cluster 2 was found to have significantly more activity than meta-cluster 1 for both substrates (Mann-Whitney U-test, p\u00a0<\u20090.0001) (Fig.\u00a04b). These data correlate the abundance of peptides found in the meta-cluster 2 sputum samples with an increased amount of neutrophil-mediated proteolysis. In addition, the antimicrobial neutrophil proteins HNP1, 2, and 3 detected in the LC-MS/MS data (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S7) were also more abundant in cluster 2 (Mann-Whitney U test, p\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a04).",

GC-MS data were used to further assess the relationships between the microbiome and primary metabolites in the sputum samples. The relative abundance of P. aeruginosa was regressed against known metabolites in the GC-MS data. The bacterium was positively correlated to indole (Pearson\u2019s r\u00a0=\u20090.431, p\u00a0=\u20094.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125, Spearman rho\u00a0=\u20090.480, p\u00a0<\u20090.001) and phenylacetic acid (Pearson\u2019s r\u00a0=\u20090.431, Spearman rho\u00a0=\u20090.400, p\u00a0=\u20090.00020; Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S8); both of which can be produced from amino acid breakdown. Our previous studies have shown that P. aeruginosa grows to a high density in ASM that is rich in amino acids and proteins [22]. When amino acids were omitted from this culture media, but protein remained, a non-mucoid P. aeruginosa CF isolate failed to grow (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S9). This indicated that this strain (closely related to the Liverpool epidemic strain LES431) was unable to generate sufficient amino acids from enzymatic degradation of proteins in the ASM culture media and required free amino acids for growth. The strain used in this study was from a patient with a target FEV1% of 87.1%; thus, it may not represent the highly adapted strains from patients with more severe disease.",

Levels of all three metabolites were higher in sputum samples from the Pseudomonas-dominated meta-cluster 2, although only pyochelin was statistically significant (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S6, Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S10). We thus compared the relative abundance of P. aeruginosa and its specialized metabolites in the same samples across both datasets. There was no correlation between the amount of P. aeruginosa and the abundance of its metabolites (Fig.\u00a05). In many cases, P. aeruginosa was highly abundant in the microbiome profile, but no metabolites were detected. In contrast, P. aeruginosa metabolites were never detected in the absence of reads from the bacterium in the 16S rRNA gene profiles. The P. aeruginosa metabolites themselves, however, were all positively correlated with each other, particularly the various quinolones, with a strong linear relationship (Fig.\u00a05).",

The existence of these two molecular states reflects the conditions of the lung in these two patient populations and can explain aspects of CF disease progression. In lungs with more severe disease, rampant protease activity resulted in a unique metabolomic signature that consisted of abundant and diverse degraded proteins products and amino acids, driving the clustering of patients into one of two molecular states.",

Thus, monitoring of the metabolome for peptides and amino acids\u00a0may aid in identifying patients whose disease is progressing to a more severe state.

Peptides frequently contained Val, Phe, and Met at the carboxyl termini, which are situated in the P1 position of the protease active site just prior to cleavage. In addition, the amino termini of these peptides were enriched with small residues such as Gly and Ser situated in the P1\u2032 position. This cleavage pattern was described previously by Schilling and Overall [25] when human neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CG) were incubated with a cellular extract from human embryonic kidney cells. NE had a preference for cleavage between Val-Ser and Val-Gly bonds while CG had a preference for Phe-Gly, Phe-Ser, Met-Gly, and Met-Ser. These assays indicated that the peptides detected in the mass spectrometry data were being produced by these neutrophil proteases. Accordingly, neutrophil proteins (including NE itself) were found to be more abundant in the metabolome of patients with reduced lung function enriched in peptides. We therefore anticipated that there would be a concomitant increase in protease activity in these same patient samples, and our fluorescent reporter substrates containing P1-Val and P1-Phe confirmed this, showing abundant NE and CG activity in sputum from patients with reduced lung function. NE has been shown to be highly active in CF lungs and associated with lung function decline [26, 27]. Here, we support this finding and also implicate a role for CG in patients with declining lung function. Analysis of the peptide sequences indicated that the action of these enzymes was primarily on host proteins, including those related to basic cellular metabolism, but particularly those related to a neutrophilic inflammatory response. This is further supported by the corresponding high abundance of host \u03b1-defensins, also sourced from neutrophil granules [28], and neutrophil peptides, particularly calprotectin. Few P. aeruginosa peptides were discovered in the data, even in patients whose lungs were dominated by this bacterium, indicating that the vast majority of peptides detected were derived from the host. P. aeruginosa also produces proteases that may contribute to lung proteolysis [29]; however, conditioned media from this bacterium did not have enzymes that could cleave the fluorescent NE substrate. In summary, our data shows that in patients with more severe lung disease, neutrophil proteases degrade host proteins into peptides and amino acids and these metabolites can be found in CF lung mucus.",

It also upregulates genes for branched chain amino acid catabolism and represses those for their anabolism when grown in CF sputum [34]. This study supports these findings as the adult sputum metabolome contained abundant small peptides enriched with these amino acids (Ile/Leu and Val). Furthermore, patients with abundant peptides had higher levels of Pseudomonas in their microbiome, and its abundance was positively correlated with free amino acids and the by-products of their metabolism. The genomic evolution of P. aeruginosa also reflects the availability of these compounds as it becomes auxotrophic for certain amino acids during adaptation to the CF lung, particularly those with branched-chained residues and methionine [10, 35]. Thus, several lines of evidence from the literature [30\u201335], and from this study, indicate that there may be an important link between neutrophil protease activity and P. aeruginosa catabolism. The action of neutrophil proteases could contribute to shaping the niche space that P. aeruginosa comes to dominate in a severely diseased CF lung by providing its preferred carbon source.",

It would normally be expected that chemical diversity would increase with a concomitant increase in microbial diversity, yet this study showed the contrary. This discrepancy is due to the differential nature of the two omics datasets (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08). In 16S rRNA gene microbiome studies, PCR amplification targets a universal bacterial gene, providing information about the population and relative abundance of bacterial cells containing this gene. Metabolomics does not target a particular lineage of the tree of life; instead, extraction methods for mass spectrometry sample an untargeted pool of compounds in a complex sample. Thus, we propose that microbial and metabolite diversity in the CF lung did not correlate due to the greater neutrophilic inflammation in patients dominated by pathogens, such as P. aeruginosa, and the rampant proteolysis associated with that inflammation. Patients with a low microbial diversity have higher protease activity, which increases the extracted metabolite diversity via the detection of peptides. Further research into the relationship between microbial and metabolite diversity is warranted to better understand how microbes and host cells contribute to the nature of their surrounding chemical environment.",

Sputum samples with high relative abundance of P. aeruginosa often had low or undetectable amounts of quinolones, siderophores, and rhamnolipids from the bacterium. This demonstrates that there is an inconsistency between the detection of P. aeruginosa by 16S rRNA gene amplification and the detection of its metabolite production. Microbiome studies based on PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes can amplify DNA from both live and dead cells [36]; the latter of which can persist for long periods [37]. The poor correlation between metabolite-based and DNA-based detection methods may therefore be due to the contrasting results from PCR amplification of DNA from metabolically inactive cells compared to detection of molecules produced during active metabolism. Treatment with dyes such as propidium monoazide should be further explored to determine the contribution of \u201cdead DNA,\u201d as it has been shown to change the abundance of P. aeruginosa [36]. On the other hand, many of the metabolites from P. aeruginosa were highly correlated to each other. This shows that production of these molecules was occurring concomitantly in the same sputum samples from within and across different metabolic pathways. Quinolones were highly correlated to each other and the rhamnolipid Rha-Rha-C10-C10, though a poor correlation was found with the siderophore pyochelin, possibly due to the longer half-life of this iron chelator. Thus, we propose that detection of P. aeruginosa metabolites, particularly HHQ and NHQ, may be informative for clinicians by demonstrating that a patient\u2019s sample has active metabolism of the pathogen. As the use of multi-omics approaches in the microbiome field grows, further research into the relationship between microbial and metabolite abundance is needed.",

We hypothesize that the CF lung becomes a favored environment for persistence of P. aeruginosa in part because this bacterium promotes recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their proteases generate peptides and amino acids that are a favored carbon source of the pathogen [30\u201333, 38]. P. aeruginosa\u2019s inherent resistance to neutrophilic attack [39], through its growth in biofilms and production of virulence factors [40\u201343], may explain its persistence and dominance in this amino acid rich environment. This proposed model creates a positive-feedback loop where an increased inflammatory load produces more amino acids promoting the expansion of P. aeruginosa\u2019s growth and progressive lung function decline. Though this hypothesis was generated based on the multi-omics data presented here and we are unable to determine causality, this study expands on a larger model describing the microbial ecology in the CF lung called the Climax and Attack Model proposed by Conrad et al. [44, 45]. In addition, we provide further knowledge about the chemical composition of a severely diseased CF lung that is associated with the Climax Community of highly antibiotic resistant pathogens [44, 45]. Future work to understand the relationship between neutrophil proteolysis and amino acid metabolism by P. aeruginosa may shed light on its dominance in this highly inflamed environment. Our data also indicates that anti-NE and anti-CG treatments should be further investigated for their potential to reduce proteolysis in CF [46]. These drugs may not only reduce pulmonary inflammation, as has previously been shown [47], but may also inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa by reducing the availability of its primary carbon source.",
