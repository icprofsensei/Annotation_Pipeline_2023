However, it remains unclear whether such patients might benefit from enhanced surveillance or from interventions targeting the gut microbiota or the pathogens therein. We therefore undertook a prospective observational study of 24 ICU patients, in which serial faecal samples were subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing, phylogenetic profiling and microbial genome analyses. Two-thirds of the patients experienced a marked drop in gut microbial diversity (to an inverse Simpson\u2019s index of <4) at some stage during their stay in the ICU, often accompanied by the absence or loss of potentially beneficial bacteria. Intravenous administration of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent meropenem was significantly associated with loss of gut microbial diversity, but the administration of other antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, failed to trigger statistically detectable changes in microbial diversity. In three-quarters of ICU patients, we documented episodes of gut domination by pathogenic strains, with evidence of cryptic nosocomial transmission of \nEnterococcus faecium\n. In some patients, we also saw an increase in the relative abundance of apparent commensal organisms in the gut microbiome, including the archaeal species \nMethanobrevibacter smithii\n. In conclusion, we have documented a dramatic absence of microbial diversity and pathogen domination of the gut microbiota in a high proportion of critically ill patients using shotgun metagenomics.",

Our documentation of this worrying phenomenon in a prospective observational study establishes the extent of the problem in a uniquely vulnerable population, while also highlighting the potential of shotgun metagenomics as a powerful new tool in microbial surveillance. In achieving strain-level resolution of pathogen genomes from faecal metagenomes, we have uncovered cryptic transmission of nosocomial pathogens among intensive care unit patients. In documenting episodes of gut domination by pathogens and apparent commensals, our findings raise important questions about the potentially clinically relevant metabolic and physiological consequences of such events. The fact that not all intravenous antibiotics are equally disruptive of gut microbial ecology highlights the potential for the optimization of microbiome-sparing antibiotic regimes. More generally, our observations pave the way for precise patient-specific interventions that maintain or restore gut microbial diversity in the ICU, including enhanced infection control and tailored use of microbiota-sparing antibiotics, plus oral administration of antibiotic-absorbing charcoal or beta-lactamase.",

In recent years, interest has grown in protecting or restoring the integrity of the gut microbiome in ICU patients, using ecological approaches such as probiotics or faecal microbiota transplants [7\u201318].

To account for the long-term effects of antibiotics on microbial diversity and the absence of data on when antibiotics were started, antibiotic use variables were coded at each sampling point into one of four levels: no use, starting use, ongoing use and historic use. Episodes were classified as \u2018starting\u2019 if the antibiotic was started on the same day the sample was taken; \u2018ongoing\u2019 if the antibiotic was still being administered on the day of a sample being taken; \u2018historic\u2019 if the antibiotic had been used prior to the date of sample collection but was no longer being administered.",

Interestingly, recent publications have shown that the cultural and ecological requirements for \nM. smithii\n are far simpler than previously thought, supported even by individual species of bacterial pathogens or commensals [55\u201357] Furthermore, isolation of this organism from vaginal and urine samples raises the question of whether it should always be considered a harmless commensal [57, 58].",
