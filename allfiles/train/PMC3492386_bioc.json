We analyzed bacteria and arachaea from the belly buttons of humans from two different populations sampled within a nation-wide citizen science project. We examined bacterial and archaeal phylotypes present and their diversity using multiplex pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA libraries. We then tested the oligarchy hypothesis borrowed from tropical macroecology, namely that the frequency of phylotypes in one sample of humans predicts its frequency in another independent sample. We also tested the predictions that frequent phylotypes (the oligarchs) tend to be common when present, and tend to be more phylogenetically clustered than rare phylotypes. Once rarefied to four hundred reads per sample, bacterial communities from belly buttons proved to be at least as diverse as communities known from other skin studies (on average 67 bacterial phylotypes per belly button). However, the belly button communities were strongly dominated by a few taxa: only 6 phylotypes occurred on >80% humans. While these frequent bacterial phylotypes (the archaea were all rare) are a tiny part of the total diversity of bacteria in human navels (<0.3% of phylotypes), they constitute a major portion of individual reads (\u223c1/3), and are predictable among independent samples of humans, in terms of both the occurrence and evolutionary relatedness (more closely related than randomly drawn equal sets of phylotypes). Thus, the hypothesis that \u201coligarchs\u201d dominate diverse assemblages appears to be supported by human-associated bacteria. Although it remains difficult to predict which species of bacteria might be found on a particular human, predicting which species are most frequent (or rare) seems more straightforward, at least for those species living in belly buttons.",

Most of these phylotypes or \u201cspecies\u201d (acknowledging that bacterial species definitions are vague [2]), are not yet named [3], and are often difficult to cultivate so are known only based on their nucleotide sequence. Studies have begun to characterize consistent differences in the composition of bacterial taxa across the geography of our bodies, for example, between wet (e.g., armpit) and dry (e.g., forearm) habitats [1], [4]. It is still not clear, however, how the diversity in such habitats is structured and, in particular, what makes some phylotypes common and others rare. Commonness might be the result of historically contingent or even chance processes [5], in which common phylotypes might be expected to differ among individual humans or human populations in unpredictable ways. Alternatively, common phylotypes might be predictably common, because they are from lineages with adaptations that predispose them to predictable success in the environment in which they are common [4], [6], [7].",

The samples were collected from volunteers in a nation-wide citizen science project, Belly Button Biodiversity (http://www.wildlifeofyourbody.org/), and we assessed the microbial communities on the volunteers using multiplex pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA libraries. We tested two predictions derived from research on common and rare multicellular species, such as tropical trees or freshwater fish. The first two predictions we tested were 1) phylotypes frequent in one human population should be predictably frequent in others and 2) frequent phylotypes should also be abundant when present [7], [8]. We define frequent phylotypes as those that occur on many humans and abundant phylotypes are those that are found many times (which is to say, represented by many 16S rDNA \u201creads\u201d in the pyrosequencing output) on those humans on which they are found. Theoretically, a phylotype might have a high abundance (many reads when present), even if it is very infrequent. While it has long been known that many communities (be they of fish, bacteria or something else) are composed of a few exceptionally frequent and/or abundant species and many more rare species [9], [10], few studies seem to have compared whether abundant species tend to be the same among regions or, as in our case, populations of hosts.",

In the context of fish communities, they have been called \u201ccore species\u201d (which were then contrasted with \u201coccasional species\u201d) [7]. The concepts of oligarchy or core species are similar to, but more specific than the microbiological concept of a \u201ccore microbiome\u201d(note, we will focus on the term oligarchy here, rather than \u201ccore species,\u201d to avoid confusion between the ecological term core species and the microbiological term \u201ccore microbiome\u201d). The core biome has two relatively separate definitions. In some contexts, the core microbiome is described as a set of genes and metabolic functions that are nearly universal among individuals [11], [12], in many cases relatively independent of which phylotypes are present. In other contexts, the term core microbiome is used in a sense more directly tied to our focus, wherein a core microbiome is described as a set of phylotypes that are nearly universal among samples [13]. The oligarchy concept extends this second definition of the \u201ccore microbiome\u201d by statistically considering whether the frequency and abundance of phylotypes is predictable or if samples are taxonomically unpredictable assemblages of strains.",

If success is associated with specific adaptations and those adaptations are difficult to evolve, one might expect frequent species to be phylogenetically clustered [14], [15]. Alternatively, if success is independent of specific adaptations for survival on belly buttons or bodies more generally, success may simply be a function of neutral or stochastic processes [16] or the traits necessary for success may be easily evolved. In this context, we tested a third hypothesis, namely that the most frequently encountered bacterial phylotypes (our putative oligarchs, found on greater than 50% of individuals sampled) tend to be more closely related than would be expected among phylotypes chosen randomly from those we sampled as has been suggested to be the case for rain forest trees [6].",

Bacteria are common on all parts of the skin, but the belly button offers several advantages. It is an environment that varies relatively little from person to person, in terms of morphology (compared, for example, to the belly itself). It is removed from daily scrubbing, and has the potential to host a less disturbed bacterial community particularly in contrast to frequently washed and exposed parts of the body such as the hands [4]. And last but not least, sampling from belly buttons has also proven of broad interest to the public, which has aided in drawing attention to discussions of the species with which humans are most intimately associated, a key goal of our broader work (www.yourwildlife.org).",

We focus on the first two subsamples (60 individuals in total): a sample from the ScienceOnline meeting of science communicators (January 13\u201315, 2011, Raleigh, NC, USA), and a sample from the Darwin Day at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, NC (February 12, 2011). All participants were provided a written Informed Consent form approved by the North Carolina State University\u2019s Human Research Committee (Approval No. 1987). The University\u2019s Human Research Committee has approved this study. Belly buttons were swabbed with sterile cotton tips that were then immersed in 0.5 ml 10% phosphate saline buffer. Swabbing has previously been determined to be as effective as other sampling methods for sampling of human skin bacteria (7). Samples were kept in \u221220\u00b0C. Genomic DNA was extracted from 50 \u00b5L of the sediment of centrifuged samples using the PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio, Inc.), modified according to Lauber et al. [17]. Amplicons were generated using a combination of the universal bacterial/archaeal primers 515F and 806R [18]. The primer 515F was appended with a TC linker and a Roche 454 B pyrosequencing adapter, and the 806R primer was appended with a 12-bp sample-specific barcode sequence, a CA linker, and a Roche 454 A sequencing adapter. The sample-specific, error-correcting barcode allowed for pooling all amplicons in a single pyrosequencing run. All samples, including no-template controls, were PCR-amplified in triplicate following the protocol described in [18], [19]. Amplicons were cleaned using the UltraClean-htp 96-well PCR Clean-up kit (MoBio). The concentration of each amplicon was determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA kit (Invitrogen), and equimolar aliquots of all samples were pooled. Pyrosequencing was carried out on a Roche Genome Sequencer FLX system running the Titanium chemistry at Engencore (University of South Carolina, USA). The 454 platform was chosen over other platforms, since our team has had significant success with this methodology in previous studies of human microbiome (i.e., [4]). Also, the reads produced by 454 pyrosequencing are significantly longer than from most other approaches, and thus easier to analyze and interpret.",

The sequencing output was filtered to contain only sequences with length >200 and <1000 bp with an average quality score >25 and no ambiguous characters. Sequences were assigned to samples according to the 12-bp barcode; only 50 sequences had uncorrectable barcode sequence. Sequences that were \u226597% similar were grouped into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using the uclust method. Representative sequences from all OTUs were aligned with PyNAST [21] according to the RDP template, and the taxonomic identity of each OTU was determined using the RDP Classifier [22] with minimum alignment length 190 and minimum sequence identity 70%. Read counts (a proxy for abundance) of identified microbial taxa across samples were exported as a matrix to be used in subsequent community analyses. All samples were rarefied to a sequencing depth of 400 reads per sample prior to downstream analyses. To confirm that singletons in our dataset are not sequencing artifacts, we performed a manual chimera check of twenty single-copy OTUs unidentified by the RDP classifier in QIIME (chimera suspects) directly against GenBank. None of these twenty sequences was chimeric, thus we concluded that chimeras, even if present, were rare and inconsequential in our dataset.",

These phylotypes likely correspond to far more than 2368 biological species. Our 3% cut-off is standard in microbial studies, but is conservative so that a given phylotype is likely to include multiple species-level lineages. Also, the overall rarefaction curves for belly button bacterial phylotypes failed to level off, suggesting additional phylotypes would have been encountered were more individuals sampled, or were additional human populations considered (whether from different regions or different genetic backgrounds). Even conservatively considering just the 2368 phylotypes, our diversity of bacterial phylotypes was more than twice as great as the species diversity of, for example, North American birds [24] or ants [25].",

This composition corresponds to the previously reported composition of the skin microbiome in deep sequencing studies [1], [3], [26]. Interestingly, it is also very similar to the taxa recorded in a culture-based study of skin samples from humans in our same study region of North Carolina [26]. The most common skin bacteria in that study were lineages of Staphylococcus, Micrococcus (within the group Actinobacteria above), Bacillus (Bacilli above) and then Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Streptomyces and Enterobacter. The frequently encountered genera in the 1975 culture-based study were all also frequently encountered here with the exception of Streptomyces, and Enterobacter which were present in the belly button samples but not common and Klebsiella which was absent from our samples.",

Rarefying the data decreased the total number of bacterial phylotypes being considered in our analyses to 1380. For this rarefied dataset, we recovered a median diversity of 67 bacterial phylotypes (per 400 reads) per belly button. The most diverse bacterial sample included 107 phylotypes, and the least diverse included 29 phylotypes. In other words, some belly buttons appear more than three times as diverse as others. Such differences have the potential to influence human health and well-being. Several recent studies suggested that skin bacteria have a beneficial effect on skin immune function [28], [29]. Interestingly, our results suggest that when a high diversity of phylotypes is present on the bellybutton skin, most of those phylotypes are rare, infrequent, phylotypes. Thus, if microbial diversity on habitats like the belly button skin plays a role in allergy, the role may be contingent on the rare, infrequent, phylotypes.",

If this were the case, we would expect the oligarchs to derive from fewer lineages than do more infrequent phylotypes. The hypothesis that frequent taxa are from a subset of lineages with adaptations for the habitat being studied whereas infrequent species draw from a broader range of lineages, many of which are not locally adapted has precedent in ecological literature. For example, a disproportionate number of common rain forest tree species are from the family of palms which possess a range of unique adaptations for tropical forest life [6]. Similarly, only the \u201ccore\u201d species of estuarine fish has adaptations for estuary life whereas the many more occasional species are not biologically associated with those habitats [7]. Rare, more occasional, species might represent more random species capable of arriving in a habitat, but not necessarily succeeding. If this were the case, bacteria frequently encountered on humans should belong to fewer lineages than a random draw of the same number of less frequent species. In our samples from belly buttons, we found the most frequently encountered bacterial phylotypes were indeed more phylogenetically clustered than random draws of the same number of representatives from the remaining bacteria. The mean pairwise distance among the most frequent phylotypes (the 23 that occurred on >50% of sampled humans) was 0.070 (Kimura 2-parameter), significantly outside of the 95% range of distances within randomly sampled sets of 23 phylotypes from the rest of the diversity (median\u200a=\u200a0.100, lower 95% quantile\u200a=\u200a0.078, Figure 2). These results support the hypothesis that while human bodies encounter many thousands of bacterial phylotypes, the most successful phylotypes are from only a few lineages. We hypothesize that these lineages have, over evolutionary history, evolved traits that allow them to thrive on humans, a hypothesis that seems supported by older culture-based studies in which the lineages we found to be most frequent and abundant are nearly identical to those suggested to have specific adaptations for the tough, desert-like conditions found on human skin [26], [30].",

This appears in line with the oligarchy concept or ecological core species concept, but at odds with the traditional concept of core microbiome, defined as subset of taxa that are present in all samples [13]. Such phylotypes may have been present on all of the humans in our study but were undetected. However, given that the oligarchs tend to be abundant when present, and they are the least likely phylotypes to be missed our results conform better to the alternative description of the \u201ccore microbiome\u201d as stable at the level of genes and metabolic functions, but flexible in its taxonomic composition due to a high functional redundancy among many taxa [11], [12], though even then we note a key distinction. We found that while the microbial communities in human belly buttons may display some degree of flexibility in the taxonomic composition they appear much more predictable than a random assemblage from a functionally redundant metacommunity. Importantly, this pattern of predictable taxonomic composition is borne predominantly by the oligarchs \u2013 frequent, abundant, and phylogenetically clustered symbionts, while the rest of the community appears to be much more stochastic. Notably, this means an all-at-once analysis of a bacterial community without regard to differences in predictability among strains may potentially obscure existing taxonomic patterns [31], general both in terms of their predictability from one group of humans to the next but also in terms of their broad correspondence to patterns observed in other taxa, such as fish and tropical trees, at far different spatial scales.",
