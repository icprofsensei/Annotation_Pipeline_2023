Recent publications have demonstrated the impact of gut microbiota, the complex community of microorganisms that live in the gastrointestinal tract, on malaria disease progression and outcome. Yilmaz et al [2] reported that Escherichia coli O86:B7 expresses Gal\u03b11-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc-R (\u03b1-gal) carbohydrates that can elicit the production of anti-\u03b1-gal antibodies that cross-react with \u03b1-gal-expressing Plasmodium sporozoites, providing protection against the initial liver stage infection. We have shown that gut microbiota modulates the magnitude and kinetics of blood stage rodent Plasmodium species parasitemia and subsequent severity of malaria in mice [3]. Likewise, stool microbiota composition in humans is associated with the prospective risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection [4]. Rodent Plasmodium species can also modulate intestinal tissue and gut bacteria populations; however, this outcome appears to be dependent on the combination of mouse strain and Plasmodium species [5, 6].",

More importantly, it remains unknown whether Plasmodium infection alters human gut microbiota as a potential prelude to the progression of enteric bacteria to bacteremia. Moreover, although oral antibiotics cause gut microbiota dysbiosis [9, 10], which increases susceptibility to numerous diseases [11\u201315], it is not known whether oral treatment with antimalarial drugs also impacts gut microbiota. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to assess to what degree Plasmodium infection, or antimalarial treatment, in humans induces gut bacteria dysbiosis that may contribute to enteric bacteria progressing to systemic infections.",

In brief, 100 infants in Kilifi County, Kenya, were subject to continuous active and passive case detection for fever and other health parameters from within 14 days of birth until 9 months of age (cohort principal investigator R.J.C.). Febrile participants with positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and/or slide microscopy were immediately started on a 3-day oral course of artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Antibiotic courses were also prospectively recorded. Stool samples were collected at home every 1\u20133 weeks. Samples were selected for analysis on the basis of having been collected before or fewer than 18 days after a malaria diagnosis, with no antibiotics having been administered during the period in-between the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d stool samples. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from these selected stool samples and subjected to 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequence analysis of the V3\u2013V4 hypervariable region according to the Illumina 16S metagenomic sequencing library preparation protocol (Illumina). Reads underwent quality control to remove phiX reads and filter chimeric sequences followed by multiple downstream analyses of high-quality sequences using QIIME2(https://qiime2.org/). Statistical analysis for alpha and beta diversity were performed using linear mixed-effect models at 33 000 sequencing reads depth per sample. Metagenomic capacity was predicted using Piphillin (http://secondgenome.com/solutions/resources/data-analysis-tools/piphillin/), and statistical analysis were performed using t test and DESeq2 implemented inside RNA-seq 2G online tool (http://52.90.192.24:3838/rnaseq2g/). Variation and significance level of covariates were determined using \u201cenvfit\u201d function implemented in \u201cvegan\u201d (http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/envfit.html).",

Rapid diagnostic test was positive for all 16 episodes. Plasmodium falciparum was detected by slide microscopy for 11 episodes, and no parasites were seen for 5 episodes (Supplementary Table 3).

                    "text": "The prior analyses did not identify major changes in the bacterial community structures in stool samples collected before and after malaria/AL episodes. Yet, smaller taxonomic differences may have been present between the stool samples. Graphical phylogenetic analysis showed similar taxonomic profile between before and after malaria/AL (Supplementary Figure 4). In addition, linear discriminate effect size (LEfSe) analysis was used to identify any differentially abundant bacteria at the phylum, class, order, family, genus, and SV level between the before and after malaria/AL stool samples. The LEfSe analysis identified discriminative bacterial features with a 2 threshold cut off on the logarithmic scale (P < .05, Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis test) (Supplementary Figure 5). However, when accounted for repeated measures, Fusobacteriaceae was the only feature that was different (higher after malaria/AL treatment; P = .025, LMEM). Consistently, analysis of the relative abundance of the top 12 bacteria family among the individual participants revealed no gross pattern between the before and after malaria/AL stool samples (Figure 4A). Similar results were seen when the overall abundance of these 12 bacterial families were analyzed between the combined before and after malaria/AL stool samples (Figure 4B). When each of the top 12 bacteria families were individually compared between the before and after malaria/AL stool samples, none of them were significantly different (P > .05, unpaired t test) (Figure 4C). Likewise, the heat map and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plot (Supplementary Figure 6A and B) of the top 16 genera did not show clustering of the before and after malaria/AL stool samples.",

A majority of the top 100 SVs, which represents 91.45% and 90.98% of total SVs in the before and after samples, respectively, had a similar relative abundance between the before and after malaria/AL stool samples (Figure 5A and \u200bandB),B), which correlated (R2 = 0.948, P < .0001) (Figure 5C). The LEfSe analysis identified only 5 differentially abundant SVs (Figure 5D). SV43, SV80, and SV38 were abundant in stool samples before malaria/AL, whereas SV29 and SV72 were abundant in stool samples after malaria/AL (Figure 5D). However, only SV80 was different when the repeated measures were taken into consideration (P = .046, LMEM) (Figure 5E, Supplementary Figure 7). The top BLASTN (v2.7.1+) hit against the nucleotide database for SV43, SV80, SV38, SV72, and SV29 were E coli strain Ecol_746, Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum strain CCBE 141-17, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Lactobacillus fermentum strain S1B1.25, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium, respectively.

The inferred metagenome at gene level were normalized with DeSeq2, and differentially abundant genes were calculated using DeSeq2 and t test using RNA-Seq 2G, resulting in 47 genes common to both tests (Supplementary Figure 8A\u2013C). All were abundant in before malaria/AL samples. Stool samples were clustered using these differentially abundant genes, yet PCoA and heat map analysis showed overlapping clustering of the stool samples, with the exception of 4 before malaria/AL stool samples (Supplementary Figure 8D\u2013E). Among these 47, most did not fall into any KO pathway (Supplementary Figure 8F). Inconsistent with the KEGG pathway analysis (Figure 6), the pathway with the most gene hits was not N-glycan biosynthesis (Supplementary Figure 8F). Moreover, after visualization of the N-glycan biosynthesis pathway with Pathview (https://pathview.uncc.edu/), only 3 KO were inferred by Piphillin of 43 KO in the pathway (Supplementary Figure S9). However, many KOs of histidine metabolism pathway were enriched (Supplementary Figure S8 and S9). Collectively, these data provide no compelling evidence that malaria/AL episodes had any effect on the potential functional activity of stool bacteria communities.",

The data identified minimal changes in gut microbiota of Kenyan infants due to malaria/AL. In contrast to these data in humans, 2 previous studies in rodent malaria models have reported larger shifts in the gut microbiota of mice before and after malaria infection associated with intestinal inflammation. Infection of mice (C57BL/6) with rodent Plasmodium species (Plasmodium berghei ANKA and P yoelii nigeriensis) induced pathological changes in the intestine including infiltration of inflammatory macrophages, T cells, detachment of epithelia in the small intestine, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, and intestinal permeability [5, 6]. By contrast, no such intestinal inflammation and shift in gut microbiota was observed in P berghei ANKA-infected BALB/c mice [5], and P yoelii nigeriensis infection in CBA mice induces anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10 [6, 17]. Likewise, in a nonhuman primate model\u2014rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) infected with Plasmodium fragile\u2014the parasite suppressed gut inflammation via the induction of IL-10, which blunted the influx of neutrophils in the gut [17]. Finally, individuals with severe pediatric malaria lack symptoms of gastroenteritis [17, 18]. Taken together, these data indicate that inflammation, intestinal damage, and changes in gut microbiota might be attributed to complex interactions between host genotype and Plasmodium species.",

In spite of the relative lack of clinical features of gastroenteritis, malaria is a major risk factor for invasive nontyphoid salmonellosis in sub-Saharan Africa [20]. Various mechanisms have been proposed that explain why the host immune system struggles to eliminate systemic Salmonella during malaria, including macrophage dysfunction due to ingestion of the malaria pigment hemozoin [21], impaired neutrophil oxidative burst [22], dysfunctional spleen in young children, and competition between bacteria and damaged red blood cells for phagocytic cells [23] among others [24]. However, it is less clear how Salmonella initially breaches the intestinal barrier to cause a systemic infection during malaria. It is well established that dysbiosis of the normal gut flora provides an opportunity for Salmonella to establish infection [8], and it might contribute to nontyphoid salmonellosis during malaria. Consistent with this possibility, P yoelii nigeriensis-induced dysbiosis resulted in increased susceptibility to Salmonella typhimurium enterica infection in C57BL/6 mice [6]. In contrast, the analyses reported here identified little to no change in stool bacteria in Kenyan infants after nonsevere malaria episodes. In addition to dysbiosis, P yoelii nigeriensis infections induce elevated production of intestinal IL-10, which facilitates increased translocation of S typhimurium enterica out of the intestinal tract [17]. Taken together, these results suggest that in humans Plasmodium-induced changes in the anti-inflammatory status of the intestinal tract may be more likely to contribute to intestinal translocation of Salmonella rather than gut microbiota dysbiosis.",

                    "text": "Of the 16 malaria episodes, all were RDT positive but only 11 were slide positive. Copresence of fever and slide positivity amongst infants in this moderate to high transmission intensity setting is strongly indicative of acute clinical malaria rather than incidental parasitaemia [25]. Suspicion is therefore high that these 11 fever episodes were indeed acute P falciparum infection. Where slide is negative but RDT positive, suspicion may be lower. The RDT used detects the P falciparum-specific surface antigen histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2) in blood. The HRP2-based RDTs can remain positive for up to 42 days or beyond after the beginning of a treated clinical malaria episode [26]. Participants 1 and 4 each had only 1 malaria diagnosis throughout follow-up. Participant 1 had a negative RDT 6 days before their index malaria diagnosis date. For participant 4, RDTs done 16 and 48 days after the index diagnosis date were positive and then negative, respectively. Participant 8\u2019s second positive RDT occurred 44 days after their last positive slide. These 3 circumstances are therefore in keeping with the index positive RDT likely indicating the start of an episode of clinical malaria despite slide negativity. The same could perhaps not be said for the second episodes for participants 3 and 10. These positive RDTs (negative slides) occurred 10 and 13 days, respectively, after a positive slide. However, these 2 episodes remain in the analysis because they conform to the prospectively determined malaria diagnostic criteria that follow World Health Organization guidelines [27]. For participant 3, the stool sample collected immediately before the second malaria episode is in fact classed as after the first episode (Figure 1A). Therefore, interpretation of this second slide-negative fever episode has no bearing on classification of stool samples. Likelihood of missed microscopy positive parasitaemia was hopefully very low in this study given the diligent passive and active case detection, with fieldworkers and phlebotomists continuously resident and available in participants\u2019 villages.",

In contrast, our analysis did not identify a robust significant correlation in these participants (Supplementary Figure S3). One explanation may be that\u2014as is frequently observed in this setting\u2014many infants in this study had received antibiotics (even if in this study, by merit of the stool selection criteria, all of these courses occurred prior to the \u201cbefore\u201d stool samples). Another possible explanation is that an association between diversity and age does exist, but it is confounded by other factors that are themselves correlated with both age and microbial diversity. Examples of confounding factors include acute illnesses such as diarrhea, subclinical enteropathogen carriage, diet, life style, antibiotic usage of infant\u2019s mother during and even after pregnancy that can influence infant gut microbiota via mother\u2019s breastmilk. Another example is nutritional status. Severe and even moderate acute malnutrition (low weight-for-height) has been shown amongst Bangladeshi children to be associated with failure of gut microbiota to diversify with age [28]. During monthly measurement of weight and length, 5 of the 10 participants fulfilled criteria for moderate or severe wasting (weight for length Z score \u22642) at 1 or more time points, and 4 fulfilled criteria for moderate or severe stunting (length for age Z score \u22642) (data not shown). It is not yet known whether stunting is associated with gut microbiota immaturity. A weaker association between age and diversity\u2014as perhaps expected in this undernourished population\u2014may be more difficult to detect with this relatively small sample size.",

It is important to note that this observation has been made in a small sample size, and that significance is lost when repetitive sampling is taken into consideration. Nevertheless, it raises the exciting possibility that differences in gut bacteria may contribute to differential outcomes of malaria in children. Clearly, this possibility will need to be examined in the context of a larger and more definitive study that determines the ability of gut microbiota to modulate the severity of malaria in African children.",

These results suggest that changes in the inflammatory nature of intestinal tissue, in contrast to gut microbiota dysbiosis, during malaria may contribute to translocation of enteric bacteria and progression to bacteremia. This study also leaves open exciting, yet unanswered, questions regarding interactions between human gut microbiota and malaria. For example, are there different gut microbiota between healthy individuals and patients with severe malaria? Given the increased appreciation of the gut-brain axis, is there an interplay between gut microbiota and cerebral malaria? Can machine learning algorithms predict the gut microbiota composition associated with children prone to Plasmodium infections? Addressing these questions could make substantial improvements in developing novel approaches to prevent malaria-related fatalities.",
