However, only 16.4% of women had a bacterial vaginosis anaerobes concentration reduction of more than 50%, and only 3 women had complete eradication. The mean concentration of lactobacilli (all species combined) increased from 4.98 to 5.56 log10/\u03bcL (P=.017), with L.\u00a0iners being the most common species pre- and posttreatment. The mean concentration of pathobionts (defined as Proteobacteria, streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and a few others) did not change significantly: from 1.92 log10/\u03bcL pretreatment to 2.01 log10/\u03bcL posttreatment (P=.939). Pretreatment pathobionts concentration, and having a pretreatment vaginal microbiota type containing more than 50% Gardnerella vaginalis (compared with less than 50%), were associated with increased likelihood of treatment failure, but the latter did not reach statistical significance (P=.044 and P=.084, respectively).",

Second, each ASV was assigned to 1 of 4\u00a0\u201cbacterial groups\u201d based on the published literature (Appendix B): (1) lactobacilli; (2) BV-anaerobes (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Tenericutes except those included in the other 3 groups); (3) pathobionts (most Proteobacteria, and streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, Spirochaetaceae, Listeria, C.\u00a0trachomatis, and N.\u00a0gonorrhoeae); and (4) \u201cother bacteria\u201d (a rest group, containing Actinobacteria that are known to be [facultative] aerobic skin bacteria, Bifidobacterium species, and 7 difficult-to-classify minority species). Within each sample, read counts of ASVs belonging to the same bacterial group were summed (Appendix A). Third, we used hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distance to pool samples into 7 VMB types: (1) L.\u00a0iners-dominated (Li; >75% lactobacilli of which L.\u00a0iners was the most common; n=45 samples); (2) other lactobacilli-dominated (Lo; also >75% lactobacilli of which L.\u00a0jensenii and L.\u00a0gasseri were the most common; n=2); (3) lactobacilli and anaerobes (LA; 25%\u201375% lactobacilli; n=30); (4) polybacterial G.\u00a0vaginalis-containing (BV_GV; <25% lactobacilli and 10%\u201350% G.\u00a0vaginalis; n=30), (5) other polybacterial low-G.\u00a0vaginalis (BV_noGV; <25% lactobacilli and <10% G.\u00a0vaginalis; n=8), (6) G.\u00a0vaginalis-dominated (GV; <25% lactobacilli and >50% G.\u00a0vaginalis; n=12); and (7) pathobionts-containing (PB; >20% pathobionts; n=7). The samples in VMB types 1\u20136 had a maximum of 0.1%\u201315.9% pathobionts per VMB type.",

Successful treatment was defined as Nugent 7\u201310 pretreatment and Nugent 0\u20133 posttreatment, and treatment failure as Nugent 7\u201310 pretreatment and Nugent 4\u201310 posttreatment. Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for continuous variables, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for binary variables, were used for cross-sectional comparisons. Bivariable logistic regression was used to investigate associations between individual baseline sociodemographic and biological characteristics and treatment failure.",

The mean bacterial group relative abundance data confirmed this (Table\u00a02, Figure\u00a02, B) and additionally showed that the mean relative abundance of pathobionts increased posttreatment (Wilcoxon signed rank P=.050). Metronidazole treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the mean concentration of total bacteria from 6.59 log10/\u03bcL pretreatment to 5.85 log10/\u03bcL posttreatment (P<.001; Table\u00a02).

The mean lactobacilli concentration increased, and mean concentrations of pathobionts and \u201cother\u00a0bacteria\u201d were low pre- and posttreatment, resulting in an overall 5.5-fold reduction of total bacterial concentration (from 6.59 to 5.85 log10/\u03bcL). The observed increase in lactobacilli is consistent with culture studies showing that lactobacilli are not sensitive to metronidazole17 but is inconsistent with claims made by some clinical researchers that the high BV recurrence rate may be due to detrimental effects of metronidazole on lactobacilli.14 The reduction in BV-anaerobes concentration clearly allows lactobacilli, which are not affected by metronidazole, to expand.26, 27, 28 In our study population of high-risk Rwandan women, L.\u00a0iners was by far the most common Lactobacillus species pre- and posttreatment (4.81 and 5.28 log10/\u03bcL, respectively), \u201cother lactobacilli\u201d (which includes L.\u00a0jensenii) increased the most during treatment (from 1.46 to 3.03 log10/ \u03bcL), and L.\u00a0crispatus was uncommon and increased only slightly (from 0.15 to 0.51 log10/\u03bcL).

Both findings are consistent with earlier studies,13, 29 and with the G.\u00a0vaginalis-containing biofilm hypothesis of treatment failure.10 Metronidazole may eliminate dispersed G.\u00a0vaginalis at low to modest concentrations but may no longer be able to do so when a biofilm (containing a high concentration of G.\u00a0vaginalis) has been established. However, other hypotheses have also been posited. A recent metatranscriptomics study showed that the VMB of BV patients with treatment failure contained G.\u00a0vaginalis with upregulated clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated (CRISPR)-genes, which may protect the bacteria against metronidazole.30 In our study, the concentrations of all other key BV-associated bacteria, including A.\u00a0vaginae, were effectively reduced by metronidazole and were not associated with treatment failure. This is in accordance to one study,29 but in contrast to others that have suggested that pretreatment presence or concentration of A.\u00a0vaginae was associated with treatment failure.31, 32, 33",

However, pathobionts have greater pathogenicity potential than BV-anaerobes3 and may therefore be clinically relevant even at low concentrations. Unfortunately, it is currently unknown which concentrations of which pathobionts in the vagina should be treated to prevent complications, such as transmission to neonates. In our study, metronidazole treatment did not change the pathobionts concentration but did increase the relative abundance due to the reduction in total bacterial concentration. Furthermore, a greater pretreatment pathobionts concentration was associated with increased likelihood of treatment failure. None of the sociodemographic factors that have been associated with VMB composition in other studies, including menses in the 7 days prior to the posttreatment visit,34 were associated with treatment failure in our study.",

Women with persistent or recurrent BV might benefit from vaginal biofilm-disrupting treatment, adjuvant therapy with lactobacilli-based live biotherapeutics, or treatment with drugs that specifically target\u00a0all G.\u00a0vaginalis clades. The former 2 are actively researched,10, 35, 36 but the latter are not yet available. Whether these strategies are efficacious in real life would have to be evaluated in clinical trials. Furthermore, diagnostic tests to determine the presence of a biofilm or concentrations of G.\u00a0vaginalis are not yet available to clinicians. Women at risk of complications caused by vaginal pathobionts (not just Group B streptococci), such as pregnant women, might benefit from targeted screening and treatment. We encourage the incorporation of quantitative molecular characterization of both key individual bacteria with pathogenic potential, as well as bacterial communities and biofilms, in future intervention studies.",

Recent studies have shown good correlations between the method that we used to quantify relative abundance data and species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction results of non-minority species,38, 39 but additional validation studies are desirable. Although Nugent-based studies have shown that oral and vaginal metronidazole of similar dose and duration of use have similar efficacy for BV,11, 12 molecular studies comparing the in-depth microbiological effects of different metronidazole formulations are desirable. A major strength of our study is that we used multiple laboratory and analytic methods to characterize the VMB, including methods that incorporated a priori knowledge about the pathogenic potential of specific microorganisms and the types of communities in which they typically live.",
