Using an unattended process that is independent of external reference sequences, mPUMA forms OTUs by DNA sequence assembly and is capable of tracking OTU abundance. mPUMA processes microbial profiles both in terms of the direct DNA sequence as well as in the translated amino acid sequence for protein coding barcodes. By forming OTUs and calculating abundance through an assembly approach, mPUMA is capable of generating inputs for several popular microbiota analysis tools. Using SFF data from sequencing of a synthetic community of Cpn60 sequences derived from the human vaginal microbiome, we demonstrate that mPUMA can faithfully reconstruct all expected OTU sequences and produce compositional profiles consistent with actual community structure.",

Barcodes are defined by the International Barcode of Life Project as short, phylogenetically informative sequences from standardized regions of the genome that can be used for species identification and discovery [1], and preferred barcodes for microbes including fungi [2] and bacteria [3] have been proposed recently. In microbial community studies, broad-range \u2018universal\u2019 PCR primers are used to amplify regions of the target genes, and amplicon sequences are determined directly using next-generation sequencing methods. These gene-targeted methods arguably fall under the umbrella of 'metagenomics' along with whole genome sequencing approaches, since these are methods based on the analysis of total genomic content of a community of organisms rather than individual isolates [4]. The number of individual sequences generated is typically in the order of 106 and can be much greater. Thus, some form of data aggregation is required to reduce the complexity of the raw sequence data, and facilitate interpretation. Data aggregation is focused on the in silico steps following sequence data acquisition, and not issues that arise from methods of DNA extraction and possible biases in PCR amplification. The key challenge in aggregation is ensuring that the resulting 'profiles' (list of sequences and their abundances) are faithful to the raw sequence data that was aggregated.",

Clustering procedures culminate in the selection of a representative sequence for each OTU, which may be selected from the experimental data according to various rules: longest sequence in the cluster, most abundant sequence in the cluster, or random selection. However, representative sequences selected from the experimental data may not include full-length coverage of the target, depending on its length. This in turn limits information content, and the ability to conduct multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis for characterization of novel OTU sequences. Alternatively, the closest sequence from a reference database may be used to represent the OTU [5]. A limitation common to all of these approaches is apparent when the community under study contains novel sequences not represented in reference databases. In these cases, novel sequences in the experimental data may be ignored or pooled together as 'unclassified' since they do not closely resemble the reference sequences. The end result is that the aggregated description of the community may not reflect the input sequence data generated in the experiment.",

PCR from this template mixture and pyrosequencing of the resulting amplicon library on a Roche GS FLX instrument was performed using established protocols [28], resulting in 9,877 sequence reads from either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the target sequence. The SFF data is accessible through the mPUMA sourceforge site (http://mpuma.sourceforge.net/). We verified that all 20 target sequences were represented in the results by using Bowtie 2 to map all reads on to the reference sequences for the synthetic community ('Target' in Figure\u00a02). OTU formation and abundance calculations were performed on the dataset using all three options available within the mPUMA pipeline (gsAssembler OTU assembly/gsAssembler read-to-OTU mapping, gsAssembler OTU assembly/Bowtie 2 read-to-OTU mapping and Trinity OTU assembly/Bowtie 2 read-to-OTU mapping) and the resulting microbial profiles were evaluated for number of OTU generated, number of reads unmapped, amount of total error generated and comparison of the profile to the known 'Target' synthetic community profile (Figure\u00a02).",

However, despite accurately describing the richness of the sample (20 OTUs), read tracking within gsAssembler failed to place a substantial proportion of data in any OTU. The proportion of sequence reads unmapped increased steadily from 8% to a maximum of 33% as the minimum length parameter was increased from 150 through 350 bp (Figure\u00a02). There are several possible explanations for this unplaced data: the reads could be short or of low quality, or the assembly process may not have completely accounted for the placement of each read to an OTU. In our experience, situations in which a study contains samples with extreme differences in richness can lead to incomplete mapping when utilizing gsAssembler which cannot be resolved using the available command line options (\u2212ig, -it, and -icc). The occurrence of such 'thresholding' problems is recorded in the 454IsotigsLayout.txt files generated by gsAssembler. Given that we confirmed that gsAssembler had correctly resolved all 20 of the expected OTU for this synthetic community, we were left with the possibility that either there was a proportion of the data which was of insufficient quality and/or length to be placed in the OTUs at higher stringencies (that is, greater minimum overlap length requirement) or the placement was incomplete. To determine which of these phenomena were occurring we employed Bowtie 2 [17] as a method to independently assess the read to OTU mapping.",

The results of assembly using gsAssembler with a minimum overlap >100 bp followed by read mapping with Bowtie 2 served to construct a microbial profile indistinguishable from the actual profile of the synthetic community at both the nucleotide and peptide levels, with the 20 expected nucleotide OTU and 19 corresponding peptide OTU (peptide sequences for Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii are identical). This result confirmed that the reads were of sufficient length and quality for inclusion, and thus the more likely explanation for the relatively large proportion of data that is not placed by gsAssembler read tracking is that the assembler had failed to completely assign all reads to the OTU assembled (the thresholding problem described above).",

The dominant alternative approach for assembly is the use of a de Bruijn graph (DBG) to analyze sequence composition in terms of k-mers. The total length of sequence being assembled, independent of coverage depth, governs the size of a de Bruijn graph. Being unaffected by coverage depth is the chief computational advantage of DBG approaches. We explored whether Trinity, a DBG method [16], offers a valid alternative to gsAssembler in cDNA mode for the analysis of microbial barcode data. Within Trinity, the parameter most likely to affect the accuracy of assembly results is k-mer size. We examined all possible k-mer lengths supported by Trinity (k-mer ranging from 10 to 31, inclusive). Bowtie 2 was then used to map the individual reads onto the non-redundant set of OTU formed by Trinity for calculating abundance because the reductive process of distilling sequences to component k-mers eliminates the ability of tracking reads directly within DBG approaches.",

In our experience the use of Trinity over gsAssembler can be necessary for computational constraints (memory and cpu time) when dealing with datasets that are extremely rich or diverse. mPUMA is suitable for the assembly and analysis of OTU from other suitable targets besides Cpn60, such as the gene encoding the universal archaeal type-II chaperone (also known as Thermosome or TCP1 or CCT) [30], and RpoB [31]. Pyrosequencing data from both have been processed through mPUMA, confirming its utility for other protein coding targets. To date, we have applied mPUMA to the analysis of amplicon sequence data from the 454 GS FLX, Titanium and Junior platforms. We encourage the microbial ecology community to investigate the application of mPUMA to other sequence data types and gene targets of interest.",

The mPUMA pipeline was developed to facilitate the use of assembly in microbial ecology studies where both accurate descriptions of richness and calculation of OTU abundance are desired. Based on our examination of a synthetic community, optimal resolution of OTU sequence barcodes and calculation of their abundance can be achieved through use of gsAssembler with a minimum overlap length parameter >100 bp followed by Bowtie 2 read tracking for determining OTU abundance. In cases where computational performance is limiting, Trinity assembly followed by read tracking with Bowtie 2 should produce near-optimal results with only exceptionally similar barcodes remaining unresolved. In choosing the most appropriate strategy for assembly and abundance calculations from among the options available in mPUMA, researchers will need to balance the computational performance of the assembly approach with the precision of OTU formation.",
