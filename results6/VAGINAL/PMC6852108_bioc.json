However, little is known about the exact role and the reaction of the host during and after mesh surgery. The inflammatory response, as well as the microbiological vaginal environment, may be determining factors in the outcome after mesh implantation.12 The microbiome is the totality of microbes, their genetic elements (genome), and environmental interactions, the term microbiota refers to the microorganisms themselves.13 It is estimated that trillions of microorganisms inhabit the average healthy human body in a symbiotic existence with human cells; most of these microorganisms are of low virulence, others may be highly pathogenic. Recent publications about the vaginal microbiome have led to better understanding of vaginal dysbiosis or imbalance.14, 15 Culture\u2010dependent microbiological procedures historically represent the standard for the assessment of vaginal microbiota. However, with such a technique, a majority of species remains undetectable, providing only a partial picture of the overall microbiome. With the analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences,16 the limitations of traditional culture techniques can be overcome by providing species\u2010level classification 15 of all bacteria in the vagina. These analyses can increase not only our understanding of the vaginal ecosystem in general, but also the complex interrelation between microbiota and their host.17\n",

We did not scale biological read counts because rarefying biological count data reduces the reproducibility of results and is an opportunity to introduce bias.21 Weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances (accessing the abundance and a phylogenetic tree data within an experiment\u2010level object) were calculated using the phyloseq package. Multivariate differences among groups were evaluated with \u201cpermutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices,\u201d function ADONIS (a function for the analysis and partitioning sums of squares using semimetric and metric distance matrices) in the vegan package.22 For ADONIS (default parameter: 999 permutations), distances among samples first were calculated using weighted and unweighted UniFrac.

We performed a thorough literature review using the following search terms: \u201cmesh complications\u201d OR \u201cerosion\u201d OR \u201cexposure\u201d OR \u201cextrusion\u201d OR \u201ccontraction\u201d OR \u201cretraction\u201d AND \u201cvaginal microbiome\u201d and could not find any relevant publication. This study is the first of its kind aiming for the identification of microbial DNA in the vagina after mesh augmentation surgery. Our results demonstrate significant differences among cases and controls concerning the vaginal microbiome. Our findings revealed that after mesh implantation, the vagina harbors a polymicrobial composition with substantial individual variability in diversity and richness from each sample. We were able to detect bacteria from all of our samples, which is consistent with the findings of other studies.17\n",

                    "text": "Previous analyses of the vaginal microbiome have identified Lactobacillus spp. as the predominant genus with age\u2010dependent differences in abundance. Lactobacilli inhibit the growth of other microorganisms by competitive exclusion through adherence to vaginal epithelial cells and production of antimicrobials.14 Some studies reported that Lactobacillus spp. was dominant in 83% of precompared with only 54% of postmenopausal women.14, 23 Our results confirmed results from previous studies where one or two predominant Lactobacillus species were isolated, the most common being of these included Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus gasseri.24, 25 We found a modified distribution of these species in favour of Lactobacillus gasseri in the contraction group without statistical significance though (Table \u200b(Table2).2). However, recent studies have found that in a certain proportion of healthy women of reproductive age, other species than Lactobacillus spp. are predominant in the vaginal microbiome. These earlier data suggest the existence of multiple \u201cvagitype\u201d clusters with no evidence so far whether or not these microbial profiles are causal indicators for health or disease.14 Moreover, numerous vaginally relevant bacterial species have yet to be characterized. Beside estrogen, environmental factors, such as smoking, douching, and some sexual practices can decrease vaginal Lactobacilli levels.26 Estrogen deficiency during menopause often leads to a depletion in Lactobacilli whereas estrogen substitution generally leads to a reestablishment of the same bacteria.27, 28 Throughout all our study groups, a large majority of women were nonsmokers. Only 30% (6 out of 20) of samples in the control group, 57.14% (8 out of 14) of samples in the exposure group, and 20% (1 out of 5) of samples in the contraction group demonstrated a dominance of Lactobacillus spp. This may be an indicator for the impairment by the mere presence of prosthetic material caused on the vaginal microbiome and a positive result of the consequent continuous estrogen treatment in patients with diagnosed mesh exposure. The latter could also explain the higher relative abundance of the phyla Firmicutes (including the genus Lactobacillus) in the exposure group. The higher abundance of Actinobacter in the contraction group compared with controls may represent a risk factor for the occurrence of this mesh related complication although these findings again lack statistical significance.",

Other studies have shown that Veillonella spp. are associated with bacterial vaginosis, we believe that they could represent a risk factor for mesh contraction group.29, 30 Moreover, we detected a trend of an association between higher bacterial diversity and mesh complications when compared with controls, although these findings were not statistically significant. According to the literature, the rate of mesh exposure when placed via the vaginal route varies from 5% to 30%.31 Surgical treatment of mesh\u2010related complications accounted for 7% of TVM procedures in our center.32 Risk factors reported to be associated with complications included: operative technique, surgeon experience, previous prolapse repair, concomitant hysterectomy, inverted T colpotomy during concomitant hysterectomy, total vaginal mesh repair, mesh properties, younger age at the time of surgery, sexual activity, and smoking.33 Our study was not able to identify vaginal microbiotic dysbiosis as a factor associated with mesh exposure. It rather confirmed that the microbiota of women after vaginal mesh surgery are comparable whether or not an exposure had occurred. The recommendations for mesh complication management involve two steps: First, local healing treatment can be further enhanced with an antiseptic or estrogens. Second, partial resection of the mesh may be required if local treatment proves inadequate. We followed these recommendations for the patients included in our cohort and we can conclude, that our management of mesh related complications does not seem to have had a significant impact on the vaginal microbiome.",

Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that some patients in the control group will go on to develop complications and/or require reoperation. Another limitation is certainly that the microbiome was impacted by different antibiotic exposure between cases and controls.
