The vaginal environment represents one of the most diverse habitats for bacteria which are considered the major players in providing antimicrobial defense mechanisms to protect women against various diseases (Sobel, 1999). In healthy reproductive-age women, the vaginal microbiome is shown to be dominated by Lactobacilli, the main producers of acidic fermentation products (such as lactic acid) to ensure an acidic vaginal environment that restricts the growth of most pathogens (Witkin et al., 2007). The human vagina and the colonizing microbes interact in a mutualistic relationship. Any imbalance in the vaginal microbiome composition, also known as dysbiosis, could lead to a disease state (Fredricks et al., 2005). Understanding the composition of the vaginal microbial ecosystem is essential to study its dynamics and comprehensively dissect the etiology of vaginal diseases and their role in women's reproductive health (Ling et al., 2010).",

Sources of bias exist at each step of the experimental pipeline, and range from the sample collection methods to the DNA extraction protocols used and sequencing artifacts among others (Brooks et al., 2015). It is also worth mentioning that an efficient extraction of a high quality DNA from limited amounts of samples is the key challenge for cutting edge downstream applications like Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Therefore, the selection of a reliable method for DNA extraction is of paramount importance to ensure a high DNA yield and a representative characterization of microbial communities in any given body site.

Most of the isolated DNA samples had a similar OD260/OD280 absorbance ratio of approximately 2 (Supplementary Figure 1). We further confirmed the quality of the DNA isolated by running all the samples on the LabChip and by assessing their GQS (a representative image of GQS scoring is reported in Supplementary Figure 2). As described in Figure 2A, significant differences in the DNA yield were observed when we compared the four extraction protocols; method #1 resulted in the highest DNA yield with an average of 5.96 ug, followed by methods # 4, 2, 3, respectively.",

Average number of sequences count per sample was also calculated (Supplementary Figure 3) and a significant difference was observed when comparing extraction method #1 and #2. No statistical significance was observed when we compared other extraction methods used. A comparison of OTUs from phylum to genus levels was performed. No statistical significance was observed in the various extraction methods used when we compared the total OTUs count (Supplementary Figure 3). However, our analysis revealed that regardless of the extraction protocol used, Firmicutes remains as expected the most abundant phylum with an average of 98% of all OTUs (Figure 4C). At the genus level, Lactobacillus species was the most abundant genera (Figure 4D). Prevotella spp., Streptococcus spp., Ruminococcaceae and Coriobacteraceae were the least abundant genera across the four DNA extraction methods (Figures 4A\u2013D). Relative abundance of the vaginal microbiota profiles of each donor using different extraction methods showed that there is a shift observed in method #2, method #3, and method #4 as compared to method #1 (Figures 4A\u2013D). Overall, Powersoil DNA extraction methods exposed more genera especially with method #3 and method #4 as compared to method #1 (Figure 4B).",

Therefore, it is vital to use a universal method at each step in order to facilitate comparison of the results generated from various studies in the same research area.

The majority of these indigenous microbiota exist in a mutualistic relationship with their human host and prevent the colonization of potentially pathogenic organisms, including those responsible for bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections and urinary tract infections (Hillier et al., 1992; Sobel, 1997, 1999; Gupta et al., 1998). Recent development in the next generation sequencing technologies revealed that vaginal microbiome vary among healthy women (90\u2013100%) with genus Lactobacillus spp., as the predominant member to almost zero Lactobacillus in women with bacterial vaginosis (Xiao et al., 2016). Collection methods of the vaginal samples play an important role in reflecting the microbial composition of the vaginal ecosystem. A comparison of vaginal swab and cytobrush to collect samples to explore the vaginal microbiota composition revealed that there was no significant change neither in the species richness nor in diversity (Mitra et al., 2017). Moreover, a comparative study between self-collection and clinician collected vaginal swab samples showed similar microbial diversity using both techniques in US women (Forney et al., 2010). Although the importance of vaginal microenvironment in relation to health and diseases has been well established, there is a paucity of data regarding DNA extraction methods and their ability to assure microbial diversity in not well-characterized sites like gut, saliva and skin (Vesty et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2018; Stinson et al., 2018).",

Among the 4 methods tested, method #1 was the most efficient with respect to the amount and quality of DNA, although the other three methods resulted in a good quality DNA as well. DNA yield was significantly higher in method #1 compared to the other methods. However, method #1 showed the lowest efficiency in detecting microbial diversity as compared to the other protocols as observed in the alpha diversity measures. We cannot exclude that this may be due to inefficient enzymatic bacterial lysis and/or to the presence of host DNA along with microbial DNA. In this study, we show that DNA extraction protocol using various lysis methods may affect the vaginal microbiome composition. Method #3 was the most efficient in detecting bacterial diversity although the yield was significantly lower compared to method #1. The ultimate aim of most of the microbial community based studies is the representation of microbial diversity, which is not generally considered as a standard to evaluate DNA extraction methods (Yuan et al., 2012). Compared to the other methods, the in-house modified method #3 is the most efficient in detecting microbial diversity probably due to the ability of the combined C1,C2, and C3 solutions and mechanical bead beating to break down the bacterial cell wall of vaginal microbiota. Gram positive cell walls of members of Coriobacteriaceae family such as Atopobium spp. are thicker and more resistant to enzymatic degradation. Method #3 uses a combination of enzymatic and mechanical lysis which improves this method's efficiency in recovering both gram positive and gram negative members of the vaginal flora. Although Method #4 has edged slightly in alpha diversity, method #3 yielded DNA of higher quality when compared to method #4 (Table 2, Figure 2). As opposed to method #4, method #3 combines C1, C2, and C3 buffers in one step, which resulted in a higher efficiency in detecting different members of the vaginal microbiome environment. Additionally, method #3 has the advantage of a lower processing time compared to method #4. Method #1 clustered apart from the other methods involving mechanical lysis (Figure 6A). Obviosuly the choice of the most appropriate method for DNA extraction is based on the researcher's needs and the downstream application that will be used. The ideal DNA extraction method may depend on the specific study goals; in some instances, efficient capture of bacterial diversity within a microbial community may be more important than DNA yield (Table 2).",
