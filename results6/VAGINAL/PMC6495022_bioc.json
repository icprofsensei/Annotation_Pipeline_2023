In research settings, the microbiological diagnosis of BV uses the Nugent score, which is the semi-quantitative scoring of a Gram\u2019s stained vaginal smear based on the presence of gram-positive rods (Lactobacillus spp.), Gram-negative rods (Gardnerella and Bacteroides spp.), and curved, Gram-variable rods (Mobiluncus) [3]. This scoring system assigns women to 1 of 3 categories: normal vaginal microbiota (Nugent score 0\u20133), intermediate vaginal flora (Nugent score 4\u20136), or BV (Nugent score 7\u201310). The latter 2 categories (collectively defined here as altered vaginal flora [AVF], Nugent score = 4\u201310) are associated with a >50% increased risk of HIV acquisition [1]. Furthermore, the presence of BV in an HIV-infected woman results in a 3-fold increase in the risk of HIV transmission to her male partner [4], independent of the genital HIV viral load. As a result, BV may be responsible for up to a fifth of heterosexual HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa [4, 5].",

HIV is acquired across the cervico-vaginal mucosa during penile-vaginal sex, and the immune parameters that increase susceptibility at this site include a reduced integrity of the cervico-vaginal mucus and the epithelial barrier, the presence of activated mucosal HIV target cells (CD4+ T cell and dendritic cell subsets), and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [10]. Importantly, BV-associated vaginal microbiota increase mucosal levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and the resulting mucosal inflammation can recruit activated CD4+ T cells [8, 11], as well as disrupt epithelial integrity [11, 12], impair mucosal repair [13], and reduce the ability of cervical mucus to bind HIV [14]. While it is unclear which mechanisms are most important, these immune alterations are thought to underpin the consistent association of genital inflammation and, more recently, are thought to impact the genital microbiota in cases of HIV acquisition in both women [8, 15, 16] and men [17, 18].",

While Lactobacillus crispatus has been found to predominate in Caucasian women [6], L. iners is much more common in women from ACB communities [6, 19, 20]. This is important, since an L. iners\u2013predominant microbiota (CST-III) frequently transitions into a diversity-type microbiota [21], is not associated with the same mucosal immune quiescence that appears to be provided by L. crispatus [19, 20], and tends to increase HIV acquisition risks [8]. Therefore, despite calls for BV screenings and/or treatment to be implemented at the community level as a means to reduce HIV incidence in at-risk populations [22], it is important to first understand the impact of existing BV treatment on the genital immune parameters that increase HIV susceptibility. To achieve this, we assessed the impact of BV treatment on cervico-vaginal immunology, ex vivo HIV susceptibility, and the genital microbiota in a longitudinal clinical study.",

The reduction in percent HIV entry was independent of treatment outcome: HIV entry was reduced in 13/18 (72%) participants, with a Nugent score \u22643 at follow-up; in 5/7 (71%) participants with intermediate flora; and in 12/20 (60%) participants with persistent/recurrent BV (likelihood ratio = 1.1; P = .6; n = 45). The reduction in virus entry was independent of post-treatment CST, of changes in the total cervico-vaginal bacterial load, and of the baseline abundance, follow-up abundance, or change in abundance of the specific BV-associated bacterial species or genera previously linked to HIV acquisition, including Gardnerella, Prevotella, Atopobium, Mobiluncus, Sneathia, or Lactobacillus spp. (data not shown). Co-factors that may modify the risk of HIV acquisition, including herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 infection, hormonal contraception use, and the phase of the menstrual cycle, were not associated with HIV entry at baseline (P > .05 for all). In summary, BV treatment reduced the HIV susceptibility of endocervical CD4+ T cells at 1 month, regardless of the treatment outcome as defined by Nugent score or genital CST.",

Bacterial taxa were selected if their relative abundance changed significantly (>0.1%) after metronidazole treatment, and non-iners Lactobacillus spp. (0.03% increased abundance post-treatment) were also included (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 2), given their prior association with HIV protection [8]. Baseline and metronidazole-induced changes in the relationships between microbial taxa and genital cytokines IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2 and the chemokines IP-10, MIG, MIP-3\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-1\u03b1 were assessed. For participants with CST-III or -IV at baseline (Figure 5) or after treatment (Figure 5), the centroids of principal components (PCs) 1 and 2 were diametrically opposed, indicating that these groups were distinct. Indeed, this distinction was driven by several key factors. Treatment-induced changes were seen in the levels of genital IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2 and the abundance of Prevotella, Eggerthela, and Atopobium clustered together, and these factors were each negatively correlated with PC1 (r < -0.44; P < .001 for all), while changes in the levels of genital IP-10, MIG, MCP-1, and MIP-3\u03b1 and the abundance of L. iners clustered together all correlated positively with PC1 (r > 0.46; P < .001 for all; Figure 5). These data demonstrate that baseline or treatment-induced changes in IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2 and gram-negative strict and facultative anaerobes were closely related, as were changes in genital chemokines and L. iners abundance.",

Among these participants, 22/51 carried an L. iners\u2013dominated microbiota (CST-III; 42%), 20 carried a diversity-dominated microbiota (CST-IV; 39%), and the remainder (9/51, 19%) carried a microbiota dominated by another Lactobacillus spp.: L. crispatus in 7/9 (CST-I) and L. gasseri in 2/9 (CST-II).

Therefore, it seems intuitive that BV treatment and/or prevention would reduce HIV acquisition risk, but substantial barriers exist to this clinical strategy. First, BV generally recurs quickly after standard antibiotic treatment [24], and the intermittent provision of metronidazole did not reduce the incidence of HIV in a large, community-based trial [25]. Furthermore, the short-term ability of BV therapy to ameliorate the mucosal immune changes that enhance HIV susceptibility has not been assessed. Therefore, we studied the impact of standard metronidazole therapy on the genital immune milieu, cellular HIV susceptibility, and the microbiota. BV treatment moderately reduced endocervical CD4+ T cells\u2019 susceptibility to HIV. While effective therapy reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1, it also dramatically increased genital chemokines, including IP-10, MIG, MIP-3\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-1\u03b1, and the abundance of vaginal L. iners; several of these factors have been directly linked to HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) acquisition [16, 18, 26, 27]. Therefore, further studies are indicated before metronidazole treatment can be recommended as an HIV prevention tool.",

These pleomorphic effects mean that it is not possible to link the mucosal immune effects of BV treatment to its impact on a single bacterial species or taxa, but factor analysis from our 2 datasets demonstrate very interesting relationships. The baseline abundance and/or change in abundance of various BV-associated strict or facultative gram-negative anaerobes was most tightly linked to levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in both the prospective Kenyan trial of BV treatment and the cross-sectional study of ACB women in Canada. Since pro-inflammatory cytokines can reduce epithelial barrier integrity and potentially recruit CD4+ T cells and other HIV targets [11, 12, 19], this is clearly a beneficial treatment outcome. However, the resolution of BV was strongly associated with elevated genital chemokines that may also increase susceptibility: IP-10 and MIP-1\u03b1 have been directly linked to HIV acquisition in women [16], both MIG and IL-8 have been linked to the recruitment of CD4+ targets and HIV acquisition in men [18], MIP-3\u03b1 recruits activated CD4+ T cells to the cervical mucosa in primate models [27], and chemokine receptor signaling was recently implicated in the dissemination of an HIV infection to the draining lymph nodes after establishment of a vaginal infection [29].",

Indeed, given that L. iners is the predominant Lactobacillus spp. in the vaginal microbiota of ACB women, this may explain why ACB women who have BV (i.e., who lack lactobacilli) consistently demonstrate reduced genital IP-10 levels [20, 23]. These results imply that BV therapy may have different immune effects, depending on the dominant Lactobacillus species that is restored; restoration of an L. iners\u2013dominated microbiota may not have the same beneficial effects on HIV susceptibility as the restoration of a vaginal microbiota dominated by L. crispatus or other non-iners Lactobacillus spp. The impact of these chemokine alterations on the epithelial barrier function and the mucosal recruitment of HIV target cells after treatment in the context of different vaginal microbiota will be important areas for future study.",

We assessed the impact of BV treatment on HIV entry and some T-cell parameters, but could not simultaneously characterize other important immune cell subsets, including Th17 cells, \u03b3\u03b41 T cells, dendritic cells, or macrophages. Th17 cells are important, early, genital HIV targets [30\u201332]; \u03b3\u03b41 T cells are significant producers of IL-17 [33, 34], are abundant in the endocervix, and their numbers decline substantially in women with BV [35, 36]. Moreover, the treatment-induced reduction in cellular HIV susceptibility was not mediated through any discernable changes in the microbiota, and a direct impact of metronidazole on T cells after 1 month may also be unlikely due to its short serum half-life (8 h) [37]. Nevertheless, future studies may formally test this possibility and also perform a more comprehensive microbial/immune assessment, including the time course of cytokines/chemokines and their relationship with HIV target cells, and the composition and function of the vaginal microbiota. Approximately a quarter of our study participants with BV at screening were BV-free at enrollment or carried a lactobacillus-dominated microbiota prior to metronidazole treatment. Indeed, treatment-independent rapid fluctuations in the vaginal microbiota have been observed, especially between CST-III and CST-IV microbiota [21, 38], which were carried by 95% of our participants at enrollment. Even in the minority (20%) of participants carrying a lactobacillus-dominated microbiota at enrollment, in all but 2 cases, this was L. iners\u2013dominated, which has been associated with increased bacterial diversity and a moderately-increased risk of HIV acquisition [8]. Therefore, we included all study participants in our analysis of microbial/immune associations. Participant compliance with metronidazole treatment could not be confirmed, but while low uptake could be 1 reason for low BV clearance rates after 1 month, our results are in keeping with prior clinical trials showing suboptimal efficacy and rapid recurrence of BV after treatment [24, 39]. Our sample size was also limited, to test whether co-factors such as HSV-2 infection, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) usage, or stage of the menstrual cycle affected HIV entry; however, our prospective study design enabled us to control for such inter-individual differences and to isolate any intra-individual effect directly to the metronidazole treatment itself. Our input cell number in pseudovirus assays was not kept constant; however, we have previously shown that, within the range of cytobrush-derived CD4+ T cells assessed in this study, input cell number has no impact on HIV entry [40]. Rather, the frequency of highly-susceptible cells is the critical determinant of viral entry [41].",
