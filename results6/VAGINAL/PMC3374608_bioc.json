The National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine microbial diversity within and across body habitats and individuals through pyrosequencing-based profiling of 16 S rRNA gene sequences (16 S) from habits of the oral, skin, distal gut, and vaginal body regions from over 200 healthy individuals enabling the application of statistical techniques. In this study, two approaches were applied to elucidate the nature and extent of human microbiome diversity. First, bootstrap and parametric curve fitting techniques were evaluated to estimate the maximum number of unique taxa, Smax, and taxa discovery rate for habitats across individuals. Next, our results demonstrated that the variation of diversity within low abundant taxa across habitats and individuals was not sufficiently quantified with standard ecological diversity indices. This impact from low abundant taxa motivated us to introduce a novel rank-based diversity measure, the Tail statistic, (\u201c\u03c4\u201d), based on the standard deviation of the rank abundance curve if made symmetric by reflection around the most abundant taxon. Due to \u03c4\u2019s greater sensitivity to low abundant taxa, its application to diversity estimation of taxonomic units using taxonomic dependent and independent methods revealed a greater range of values recovered between individuals versus body habitats, and different patterns of diversity within habitats. The greatest range of \u03c4 values within and across individuals was found in stool, which also exhibited the most undiscovered taxa. Oral and skin habitats revealed variable diversity patterns, while vaginal habitats were consistently the least diverse. Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance, and motivate the introduction, of several visualization and analysis methods tuned specifically for next-generation sequence data, further revealing that low abundant taxa serve as an important reservoir of genetic diversity in the human microbiome.",

Next, the taxonomic profile is assessed by quantifying richness, or number of taxonomic units present, and finally the evenness, based on the abundance of taxonomic units [20].

This occurs when reads from the same organism are divided into multiple taxonomic units due to sequencing error, or when there is significant diversity of the 16 S copies within a single organism [23], [24]. Since OTU-based taxonomic profiling is database independent, two benefits of its utilization include potentially differentiating between strains of the same species, and generating OTUs for as yet uncharacterized organisms. Due to the shortcomings and advantages of each approach, both techniques offer alternative views of a sample\u2019s taxonomic profile, thus being both complementary and confirmatory.

This information can also be used in a practical sense to generate sequencing coverage estimates and to determine the proportion of the microbial community that has been discovered as the sequencing effort is progressing [26]. A commonly used visualization tool to represent the discovery rate of new taxonomic units as samples are taken is the rarefaction curve. The x-axis of the graph is labelled with the number of samples (or donors) that have been observed, and the y-axis is the number of unique taxonomic units that have been observed within the samples collected thus far. The instantaneous slope and height of the curve inform the analyst about both the expected discovery rate of new taxonomic units and how many taxonomic units have been discovered at a particular point. Smax is found at the height of the curve when the slope is zero, i.e., the sampling saturation point. In previous studies, due at least in part to the prohibitive cost of sampling and sequencing, rarefaction curves based on empirical data have not typically acquired a large number of samples. Therefore, for communities with great diversity, the instantaneous slope of the last point of sampling does not become zero, as not all taxonomic units have been observed. Thus, to predict the number of taxonomic units in the community based on a rarefaction curve that is still climbing, the use of extrapolation is a reasonable next step. This is a different approach than the estimation of Smax based on the combined distribution of taxa across all samples for a specific body site. In this latter scenario, parametric finite mixture models or non-parametric coverage-based estimates, as implemented in Catchall [27], would be applicable. Efforts have been made to extrapolate the rarefaction curve with various parametric models, such as the poisson log-normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) [28]. In general, parametric statistical techniques can produce more accurate, precise and robust estimates, with greater statistical power than nonparametric methods, provided that the model fits the data correctly. When these assumptions are valid, estimating constants for the underlying distribution functions can be performed with optimization algorithms. However, when the model is only approximate, sparse sampling compounds the unreliability of parametric curve fitting, resulting in overfitting and outcomes that are poorly predictive. As a result, these techniques have not been generally recommended. However, the scope of the HMP has provided the community with a large number of samples from a large set of donors and a broad range of body habitats, enabling the realistic exploration of parametric modelling techniques. In particular, for each body habitat rarefaction curve, values for Smax were calculated and compared by applying these curve fitting approaches. Four well-understood CDFs, log-normal, gamma, Pareto [29], and Fr\u00e9chet [30] were chosen for consideration in part as they are suitable for addressing ecological distributions that may be highly skewed towards the most dominant taxa.",

Commonly used ecological diversity indices for quantifying intrasample diversity, include the Shannon index, a measurement of entropy and the uncertainty of the sampling outcome, and Simpson\u2019s diversity index, a description of the probability that randomly drawing two reads from a sample will produce the same taxon. In terms of application to ecological studies, each of these indices was originally derived, or adapted from macroecology.

Thus it may be expected that a strong correlation exists between calculated diversity indices such as the Shannon index and Smax between all samples. However, our investigations suggest that this index was unable to capture enough of the low abundant taxa to correlate well with the estimated Smax for many body habitats. This finding motivated us to formulate the Tail statistic, \u03c4, a rank-based diversity measure with a much stronger correlation to Smax, and with intuitive characteristics matching the well-understood standard deviation statistic. As described more rigorously under Materials and Methods, \u03c4 is the standard deviation of the rank abundance curve had it been made symmetric by reflection around the most abundant, or first, taxon. The more concentrated the taxa are to a few members, the smaller \u03c4 becomes. The sensitivity of \u03c4 to low abundant taxonomic units is comparable to a R\u00e9nyi entropy with fractional \u03b1, but with a probabilistic interpretation. \u03c4 consists of the number of taxonomic units as a unit of measure and due to its similarity to the standard deviation statistic, \u03c3, further takes advantage of existing known properties of \u03c3 such as the Chebychev\u2019s inequality [33]. The \u03c4 statistic provides an important complement to the study of microbial diversity as it has been derived to suit the nature of 16 S profiles which tend to exhibit a long-tailed distribution. These distributions reflect the nature of species abundance in which many sequences reside in a few taxonomic units while the majority of taxa are represented by only a few sequences. As such, \u03c4 more accurately captures the contribution of low abundant taxa facilitating an improved ability to elucidate the nature and extent of variation within and between individuals and body habitats over time, a central topic of study in human microbiome research [34].",

Next, we present comparisons of the Shannon, \u03c4 and Smax diversity estimates between OTU and taxonomy (genera)-based taxonomic units, and between common and all taxonomic units. Further, by the introduction of new statistical analyses tuned for next generation sequencing and improved methods to visualize and interpret their output, we not only provide a better understanding of the diversity across body sites and individuals, particularly through the contribution of low abundant taxa, but we also show how various approaches to diversity analyses complement and confirm these observations.",

However, if new taxa are introduced or evenness in the distribution is increased, then the diversity of the combined distribution will be greater than the diversity measured individually. Since much of the mutually exclusive diversity tends to be found in the low abundant fraction when the equal-weighted pooling is performed, the Shannon diversity index does not differentiate well between the median and pooled diversity. A scatterplot of median individual diversity versus pooled diversity was generated for both the Shannon diversity index and \u03c4 on both OTU- and genera-based taxonomic units (Figure 3 and Table S2 for abbreviation to sample mapping). A simple linear regression line was drawn to indicate the mean ratio between pooled and individual diversity.

The slope of the regression line for the \u03c4 statistic is 9.617 and 1.768 for OTU- and genera-based taxonomic units, respectively. In particular, for OTUs it can be seen that the stool samples consist of significantly more mutually exclusive diversity than other body habitats. For genera-based taxa, the left and right antecubital fossae have the greatest mutually exclusive diversity. The pooled-to-median ratios for both OTU and genera-based taxonomic units reveal that the skin samples have more mutually exclusive diversity than the oral samples. This suggests that the taxonomic diversity in human oral habitats is shared more closely in the human population than skin habitats. The vaginal samples, because of their extremely low diversity, did not exhibit significant mutually exclusive diversity between donors, likely due to the unusual selective pressure of the environment.

The two parameters of core membership are abundance and ubiquity. The \u201cabundance\u201d refers to the percentage of a taxon in a sample and the \u201cubiquity\u201d refers to the percentage of samples that possess the taxon. As such, the ubiquity is a function of the abundance. From a probabilistic perspective, this relationship can be considered a CDF since as abundance decreases, ubiquity increases, making it monotonically increasing, continuous, and bounded at its limits between 0 and 1. However, for ease of interpretation, it is plotted as a monotonically decreasing function. Intuitively, one would expect that as the threshold of percent abundance of a taxon in question increases, fewer samples would be found in which this taxon exceeds that threshold. Thus, to define a core, it would be sufficient to identify the subset of taxa which exceed both predefined abundance and ubiquity thresholds.",

A single curve for each body habitat was derived by using the median of the discovered taxonomic units and a saturation point, Smax, was extrapolated with curve fitting. While curve fitting this median produced compelling results, i.e. those with low mean squared errors, the key drawback to this methodology was that it did not produce CIs. These are critical for any predictive methodology, since small changes in a curve\u2019s shape could produce large swings in Smax. In order to compute CIs, an alternative approach was chosen to bootstrap the sequence of individuals multiple times, curve fit each sequence, and then generate a set of Smax\u2019s from which to distill the median and 95% CIs. The total number of taxonomic units\u00a0encountered at\u00a0a particular\u00a0point of sequencing was divided by\u00a0the estimated value for Smax to approximate the current percent\u00a0coverage of population richness. This approach provides a parametric alternative to the commonly used non-parametric Good\u2019s coverage estimator, which is simply the number of taxonomic units sampled more than once, divided by the number of units sampled in total [35].",

The wide 95% confidence intervals around the Smax estimates, with the upper bounds frequently a few orders of magnitude greater than the median, suggested that given the variability in donor taxonomic compositions, there was still an insufficient number of donors to produce robust results with this methodology. The variation in the shape of the rarefaction curves, as a result of only permuting the order of donors sampled, indicated that the taxonomic profiles across individuals for the same body habitat could be highly variable. This observation was corroborated by the wide 95% CIs surrounding the site medians for both the Shannon diversity and \u03c4 statistics, as discussed previously. Nonetheless, the general trend still indicated that the skin and oral samples possess a greater number of taxa (genera- and OTU-based) when compared to vaginal samples, Figure 2c and 2f subfigures. For genera-based Smax predictions, the skin region was statistically significantly greater than the oral region (one-sided WRST, p-value \u200a=\u200a0.03). This was not seen before in both taxonomic and OTU calculations for both the Shannon and \u03c4 statistic. Oral and skin regions shared the same p-values for significance indicating greater diversity when compared to the vaginal region, as seen previously.

For example, an additional donor added to the curve for stool will lead to an additional 10.5 OTUs being discovered. Due to the low diversity of the vaginal microbiome, anticipated discovery rates were similar to other body sites, even though half as many samples were collected from the donor cohort. The left and right antecubital fossae experienced lower sampling success rates, resulting in a lower number of total samples and in taxonomic discovery rates that were noticeably higher when compared to other skin sites.

The genera-based units are assigned to the genus level, whereas the OTU-based units are considered to be proxies for species level granularity when clustering at 97% intracluster sequence similarity. Note, however, that the 97% similarity typically associated with species is meant to be applied to a full length 16 S sequence, e.g., paired-end Sanger sequencing, not to a shorter pyrosequencing read covering only 2\u20133 variable regions of the 16 S gene. As a result, if a targeted variable region contains greater genetic diversity than other portions of the rDNA sequence, the 97% cut off may produce more OTUs than taxonomic-based classifications such as species, depending on the phylogeny of the bacterium. Although OTU-based taxonomic units are more sensitive to sequencing errors, they are also more likely to treat novel organisms properly and partition sequences more accurately, since they do not depend on a database of known sequences to classify against. Contrariwise, the genera-based approach will group novel sequences together as unknown, and it is common for a single known genus to represent a variable number of species.",

The reported ratios were normalized by sequencing depth to minimize the impact of OTUs that may have been formed due to sequencing error as read depth increases. Note that this is an over correction, as one would expect that the rate of OTU formation would be less than linear compared to the increase in read depth. Even after this normalization is applied to make the estimates more conservative, it can still be seen that when a genus is dominant within a body region, it can have an OTU composition more complex than other body regions with the same genus present.

Stool samples held the greatest median OTU-to-genera ratio (27.20) while the vaginal and skin habitats revealed smaller ratios. Within the oral region, the highest median ratios were determined for the tongue dorsum (9.08), followed by the subgingival (8.71) and supragingival(8.67) plaques. These results may in part be indicative of the habitats in question as the tongue dorsum represents the papillated surface of the tongue, while the plaque samples represent biofilms adhered to a non-shedding hard surface [36].

After the application of the 1% abundance filter (green), there was not a significant change in the computed Shannon diversity indices for each body habitat when compared to all taxonomic units (blue). This result was consistent between OTU-based and genera-based units. However, an examination of the \u03c4 statistic revealed a stronger impact due to the removal of the rare taxonomic units, especially for the OTU-based taxonomic units. Computation of Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient between Smax and the Shannon diversity index resulted in the values of 0.326 (genera-based) and 0.574 (OTU-based). The higher the correlation between the diversity index and Smax, the better the diversity index can predict the magnitude of Smax. In contrast, examination of the \u03c4 statistic revealed a greater impact from truncating the rare taxonomic units. This is displayed by the downward shift of the \u03c4 statistic. Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient was measured as 0.552 and 0.941, for genera-based and OTU-based taxonomic units, respectively.

The CDFs of four commonly used theoretical probability distributions (log-normal, gamma, Pareto, and Fr\u00e9chet), were fit to each rarefaction curve, see Figure S2. Fitting of the rarefaction curve to the same probability density function (PDF) was not attempted, because the derivative of the rarefaction curve produced a very unsmooth result due to the variability of donor diversity. To fit the theoretical CDF to the targeted rarefaction curve required the optimization of each distribution\u2019s parameters, usually the shape and scale. Any location parameters were generally fixed at zero, because the rarefaction curve starts at zero donors and zero discovered taxonomic units. In addition to the standard distribution specific parameters, the additional parameter Smax was also included for optimization. The cost, or objective, function to be minimized was the root mean square distance (RMSD) between the rarefaction curve and the theoretical parameterized CDF multiplied by Smax. The RMSD was chosen because it allowed for the comparison of fitness between curve fits of unequal donor size. The R function, optim, was used with the Nelder-Mead algorithm to perform the optimization. To avoid the common problem with stopping at local minima, multiple optimization runs were performed. An initial run was performed with Smax seeded at the number of taxa in the target sample\u2019s distribution. After a first Smax estimate was made, a new set of optimizations was seeded from various distances relative to the first Smax estimate. The set of parameters with the lowest RMSD value across all seeded optimizations was reported.",

Samples were obtained from 15 male or 18 female body sites (habitats) using a common sampling protocol (see http://hmpdacc.org/doc/HMP_Clinical_Protocol.pdf). The following body habitats were sampled: nine oral samples (saliva, swabs from the buccal mucosa, tongue, keratinized gingiva, hard palate, tonsils, and throat, and sub- and supragingival plaque scraping); three vaginal samples (swabs from the vaginal introitus, posterior fornix, and vaginal midpoint); four skin samples (bilateral retroauricular crease and antecubital fossa swabs); airways (both anterior nares, swabbed and pooled); and stool (self collected by commode kit).

Data from the \u201chigh stringency\u201d pipeline was used in this analysis and quality was assured with the following steps described here in brief. For sample multiplex barcode deconvolution and 16 S primer trimming, a one nucleotide unambiguous mismatch to the sample barcode and up to two nucleotide mismatches to the adjacent PCR primer were allowed, respectively. Sequences with an ambiguous base call or a homopolymer stretch longer than eight nucleotides were removed from subsequent analyses. The high stringency pipeline incorporated a strategy of calculating the average quality score within a 50 nucleotide window that was shifted along the sequence. When the average quality score of the window decreased to <35, the sequence was trimmed. After trimming, all sequences were aligned using a NAST-based sequence aligner [37] to a custom reference based on the SILVA [38] database of curated alignments. Sequences shorter than 200 nucleotides or that did not align to the anticipated region of the reference alignment were removed and extraneous bases that extended beyond the targeted variable region were trimmed. Chimeric sequences were then identified using the Mothur implementation of the ChimeraSlayer algorithm which was trained to the \u201cGold\u201d database (http://microbiomeutil.sourceforge.net). These filtered alignments formed the data set used for the generation of taxonomic classifications using RDP [22].",
