However, when and how microbial communities within each body niche acquire unique taxonomical and functional signatures in early life remains underexplored. We thus sought to assess the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota across multiple body sites, and assess the impact of mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women in their early 3rd trimester (n=81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks post-delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n=81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at delivery. Samples were collected for each maternal-infant dyad across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogenous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks, the infant microbiota structure and function had significantly expanded and diversified, with body site serving as the primary determinant of the bacterial community composition and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with Cesarean delivery in some body sites (oral, nares, and skin; R2 = 0.038), this was not true in neonatal stool (meconium, Mann-Whitney p>0.05) and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. By 6 weeks of age, the infant microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (p<0.001, R2 = 0.189), and no discernable differences in neither community structure nor function by Cesarean delivery were identifiable (p=0.057, R2 = 0.007). We conclude that within the first 6 weeks of life, the infant microbiota undergoes significant reorganization that is primarily driven by body site and not by mode of delivery.",

However, the clinical decision to deliver via Cesarean is often indicated by the underlying maternal or fetal medical diagnoses or co-morbidities, and is accompanied by varying use of medications, including antibiotics and anti-inflammatory pain analgesics23. Several previous studies identified distinct microbiota initially colonizing the neonatal microbiome differentially associated with either Cesarean or vaginal deliveries, but many of these were limited by small cohort sizes, potential for significant confounders, or a lack of longitudinal infant sampling24\u201326. A subsequent study by Azad et al. reported differences in the infant gut microbiota by virtue of the type of Cesarean delivery performed (emergent versus non-labored/elective), suggesting that the differences associated with Cesarean births may be due to the underlying medical indication, rather than the surgical procedure per se27. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Cesarean births in the United States are not by maternal request but are rather indicated (e.g. arrest of active labor, fetal malpresentation, severe preeclampsia & HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelets), fetal macrosomia, and/or prior Cesarean delivery28) and yet the impact of such potential confounders on the offspring microbiota have not been established and remains underexplored23. In addition, while Cesarean deliveries can be classified based on whether or not the mother was in active labor prior to the Cesarean surgery (potentially indicating descent of the fetus into the vaginal canal or exposure to vaginal microbes), the impact of labored versus unlabored Cesarean on the offspring microbiota has been initially considered, but remains underexplored and often overlooked by many studies. Finally, since diet is known to be a potent and persistent modifier of the microbiota in both adults and children29,30, and human milk modifies the infant microbiota31\u201333, infant feeding practices in association with mode of delivery have been accounted for in some studies, but need to be more thoroughly evaluated",

An endpoint of approximately 4\u20136 weeks postpartum (hereon out referred to simply as 6 weeks) was chosen because at this age, infants still consume a relatively homogenous diet of human milk and/or formula, have limited person-to-person contact, and are not yet exposed to a wide variety of environmental sources of microbes (e.g. not yet attending daycare and not yet crawling). In all, a cohort of mother-neonate dyads (n=81) was prospectively enrolled from our county hospital (Ben Taub General Hospital, Harris Health System, Houston, Texas) and sampled starting in the early third trimester. The Dirichlet-multinomial distribution was used to power our study to detect a difference in the infant microbiota by virtue of mode of delivery at the 6 week time point. As subjects were enrolled, preliminary sequencing efforts demonstrated lower read counts in neonatal samples taken at delivery as opposed to postpartum (Table S1). Therefore, to increase our power to detect a difference based on mode of delivery at birth, we enrolled a matched cross-sectional cohort of gravidae (n=82) that was sampled once at the time of delivery (Fig. S1A). Of the longitudinally sampled cohort, two withdrew and four delivered at another site and thus were excluded. An additional fifteen subjects were lost to follow up. No losses were incurred in the cross-sectional cohort. In all, 157 mother-neonate dyads were sampled at delivery, with 60 dyads longitudinally sampled (Fig. S1A). As shown in Table S2 and consistent with our delivery population, the enrolled cohort consisted of primarily Hispanic women (90.0%) who delivered singleton pregnancies (96.2%) at term (88.5%). The rate of Cesarean delivery was similar to the U.S. national incidence (33.1% vs. 32.7%, respectively, p=0.91)20. The baseline maternal characteristics of the two cohorts were similar, except for a greater proportion of gestational diabetes in mothers enrolled in the longitudinal cohort (44.0% vs. 17.1%, p<0.001, Table S2). Furthermore, the baseline maternal characteristics were similar between mothers who delivered vaginally (n=105) or by Cesarean (n=52) (all p>0.05), except for a greater proportion of twin pregnancies undergoing Cesarean delivery (Student\u2019s t-test, p=0.008; Table S3). Finally, the rate of gestational diabetes (GDM) and occurrence of Class I-Class III obesity, mean pre-pregnancy BMI, and incidence of fetal macrosomia did not vary among women who underwent Cesarean surgery when compared to those who delivered their infants vaginally (Tables S2 and S3). Overall, the characteristics of the enrolled cohort reflect the typical demographic of patients seen in most Maternal-Fetal Medicine clinics. However, as evidenced by the nationally comparable Cesarean delivery rate, intrapartum management of these subjects\u2019 pregnancies was likely in line with the standard of care provided to the general population.",

Only the neonatal meconium appeared to cluster separately from the skin, nares and oral cavity (Adonis p<0.001), with a small R2 value (0.038) suggestive of minimal body site variation. Pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarity comparisons between samples among subjects (beta diversity) further corroborated these observations. In maternal subjects, the beta diversity between maternal samples obtained from the same body site was significantly lower than that between different body sites (Fig. 1B, gray solid line vs. gray dotted line).

To measure the specificity of a taxa to a given site, we determined its Indicator Value (IndVal) Index, which considers the relative abundance of a taxa in a given site and its relative frequency of occurrence across all sites34. A maximum IndVal value represents taxa that are found in only a single site and are found within all individuals. Thus, taxa with a large IndVal can be thought of as a signature taxa for a given body site. Linear Discriminate Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis was additionally performed to further corroborate representative taxa (Fig. S3). For example, in the maternal subjects, Lactobacillus was both highly abundant and highly specific for the vagina (avg. abundance 64.7%, IndVal = 0.922; Fig. 1C; Table S4), while Bacteroides was prevalent and highly specific for the maternal stool (avg. abundance 27.8%, IndVal = 0.943; Fig. 1C; Table S4), which is consistent with previous observations by ourselves and others1,6,35. In contrast, few signature taxa were detected in the neonatal microbiota at delivery. Consistent with previous studies6,24, predominant members of the vaginal and skin microbiota of the adult, namely Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, were also the most abundant genera in the neonates across all body sites (Fig. 1C; Table S4). However, none of these taxa were specific to any body site (all IndVal < 0.5). Of interest, many neonatal meconium samples harbored Escherichia and Klebsiella (avg. abundance 14.3% and 6.4%, respectively), which was not seen in any other body site (all < 0.03%). Notably, these taxa are known facultative anaerobes typical of the early gastrointestinal tract30,36, which have been previously detected in the placenta and amniotic fluid by both 16S rRNA gene and WGS sequencing37\u201339.",

                    "text": "By 6 weeks of age, however, the community structure of the infant microbiota appeared to be primarily driven by body site differences, similar to the maternal microbiota. The stool, oral and skin microbiota clustered distinctly with the nares bridging the oral and skin body sites (Adonis p<0.001, R2=0.189; Fig. 2A). Similarly, patterns of beta diversity (Fig. 2B) and signature taxa (Fig. 2C) were similar to maternal communities (Fig. 2B,C). For instance, the infants\u2019 oral gingiva was similarly characterized by Streptococcus (60.7%, IndVal = 0.73), while the infant\u2019s skin and nares were similarly characterized by Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium (Table S5). More appreciable differences could be detected between the infant and maternal stool. As has been previously published35, the maternal stool was dominated by either Bacteroides or Prevotella, though only Bacteroides was considered a signature taxa for the maternal gut (Bacteroides IndVal = 0.92). In contrast, Escherichia and Klebsiella were both prominently abundant (~10% on average) and highly specific for the infant gut (IndVal, 0.95 and 0.75, respectively), which conforms to previous observations of the typical microbial constituents of infant stool at this age30,40 (Fig. 2C; Table S5). Although the infant and maternal microbiota as a whole shared similar community structure and genus level membership (Fig. 2), the microbial communities of the infant within most body habitats remained distinct at the OTU level. The infant nares, oral cavity and gut clustered distinctly from its maternal counterpart, while no difference could be detected between the infant and maternal skin (Fig. S4). Furthermore, measurements of taxa diversity within a sample revealed that at 6 weeks, with the exception of skin, the infant tended to harbor more simple communities than in mothers (Fig. S5). Thus, while body site differences appear to drive the reorganization of the infant microbiota across body habitats within the first 6 weeks of life, these site-specific communities are generally less ecologically rich and harbor unique communities from the mother.",

By PCoA, we observed marginal significant clustering in the neonatal microbiota by virtue of mode of delivery only in the oral cavity, nares, and skin (Adonis R2 0.038), but not the meconium (Mann-Whitney p>0.05; Fig. 3A). Alpha diversity was similarly reduced in neonates at the time of birth born by Cesarean delivery in the oral cavity and skin microbiota (p<0.001), but not the nares or meconium (p>0.05; Fig. S6). These marginal differences appeared to be driven by an increased association of Propionibacterium and Streptococcus with Cesarean-born neonates while Lactobacillus was associated with those born vaginally (Fig. S7). Reflecting this observation, pairwise beta diversity comparisons between mother-neonate dyads revealed that neonates born vaginally tended to be more similar to the maternal vagina (Fig. S8), which was predominantly comprised of Lactobacillus at the time of delivery (Fig. 1C). However, at 6 weeks, the infant microbiota did not significantly cluster by mode of delivery at any body site (Fig. 3B), nor did alpha diversity significantly differ (Fig. S6). Hierarchical clustering of taxa at the genus level further demonstrated primary clustering by body site, but without appreciable clustering by mode of delivery (Fig. S9).",

Having extensively sampled multiple maternal body sites in parallel with equivalent neonatal and infant samples, we thus sought to perform SourceTracker analysis41 to predict the most probable maternal origin of the neonatal microbiota. Samples from different maternal body sites were considered to be potential sources of OTUs for each neonatal sample. From this analysis, we obtained an estimated proportion of OTUs of a given neonatal sample predicted to originate from either the maternal skin, vagina, stool, nares, oral cavity or an unknown source (Fig. S10, S11). Because neonates delivered by Cesarean are thought to be populated by maternal skin microbiota rather than vaginal microbiota24,40, data were plotted on a ternary plot to highlight these two maternal body sites (Fig. 3C,D). Moreover, because differences in the neonatal microbiota have previously been shown by virtue of Cesarean indication (emergent vs. non-emergent)27, comparisons were further stratified by whether or not the mother had labored before the Cesarean procedure (here on out referred to as a labored or unlabored Cesarean delivery). For neonates delivered vaginally, most body sites demonstrated a bimodal pattern of maternal origin \u2013 while many sites were predominantly populated by microbiota originating of the mother\u2019s vagina, a substantial number were predominantly populated by microbiota of the maternal skin (Fig. 3C). Notably, meconium samples additionally harbored OTUs predicted to originate from the maternal stool (Fig. S10). Thus, except for the infant gut, the maternal vagina and skin appear equally contribute to a majority of the early taxa of the vaginally delivered neonate. This bimodal pattern among vaginally born neonates was similarly seen in neonates delivered by a labored Cesarean, but not by an unlabored Cesarean (Fig. 3C). In the latter case, a majority of samples from neonates delivered by an unlabored Cesarean were primarily populated by microbiota found in the maternal skin. Thus, whether or not labor had occurred prior to delivery, rather than the Cesarean procedure itself, appeared to have the greatest impact on the maternal origin of microbiota.",

We next sought to examine how these three genera were impacted by mode of delivery and other clinical variables at 6 weeks of age. The abundance of these three taxa were classified as either being undetectable (0%), sparsely present (>0.1%), appreciably present (>1%) or moderately abundant (>10%). Comparisons of the gut microbiota at delivery revealed that in all Cesarean and the majority of vaginally delivered infants, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides were appreciably (i.e., not undetectable at greater than 0%) present at the time of delivery (Fig. 4A\u2013D). By 6 weeks of age, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium continued to be appreciably present and similar by virtue of mode of delivery in the neonatal stool (Fig. 4A). By shotgun sequencing, Bacteroides were undetectable in just three infant stool samples, all of which belong to infants born not by Cesarean but rather by vaginal delivery (Fig. S12). To further interrogate if mode of delivery had a significant impact on the relative abundance of these three genera while controlling for other factors, we employed a generalized linear model. Based on previous literature, breastfeeding practices26,32,42, gestational age36, maternal and infant obesity/macrosomia45,46, maternal diet (% fat intake)47 and maternal gestational diabetes48 all have been reported to impact the very early infant microbiome; thus these were used in model creation. Of the imputed factors, breastfeeding practices was the only significant contributor to the abundance of Bacteroides in the infant stool at 4\u20136 weeks of age, with exposure to formula associated with increased levels of Bacteroides (Fig. S13, Table S6). We have recently published47 that increased maternal fat intake during gestation is significantly associated with decreased abundance of Bacteroides, but only after a potential outlier was excluded from analysis. No factors were significantly associated with altered Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus abundance (Fig. S13, Table S6).",

Overall, the metagenomic profiles clustered by virtue of age and by body site (Fig. 5A and 5B), indicating overall similarities in site-specific microbial activities. However, while the maternal gut metagenome appeared much more consistent and evenly diverse than taxonomic abundances (Fig. 5A, see also Table S5), a significant amount of heterogeneity was seen in the neonatal oral and gut metagenomes at delivery (Fig. S14). This was particularly apparent in the neonatal oral cavity. For example, the relative abundance of alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism in neonatal oral samples were undetectable in half of the sequenced samples (0% relative abundance), but present at greater than 2.3% in the other half (median abundance across all samples 2.4%, Table S7). However, at 6 weeks, both the infant oral and stool metagenomes were significantly more similar between body sites of different individuals (Fig. S14), indicating convergence toward a shared set of microbial metabolic pathways and activities unique to each body site. Comparisons of the infant stool and oral cavity metagenomes revealed that each was enriched for pathways that potentially reflected a selective advantage of specific microbiota to its local environment (Fig. 5D). For example, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis is a key feature of gram-negative enteric bacteria and was fittingly increased in the infant stool metagenome compared to that of the oral cavity. Additionally, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, which is critical for bile acid metabolism and conjugation49, was also increased in the infant stool metagenome compared to that of the infant oral cavity. In contrast, amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism was seen to be a predominant feature of the infant oral metagenome.",

In comparison, the infant gut metagenome at 6 weeks was significantly enriched for pathways related to co-factor metabolism and biosynthesis, including folate, biotin and vitamin B6, which are known to be important for growth, metabolism and neurodevelopment50. However, the infant gut metagenome was still greatly outnumbered by the maternal in both gene counts and unique species present (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, several pathways discriminated the infant and maternal gut metagenomes (Fig. 5D), including an enrichment of TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism in the maternal gut.

This approached allowed us to quantify the contribution of each variable to the pathway abundances, while controlling for possible confounding between clinical metadata. Again based on previous literature, we considered mode of delivery, intrapartum antibiotics51, breastfeeding practices at 6 weeks of age32, gestational weight gain38, maternal gestational diabetes or pre-pregnancy BMI46, and gestational age36 at the time of delivery as possible fixed effects in our model. Of all of the pathways considered, no single pathway correlated with any clinical variable considered in our model, indicating that the relative frequency of most functions throughout the infant stool microbiota were consistent across individuals and robust to exogenous perturbations including Cesarean delivery (Fig. 6A). Similarly, few species in the infant stool identified by WGS sequencing were significantly altered in our model (Fig. S15). Intrapartum antibiotics appeared to have the greatest effect on pathway variation, as ten distinct pathways were either positively or negatively correlated with intrapartum antibiotic usage (Fig. 6B). In contrast, gestational age and pre-pregnancy BMI had little impact on pathway variation within the infant stool. Of particular interest, given co-linearity with antibiotic usage and breastfeeding practices, Cesarean mode of delivery per se did not bear a differential effect on the infant metagenome nor its function when subjected to robust linear mixed modeling controlling for covariates as fixed effects.",

Although the neonatal microbiota at the time of delivery was sparsely populated and predominantly comprised of taxa of the maternal skin and vaginal microbiota, by 6 weeks of age, the major patterns of community variation was most strongly associated with body site grouping with concomitant coalescence of functional and metabolic microbial pathways reflective of probable selection within or adaptations to a given body niche. However, while the infant skin most resembled the maternal microbiota, the stool, nares and oral cavity harbored distinct microbial communities from their maternal counterparts. These differences likely reflect age related physiological differences between the maternal and infant body habitats, including nutrient availability and oxygen exposure.",

We similarly found that after several weeks, each body niche was enriched for taxa that were characteristic of their adult counterparts, such as Streptococcus in the oral cavity, likely indicating a common maturation process. However, our study further extends these observations though the generation of rich WGS data, which provides the benefit of interrogating both taxonomic abundances and community function within this early time period. Our results suggest that similar to microbiota abundance, site-specific functional pathways emerge very early on in life, before extensive contact to environmental sources which may influence community membership and consequent function.",

First, our cohort was ethnically homogenous (mostly Hispanic) and was comprised of primarily term infants; thus specific observations of the predominant taxonomic and pathway abundances of the infant metagenome may not be generalizable to preterm neonates or other ethnic populations. Previous observations have indicated that in adult and infant populations43, there are large differences between individuals of different ethnic populations residing in different countries and societal structures. Thus the specific taxa or functions that become enriched early on may vary depending on the environmental context. Nevertheless, considering that the adult microbiota is driven to a larger extent by body site habitat and not ethnicity, we anticipate that gross reorganization of the infant microbiota by body site within this early time period is generalizable across populations, though additional studies are needed to confirm this.",

However, the rate of gestational diabetes did not vary among women who later delivered their infants via Cesarean or vaginal birth (Table S2) and gestational diabetes (as well as other potential or likely confounders) were included in our GLM analysis. Since other studies have not reported maternal gestational nor Type II diabetes as characteristics of their cohort, we cannot directly compare nor speculate as to whether their findings might be a result of confounding or co-linearity24,40,42\u201344,52. This would necessarily include those characteristics and comorbidities which render risk or indication for Cesarean delivery, such as poorly controlled diabetes with resultant fetal macrosomia. As one such example, it is worthwhile noting that the landmark study of Dominquez-Bello et al does not report at-risk maternal characteristics such as diabetes nor BMI, but does describe infant birth weight ranges of up to 5.2 kg24. Thus, in their study comprised of 11 neonates from Venezuela (6 born via Cesarean surgery), at least one neonate was macrosomic (\u201cBabies weighed between 2 and 5.2 kg (the smallest baby was the twin in second order of birth, after his 3-kg brother)\u201d)24. A 5.2 kg infant would be 1.0 kg heavier than more than 98% of the birth population by WHO standards. While there are multiple underlying causes of fetal macrosomia, common causes include poorly controlled maternal diabetes. Additional causes include genetic and epigenetic overgrowth disorders, chronic caloric excess, and maternal obesity. These were excluded or controlled for in our study analysis, and our mean infant birthweight was 3.237 kg (\u00b10.68 kg) with no significant difference in birthweight observed when comparing infants born vaginally to those delivered by Cesarean (p 0.85; Table S2 and S3). Notably, in our entire cohort of 162 infants, only one exceeded 5 kg (birthweight 5.085 kg; Table S8).",

Previous studies have detected bacteria associated with the placenta and amniotic fluid of preterm and healthy, term pregnancies37,39,53\u201355 while work in murine models have demonstrated maternal transmission of bacteria to the fetal gut during gestation, consistent with microbial colonization of the mouse fetus occurring prior to delivery56. More recently, the neonate\u2019s first intestinal discharge (meconium) has been shown to harbor a microbial community similar to that of the amniotic fluid and placenta39,57,58. Interestingly, the meconium microbiota was shown to vary with maternal glycemic control, but not mode of delivery, indicating that establishment of the neonatal microbiota can be potentially altered by gestational exposures48. Consistent with these findings, we observed that the meconium microbiota was markedly different from other neonatal body sites at the time of delivery, indicating a potentially different maternal origin. Additionally, unlike the skin, oral cavity or nares, the neonatal gut microbiota at the time of delivery did not significantly vary by mode of delivery. The content of the first meconium is hypothesized to reflect the in utero environment (whereby the infant is swallowing amniotic fluid continuously from mid to late gestation), and thus we speculate that these microbes were similarly transmitted from the mother to the fetus during gestation, suggesting that seeding of the early microbiota may occur earlier than was previously thought. However, additional studies are needed to evaluate potential mechanisms of transmission and its potential impact on fetal programming and the establishment of the infant gut microbiome long-term.",

However, this was not true of the gut microbiota, which appeared to have a distinct maternal origin from the rest of the body sites. A number of studies have indicated that the early composition of the gut may be influenced by maternal exposures or health status, which may account for the lack of separation by mode of delivery in our study. Our previously published work in a non-human primate model demonstrated that maternal diet during gestation and lactation has a persistent impact on the gut microbiota of the offspring at least up to one year of age. In conjunction with these findings, we\u2019ve similarly seen in human cohorts that the composition of the early infant gut microbiome associated with maternal diet in the last trimester of pregnancy, independent of mode of delivery and maternal obesity47. In addition to maternal gestational diet, maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, and maternal glycemic control us have also been attributed to differences in the early infant gut microbiome. Notably, these maternal health states also increase the risk that the pregnancy will be delivered by Cesarean28. However, accounting for these potential confounders in our study, we did not find significant differences in infant gut microbiome which could be reliably nor significantly attributed to Cesarean nor vaginal mode of delivery.",

Division of Cesarean deliveries by indication (labored vs. unlabored) revealed that the differences in the neonatal microbiota at birth associated with mode of delivery was most pronounced when comparing unlabored Cesarean to vaginal deliveries. In our cohort, these unlabored Cesarean deliveries were generally among women with a history of prior Cesarean and electing for a repeat Cesarean, rather than a trial of labor with attempted vaginal birth after Cesarean. This is in agreement with the observations of Azad et al.27, which identified differences in the infant gut microbiome at 4 months of age when Cesarean deliveries were classified as either being emergent (typically labored) or elective (typically unlabored). This is not surprising, as Cesarean delivery is not a randomly allocated procedure but rather is indicated for an underlying maternal or fetal medical condition23. Ergo, prior small studies24,25 which do not account for underlying indication for the Cesarean surgery, may be prone to both Type I and Type II error resulting in misclassification of the attribution of Cesarean delivery per se as a driving force in any dysbiosis in the infant microbiota.",

These include: Cesarean delivery40,43,52, exclusive breastfeeding26,42,59, maternal high fat diet47, maternal obesity46, transition to solid foods30, and other yet unknown factors52. Based on the work of Bakhed et al.40, Bacteroides species can be acquired postnatally, with a notable increase at 4 months of age among both Cesarean and vaginally delivered infants. Ergo, any supposition relating relative abundance and less abundance to Cesarean delivery per se must be threaded with caution. This may include introduction of antibiotics postnatally51,52,60, formula feeding42,59, as well as solid foods30. In the current study, we focused on early exposures since they are most proximal to the intrauterine and intrapartum period of exposure, and least likely to be subjected to exogenous postnatal influences. We have now demonstrated with WGS data that both vaginally and Cesarean delivery infants can have low Bacteroides counts. In our cohort, and distinct from that of B\u00e4cked40, no Bacteroides at birth at 6 weeks of age was found only among vaginally delivered infants (n=3) and every Cesarean delivered infant had detectable Bacteroides (Fig. S12). These findings are consistent with a recent publication by Yassour et al.60 which similarly observed low Bacteroides in 20% of vaginally delivered infants. Even when we extend our definition of significantly variant taxa to include those identified by Dominquez-Bello as being perturbed in Cesarean and only restored with vaginal wiping44, we failed to see significantly altered taxonomic profiles. Specifically, sequential definitions of low Bifidobacterium or high Lactobacillus were equally probable in vaginally and Cesarean delivered infants (Fig. S12). Finally, when we examined 4\u20136 week old infants with either absent or relatively low Bacteroides and assigned relative risk estimated for a number of antenatal factors, low Bacteroides were most likely to be delivered by vaginal birth (Fig. S12).",

We further demonstrate that there is no discernable impact of Cesarean mode of delivery on the early microbiota beyond the immediate neonatal period (and never inclusive of meconium nor stool), and that early taxonomic distinctions are not recapitulated by functional pathway analysis. These findings underscore the likely importance of interrogating not only the relative abundance of members of the microbiota, but their potentially overlapping metabolic pathways, when considering the impact of an intervention on diversity of the microbiota.",

An overview of the study design is shown in Fig. S1A. An initial cohort of gravidae and their infants (n=81) were prospectively enrolled in the 3rd trimester from the Ben Taub County Hospital in Houston, Texas. Assuming a Cesarean rate equivalent to the U.S. national average (32%)20, this cohort size achieved a power of at least 0.80 to detect a difference in the taxonomic composition by virtue of mode of delivery at the 6 week time point, based on an estimated read count of at least 5000 and a small effect size (\u03a6=0.07 at an \u03b1=0.05). Power calculations were based on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution as described in La Rosa et al.61. A second cross-sectional cohort (n=82) was additionally enrolled to increase the power to detect differences by virtue of mode of delivery at the time of delivery. This second cohort increased enrollment of Cesarean deliveries, thus capturing a larger number of types of Cesarean indications (labored vs. unlabored, n=26 for both, Table S9). All subjects were enrolled under Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB) H-27393. Subjects included in this study had a viable pregnancy >28 weeks gestation, were 18 years of age or older, and willing to consent to all aspects of the protocol. Subjects were excluded if there was known HIV or Hepatitis C infection, known immunosuppressive disease, known use of cytokines or immunosuppressive agents within the last 6 months, a history of cancer except squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin managed by local excision, treatment of suspicion of ever having toxic shock syndrome, or major surgery of the GI tract except cholecystectomy or appendectomy in the past five years. During the consent process, subjects were informed of the potential risks of participation, including the minimal physical risks associated with specimen collection, and the possibility that protected health information or de-identified project data could be accidentally released. Several precautions described in the protocol and consent form were taken to reduce these risks.",

Sequences were preprocessed to remove sequences less than 200 nucleotides, greater than 700 nucleotides, or sequences with a minimum average quality score less than 25. Remaining sequences were trimmed of reverse primer sequences and trimmed at the first ambiguous base call. Sequences below 200 nucleotides after trimming were subsequently removed. Retained high quality sequences were subsequently assigned to the sample of origin using the uniquely identifying barcode sequence and thereafter trimmed of the barcode and 5\u2019 primer. To remove human contamination, high quality reads were mapped to the human genome (GRCh38) using DeconSeq (v 0.4.3) and highly similar sequences to the human genome reference were subsequently removed from the dataset64. Remaining sequence data and associated flowgram data were aggregated by body site and denoised to reduce sequencing errors using the QIIME denoising pipeline (denoise_wrapper.py). All denoised sequences were aggregated and de novo operational taxonomic unit (OTU) were identified. Sequences were clustered into distinct OTUs at 97% similarity using the UCLUST65 method. Chimeric sequences were identified and removed using ChimeraSlayer on the QIIME workflow script (v 1.9.0, identify_chimeric_seqs.py)66. The RDP classifier67 (v2.2) retrained against the May 8th 2013 version of the GreenGenes68 taxonomic database was used to assign taxonomy for each OTU at a confidence greater than 50% at the lowest level of assignment.

Bubble plots of relative taxonomic abundances were generated using the R package ggplot. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe v1.0) was performed with a LDA cut off of 2.0 with a significance value (p) of 0.0569. Diversity within samples (alpha diversity) and between samples (beta diversity) were evaluated on the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) table (16S) or KEGG pathway table (WGS) as indicated. For alpha diversity, samples were first rarefied at 2000 sequences before diversity indexes were calculated. Significance was determined by Mann Whitney U tests. To evaluate OTU discovery as a function of sequencing depth, reads per sample were plotted against the number of unique OTUs using PRISM (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and regression lines were fitted. Significance between linear regression slopes was determined by Student\u2019s t-test. For beta diversity measurements, both phylogenetic (UniFrac) and non-phylogenetic (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard) distance matrixes were determined. Cumulative distribution plots of beta diversity distances were generated using PRISM. Principal component analysis (PCoA) was performed on distance matrices as indicated with significance of clustering determined by PERMANOVA or Adonis with 999 permutations. PCoA plots and confidence ellipses were generated by the R package ggplot. Heatmaps were generated using the R package pheatmap. Heirarchical clustering was performed using complete linkage on Jaccard similarity coefficients or Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distances using the R package vegan as indicated. Phylogenetic trees were created with PhyloPhlAn (v0.99). Association of the metadata categories with the hierarchical clustering in the dataset was determined by a Chi-squared test.

The total counts of mapped reads by each algorithm are provided in Table S11. Gene counts and unique species counts were determined as described in the MetaHit project72. After quality filtering and removal of human contamination, reads were aligned against the MetaHIT gene catalog by using SOAPalign version 2.21 with parameters \u2018-m 200 -x 600\u2019. As long as the read could be aligned to a gene, the aligned gene was taken as one gene count. In order to assess the number of unique species, the collection of genes for each sample where then checked against the origin of species using the MetaHIT gene catalog taxonomic reference. Species were tabulated if any gene was represented in the data set.",

Hierarchical clustering was performed using average linkage on Euclidean distance. To identify factors with a significant impact on either species relative abundance or gene pathway abundance while controlling for other factors, we fitted a generalized linear model for each pathway or taxa with a normal distribution and a linear link function by residual maximum likelihood using the lme4 package in R. The KEGG pathway or taxa abundance was treated as the dependent variable as a function of mode of delivery, feeding method (any formula vs. exclusive breastfeeding), gestational weight gain category (excess vs. normal), maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM, antibiotic usage and gestational age as fixed effects. The categorical variables (mode of delivery, feeding and GWG) were represented using dummy variables. The base case for linear regression was set as vaginal delivery, exclusive breastfeeding, normal gestational weight gain and no antibiotic usage.",
