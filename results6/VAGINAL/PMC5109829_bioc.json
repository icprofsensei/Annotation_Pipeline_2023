Its latest chemistry allows the sequencing of 300\u00a0bp PCR fragments in both directions with full overlap and makes it appropriate for the sequencing of single variable regions and the bacterial 16S rRNA V1-2 gene region where full sequence overlap is desired [1]. However, the short read approach by second generation sequencing introduces biases depending on which variable regions are used and can not provide effective resolution below the bacterial genus level, limiting microbial ecology studies [5, 8]. Further, a large proportion of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene records in the GenBank database labeled as environmental samples are unclassified, which is in part due to low read accuracy, potential chimeric sequences produced during PCR amplification and the low resolution of short amplicons. High throughput full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing methodologies with reduced biases are needed.",

Phylogenetic profiling based on full-length bacterial 16S\u00a0 rRNA gene requires high read accuracy, and this should be achieved through the use of PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS).

Mosher and colleagues reported the first sequencing of full-length bacterial 16S\u00a0rRNA gene amplicons from environmental samples (sediment and rock biofilm) using the PacBio RS SMRT sequencing platform with XL/C2 chemistry in comparison with the Roche 454 GS FLX chemistry [10].

The PacBio full-length bacterial 16S\u00a0 rRNA gene sequences were grouped into 755 clusters (OTUs) at 97% sequence identity. The >10-fold increase in the number of OTU clusters obtained from the PacBio platform reflected the large sequencing error rate in the PacBio data at that time. One year later the same group reanalyzed two of their libraries with the updated P4/C2 chemistry and a run time of 180\u00a0minutes [11]. The PacBio RS II platform combined with P4/C2 chemistry improved sequence accuracy and number of high quality reads, compared to their initial assessment, from 80% to\u2009>\u200999% for the full length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence.

Both files were then used for amplicon size trimming to remove sequences outside the expected amplicon size (<1400\u00a0bp and >1600\u00a0bp) using the \u201ctrim.seqs\u201d command. A second \u201ctrim.seqs\u201d step was performed to remove any ambiguous sequences, sequences with homopolymers longer than 6\u00a0bp, and sequences with a quality window average below 35 over a rolling quality window size of 50\u00a0bp. Unique sequences were generated and aligned with sequences of the Silva reference database release 119, which is available from the Mothur homepage [21] using the default kmer searching method with the flip parameter set to true. The aligned sequences were screened using the \u201cscreen.seqs\u201d command to remove alignment outside the expected alignment coordinates (start\u2009=\u20091046, end\u2009=\u200943116). In order to decrease the sequencing error rate, we also implemented an additional screening step using the align report from the \u201calign.seqs\u201d step and screened the aligned sequences, setting the minscore to 80 or 90 (minimum alignment score) and the minsim to 80 or 90 (minimum similarity score). Then the \u201cfilter.seqs\u201d command was used to remove empty columns. The filtered sequences were pre clustered allowing 1% mismatch. The pre clustering implements a pseudo-single linkage algorithm with the goal of removing sequences that are likely due to sequencing errors. As a general rule we allow 1% difference (1\u00a0bp/100\u00a0bp of the 16S gene) for the bacterial 16S gene. Sequences were checked for chimeras using Chimera Uchime and the template option set to self. High quality filtered sequences were used for matrix generation (dist.seqs command with output\u2009=\u2009lt) and the phylip generated distance matrix was clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTU) using a cutoff of 0.10. Sequencing error was determined with Mothur using Staphylococcus aureus M1 as a reference sequence. High quality sequences and OTUs were classified using Silva.nr_v119.tax database, which is available from the Mothur homepage.

As expected we observed a higher number of OTUs in the low stringency post alignment screened datasets across the 97% (129 OTUs versus 33 OTUs), 98% (545 OTUs versus 36 OTUs) and unique OTU clusters (1513 OTUs versus 81 OTUs) (Table\u00a03). The higher number of OTUs seen in the low stringency screened datasets compared to the high stringency screened datasets is most likely a result of the high number of deletion errors present in these datasets, as seen in Fig.\u00a02b and \u200bandcc.\n",

The PacBio SMRT portal barcode filtering was able to assign 29,074 sequences to the eleven barcodes. We were able to increase the number of barcoded sequences by using MOTHUR software and the \u201cfastq.info\u201d function, which allows a user-defined barcode list and adjustable mismatches in the barcode sequence. Allowing four mismatches in the barcode sequence generated the same number of barcoded sequences as the PacBio SMRT portal (n\u2009=\u200929,074/58,951 raw sequences). The number of barcoded sequences could be increased to 34791, 35552, and 36098 reads by allowing one, two, and three mismatches in the barcode, respectively (this is because allowing 4 mismatches meant that some barcodes could not be uniquely assigned). For further analysis we used the filtered datasets with 2 allowed mismatches in the barcode. The MiSeq samples were part of a larger bacterial vaginosis study and were indexed with standard MiSeq indexing as outlined in the materials and methods section. The overall sequence error rate in the MiSeq data set was 0.00902%.",

The numbers of high quality reads in individual samples are shown in Additional file 3: Table S4. For PacBio we analyzed the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region, using the low stringency and high stringency post aligned screened datasets. This was compared with the MiSeq full-overlap paired-end sequenced bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region of the same sample cohort (Table\u00a01). For PacBio, we observed a very large number of OTUs in the low stringency post aligned screened datasets. This was most obvious for the full-length Bacterial 16S rRNA gene at unique (1316 OTUs), 99% (1109 OTUs), and 98% (453 OTUs) distance level, compared to 209 OTUs, 90 OTUs, and 63 OTUs for the same distance level, respectively, using the high stringency post aligned screened datasets. The largest proportions of the additional OTUs in the low stringency datasets were singleton OTUs. The differences between the PacBio in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region in regards to the observed number of OTUs between the two different post alignment screened datasets was much smaller. The difference was even smaller after removing the singleton OTUs (Table\u00a01). We analyzed the MiSeq dataset with all sequences (n\u2009=\u2009508,016; non-subsampled) and with a subsampled datasets of 27,596 sequences which was equivalent to the number of PacBio in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region dataset from the low stringency post alignment screening. As expected the number of OTUs was higher by analyzing the non-subsampled MiSeq bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene sequences. The number of singletons free OTUs in the subsampled MiSeq datasets was similar to the number of singletons free OTUs in the PacBio in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene datasets (Table\u00a01).",

Our implemented quality filtering steps removed low quality reads very consistently from the four different PacBio filtered \u22651 pass, \u22652 pass, \u22654 pass and \u22658 pass datasets. Interestingly, the sequence quality filtering resulted in very similar numbers of high quality reads from all four different filtered datasets despite large variations in the number of raw reads between the \u22651 pass (43268) and \u22658 pass (28042) datasets (Fig.\u00a01b, top panel). This emphasizes that a good quality filtering step is of great importance and that an increase in the minimum number of passes for PacBio CCS reads did not generate a larger number of high quality reads after using our applied quality filtering parameters. We further analyzed the effect of different post alignment screening and different allowed mismatches during the pre-clustering step on overall sequence error rates and sequence error types. As expected the sequence error rate decreased depending on the allowed mismatches during the pre-cluster step. In the no post aligned screened dataset, the overall sequence error rate decreased from 0.15%, to 0.10%, and to 0.07% allowing 5, 10, or 15 bases mismatches during the pre-clustering (Fig.\u00a01a). Schloss et al reported an overall sequence error rate of 0.027% allowing 15 bases mismatches during the pre-clustering [13]. The use of a different mock community and different laboratory/sequencing facility might have contributed to the different outcomes. Low stringency post alignment screening did not much improve the sequence error rate, but the high stringency post alignment screening has a dramatic improvement in the overall sequence error rate. We achieved a sequence error rate of 0.0365% and 0.00732% by allowing 10 and 15 mismatches, respectively, in the pre-clustering step. This was achieved for the 1 pass, 2 pass, and 4 pass dataset. The 0.0073% sequence error rate was smaller compared to the 0.00902% MiSeq error in this study. Within a given dataset and the same allowed pre-clustered mismatches, the number of passes did not improve the sequence error rate: i.e. the sequence error rate was very similar for the \u22651 pass, \u22652 pass, \u22654 pass, and \u22658 pass datasets (Fig.\u00a01a and Additional file 2: Table S2). This was in contrast to the Schloss study, which reported a reduced error rate by 8.48 to 37.08% with at least 10-fold coverage (10 passes) compared to those with less coverage.",

Other groups have reported insertions and deletions as the most abundance error types in PacBio sequence data [12, 24, 25]. Singer et al [12] also reported that substitutions errors are more difficult to correct than insertion and deletion errors. We could confirm the difficulty of removal of substitution errors, which were still present at the different hotspots after applying the high stringency post alignment screening which otherwise reduced the overall sequence error rate to an excellent range of 0.0073%.",

If we still consider the Sanger capillary sequencing of the full-length bacterial 16S as the gold standard for species identification, then the discrepancy in species detection between PacBio sequence data and capillary sequencing indicates that the sequencing error rates in PacBio consensus circular reads can lead to additional classification of false positive species. The larger number of shared species between capillary sequence data and the low stringent screened sequence data comes at the expense of identifying a larger proportion of false positive species. The larger number of false positive species in the low stringency post alignment screened dataset is a reflection of the higher number of OTUs obtained using the low stringency screening parameters (Table\u00a03). We could not identify a bias regarding different phyla and genera classification between capillary and PacBio full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene in the pooled stool community. Different species of the same genus were identified by capillary sequencing only, which were not detected by PacBio sequencing and vice versa (Table\u00a03). This highlights that species identification using bacterial 16S rRNA gene is a difficult process and should be conducted and concluded with great care.",

The similarity between species detected by MiSeq sequence data and PacBio sequence data was less consistent, despite a similar number of singletons free OTUs detected by the two platforms (not considering the non subsampled MiSeq dataset) (Table\u00a01). Interestingly, the largest numbers of species were identified from the MiSeq bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region datasets, despite containing the lowest number of OTUs compared to any of the PacBio datasets (Table\u00a04). From the PacBio low stringency screened in silico bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region dataset, 39/63 species (58%) were shared with the 70 MiSeq species, whereas from the high stringent screened in silico bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region dataset 26/48 species (37%) were shared with the 70 MiSeq species. The smaller number of OTUs and consequently smaller proportion of MiSeq shared species from the PacBio high stringency post aligned screened datasets (37% shared species) suggests that high stringency screening removed additional true positive OTUs and hence species from the dataset. On the other hand, low stringency post alignment screening resulted in an additional detection of 24 species compared to 22 species from the high stringency post alignment screening, which were not detected in the MiSeq dataset. The same pattern of additional false positive species using low stringency screening was observed in the stool colony study.",

No studies are available yet, which have investigated the enterotype clustering across different body habitats using full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene data.

The taxonomic profiling effectiveness between different bacterial 16S rRNA gene regions and full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene needs further validation, to determine whether the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene will provide better bacterial classification across different sample types. A true advantage of sequencing the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene would be the possible global comparison of microbiome studies, which currently can only be done with great difficulty due to different bacterial 16S rRNA gene regions used in different studies.",
