In the general population, gut microbial dysbiosis has been linked to cancer, yet is unclear whether these are associated in PHTS patients. In this pilot study, we aimed to characterize microbial composition of stool, urine, and oral wash from 32 PTEN mutation-positive individuals using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. PCoA revealed clustering of the fecal microbiome by cancer history (P\u2009=\u20090.03, R\n2\u2009=\u20090.04). Fecal samples from PHTS cancer patients had relatively more abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from family Rikenellaceae and unclassified members of Clostridia compared to those from non-cancer patients, whereas families Peptostreptococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae represented relatively more abundant OTUs among fecal samples from PHTS non-cancer patients. Functional metagenomic prediction revealed enrichment of the folate biosynthesis, genetic information processing and cell growth and death pathways among fecal samples from PHTS cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients. We found no major shifts in overall diversity and no clustering by cancer history among oral wash or urine samples. Our observations suggest the utility of an expanded study to interrogate gut dysbiosis as a potential cancer risk modifier in PHTS patients.",

These data provide evidence for PTEN-enabled cancer risk assessment, surveillance and medical management for PHTS patients as a group. However, there is currently no way to predict if any one individual harboring a PTEN mutation will develop cancer, and if so, which cancer(s). There is, therefore, a need to ascertain clinically significant risk factors for cancer at an individual level in PHTS.",

While the environmental component of a few cancers can be largely attributed to a single carcinogen\u2014for example, lung cancer and tobacco smoking\u2014this represents the exception, as most environmental contributors to cancer risk remain to be characterized (Bultman 2014). The human microbiome has recently received much attention as a potential modifier of cancer risk in the general population (Plottel & Blaser 2011). Breast cancer has been linked to dysbiosis, or perturbation of the normal microbial composition, of the breast and oral cavity (Xuan et al. 2014, Freudenheim et al. 2016). This association may be at least partly explained by altered microbial metabolism of estrogen in the dysbiotic microbiome (Flores et al. 2012, Fuhrman et al. 2014). Dysbiosis of the gut has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC), and alterations in the urinary microbiota have been linked to urothelial carcinoma (Louis et al. 2014, Xu et al. 2014). Proposed mechanisms for these links include injection of direct effectors into host cells, induction of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment and altered host\u2013microbiota interactions leading to activation of key cancer-promoting pathways like STAT3 and NF-\u03baB (Rajagopala et al. 2017).",

All beads, tubes and non-enzymatic reagents were treated with UV light for 30\u2009min prior to use (Tamariz et al. 2006). Briefly, total DNA was PCR-amplified using primers targeting the 16S V3 and V4 region (Illumina) (Klindworth et al. 2013) under the following conditions: 95\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 56\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 72\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. The resulting 16S rDNA amplicons were run on a 1% agarose gel, size-selected at 450\u2013500\u2009bp and gel-purified using QIAquick Gel Purification kit (Qiagen). A second round of PCR was performed to add Nextera XT indices (Illumina) to purified amplicons. Indexed PCR products were purified with Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and quantified with Qubit dsDNA system (ThermoFisher Scientific). Samples were then normalized and pooled into sequencing libraries at 20\u2009nM for oral wash and fecal samples and 1\u2009nM for urine samples, then validated on a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent) and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq with a V3 reagent kit at the Case Western Reserve University Genomics Core Facility.",

A hybrid sequencing analysis methodology was adopted, in which preprocessing was performed in QIIME and open-reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking was implemented within MICCA (Albanese et al. 2015). Vsearch (version 1.9.5) (Rognes et al. 2016) was used to cluster sequences with a threshold of 97% similarity, and representative sequences were classified using RDP classifier (version 2.11) (Wang et al. 2007). Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE (version 3.8.31) (Edgar 2004) against the Greengenes database (version 13.8) (DeSantis et al. 2006), filtered at 97% similarity, and FastTree (version 2.1.8) was used for phylogenetic tree construction (Price et al. 2009). Taxa represented in fewer than 5% of total samples in the group were then discarded. Rarefaction to 1000 reads per sample for fecal, 365 for urine and 1449 for oral wash samples was performed to reduce sampling heterogeneity, and computation of alpha (Shannon diversity index) and beta diversity measures (unweighted UniFrac distances) was performed with QIIME.",

It is well documented that gut microbiota of patients with sporadic, or non-PTEN related, breast and colorectal cancer compared to healthy controls are structurally distinct (Wang et al. 2012, Goedert et al. 2015, Flemer et al. 2017). In PHTS patients, we also found structurally distinct gut microbial communities in those with vs without cancer. While exposures related to cancer treatment may influence microbiome composition, the wide variety of combinations of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to which PHTS cancer patients may have been exposed makes it unlikely that this was a major confounding variable. Gut microbial communities were also distinct among PHTS patients with breast cancer compared to those without breast cancer. It is possible that the gut microbiome exerts a carcinogenic effect on the breast tissue via its role in estrogen metabolism; future microbiome studies could include an analysis of urine estrogen levels in PHTS patients with and without breast cancer to investigate this possibility.",

High levels of endogenous estrogens are a risk factor for breast cancer (Fuhrman et al. 2012), and obesity is a determinant of non-ovarian systemic estrogen levels and an independent risk factor for breast cancer, the most component cancer of PHTS (Cleary & Grossmann 2009). There is a known association of germline PTEN mutations with increased adiposity and paradoxically enhanced insulin sensitivity (Pal et al. 2012). In light of the many growth pathways that play dual roles in carcinogenesis and the development of obesity, it is plausible that Rikenellaceae may modulate signaling down the PI3K/AKT pathway that is constitutively activated in PHTS to modify risk for both cancer and obesity.",

                    "text": "Peptostreptococcaceae, whose members are motile anaerobes, has been reported to be relatively overrepresented in the gut microbiome of colorectal cancer patients (Ahn et al. 2013). In contrast, we observed a relative underrepresentation of Peptostreptococcaceae among fecal samples from PHTS patients with cancer compared to those without cancer. Clostridiaceae 1 was also underrepresented in fecal samples from PHTS patients with cancer; members of this family include pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens. In addition, members of Enterobacteriales including Enterobacteriaceae were relatively more abundant among fecal samples from non-cancer compared to cancer patients. Enterobacteriaceae has been implicated in intestinal inflammation (Morgan et al. 2012). According to mouse studies, inflammation driven by members of the Enterobacteriaceae family is necessary but not sufficient for carcinogenesis (Arthur et al. 2012). Given the immune dysregulation in PHTS patients and defects in mucosal B-cell homeostasis (Heindl et al. 2012, Chen et al. 2017), it is tempting to speculate that dysbiosis-associated inflammation could contribute to PHTS-associated cancer risk. It is almost certain that some non-cancer PHTS patients in this study will develop cancer; it would be interesting to see whether members of Enterobacteriaceae or Clostridiaceae are more relatively abundant in the gut microbiome of these patients, and whether a rise in these taxa coincides with cancer development. Future studies are warranted to provide a longitudinal view of the role of the microbiome in PHTS.",

Recent studies have linked excessive microbial folate production to a shortened lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, showing that metformin abrogates this effect by altering microbial folate metabolism (Virk et al. 2012, Cabreiro et al. 2013). There are many shared pathways in cancer and aging, and anti-folate medications are a mainstay of many cancer chemotherapy regimens. Given our findings, in the context of these associations, it is plausible that microbial folate biosynthesis could be a mediator of cancer risk in individuals with PHTS. Future studies are needed to better elucidate a potential role for microbial folate production in carcinogenesis.",

These hypotheses are worthy and our pilot data should provide a useful platform to inform such future studies. We did intend to compare PHTS with autism spectrum disorder and neurotypical PHTS.

While these findings are preliminary and require validation in a larger cohort, they suggest that the microbiota may have potential as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic target in the development of cancer in individuals with PHTS, with implications for cancer in the general population. We believe our observations may be sufficient to generate a hypothesis-driven expanded study to reveal differences in microbial composition and diversity not detected by this exploratory study, and to further explore sub-hypotheses suggested by the findings of this pilot study; for example, a potential relationship between the gut microbiota of PHTS patients, non-ovarian estrogen levels and cancer risk or investigate other potential variables affecting microbiota composition, such as seropositivity for common viruses such as HSV, often reactivated in patients with cancer (Djuric et al. 2009). In sum, therefore, investigation of the microbiome as a modifier of phenotype in those with heritable cancer syndromes, such as PHTS, is feasible and might show promise from risk assessment to medical management points of view.",
