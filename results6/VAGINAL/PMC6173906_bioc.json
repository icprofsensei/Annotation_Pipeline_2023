However, data are not currently available regarding the representation of microbial species composition in patient-collected swabs compared to provider-collected swabs among pregnant women. Considering the maternal physiologic changes in pregnancy, including the gravid abdomen and increased physiologic vaginal discharge, we aimed to evaluate if patient-collected swabs of the mid-vagina in pregnancy reflect the same microbial community characteristics as provider-collected swabs obtained during speculum exam.

Exclusion criteria were cervical cerclage and vaginal or intramuscular progesterone therapy. The patient was asked to self-collect a swab immediately prior to their provider visit at the same time that their urine specimen for routine obstetric care was obtained. The patient was provided a sterile dual-tipped rayon swab with instructions to remove the swab from the tube, spread her labia with her non-dominant hand, and then using her dominant hand, insert the swab approximately 3\u00a0cm into the vaginal canal, twist the swab within the vaginal canal to wipe in several full circles within the vagina, and remove the swab to place it back into the sterile collection tube. After the self-collection was complete the patient would see her provider and undergo a speculum examination for a provider-collected swab. For provider-collected swabs, a sterile speculum was introduced into the vagina, and the swab was applied to both mid-vaginal lateral sidewalls 3\u20135 times per side and placed back into the sterile collection tube.

V1V3 and V3V5 samples with weaker correlation between provider- and patient-collected swabs differed in relative abundances of different microbial taxa in each sample type.

In both the V1V3 and V3V5 regions, the patient-collected swabs did not cluster separately from provider-collected swabs. Additionally, paired patient- and provider-collected swabs sampled from the same patient at the same time point clustered closely, suggesting that bacterial microbial communities identified by patient self-sampling are similar to those obtained from provider-based sampling. When differences in patient versus provider collection are present they generally appear to be due to changes in relative abundances of taxa present, but not due to specific taxa that are inherently different by sampling strategy. Even with the variations in relative abundances, overall differences in alpha diversity did not differ between patient and provider collections.",

Both sampling site and sampling method have previously been shown to influence the composition of vaginal microbial communities within individuals [2, 23]. In the case of patient-collected vaginal samples it is plausible that taxa might be missed, or may be more or less abundant than expected, by not controlling the exact vaginal location where the sampling occurred. Our patients were sampled at a wide range of gestational ages, predominantly in the late second and early third trimesters. Additionally, our patient population is predominantly obese with BMI\u2009>\u200930. Thus, reaching over the gravid abdomen to sample the inner vagina may contribute to sampling bias, as they may not be able to sufficiently reach the mid-vagina. Furthermore, sequential, repeated sampling of the vagina by the patient followed by the provider could alter microbial populations. Nonetheless, our data suggest that patient collection and provider collection produce similar results for vaginal community characteristics with high correlation between sample types, no differences in detection of specific taxa by sample type, and no systematic differences in higher or lower alpha diversity measurement by sample type.",

While these findings suggest that sampling methodology does not result in systematic differences in vaginal microbiome community characteristics in pregnant women, we observed subtle differences between patient- and provider-collected swabs. These may be due to minor differences attributable to the sample collection methods or, alternatively, are due to the inherent variability between two serial biologic samplings (i.e. would have been as likely to be present with provider speculum exam as with two serial swabs obtained). Additionally, this study assesses only bacterial components of the microbiome and no conclusions can be made about the similarity of viral or fungal components of the microbiome by sampling method. Lastly, our study only evaluated sample collection methods in asymptomatic pregnant women to assess vaginal microbiome composition; however, it remains uncertain whether patient- and provider-based sampling would be equally effective for diagnostic point-of-care testing and evaluation of clinical infections in pregnant women, as has been previously demonstrated in non-pregnant women [5\u20137, 18\u201322].

The vaginal microbiome is dynamic and characterizing these fluctuations may be of biological and clinical significance [24, 25]. Use of patient-collected samples would allow closely-spaced longitudinal sampling and increase the ability to detect subtle temporal changes in the vaginal microbiome over gestation and postpartum. Patient self-collection could improve cost- and time-efficiency for both patients and providers. Overall, these data demonstrate that the vaginal bacterial communities are similar in patient- and provider-collected swabs in pregnancy. Our findings suggest that utilizing less invasive patient self-collection is an acceptable sampling method to study vaginal microbiome dynamics during pregnancy.",
