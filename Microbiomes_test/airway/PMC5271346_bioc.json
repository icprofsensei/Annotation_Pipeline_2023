Despite evidence linking bacterial infections to the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), systematic studies of airway microbiota are limited. The objective was to identify specific patterns of the early respiratory tract microbiome from tracheal aspirates of mechanically ventilated preterm infants that are associated with the development and severity of BPD. Infants with gestational age \u226434 weeks, and birth weight 500\u20131250g were prospectively enrolled. Mechanically ventilated infants had tracheal aspirate samples collected at enrollment, 7, 14, and 21 days of age. BPD was determined by modified NIH criteria with oxygen reduction tests; infants without BPD were excluded due to low numbers. Aspirates were processed for bacterial identification by 16S rRNA sequencing, and bacterial load by qPCR. Cross-sectional analysis was performed using 7 day samples and longitudinal analysis was performed from subjects with at least 2 aspirates. Microbiome analysis was performed on tracheal aspirates from 152 infants (51, 49, and 52 with mild, moderate, and severe BPD, respectively). Seventy-nine of the infants were included in the cross-sectional analysis and 94 in the longitudinal. Shannon Diversity, bacterial load, and relative abundance of individual taxa were not strongly associated with BPD status. Longitudinal analysis revealed that preterm infants who eventually developed severe BPD exhibited greater bacterial community turnover with age, acquired less Staphylococcus in the first days after birth, and had higher initial relative abundance of Ureaplasma. In conclusion, longitudinal changes in the airway microbial communities of mechanically ventilated preterm infants may be associated with BPD severity, whereas cross-sectional analysis of airway ecology at 7 days of age did not reveal an association with BPD severity. Further evaluation is necessary to determine whether the observed longitudinal changes are causal or in response to clinical management or other factors that lead to BPD.",

BPD is characterized by prolonged need for oxygen therapy, frequent pulmonary infections requiring hospitalizations, asthma, exercise intolerance, and pulmonary hypertension [1, 2]. BPD results from the adverse effects of early exposure of the lung to the extrauterine environment, as well as, the need for supportive interventions such as mechanical ventilation and high levels of oxygen delivery [3\u20135]. These stimuli can lead to inflammation of the immature lung that disrupt normal lung development [6]. Thus, further understanding of risk factors and mechanisms that promote inflammation and impair lung development after preterm birth is critical to instituting better prevention and treatment strategies.",

While antenatal and postnatal infections, hyperoxia, and mechanical ventilation have garnered much attention as inflammation provoking stimuli [9], the possible impact of airway colonization and invasion on the development of BPD is less clear with few studies examining this question [10, 11]. It has been shown that bacterial exposures even without overt infection may influence maturation of the immune system, which in turn, modulates lung development and the response to later infections. The presence of Ureaplasma in the respiratory tract of preterm infants, even without signs of infection, has been associated with a pro-inflammatory response and an increased risk for BPD [12]. Thus, postnatal exposure to colonizing bacteria, may impact the preterm infant\u2019s immune response and subsequent lung development.",

We tested this hypothesis two ways: 1) in a cross-sectional analysis of tracheal aspirate specimens collected at 7 days of age from mechanically ventilated preterm infants and 2) in a longitudinal analysis evaluating the change in the airway microbiome in mechanically ventilated preterm infants who had at least 2 tracheal aspirates collected in the first 3 weeks after birth.",

Infants with gestational age at birth less than 34 weeks and birth weight between 500 and 1250 g were screened for enrollment. Exclusion criteria included clinical evidence of congenital heart disease (except patent ductus arteriosus [PDA], patent foramen ovale [PFO] or atrial septal defect [ASD] < 1cm, or ventricular septal defect [VSD] < 2mm if known prior to enrollment); lethal congenital abnormality; and futile cases (anticipated death prior to hospital discharge). Subjects were required to be enrolled within 7 days of age. Infants who required mechanical ventilation had tracheal aspirates samples collected at enrollment, 7, 14, and 21 days of age (+/- 48 hours). Infants who were mechanically ventilated and had at least one tracheal aspirate collected were included in this study. Tracheal aspirates collected closest to 7 days of age but within 5\u20139 days were used for cross-sectional analyses, and infants with at least two tracheal aspirates collected were included in the longitudinal analysis. Infants who died, withdrew, or were transferred or discharged without undergoing BPD assessment at 36 weeks PMA were also excluded (Fig 1). Detailed clinical data including maternal and birth history, hospital course and physiological assessments were collected.

To account for differences in sequencing depth, the relative abundance (RA) of each taxon was calculated (number of sequences for specific taxa/ total number of sequences*100). Random forests (RF) consisting of 5,000 classification trees were used to multivariately evaluate microbial taxa cross-sectionally across BPD groups [39]. A random forest is an ensemble method which fits many classification trees and is often used for high dimensional data. Multidimensional Scaling using the proximity matrix from the RF was used to visualize the separation between BPD groups based on the microbial communities. Communities across collection times within a subject were compared using Shannon Beta, a measure of beta diversity [40].

In addition to the single Beta diversity measure, MH, a pair-wise beta diversity measure, was calculated between pairs of samples within each subject. The mean (SE after adjusting for repeated measures) for MH values (lower values indicate increased microbial turnover) across the three severity groups were 0.69 (0.58) for mild, 0.53 (0.41) for moderate and 0.48 (0.39) for severe. MH values were significantly lower in severe BPD compared to mild (p = 0.01) and were only marginally different between mild and moderate (p = 0.08; Fig 6). S3 Fig displays the MH values by the interval days between specimen collection and indicates a trend towards greater community turnover in the moderate and severe BPD groups (p = 0.04 across all 3 groups; p = 0.05 mild vs. severe BPD).

For Staphylococcus, the mean RA value at 14 days was higher among infants who went on to develop mild BPD compared to those who went on to develop severe BPD (p = 0.04). Fig 7 reveals that there are differences in the trends of RA over time between BPD severity groups. These data demonstrate that the RA of Staphylococcus in the lower airways increases at a greater rate after birth and reaches a higher absolute RA for infants who develop less severe BPD, although these trends were not statistically significant (Fig 7, top). Infants with higher RA Ureaplasma soon after birth were more likely to develop severe BPD, although this trend was also not statistically significant (Fig 7, bottom). For both organisms, there was more variability in the severe and moderate BPD groups compared to the mild group, which is consistent with the results from the beta diversity measures that similarly indicated an association between community changes and BPD severity. As a sensitivity analysis, the models were refit including time on ventilator and use of corticosteroids as covariates, the results remained unchanged (S1 Supplementary Information). The individual level data is not well represented by the average trend, providing support for the need of the more complex models in which individual subjects are allowed to deviate from the average.",

In a cross-sectional evaluation at 7 days of age there was no evidence that bacterial communities were associated with later BPD severity. Bacterial load and Shannon diversity of airway communities did not reveal a striking pattern that was strongly linked to BPD severity either on its own or in conjunction with clinical factors. Investigation of airway microbial communities over time by several measures indicated that there may be temporal trends that are associated with BPD severity. Although, a particular organism may not necessarily be associated with BPD severity, shifts in the community of airway organisms were observed more often in preterm infants who eventually developed severe BPD. Specifically, infants who developed more severe BPD exhibited greater bacterial community turnover with increasing time from birth, acquired less Staphylococcus in the first days after birth, and had higher initial RA of Ureaplasma.",

A predictive biomarker in this population is of enormous benefit for families eager for prognostic information, and would help guide early preventive and novel treatment strategies. Identification of microbiome patterns that are associated with outcome will also lead to clinical trials evaluating interventions (e.g. probiotics, judicious use of antibiotics, routes and content of nutritional support) that promote beneficial bacterial colonization and prevent acquisition of pathogenic bacteria, ultimately preventing or mitigating chronic lung disease of prematurity.",

Our previous study in this area was an observation of only 10 infants, all of whom were included in the present study [10], and the study by Lohman et al. was performed in 25 infants [11]. This study represents a much larger cohort of 152 preterm infants from multiple hospitals, which increases the generalizability of the findings. The previous studies, along with the present one reveal that the airways of preterm infants may not be sterile at birth and quickly acquire bacteria communities that are often dominated by a single organism. Bacteria in the airways of these infants may be acquired from the mother or through exposure to the local environment in the NICU. Unfortunately, this study was not designed to evaluate the differential impact of these routes of acquisition as most infants had their first samples collected several days after birth. The study by Lohmann et. al. found that Acinetobacter was the frequent dominant organism in their institution [11], while our study performed at multiple hospitals affiliated with two academic centers were dominated by Staphylococcus and Ureaplasma. These differences suggest that the bacteria that populate the airways of infants may be associated with the bacterial communities in the hospital units themselves and warrants further investigation. Yet the range of different bacteria that colonize the airways of mechanically ventilated infants suggest that simple detection of specific bacteria will not be a reliable biomarker for BPD and the evaluation of entire microbial community is likely needed.",

The finding that infants with more severe BPD tend to have higher RA of Ureaplasma early in their course perpetuates the possibility of its contribution to BPD [42]. Chronic intrauterine Ureaplasma exposure appears to downregulate the host response to acute LPS exposure in the preterm sheep model [47]. Yet, the presence of Ureaplasma may be a function of prematurity as Kemp et al found that host bactericidal activity was directly correlated to gestational age, and the bactericidal activity appeared related to functional complement activity [48].",

Certainly, the treatment variation among preterm infants, especially related to antibiotic administration could lead to these findings. It is possible that the increased turnover in the infants who went on to develop more severe BPD were more often treated with antibiotics because their clinical course was more severe and there were more frequent episodes of suspected infection. Future studies will have to evaluate the impact of antibiotic administration on the respiratory tract microbiome and the potential association with the development and severity of BPD.",

Specific patterns in the acquisition and composition of the microbiome are associated with inflammation and altered epithelial barrier function in the intestinal tract of adults and premature infants [49\u201351]. Inflammation has been a key driver in the pathophysiology of BPD and thought to result from a variety of etiologies, including pre- and postnatal infection, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen toxicity. However, as the immune system of preterm infants is still maturing, simple colonization with bacteria may be enough to drive an inflammatory response that disrupts lung development and lead to BPD. Thus, further studies should thoroughly evaluate the interaction between the airway microbiome, the host immune response, and clinical treatment including the use of antibiotics to impact lung development in preterm infants.",

First, because analysis of the airway microbiome requires access to the lower airway with an endotracheal tube, we were not able to assess the airway microbiome in infants who did not require mechanical ventilation. As such, we did not have sufficient numbers of infants who were mechanically ventilated that did not go on to develop BPD. The lack of a control group did not allow us to determine whether the airway microbiome could differentiate between those with and without BPD. Additionally, since fewer preterm infants are ventilated after birth due to advances in the use of non-invasive ventilation techniques and less invasive surfactant administration, the results of this study should be confined only to infants who require invasive mechanical ventilation support. Furthermore, we did not have data on antibiotic administration in this cohort and therefore were not able to evaluate its potential impact on the airway microbiome. Finally, these data were generated from a secondary analysis of a study cohort that was not specifically designed to address these questions. Therefore, these results should be interpreted as hypothesis generating, and prospective studies designed to assess the relative roles of the entire microbiome (bacteria, viruses, and fungi) are warranted.",

Hiergeist et. al. brought attention to this issue by demonstrating the variability of bacterial community detection among 9 different centers employing varying DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing techniques to the same specimens [52]. While they did find that repeatedly performing the analysis with the same technique within centers produced reliable results, they did expectedly find that variation in technique across centers resulted in substantial differences in bacterial detection. Most of the variation seemed to be explained by differences in covered hypervariable (V-) regions and primers selected for 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Thus, careful attention to the methods utilized for molecular detection of bacteria is necessary when attempting to reproduce results from laboratory to laboratory. In this study, we employed a standard sample collection protocol across sites, and sample processing, sequencing and bioinformatics was performed at a single lab utilizing consistent and well vetted approaches. In addition, applying the same techniques to cross-sectional and longitudinal specimens as was performed in this study is sufficient to determine whether there are differences in bacterial composition across specimens collected from different subjects at the same time point as well as differences within individual subjects over time. However, determining the precise effect size of these differences is more difficult due to variation in technique.",
