Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 120 Chilean infants from Santiago with acute lower respiratory tract infections were analysed by viral metagenomics, revealing the presence of nucleic acids from anelloviruses, adenovirus-associated virus and 12 known respiratory viral pathogens. A single sequence read showed translated protein similarity to cycloviruses. We used inverse PCR to amplify the complete circular ssDNA genome of a novel cyclovirus we named CyCV-ChileNPA1. Closely related variants were detected using PCR in the NPAs of three other affected children that also contained anelloviruses. This report increases the current knowledge of the genetic diversity of cycloviruses whose detection in multiple NPAs may reflect a tropism for human respiratory tissues.",

Genetically highly diverse cycloviruses were initially found in the faeces of Pakistani children with and without acute flaccid paralysis (Victoria et al., 2009), in wild chimpanzees (Li et al., 2010) and in tissues of farm animals including cows, goats, bats and chickens (Ge et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010, 2011). Unexpectedly, other cyclovirus species have also been detected in insects, namely dragonflies and cockroaches (Dayaram et al., 2013; Padilla-Rodriguez et al., 2013; Rosario et al., 2011). In 2013, a cyclovirus species (CyCV-CN) was found initially using viral metagenomics and then by PCR in 4\u200a% of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from Vietnamese children with unexplained central nervous system disorder, but not in CSF from patients with non-neurological problems, as well as in 4.2\u200a% of faeces from healthy Vietnamese children (Tan et al., 2013). CyCV-CN DNA was also detected in a throat swab (Tan et al., 2013). In this study, 58\u200a% of faecal specimens from pigs and poultry in Vietnam were also positive for the same cyclovirus, suggesting possible sources of human infection (Tan et al., 2013). A related cyclovirus was also detected in 10\u200a% of CSF samples and 15\u200a% of serum samples from adult patients with paraplegia (leg paralysis) from Malawi (Smits et al., 2013).",

From 1998 to 2000, a mean of 29\u200a% of acute lower respiratory infections samples were positive for RSV (Avenda\u00f1o et al., 2003). To initiate the characterization of the viruses in non-reactive NPA samples, viral particles were enriched by filtration, and unprotected DNA and RNA were digested using a combination of nuclease enzymes (Victoria et al., 2009). The remaining nucleic acids were then extracted using a MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation kit (Life Technologies), which recovers both RNA and DNA. A DNA library was constructed using a ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation kit (Epicentre), which amplifies both RNA and DNA, and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Viral sequences were identified using translated protein sequence similarity searches to annotated viral proteins available in GenBank (using blastx) and results were mapped using the NCBI Virus Taxonomy browser (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?name=Viruses). The study was approved by the University of California at San Francisco committee on human research.",

Viral sequence reads were identified with amino acid similarity >95\u200a% to known viruses. Most numerous sequences were from anelloviruses, followed by enterovirus C, betacoronavirus, bocavirus 1, RSV, human adenovirus 3, enterovirus B, human rhinoviruses A and C, human parainfluenza 3, adeno-associated virus, human pneumovirus, human rhinovirus B and human parechovirus sequences (Table 1). Anelloviruses were identified in all but one pool (Table 1). Anelloviruses have been reported previously in human respiratory secretions (Buri\u00e1n et al., 2011; Jartti et al., 2012). Anelloviruses are usually considered commensal viruses (Okamoto, 2009a), although increased prevalence was found in bronchoalveolar lavage of children with acute exacerbation idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Wootton et al., 2011) and acute respiratory diseases (Maggi et al., 2003), and in lung tissues of pigs infected with known respiratory pathogens (Rammohan et al., 2012). Anellovirus plasma load is also ncreased in advanced AIDS (Li et al., 2013) and in immunosuppressed patients following organ transplantation (De Vlaminck et al., 2013). Increased anellovirus loads may reflect increased replication in immune cells stimulated by chronic inflammation, rather than indicating a direct pathogenic role (De Vlaminck et al., 2013). Detection of RSV, parainfluenza 3 and adenovirus in four, two and one pools, respectively, was probably the result of viral loads being too low for detection by immunofluorescence assays and cell culture (Avenda\u00f1o et al., 2003). Except for anelloviruses and adeno-associated virus, all other viruses found have been associated with respiratory symptoms.",

Primers ChileNPA-F1 (5\u2032-TGGGTCAGGCTATTACTGGGAG-3\u2032) and ChileNPA-R1 (5\u2032-ACTGAATGTCCGTCCGTTGTCC-3\u2032) were used for the first round of PCR, and primers ChileNPA-F2 (5\u2032-CAGTGCCATAGTACAGAGTGCCCA-3\u2032) and ChileNPA-R2 (5\u2032-CTCCCCTACTCAAAGAACTCGCCT-3\u2032) for the second round of PCR, resulting in an expected amplicon of ~310 bp. The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 53 or 55 \u00b0C (for the first or second round, respectively) for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min, and then held at 4 \u00b0C. Amplicons were then sequenced directly for identification. Three additional cases (CyCV-ChileNPA2\u20134) were positive for the new cyclovirus, yielding a prevalence of 3.3\u200a% in the studied population (4/120). The full genomes of these three viruses were then acquired by overlapping PCR. The genomic sequences of CyCV-ChileNPA2\u20134 shared a high nucleotide identity of >99\u200a%, showing two, five and six nucleotide mutations compared with the CyCV-ChileNPA1 genome, respectively. All of these point mutations were synonymous except R25S and K93E in the ORF of CyCV-ChileNPA4 Rep.",

A total of 2697 unique sequence reads were generated. Three unique CyCV-ChileNPA1 reads were generated from the NPA sample in which it was originally detected. No other viral sequences were detected. A total of 6362 unique reads were also generated from the other three samples positive only by PCR for the cyclovirus. All three samples contained anellovirus sequences (a total of 456 reads) and no other close matches to mammalian viruses. Anelloviruses are highly prevalent viruses present in many anatomical sites of different mammals (Okamoto, 2009b) and are generally considered commensal infections. Anelloviruses have also been found in a significant minority of cases of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and in cases of acute lung injury (Wootton et al., 2011), are at higher prevalence in plasma and nasopharyngeal samples of febrile versus non-febrile cases (McElvania TeKippe et al., 2012) and are generally increased in the plasma of immunosuppressed individuals such as advanced AIDS patients (Li et al., 2013) or transplant recipients (De Vlaminck et al., 2013). A porcine anellovirus (torque teno sus virus species 1) has also been associated with porcine respiratory disease complex where it might exacerbate infections caused by porcine circovirus 2 and the arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory disease symptom virus (Rammohan et al., 2012).",

The detection of cyclovirus DNA in NPAs (upper respiratory tract) of children with lower tract respiratory problems raises the possibility of a role for these viruses in respiratory illnesses. Further investigations of the host and tissue tropism, the transmission route(s) and any physiological consequences of human cyclovirus infections and possible interactions with anelloviruses are required.",
