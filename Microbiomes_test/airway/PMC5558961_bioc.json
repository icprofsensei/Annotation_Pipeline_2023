Nevertheless, none of the existing hypotheses have presented mechanistic interpretations on how and why dysbiosis actually occurs. Hubbell\u2019s neutral theory of biodiversity offers a powerful null model to test hypothesis regarding the mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance from the metagenomic sequencing data, which can help to understand the forces that shape the community dynamics such as dysbiosis. Here we reanalyze the dataset from Abusleme et al.\u2019s comparative study of the oral microbial communities from periodontitis patients and healthy individuals. Our study demonstrates that 14 out of 61 communities (23%) passed the neutrality test, a percentage significantly higher than the previous reported neutrality rate of 1% in human microbiome (Li & Ma 2016, Scientific Reports). This suggests that, while the niche selection may play a predominant role in the assembly and diversity maintenance in oral microbiome, the effect of neutral dynamics may not be ignored. However, no statistically significant differences in the neutrality passing rates were detected between the periodontitis and healthy treatments with Fisher\u2019s exact probability test and multiple testing corrections, suggesting that the mechanism of community assembly is robust against disturbances such as periodontitis. In addition, our study confirmed previous finding that periodontitis patients exhibited higher biodiversity. These findings suggest that while periodontitis may significantly change the community composition measured by diversity (i.e., the exhibition or \u2018phenotype\u2019 of community assembly), it does not seem to cause the \u2018mutation\u2019 of the \u2018genotype\u201d (mechanism) of community assembly. We argue that the \u2018phenotypic\u2019 changes explain the observed link (not necessarily causal) between periodontitis and community dysbiosis, which is certainly worthy of further investigation.",

At least 6 billions bacteria representing 700 species have been detected in human oral cavity [1]. Several oral infectious diseases such as caries, periodontitis, and endodontic infections are associated with oral microbiome. Besides the pathogens, the oral cavity hosts far more symbiotic bacteria that play a fundamental role in maintaining the oral health. From an ecological perspective, oral microbes exist in the form of microbial community, and oral cavity is an ecosystem. The stability and dynamics of this ecosystem have far reaching influences on our oral health and diseases. Obviously the oral microbial community is subjected to frequent daily physical and biochemical disturbances, but it can maintain its long-term stability in healthy individuals [2].",

It is characterized by accumulation of bacterial deposits at the gingival margin forming an inflammatory infiltrate, which can lead to the destruction of connective tissue attachment to the tooth, alveolar bone resorption and tooth loss. Significant differences in the oral microbial community composition between periodontitis patients and healthy individuals have been reported [3\u20136]. Previous studies have revealed that either certain pathogenic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia, or the dysbiosis of the normal oral microbial community could play a key role in the etiology of periodontitis [7]. Besides traditional diagnostic criteria such as assessing the attachment of the periodontal tissue to the tooth root and radiographic evidence of bone loss, the presence of bleeding on probing (BoP) is also a main clinical indicator of periodontal inflammation and it indicates the risk for periodontitis progression and high level of proinflammatory mediators and destruction markers in gingival exudates [8]. The BoP is likely caused by the formation of plaque at the gingiva due to multiple reasons, such as poor oral hygiene condition and improper tooth brushing.",

The Next Generation DNA Sequencing (NGS) technology has leaded to the development and wide adoption of the metagenomics technology, which is culture-independent for investigating the oral microbiome. For example, a pioneering application of the metagenomics technology to the oral micorbiome by Kroes et al. detected 59 different species through amplification of 16s-rDNA from a sample of subgingival plaque, which literally doubled the number of species previously found through cultivation (28 species) [9\u201310]. Another study conducted by Paster et al. analyzed 2522 clones from subgingival plaque samples from healthy individuals and patients with refractory periodontitis, adult periodontitis, HIV-infected periodontitis, and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and detected a number of species only in patients with disease [11]. Aiming to define the normal microbial community of oral cavity, Aas et al. sequenced samples from 9 sites of 5 clinically healthy subjects and observed 141 predominant bacterial species inhabiting in these sites, of which over 60% have not been cultivated [11]. Abusleme et al. utilized 454-pyrosequencing technology to characterize the subgingival microbial community of 22 patients with chronic periodontitis and compared them with those of healthy individuals, and they observed that several genera exhibited higher proportions in patients with periodontitis, several others exhibited higher proportions in healthy individuals while some exhibited little differences between the health and periodontitis [8]. Their results also indicated that the total bacterial load, species richness and community evenness increased in periodontitis samples [8]. Hong et al. studied untreated and root-filled samples with 454-pyrosequencing and found persistent infections displayed similarly diverse bacterial community to the primary infections [12]. Li et al. also used 454-pyrosequencing to study the oral microbial community of Chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis [13]; their study suggested that there exists kinship in the phylogenetic architecture of microbial community among patients and their family members. Zhang et al. reported that a new virus (TTMV-222) may be associated with inflammation in chronic periodontitis patients using viral metagenomics [14].",

Hubbell\u2019s neutral theory of biodiversity [19] challenged the classic niche theory. It assumes that all individuals within a particular trophic level in a community have the same chances of survival and reproduction independent of their species identity [19], while niche theory assumes that different species occupy different niches, and therefore niche differentiations are necessary for species to coexist. Another important assumption of the neutral theory is that the local community is shaped mainly through stochastic immigration from metacommunity, and the relative abundance of each species in a local community should be similar to its abundance in the metacommunity [20]. Neutral theory that quantifies the neutrality, stochasticity, sampling and dispersal presents a null model for testing the mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance against species abundance distribution data obtained from practical investigations such as metagenomic sequencing experiments [20\u201321], as demonstrated in this study.",

In spite of these advantages, the theory is still relatively less known in microbial ecology, especially in the study of human microbiome [20].",

Although a handful of bacteria including P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia have traditionally been considered as causative agents of periodontitis, the recent advances from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies have prompted researchers to support an ecological theory based hypothesis. In this hypothesis, periodontitis results from polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis disturbing the ecologically balanced biofilm associated with periodontal tissue homeostasis [22]. However, this prevalent hypothesis does not explain how and why dysbiosis may occur in the oral microbiome. As mentioned previously, in this article, through testing the null model of Hubbell\u2019s neutral theory, we aim to comparatively analyze the assembly and diversity maintenance mechanisms in the oral microbiome influenced by periodontitis. We hope our analysis will help to understand the forces such as periodontitis that shape the community dynamics, including dysbiosis.",

Subjects with periodontitis were sampled at two non-adjacent tooth sites that differ in the presence of BoP (Bleeding on Probing). Healthy individuals were sampled at two subgingival plaque sites without BoP. DNA was extracted and amplified for the V1-V2 hyper-variable regions of 16S rRNA gene and then sequenced using 454 titanium chemistry. Forty-four samples from the individuals with periodontitis and 17 samples from the healthy individuals were sequenced successfully.

The major computational steps can be outlined as the following four steps: (i) For each community sample, 100 artificial communities (datasets) are simulated using the parameters (\u03b8, I, J) estimated with the observed samples. (ii) Etienne formula is used to calculate the likelihood for each artificial dataset, namely Ps. (iii) The mean value of the likelihoods (Ps) of 100 artificial datasets for each sample and the likelihood (P0) of the corresponding observed sample are compared using the log-likelihood ratio test, under the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between P0 and Ps. (iv) If the p-value from the log-likelihood ratio test exceeds 0.05, we conclude that the neutrality of the community under testing cannot be rejected, and that the observed species abundance distribution (SAD) is consistent with the prediction from the neutral theory, i.e., passing the neutrality test. In addition, as mentioned previously, the log-likelihood ratio test was performed with both Ewens and Etienne formulae, respectively to compare their performance.",

In the periodontitis BoP treatment, 22.73% (5/22) of the samples satisfied the neutral prediction, in the periodontitis non-BoP treatment, 27.27% (6/22) of the samples passed the neutrality exact test, and in the healthy (control) treatment, 17.65% (3/17) of the samples passed the test. Although the passing rates in the periodontitis treatments (BoP and non-BoP) are apparently higher than in the healthy treatment, rigorous testing with Fisher\u2019s exact probability test suggested that there are not any significant differences among the three treatments. The p-value of Fisher\u2019s exact test for the difference between the healthy and periodontitis BoP treatments is p = 1, that for the difference between the healthy and periodontitis Non-BoP treatments is p = 0.704, and p = 1 between periodontitis BoP and periodontitis Non-BoP treatments. This result suggests that periodontitis does not seem to significantly affect the assembly mechanism of oral microbial communities, and the observed differences in passing rates of the neutrality test should be due to random effects. In other words, whether or not the assembly of a community is driven by the stochastic neutral dynamics or deterministic niche forces is independent of the occurrence of periodontitis. This also means that the nature or type of the community assembly mechanism in the oral microbiome is not significantly impacted by periodontitis disease. Fig 1 shows the curves of 4 samples out of 61 samples that satisfy the prediction of the neutral theory model with Etienne neutrality exact test.",

(i) While deterministic niche forces are predominant in driving the oral community assembly, the role of stochastic neutral dynamics cannot be ignored (in our case, approximately 23% (14 out of 61) of community samples satisfied with the neutral theory). (ii) Periodontitis does not seem to alter the assembly mechanism of oral microbial communities. (iii) However, periodontitis may indeed change community composition or diversity of the oral microbiome. Dramatic changes in community compositions (diversity) may lead to dysbiosis, which may be linked to periodontitis.",

                    "text": "In early days, oral diseases were attributed to a handful of specific pathogens in the oral microbial community. The idea was referred to as \u201cspecific plaque hypothesis\u201d proposed by Loesche [30]. Later, the updated \u201cnon-specific plaque hypothesis\u201d was proposed, and the updated hypothesis stated that all bacteria in a plaque contribute to the pathogenicity of the microbial community via colonization, evasion or provocation of inflammation and tissue destruction [31]. In fact, the general idea had already been proposed in the \u201ctraditional non-specific plaque hypothesis\u201d as early as in the 19th century [32]. Since people at that time could not identify specific pathogens, so they treated oral diseases by removing the whole plaque. The updated idea was more like an ecological idea, which took into account the virulence of different species in the microbial community. In 1994, \u201cecological plaque hypothesis\u201d was proposed [33]. This theory integrating the core idea of early hypotheses stated that diseases are caused by the imbalance of the whole microbial community, which is essentially the concept of dysbiosis in more recent literatures. The imbalance may result from ecological stress (disturbances) and can lead to the occurrence of disease-related microorganisms. The latest hypothesis \u201ckeystone pathogen hypothesis\u201d [7] suggested that some low-abundance pathogens may have the ability to tip the balance between normally benign (healthy) microbiota and dysbiotic one and cause diseases ultimately. The hypothesis apparently took inspirations from macro-ecology. The effect of these keystone species is similar to the top predators (such as tigers) in an ecosystem, who usually has a discretionally large effect on the ecosystem but with a tiny relative abundance. The keystone species therefore may play a critical role in maintaining the community structure. The keystone pathogen theory appears to offer a plausible explanation to the significant difference in the composition of microbial community between patients with diseases and healthy individuals. Nevertheless, there is a problem with this hypothesis. In macro-ecology, keystone species can be any species at any trophic level. Similarly, there may be many keystone species, not necessarily pathogens, in a microbial community that may have significantly large influence incommensurable with their relative abundances. Indeed, keystone species may be the natural enemies of pathogens such as bacteriophages.",

This is because the acceptance or rejection of the previously mentioned hypotheses on the oral diseases ultimately depends on the deep understanding of the oral microbial communities, not only their structures, but also their stabilities and dynamics. The latter should be more important. Unfortunately, direct studies of community dynamics are far more difficult than investigating the community structure. This is especially true in biomedical research of the human microbiome because manipulative observations are limited by ethical considerations. It is for this reason that most existing studies of the human microbiome are still focused on the study of community structure (composition) through sequencing the community samples, which is neither intrusive and nor unethical. Neutral theory we adopted in this study offers an ideal ecological tool to decipher the mechanistic information about the formation of community structure (i.e., more formally the mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance) from the OTU tables [i.e., more formally the species abundance distribution (SAD) data]. The test of neutral theory null model is essentially a fit of a special SAD model, a zero-sum multinomial distribution model, which can be derived from the basic assumptions of the neutral theory.",
