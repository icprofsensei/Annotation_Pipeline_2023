Gradual pulmonary function decline is interspersed with periods of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms known as CF pulmonary exacerbations (CFPEs). Cumulatively, CFPEs are associated with more rapid disease progression. In this study multiple sputum samples were collected from adult CF patients over the course of CFPEs to better understand how changes in microbiota are associated with CFPE onset and management. Data were divided into five clinical periods: pre-CFPE baseline, CFPE, antibiotic treatment, recovery, and post-CFPE baseline. Samples were treated with propidium monoazide prior to DNA extraction, to remove the impact of bacterial cell death artefacts following antibiotic treatment, and then characterised by 16S rRNA gene-targeted high-throughput sequencing. Partitioning CF microbiota into core and rare groups revealed compositional resistance to CFPE and resilience to antibiotics interventions. Mixed effects modelling of core microbiota members revealed no significant negative impact on the relative abundance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa across the exacerbation cycle. Our findings have implications for current CFPE management strategies, supporting reassessment of existing antimicrobial treatment regimens, as antimicrobial resistance by pathogens and other members of the microbiota may be significant contributing factors.",

Although this disorder is multisystemic, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in an overwhelming majority (ca. 90%) of patients is chronic lung infections and concomitant airway inflammation (Foweraker, 2009). Until a treatment for the disorder can be found, for example, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene therapy or therapies that improve cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator function, the best way to continue to raise life expectancy is to improve treatment of the chronic polymicrobial lung infections (LiPuma, 2014).

This gradual decline in pulmonary function is interspersed with periods of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms known as CF pulmonary exacerbations (CFPEs) (Sibley et al., 2008). Cumulatively, these periods of CFPE are associated with more rapid disease progression and reduced survival as well as a recognised reduction in quality of life and an increase in overall healthcare costs (VanDevanter et al., 2013). There is currently no consensus for a generally applicable definition to describe when patients are experiencing a CFPE. This is mainly due to a lack of consistency in the symptoms experienced by CF patients of different ages and disease state, thus making it challenging for paediatric and adult physicians to come to an agreement (Smyth and Elborn, 2008). Despite this, clinical features can include decreased exercise tolerance, increased cough and sputum production, shortness of breath, chest pain, absence from school or work, increased adventitial sounds on lung examination, decreased appetite or weight loss, and a decline in lung function (Fuchs et al., 1994). Although lung function is still widely relied upon as an indicator of worsening symptoms, it has been revealed that short-term changes in lung function show little effect on the sensitivity or specificity of CFPE diagnosis (Rosenfeld et al., 2001).",

Set within this BETR classification, studies have provided useful insights including a clear demonstration that CFPE do not result from increased total bacterial density or density of a specific recognised CF pathogen, such as P. aeruginosa (Stressmann et al., 2011; Fodor et al., 2012; Carmody et al., 2013; Price et al., 2013). Conversely, how changes in microbiota composition and structure are associated with CFPE and intervention remain less clear; as different studies have shown either significant change or no change in CF bacterial communities, and in specific constituent species (Fodor et al., 2012; Stressmann et al., 2012; Daniels et al., 2013; Price et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014). These contradictory findings may be attributed to differing experimental designs, patient cohorts, and sampling strategies. For example, studies have typically relied on single-point samples to be representative of a given disease state (e.g. baseline or exacerbation) which will not account for variance in either microbiota or clinical factors, such as lung function (commonly, FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009s), in a given clinical period (Carmody et al., 2013; Price et al., 2013; Zemanick et al., 2013). Studies have also been based in the main on point samples from subsets and different combinations of the clinical periods defined above (Fodor et al., 2012; Carmody et al., 2013; Price et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014), making them difficult to compare, and as such the complete cycle of clinical periods from pre- to post-CFPE baseline, that is BETRB, has not been studied. However, in both instances this may be a reflection of the difficulty in obtaining respiratory samples and metadata over this type of longitudinal period.",

Sputum samples were collected from 12 adult CF patients attending the Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK (Table 1). All sputum samples were stored at 4oC immediately after expectoration and transferred to \u221280\u2009\u00b0C storage within 12\u2009h of expectoration. This timeframe was selected as recent evidence suggests that failure to stabilise samples at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C within 12\u2009h significantly impacts sequence-based microbiota profiling. (Cuthbertson et al., 2014). Subjects were selected due to their persistent production of sputum and history of CFPE. All patients were clinically defined as chronically colonised with P. aeruginosa. Samples were collected from patients during periods of baseline, defined as periods where patients were only receiving maintenance doses of antibiotics. During the study period 10 of the 12 patients were treated for a CFPE. The start and end of CFPE were identified by treating clinicians, and were defined for the purpose of this study as the period of time where patients received clinical intervention in the form of antibiotic treatment. The antibiotics administered to each patient are all broad spectrum in activity and are expected to have an impact on the predominant pathogen, P. aeruginosa (Table 1). Decisions to initiate treatment were based on worsening clinical symptoms (Fuchs et al., 1994). Stabilisation or improvement of these symptoms led to the termination of this treatment. Retrospectively samples were partitioned into five periods: (B0) baseline pre-CFPE; (E) CFPE, within 30 days prior to antibiotic treatment; (T) period of time patients were receiving treatment for pulmonary exacerbation; (R) recovery, within 30 days post-treatment for CFPE; and (B1) baseline post-CFPE. Clinically relevant symptoms were monitored throughout the sampling period. Lung function (FEV1) was assessed using a Koko PeakPro home spirometer (Ferraris Cardiorespiratory, Louisville, CO, USA) at the time of each sample collection. Patients were also required to assess respiratory symptoms: cough, breathlessness, sputum production, and general wellbeing, using a visual analogue scale scored 0\u2013100, with 0 being the worst and 100 the best.",

Based on a significant positive distribution\u2013abundance relationship, the persistent and abundant core species were defined as those in more than 75% of all samples, while all other species falling outside of the upper quartile were considered to be rare (Hedin et al., 2015). Species turnover between consecutive samples was measured using the method described by Brown and Kodric-Brown (1977). Turnover was defined as t=b+c/S1+S2. Where b=the number of species present only in the first sample; c=the number of species present only in the second sample; S1=the total number of species in the first sample; and S2 the total number of species in the second sample (Brown and Kodric-Brown, 1977). Species richness (S*) was used as previously described (Rogers et al., 2013). In brief, S* was calculated with a uniform re-sample size (to match the smallest sequence size in each group) following 1000 iterations in each instance and performed in R version 3.1.1 (Oksanen et al., 2013; The R Development Core Team, 2013). Two sample t-tests, regression analysis, coefficients of determination (r2), residuals and significance (P) were calculated using Minitab software (version 16; Minitab, University Park, PA, UK). Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and similarity of percentages analysis (SIMPER) were performed using the PAST (Paleontological Statistics, version 3.01) program available from the University of Oslo (http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past).

For each species, the change in abundance across all patients was measured using the disease period as the fixed effect and variation between patients was accounted for by including patient as a random effect.

A coherent metacommunity could be expected to exhibit a direct relationship between prevalence and proportional abundance of individual species within the constituent communities. Consistent with this prediction, the abundance of OTUs, across all samples and within specific disease periods (Figure 1), was significantly correlated with the number of individual respiratory sample communities that those OTUs occupied. On that basis, OTUs present in more than 75% of all samples, and hence highly abundant, were classified as core (Hedin et al., 2015). These were derived from five common taxa, P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae group, Streptococcus sanguinis group, Prevotella melaninogenica/veroralis/histicola (abbreviated hereafter as P. melaninogenica), and Veillonella parvula/rogosae (abbreviated as P. parvula), and accounted for over 84% of the total sequence abundance.

The rate of OTU turnover showed more variation in the periods surrounding and during treatment for CFPE. Whereas pre- and post-baseline periods had relatively consistent OTU turnover rates, particularly evident for patients 3 and 7 who did not experience a CFPE over the course of the study (Figure 2). The rate of turnover in the rare microbiota group was greater and more variable than that observed for the core microbiota group, suggesting that the more diverse rare microbiota was driving the observed changes in the whole microbiota. Species richness (S*) within the whole microbiota increased significantly from baseline (B0) within the CFPE and treatment periods, returning to B0 levels in the subsequent recovery and post-CFPE baseline (B1) periods. Again, these patterns of diversity were driven by changes within the rare microbiota (Figure 3). Diversity within the core microbiota significantly decreased within the treatment period, with Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula moving into the rare group for that period (Figures 1 and \u200band33).",

No significant change was observed between disease periods within the whole microbiota. Conversely, significant differences within the core microbiota were observed between pre-CFPE baseline and treatment periods (Table 2). Additionally, significant differences within the rare microbiota were observed between pre-CFPE baseline and the treatment and recovery periods. No significant compositional differences were observed between pre- and post-CFPE baseline periods for both the core and rare OTU groups (Table 2). The switching of the two core OTUs, P. melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula, to the rare group in the treatment period will have likely contributed to the significant differences for the core and rare microbiota between pre-CFPE baseline and treatment periods but not for the whole microbiota, where group membership is not accounted for. SIMPER analysis was employed to assess the contribution of individual OTUs to differences in similarity within the whole microbiota, core, and rare OTU groups between disease periods (Supplementary Tables S4\u2013S6). P. aeruginosa, followed by S. pneumoniae group, contributed most to dissimilarity in the whole microbiota and core OTU group between all disease periods (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Within the rare OTU group, Porphyromonas catoniae was observed to provide the greatest contribution to dissimilarity between all disease periods, with the exception of the comparison between the CFPE treatment and recovery periods, where V. parvula provided the largest contribution.",

Mixed effects models were used to further investigate how individual core OTUs changed between disease periods (Figure 4). P. catoniae, the most abundant of the rare OTU group, was also included in this analysis. These models allowed for the inclusion of both fixed (disease period) and random effects (patient), and therefore variation between patients was accounted for in each model. For P. aeruginosa, no significant change in relative abundance from pre-CFPE baseline (B0) was observed in the CFPE and treatment periods. However, a significant increase in proportional abundance was observed within the recovery period returning to B0 abundance levels in the post-CFPE baseline period (B1). No significant changes in relative abundance from B0 were observed for the S. pneumoniae group OTU in any of the disease periods. S. sanguinis group and P. catoniae both had significantly reduced abundance within the treatment period, with the former OTU also significantly lower in the recovery period. P. melaninogenica proportional abundance significantly reduced from baseline (B0) over the CFPE, treatment, and recovery periods before returning to pre-CFPE baseline (B0) levels in period B1. Conversely, the proportional abundance of V. parvula significantly increased over the same periods (Figure 4).",

However, in order to better understand the progressive nature of chronic lung infection in CF, it is important to investigate how the bacterial communities change through time in relation to disease state and progression. A small number of studies have attempted to understand bacterial community dynamics within the CF lung (Stressmann et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012; Carmody et al., 2013; Price et al., 2013). A common limitation, as stated by Carmody and colleagues (2013) for their own study, has been narrow frequency of sampling, which would not allow fluctuations in airway microbiota to be accounted for, within or between clinical periods. Indeed this within clinical period fluctuation was particularly highlighted in the current study, where species turnover was more variable in the CFPE, treatment, and recovery periods (Figure 2). By collecting samples and associated metadata at more frequent intervals the current study was able to not only account for variation within the microbiota over time but also investigate how this related to changes in disease state through the full cycle of an exacerbation event.",

Previously, Price et al. (2013) and Stressmann et al. (2011) reported no significant change in community composition through CFPE and treatment. Congruent with those studies we found that the whole microbiota did not significantly change in composition across the five clinical periods studied, indicating resistance to perturbations within the lung (Table 2). However, partitioning the whole chronic lung infection microbiota revealed there was resilience to intervention with antibiotics within both the core and rare OTU groups (Table 2), a pattern also reflected within the diversity based analysis (Figure 3).",

It was therefore surprising that its proportional abundance remained high across all clinical periods, even exhibiting a significant increase in abundance in the recovery period (Figure 4). While the relative abundance from high-throughput sequencing data of a given species may not be considered strictly quantitative, Price et al. (2013) demonstrated a highly significant correlation between the results of P. aeruginosa-targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sequencing data. One possible explanation for the increase in P. aeruginosa proportional abundances observed after the conclusion of treatment is that antibiotic therapy led to a reduction in the abundance of other species, thereby allowing P. aeruginosa to take advantage of newly available physical niche space. Even so, the proportional abundance of P. aeruginosa returned to baseline after the 30-day post-treatment recovery period, which may be due to the resilience of the members of the rare species group.",

As stated by Rosenfeld et al. (2001) and confirmed from the FEV1 data (Supplementary Figure S1), changes in lung function demonstrates little sensitivity or specificity of CFPE diagnosis. Molecular diagnostic tests are being increasingly employed in diagnosis of infectious diseases, allowing disease-associated biomarkers to be used to identify, predict, and monitor changes in infections (Pattison et al., 2013). The identification of biomarkers in CF could potentially provide important tools to improve CFPE identification and therefore improve outcomes for CF patients. Within the current study, Veillonella species related to V. parvula/rogosae and Prevotella species related to P. melaninogenica/veroralis/histicola represent potential biomarkers of disease state due to their significant changes in abundance from baseline prior to the start of antibiotic treatment (Figure 4). Development of targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction based analysis is required to test the efficacy of these two OTUs as molecular diagnostic tools for the onset of CFPE.",

CF patients receive frequent and prolonged courses of antibiotics, often at high doses, especially for CFPE treatment. Smyth and Elborn (2008) stated there is no comparable medical condition where so many individuals are exposed to antibiotics and risk of cumulative antibiotic side effects in this way. While the resilience within the core and rare species groups will be of concern with regard to treatment, of particular interest to clinicians will be the lack of substantial negative impact on P. aeruginosa. Antibiotics administered in response to the worsening symptoms associated with CFPE are expected to target P. aeruginosa, which is the emblematic species of chronic lung infections in CF patients. Antimicrobial resistance by recognised respiratory pathogens and other members of the microbiota may be a significant contributing factor underpinning the findings of this study (Sherrard et al., 2014). Therefore this study strongly highlights the merits of continual reassessment of existing antimicrobial treatment regimens and antibiotic delivery strategies (Sherrard et al., 2014).",

At the population level, studies have shown a variety of co-infection interactions between P. aeruginosa and other co-colonizing microbes, increasing the virulence of this core CF pathogen. For example, P. aeruginosa can use peptidoglycan shed by Gram-positive bacteria as a cue for enhanced virulence (Korgaonkar et al., 2013), metabolites are transferred (e.g. 2,3-butanediol) between fermenting bacteria and P. aeruginosa (Venkataraman et al., 2014; Whiteson et al., 2014), and, similarly, ethanol produced by the fungus Candida albicans can influence P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and phenazine production (Chen et al., 2014). Therefore the wider microbial community and the myriad of interactions therein need to be considered through, for example, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic approaches to elucidate the roles of bacteria, fungi, and respiratory viruses in tandem, alongside host immune responses. Studies of this nature could reveal the underlying cause or causes of CFPE and it may well be the case that there is no consistent factor (infection or host) that trigger exacerbations, either within or between patients.",
