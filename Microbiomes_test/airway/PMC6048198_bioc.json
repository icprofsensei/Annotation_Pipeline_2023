Next-generation sequencing of microbial DNA directly from patient samples may improve diagnostic accuracy for guiding antibiotic prescriptions. In this study, we hypothesized that enhanced pathogen detection using sequencing can improve upon culture-based diagnosis and that certain sequencing profiles correlate with host response. We prospectively collected endotracheal aspirates and plasma within 72 h of intubation from patients with acute respiratory failure. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine pathogen abundance in lung samples and measured plasma biomarkers to assess host responses to detected pathogens. Among 56 patients, 12 patients (21%) had positive respiratory cultures. Sequencing revealed lung communities with low diversity (p < 0.02) dominated by taxa (>50% relative abundance) corresponding to clinically isolated pathogens (concordance p = 0.009). Importantly, sequencing detected dominant pathogens in 20% of the culture-negative patients exposed to broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics. Regardless of culture results, pathogen dominance correlated with increased plasma markers of host injury (receptor of advanced glycation end-products-RAGE) and inflammation (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-TNFR1) (p < 0.05), compared to subjects without dominant pathogens in their lung communities. Machine-learning algorithms identified pathogen abundance by sequencing as the most informative predictor of culture positivity. Thus, enhanced detection of pathogenic bacteria by sequencing improves etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia, correlates with host responses, and offers substantial opportunity for individualized therapeutic targeting and antimicrobial stewardship. Clinical translation will require validation with rapid whole meta-genome sequencing approaches to guide real-time antibiotic prescriptions.",

While appropriate antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of pneumonia management, etiologic pathogen diagnosis with current culture-based microbiologic tests is often negative in patients with a clinical picture of pneumonia (Jain et al., 2015) or requires long incubation periods (\u223c3 days) to provide actionable results (Zumla et al., 2014; Jain et al., 2015; Vincent et al., 2015). Consequently, antibiotic prescriptions for severe pneumonia are empiric and typically include two or three broad-spectrum agents prescribed for seven or more days (Mandell et al., 2007; Kalil et al., 2016). This \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d practice is hazardous for individual patients, who may receive insufficient or disproportionately intense antibiotics, and further contributes to antibiotic resistance, a global health threat (Laxminarayan et al., 2013; Modi et al., 2014; Kitsios et al., 2017).",

With improvements in fidelity and accessibility of whole metagenome sequencing, identification of non-bacterial microbes (viruses, fungi and parasites) (Kuczynski et al., 2011) is becoming increasingly feasible and holds promise for clinical utility in the near future (Judge et al., 2015).

Eligible patients were 18 years or older with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation via endotracheal intubation. Exclusion criteria included inability to obtain informed consent, presence of tracheostomy, or mechanical ventilation for more than 72 h. Given our focus on etiologic diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia, we divided patients into culture-positive and culture-negative cases, based on clinical microbiologic results of respiratory specimens. We considered specimens obtained within 48 h of research sample timing acquisition so that such specimens would be reflective of the same infectious process being studied by NGS. Clinical cultures were obtained at the discretion of the treating physicians who were not involved in the MICALIR study. We considered microbiologic cultures of respiratory specimens [sputum, endo-tracheal aspirates (ETAs), or bronchoalveolar lavage \u2013 (BAL)] as positive when pathogenic bacterial species had been isolated by the clinical laboratory and treating physicians covered these bacteria with antibiotics (i.e., clinically these bacteria were not considered to be airway colonizers). Culture-negative cases were defined as those in which no organismal growth was observed or presence of \u201cnormal respiratory flora\u201d was reported, as per standard clinical practices. We also recorded results of respiratory viral panel testing performed in nasopharyngeal swabs or respiratory specimens.

We measured modified sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (we did not include the neurologic component of SOFA score because all patients were intubated and receiving sedative medications) by using the physiologically worse values within 24 h of enrollment. We recorded antibiotics and vasopressors administered during the first week of ICU course from intubation. A consensus committee of clinical experts (GDK, JE, WB, JSL, AM, BJM) reviewed all available data for the enrolled patients and performed retrospective classifications of the etiology and severity of their acute respiratory failure.

Beta-diversity comparisons with permutation analysis of variance (Permanova at 1000 permutations) were visualized with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). From the taxonomic composition of the reference-standard culture-positive cases and the available literature on the composition of the healthy lung microbiome (Morris et al., 2013; Segal et al., 2016), we operationally defined taxa as \u201cpathogenic\u201d (when corresponding to clinically relevant bacterial species isolated in cultures) vs. \u201coral-origin\u201d taxa, for those taxa that have been included in the supraglottic pneumotype of the lung microbiome created by microaspiration of oral bacteria (Segal et al., 2016). From observed taxonomic profiles and distribution of pathogen and oral taxa abundances, we defined pathogen dominance or oral taxa dominance as relative abundance of >50%, respectively. We compared log-transformed concentrations of host-response biomarkers and pathogen or oral taxa dominance with linear regression models, adjusted for culture results and history of COPD.",

In 9 (75%) samples, the concordant taxa were the most abundant organisms in their respective communities. In two other cases (cases 10 and 11, Figure \u200bFigure3A3A), sequencing revealed that taxa corresponding to clinical isolates (Klebsiella and Staphylococcus, respectively) had low abundance in their communities, which were dominated by potentially pathogenic taxa undetected by clinical cultures (Enterococcus and Fusobacterium, respectively) (Grupper et al., 2009; Johannesen et al., 2016; Kelly et al., 2016). Although definitive causal inferences about the clinical impact of these bacteria are not possible, in the case of Fusobacterium dominance (case 11), vancomycin monotherapy targeted against the cultured methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) failed to produce a clinical response, whereas improvement ensued after empiric addition of piperacillin/tazobactam which in fact is effective against the fastidious anaerobe Fusobacterium (Johannesen et al., 2016).",

Looking then into the culture-negative cases that represent a diagnostic \u201cblack-box,\u201d we found that 9/44 (20%) communities were dominated by pathogenic taxa (e.g., Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas genera) suggesting a specific etiology that was undefined by standard culture-based methods (Figure \u200bFigure3B3B). The remaining culture-negative samples were populated by the most common members of the supraglottic pneumotype of the lung microbiome, such as Prevotella, Veillonella, and Streptococcus taxa (\u201coral-origin\u201d taxa) (Segal et al., 2016; Dickson et al., 2017). In four culture-negative cases, clinical viral panel testing was positive for respiratory viruses (influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus) without identification of common bacterial pathogens (Figure \u200bFigure2B2B), and thus no indication of the commonly suspected bacterial super-infection that leads to empiric antibiotic courses in patients with viral pneumonia (van der Sluijs et al., 2010).",

In the few exceptions of discordance between dominant pathogen and culture results (cases 10\u201312, Figure \u200bFigure3A3A), sequencing did find the cultured pathogen although it was not dominant and may have uncovered co-primary or alternative pathogens not clinically considered.

We found that approximately 20% of our culture-negative samples actually contained a predominance of pathogenic taxa similar to those observed in culture-positive specimens (e.g., Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas). In contrast, eighty percent of culture-negative samples without a dominant pathogen had high oral bacteria abundance, similar to what is often found in the lung microbiome and suggesting ongoing micro-aspiration of oral secretions around endotracheal tube cuffs in these patients (Kitsios and McVerry, 2018). In general, oral-origin taxa were associated with lower levels of host immune responses compared to pathogenic taxa. Nevertheless, oral taxa dominance cannot be uniformly considered as clinically innocuous, given significant interindividual variability in host responses and absolute bacterial load, making context-specific integration of clinical and microbiome data necessary for clarifying the clinical importance of individual oral bacteria.",

For example, when a culprit pathogen is identified to dominate a community, early antibiotic tailoring against this pathogen becomes feasible and avoids the hazards of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic courses. Furthermore, in up to 40% of culture-negative communities, no pathogenic sequence abundance was found and communities had high alpha diversity metrics in the range of the healthy human lung microbiome. With no indication of bacterial pneumonia in these patients by 16S sequencing, early discontinuation of antibiotics could substantially decrease their cumulative antibiotic exposure. Nonetheless, the 16S sequencing technique we utilized cannot yet be applied clinically and does not provide species-level or antibiotic resistance information. The advent of ultra-rapid sequencing devices and bioinformatics pipelines offer the capacity for whole metagenome sequencing in a matter of hours, theoretically allowing for bedside pathogen identification including viruses and fungi and antibiotic resistance prediction (Naccache et al., 2014; Judge et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2017). In a recent proof-of-concept study, sequencing with a portable, point-of-care device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was able to identify the culprit pathogens before a clinical microbiology lab, underlining that NGS may alleviate the time-consumption problem with traditional culture techniques (Pendleton et al., 2017). Whole metagenome sequencing techniques remain to be optimized for pathogen detection from biological samples containing substantial amounts of human DNA.",

Given that clinical cultures can effectively grow only a subset of cultivable bacteria (Venkataraman et al., 2015), conventional sensitivity/specificity analyses of NGS become obsolete. To overcome such diagnostic challenges, the clinical reference standard has to be refined, with synthesis of multi-level data (clinical, radiographic, biomarkers etc.) to be combined in a \u201cconstruct gold-standard\u201d for pneumonia diagnosis with supervised (involving expert input) or unsupervised classification methods (Rutjes et al., 2007). Our PGM analyses highlighted sequencing variables as the strongest predictors of culture-positivity. Through iterative training of machine-learning algorithms comparing sequencing profiles to \u201cconstruct gold-standard\u201d cases of pneumonia, a diagnostic, sequencing-based classifier can be developed for clinical use (Kitsios, 2018). Ultimately, demonstration of clinical efficacy of NGS-based testing for improving patient outcomes in randomized clinical trials will provide the evidentiary support necessary for clinical adoption.",

Although not part of routine clinical screening, oral cavity colonization by pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is a well-known harbinger of pneumonia in hospitalized patients (Dickson, 2016). Our analyses uncovered oral communities with dysbiosis (very low alpha diversity) in patients with positive sputum or BAL cultures. With cross-sectional examination of the respiratory microbiome, we could not assess for temporal bacterial immigration along the oro-tracheal tract. However, the observed patterns of oral and lung co-dominance by the same pathogens strongly indict the mouth as the originating pool of pathogens, which notably occurred despite routine oropharyngeal decontamination with chlorhexidine in our ICU (Price et al., 2014). Thus, sequencing of non-invasive oral swabs offers an attractive option for screening for pathogen colonization and for plausible pathogen detection in patients with pneumonia when lower respiratory specimens are unavailable.",

                    "text": "Since we performed 16S sequencing in extracted DNA, we did not consider viruses (either DNA or RNA) or fungi in our analyses, which can be important pathogens in subgroups of hospitalized patients (Jain et al., 2015). Sequencing of the bacteriome is nonetheless of paramount importance, even when a viral pathogen is identified, as the concern of bacterial super- or co-infection is pervasive among clinicians. For practical and ethical purposes, we did not perform BAL for microbiome analyses, thus we could not assess for regional variability of communities. Our approach to rely on ETAs was informed by the recent clinical practice guidelines by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America, recommending non-invasive testing via ETAs over invasive testing (with bronchoscopy or blind bronchial sampling) for hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia diagnosis (Kalil et al., 2016). These recommendations are based on evidence from five randomized clinical trials (Berton et al., 2014), including a multicenter clinical trial (Canadian Critical Care Trials Group, 2006) showing that there is no clinical advantage (in terms of mortality, length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation or antibiotic management changes) between invasive or non-invasive sampling practices. For research purposes, ETAs are considered minimal-risk for enrolled patients, and represent a generally accepted \u201csummary statement\u201d of the pulmonary microbiome in intubated patients (Kelly et al., 2016; Kitsios et al., 2017; Panzer et al., 2017). Thus, we considered a priori that our comparisons between clinical BAL samples and research ETAs are internally valid for assessing concordance between cultures and sequencing. Our results showing striking concordance between dominance pathogen by sequencing with culture positivity (Figure \u200bFigure44) further validated the comparability of ETAs vs. BAL for microbiologic diagnosis. Timing differences of sample acquisition between clinical cultures and research ETAs may account for some of the observed sequencing-culture discordances, although research samples were obtained within 24hrs of clinical samples in >75% cases. Finally, we did not compare NGS against evolving techniques for rapid pathogen identification (Zumla et al., 2014), because cultures remain the current standard-of-care and allowed us to perform pragmatic comparisons in clinically challenging cases.",
