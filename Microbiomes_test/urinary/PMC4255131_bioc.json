The parent estrogens (estrone and estradiol) may be irreversibly hydroxylated at the C-2, C-4, or C-16 positions of the steroid ring, resulting in a wide array of estrogen metabolites that vary in bioavailability (3) and estrogenicity (4). The parent estrogens and their metabolites (jointly referred to as EM) can be further modified via conjugation with sulfate or glucuronide moieties, which modifies their disposition and half-life (5). Conjugated EMs are excreted in urine or bile; those excreted in bile ultimately pass into the distal gut, in which some are deconjugated by resident microbes. Once liberated, these hormones can be reabsorbed through the mucosa and enter the portal vein for enterohepatic recycling (3). EM profiles in women may be influenced by factors that influence their production, metabolism, excretion, deconjugation, or reabsorption.",

Specifically, high fecal microbial diversity, as measured by whole-tree phylogenetic diversity, was statistically significantly associated with a high ratio of metabolites to parent estrogen; these measures of microbial diversity had similar correlations with analogous ratios for each metabolic pathway (2-, 4-, and 16-hydroxylation). Because higher ratios of 2- and 4-hydroxylated metabolites to parent estrogens have been associated with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, our data suggest that postmenopausal breast cancer risk may be reduced for women who have high intestinal microbial diversity.",

Our a priori hypothesis was that the gut microbial population influences systemic EM profiles by deconjugating and thus liberating the EMs secreted in bile. Enterohepatic circulation of a 16-hydroxylation metabolite, estriol, has been clearly demonstrated (11), and both urinary and fecal levels of estriol and parent estrogens are altered by the administration of antibiotics (25). We observed a weak trend, suggesting a direct association between total EM and diversity; the association appeared to be stronger for estrogen metabolites than for parent estrogens, suggesting that the microbial population may differentially affect the components of total EM. Bacterial \u03b2-glucuronidase activity can be pharmacologically blocked (26), but an effect on estrogens has not yet been demonstrated.",

In particular, disruption of the gut microbiota may alter estrogen reabsorption and also contribute to obesity-related phenotypes by reduced integrity of the gut mucosa, allowing bacterial translocation into circulation and, as a consequence, chronic low-grade systemic inflammation (35). Chronic exposure to lipopolysaccharide and other toxins shed by bacteria induces inflammation by activation of toll-like receptors in adipocytes, in turn releasing proinflammatory cytokines (35). In vitro exposure of breast epithelial cells to the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 leads to increased total EM, 2- and 4-pathway metabolites, and the ratio of estradiol to estrone (36). Functional effects on estrogen-metabolizing enzymes induced by TNF-\u03b1 include an increased expression of aromatase (CYP19), CYP1A1, and CYP1B1; reduced expression of catechol O-methyltransferase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-quinone oxidoreductase 1; and modulated expression of 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (36, 37). Other in vivo studies have demonstrated that inflammation can drive estrogen production in the breast through the up-regulation of aromatase (38). These observations suggest that systemic inflammation would result in increased EM and in EM profiles with higher ratios of metabolites to parents. Clinical studies have found that regular use of aspirin, which can reduce systemic inflammation, is associated with lower circulating estrogen levels among postmenopausal women (39, 40).",

Because the levels and metabolism of endogenous estrogens play important roles in the etiology of breast cancer (7,\u20139), these observations support the hypothesis that breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women may be affected by differences in systemic estrogens attributable to differences in the intestinal microbiota.",
