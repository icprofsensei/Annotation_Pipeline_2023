Participants underwent 6 twice-weekly study visits over a single menstrual cycle for the collection of antiretroviral trough-timed plasma and genital samples (TearFlo wicks, Hub Pharmaceuticals, Rancho Cucamonga, California), and cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) separated within 2 hours of sample collection into supernatants and cellular pellets via centrifugation.

Sequences starting at position 1046 and ending at position 6424 with maximum homopolymer length of 8 bases were screened and unique sequences underwent a preclustering step using UCHIME [18] for removal of chimeric sequences and classification with a Bayesian classifier and the GreenGenes database [19]. Operational taxonomic unit clustering was performed using 95% sequence homology, and taxonomic assignments (at the genus level) were made using the GreenGenes database [19]. Additional analyses of sequencing data utilized RStudio [20] and the Phyloseq package [21]. Each participant visit was clustered into an mCT comprised of similar abundance and type of bacterial taxa using Dirichlet multinomial mixtures with the Dirichlet Multinomial R package [22].

Women were considered to have recent sexual activity (within 7 days of a study visit) if self-reported or if semen contamination was present at the study visit. Gram stain for Nugent score was performed on whole CVL fluid (n = 53) or CVL cell pellet (n = 55), depending on specimen availability. A subset of 15 participant visits had data available for both whole and pellet CVL; for these specimens a correlation analysis of Nugent score was performed, identifying a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.84267 (P < .0001), suggesting that the source of CVL material (whole vs cell pellet) did not markedly alter the resulting Nugent score. Nugent score was characterized as positive for BV if \u22657 and negative if <7 [26]. Serology for herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection was performed using HerpeSelect 2 (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, California).",

All bivariate and multivariate analyses utilized generalized mixed models that included a random intercept to account for repeated measures among participants. Clinical predictors evaluated included age, body mass index (BMI), antibiotic use for vaginal infection in the prior 30 days, recent sexual activity, FGT leukocytes, FGT blood contamination (RBC), plasma antiretroviral concentrations, plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations, and follicular vs luteal phase for participants with an ovulatory cycle, and ovulatory vs nonovulatory cycles for all participants. FGT leukocytes and FGT RBCs were dichotomized into 2 groups based on median values. To evaluate bivariate associations between FGT antiretroviral concentrations and the independent variables of interest (clinical predictors listed above and mCT), separate mixed linear models were carried out for each drug type. Antiretroviral concentrations (for both plasma and FGT) were natural log-transformed to normalize the distributions prior to bivariate and multivariate analyses. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) of FGT to plasma antiretroviral concentration was computed for each drug (termed \u201cFGT:plasma\u201d henceforth).",

Principal coordinates analysis using unifrac distance also demonstrated separation by mCT (Supplementary Figure 1). Of classified bacterial taxa, the low-diversity mCT was comprised of primarily Lactobacillus species (95.9% relative abundance), whereas the intermediate-diversity mCT had a lower proportion of Lactobacillus (49.7%), followed by Prevotella (11.5%), unclassified genus (9.0%), and Megasphaera (8.6%).

In Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa - 004 (CAPRISA-004), which examined the efficacy of vaginal 1% TFV gel for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in South African women, FGT TFV concentrations varied markedly among study participants, with lower PrEP efficacy among women with low FGT TFV drug concentrations [28]. Using a metaproteomics approach to vaginal flora characterization, the group demonstrated that the presence of Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal flora was associated with higher PrEP efficacy [29]. In an in vitro study, Gardnerella (a common pathogen identified in BV and in some non-Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal flora) was capable of metabolizing TFV [29]. The role of Gardnerella in our study is uncertain and may be negligible given its very low abundance in all mCT groups, even in the high-diversity group, which had the highest frequency of asymptomatic BV. However, methodological differences in microbiome quantitation make comparisons across studies challenging. Systematic underestimation of Gardnerella using 16S rRNA sequencing of the V1\u2013V3 hypervariable regions has been reported, though complex interactions with other species leading to variability in rates of this bias may occur and may be a limitation of 16S rRNA studies [30].",

Therefore, changes in the FGT mCT toward communities characterized by increased microbial diversity and BV have the potential to alter local pH and other factors capable of influencing movement of drugs across the FGT compartment. The FGT is naturally acidic with a pH of 3.5\u20134.5; strongly basic, lipid-soluble drugs achieve higher concentrations in the healthy acidic vagina, whereas the converse is true for acidic drugs, a phenomenon known as \u201cion trapping.\u201d Drugs such as ATV and TDF (pKa of 4.7 and 3.8, respectively [31, 32]) may therefore trap readily in the Lactobacillus-dominated vagina but be affected by a more basic vaginal pH, whereas drugs such as FTC (pKa 2.7, which is far below the pH of the healthy FGT [32]) may not be as affected by a vaginal pH change, consistent with our study\u2019s findings. TFV, though not TDF, has been recently found in vitro to have reduced T-cell uptake with increased extracellular pH, lending additional support to this hypothesis [33].",

                    "text": "However, differences in antiretroviral drug concentrations across the mCTs in our study cannot likely be explained on the basis of FGT pH changes and compartmental drug trapping alone. The low- and high-diversity mCTs in our study exhibited markedly different FGT bacterial taxa and, as such, high-diversity mCTs could be expected to produce higher local pH values and therefore different patterns of drug trapping. However, FGT antiretroviral concentrations for these 2 microbiota groups were similar, suggesting that additional factors may be at play. One plausible explanation is the presence of microbial strains in certain mCTs but not others that are capable of uptake or degradation of antiretroviral drugs (similar to the action of Gardnerella in the CAPRISA -004 study) or altering movement of drugs across the FGT by affecting local drug transporters in a pH-dependent or -independent manner. In fact, preliminary in vitro data suggest that certain FGT microbiota may differentially accumulate or bind TFV, reducing extracellular concentrations. For example, Lactobacillus crispatus significantly increased TFV uptake and reduced extracellular TFV by >75%, whereas other Lactobacillus species (L. jensenii and L. iners) did not [33]. Lactobacillus species\u2013level data were not available in this study, but it is possible the low-diversity mCT was dominated by species associated with TFV uptake (such as Lactobacillus crispatus), accounting for reduced FGT drug levels. Although the exact mechanism(s) are not delineated, the finding that certain mCTs are associated with altered FGT antiretroviral concentrations in vivo may have implications for HIV prevention strategies that utilize antiretroviral drugs including PrEP, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, postexposure prophylaxis, and potentially also treatment for prevention in the setting of suboptimal adherence and/or ongoing plasma viremia. More broadly, suboptimal drug exposure associated with certain FGT flora could underlie poor therapeutic responses to treatment of other genital infections in some women.",

Additionally, sample size may have been too small to detect differences between mCT or FGT concentrations and some variables. Analyses from prospective studies are currently under way to address these limitations. The majority of our study participants were African American women receiving regular HIV medical care in urban Atlanta, and these findings may not be generalizable to other populations. Finally, our participants were treated with the same antiretroviral drug regimen, with consistent reported adherence. Although ART has been speculated to alter the composition of the FGT microbiome [34], the mCT diversity observed in out our population is unlikely to be solely ART related as all participants received the same regimen. We were not able to estimate the potential effect of mCT on genital antiretroviral concentrations in the setting of inconsistent adherence.",
