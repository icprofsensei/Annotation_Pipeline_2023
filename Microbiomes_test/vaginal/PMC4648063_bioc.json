Although evidence suggests that the vaginal microbiome plays a functional role in the persistence or regression of HPV infections, this has yet to be described in women with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN). We hypothesised that increasing microbiome diversity is associated with increasing CIN severity. llumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was used to characterise the vaginal microbiota of women with low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (LSIL; n\u2009=\u200952), high-grade (HSIL; n\u2009=\u200992), invasive cervical cancer (ICC; n\u2009=\u20095) and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200920). Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed an increased prevalence of microbiomes characterised by high-diversity and low levels of Lactobacillus spp. (community state type-CST IV) with increasing disease severity, irrespective of HPV status (Normal\u2009=\u20092/20,10%; LSIL\u2009=\u200911/52,21%; HSIL\u2009=\u200925/92,27%; ICC\u2009=\u20092/5,40%). Increasing disease severity was associated with decreasing relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. The vaginal microbiome in HSIL was characterised by higher levels of Sneathia sanguinegens (P\u2009<\u20090.01), Anaerococcus tetradius (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and lower levels of Lactobacillus jensenii (P\u2009<\u20090.01) compared to LSIL. Our results suggest advancing CIN disease severity is associated with increasing vaginal microbiota diversity and may be involved in regulating viral persistence and disease progression.",

Although HPV infection is very common in sexually-active women2, the majority of infections are transient3.

Commensal vaginal Lactobacillus spp. are thought to defend against pathogens and sexually transmitted infections4 through maintenance of a hostile pH5, production of species-specific metabolites, bacteriocins and through adherence to mucous and disruption of biofilms6,7,8,9. Next generation sequencing (NGS) based studies have facilitated detailed characterisation of the \u201chealthy\u201d vaginal microbiome and shown that 5 major community-state types (CSTs) exist; CST I, II, III and V are dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, L. gasseri, L. iners and L. jensenii respectively, whereas CST IV has characteristically low numbers of Lactobacillus spp. and increased diversity of anaerobic bacteria10. Longitudinal studies of the vaginal microbiome using NGS indicates that bacterial community structure is dynamic and hormonally influenced with a propensity to become less stable during menstruation11 and conversely more stable and less diverse during normal pregnancy12,13. The stability and composition of the vaginal microbiome may play an important role in determining host innate immune response and susceptibility to infection. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a condition characterised by Lactobacillus spp. depletion, overgrowth of anaerobic species, and higher vaginal pH has been associated with increased transmission rates of sexually-transmitted infections14 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)15. Conversely, it has recently been reported that viral infection of the cervix during murine pregnancy increases susceptibility of ascending vaginal bacterial infection through sensitisation and priming of the host innate immune system16.",

Along with higher rates of HPV infection, BV has been associated with delayed clearance of the virus and with CIN, suggesting that a diverse, Lactobacillus-depleted microbiome may play a mechanistic role17,18,19,20. A recent study of 68 HPV-discordant monozygotic female Korean twins using NGS showed that HPV-positive twins had lower levels of Lactobacillus spp. and increased counts of Fusobacteria and Sneathia spp. compared to their HPV-negative twins21. Consistent with these findings, analysis of vaginal swabs collected longitudinally for 16 weeks from 32 sexually active women found that a Lactobacillus spp.-depleted, Atopobium spp. enriched (CST IV) community structure is associated with slowest regression of HPV whereas a Lactobacillus gasseri-dominated microbiome (CST II) is associated with the most rapid regression rates for HPV22.",

Increasing disease severity was also associated with decreasing relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. A recent longitudinal study by Brotman et al. reported that women with a high diversity, Lactobacillus spp. depleted (CST IV) vaginal microbiome were most likely to become HPV-positive, and to have persistent HPV infection22. Our findings suggest that vaginal microbial diversity is associated not only with HPV infection, but also with advancing CIN severity, but does not attain significance due to modest sample-size.",

BV, a condition diagnosed using traditional culture techniques, in part by Lactobacillus spp. depletion and increased diversity of potentially pathogenic gram negative bacteria, is associated with significantly higher rates of HPV infection and CIN19,20. We used NGS techniques to further examine this association and identified Sneathia sanguinegens as a biomarker of HSIL, which has previously been shown to associate with HPV infection21. Two other BV-associated bacteria; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Anaerococcus tetradius were also found to be markers of HSIL in our cohort. This further suggests that specific anaerobic species may play a role in disease progression, rather than simply signifying presence of HPV infection.",

Our findings show that this class, and specifically Sneathia sanguinegens, is discriminatory of HSIL suggesting similar mechanisms, likely involving activation of inflammatory pathways, may be involved in the cervix. Approximately one third of premalignant lesions go on to develop invasive cervical disease, if untreated. It is possible that the women in our cohort with CST IV microbiomes are those at highest risk of progression to clinically significant invasive lesions, yet our findings only demonstrate association, not causality, between cervical pre-cancer, persistent HPV infection and the structure of the vaginal microbiota. Whilst women with BV display higher rates of HPV infection14,19 the virus has been shown to induce a pro-inflammatory environment to facilitate integration of viral DNA27,28,29,30,31. Thus HPV infection itself may adversely impact on the host\u2019s immune defences and mucosal metabolism leading to aberration of vaginal microbiota, thus promoting viral persistence and disease progression.",

Brotman and colleagues reported that an L. iners dominated vaginal microbiome (CST III) was associated with HPV-infection whereas vaginal microbiomes dominated by L. gasseri (CST II) exhibited the most rapid clearance of HPV infection22. While we did not observe over-representation of CST II or III in our CIN cohorts, the reduced prevalence of L. iners (CST III) concurrent with increased rates of CST IV in CIN, compared to controls may represents a shift from L. iners (CST III) towards a CST IV type microbiome with the acquisition of CIN. Unlike the majority of Lactobacillus spp., L. iners does not produce H2O2, which has been shown to have antibacterial and antiviral properties32,33,34. Consistent with the possibility that H2O2-producing Lactobacillus spp. are protective against CIN progression, we detected higher prevalence of L. jensenii and L. coleohominis, both H2O2-producing lactobacilli, in women with LSIL compared to HSIL, suggests this species may be particularly protective in preventing progression of the dysplastic and ultimately carcinogenic process. Furthermore Lactobacilli spp., have been shown to be cytotoxic when co-cultured with cervical cancer cells in vitro, but not normal cells, independent of lactic acid concentrations, highlighting interactions amongst cervical cells, the microbiota and the mucosal metabolic milieu35.",

Although the development of HPV vaccines will be the main prevention strategy for this disease, its implementation in many settings can be challenging due to financial, cultural barriers and lack of infrastructure. Microbiome modulation with pre- and probiotics towards stable Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal community structure that promotes HPV clearance, could represent low-cost future therapeutic strategies.",

To analyse the importance of CSTs with respect to specific phenotype categories, we tested whether CSTs are significantly over or under-represented in any category. For this purpose we created a CST indicator variable, whereby CST\u2009=\u20091 for samples that could be assigned to the given CST and CST\u2009=\u20090 for all other samples. We performed a fisher\u2019s exact test on the corresponding contingency table. Analyses were performed using R and false discovery rate adjustment (Benjamin & Hochberg) was applied to correct p-values. P-values and q-values\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered significant.",
