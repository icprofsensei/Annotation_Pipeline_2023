The source of the initial neonatal microbiome and the factors dictating initial human oral microbiota development are unknown. This study aimed to investigate this in placental, oral and gut microbiome profiles from 36 overweight or obese mother-baby dyads as determined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Expression of five antibiotic resistance genes of the \u03b2-lactamase class was analysed in the infant oral microbiota samples by QPCR. The neonatal oral microbiota was 65.35% of maternal oral, 3.09% of placental, 31.56% of unknown and 0% of maternal gut origin. Two distinct neonatal oral microbiota profiles were observed: one strongly resembling the maternal oral microbiota and one with less similarity. Maternal exposure to intrapartum antibiotics explained the segregation of the profiles. Families belonging to Proteobacteria were abundant after antibiotics exposure while the families Streptococcaceae, Gemellaceae and Lactobacillales dominated in unexposed neonates. 26% of exposed neonates expressed the Vim-1 antibiotic resistance gene. These findings indicate that maternal intrapartum antibiotic treatment is a key regulator of the initial neonatal oral microbiome.",

These pioneer species usually bind to mucosal epithelium (e.g. Streptococcus salivarius) where they produce extracellular polymers from sucrose to which other bacteria can attach25. This causes a selective pressure for certain bacteria in the oral cavity. The acquisition of the first microbial colonizers may be altered by multiple maternal and infant factors, which may result in differences in oral microbiota development. These factors could include mode of delivery, breastfeeding, pregnancy outcomes, parental contact, antibiotics, host factors and living environment, all of which have been recognised to affect infant\u2019s intestinal microbial habitat19,26,27,28,29.

PCA and identification of clustering was performed for all four microbiomes together (Fig. 1a). Four distinct niches (representing gut, placenta, maternal oral and infant oral microbiota) were present in the PCA analysis, demonstrating the critical role of the varying physicochemical characteristics of the different sites in defining bacterial composition (R\u2009=\u20090.88, p\u2009=\u20090.001). When comparing the bacterial community distances between the niches, there was less distance between the bacterial communities of the maternal and neonatal oral microbiota compared to the placental and gut microbiota (p\u2009=\u20090.0001) (Fig. 1b). Bacterial source tracking analyses were also used to examine the similarity of the maternal oral and gut microbiota, as well as the placental microbiota, to the infant\u2019s oral microbiota. These analyses showed that the neonatal oral microbiota profile is comprised principally of maternal oral microbiota (65.35%), and OTUs of \u201cunknown\u201d (environmental) origin (31.56%). Neither placental (3.09%) nor maternal gut OTUs (0%) were prominent in the neonate oral microbiota (Fig. 1c). Despite the obvious influence of the mother\u2019s oral microbiota on most of the neonate profiles, we still observed diversity across the cohort with respect to the degree of overlap between a mother\u2019s and infant\u2019s oral microbiota profiles. The cohort was divided into two groups based on similarity of the infant oral microbiota to the maternal oral microbiota: the high-similarity group which had a similarity above the median similarity of 92.8% (median 98.8; IQR 95.6\u201300%, n\u2009=\u200919) and the low similarity group which had a similarity below the median of 92.8% (median 22.0; IQR 5.7\u201355.4%, n\u2009=\u200917; Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 1).",

First, the alpha diversity metrics produced from the profiles assigned to the low-similarity group indicate there is a greater richness (p\u2009=\u20090.003) and diversity (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) (Supplementary Figure 4) within these samples, compared to the mother-baby dyads assigned to the high-similarity group. The profiles of the high-similarity group were distinguished by an enrichment of taxa assigned to the phyla Firmicutes (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and Actinobacteria (p\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas taxa assigned to the phyla Bacteroidetes (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and Proteobacteria (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) were significantly enriched in the lower-similarity group (Supplementary Figure 3). A total of 16 different family level phylotypes were detected in the neonatal oral microbiota (R\u2009=\u20090.52, p\u2009=\u20090.001, Fig. 2a,b; Supplementary Figure 5). The high-similarity group was significantly enriched with the families Gemellaceae and Streptococcaceae and the order Lactobacillales. The low-similarity group exhibited higher abundances of 10 families belonging to phylum Proteobacteria, as well as a greater abundance of OTUs assigned to the families Corynebacteriaceae and Propionibacteriaceae, and Staphylococcaceae (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figure 5).",

Of these measures, administration of intrapartum antibiotics showed a significant difference between groups (p\u2009=\u20090.04), and was higher among infants assigned to the low-similarity group (Table 2). In total, 23 mothers were treated with antibiotics in the peripartum period: 16/16 delivering by C-section and 7/20 delivering vaginally. The medical reasons why women who delivered vaginally received antibiotics intrapartum include prophylactic use according to hospital protocol, prolonged rupture of membranes, and infections. These differences were also clearly revealed by PCA analysis (Fig. 3a). Adonis testing further supported the clustering of the neonatal oral microbiota on the basis of maternal exposure to antibiotics at delivery (R\u2009=\u20090.21, p\u2009=\u20090.02) but not with respect to mode of delivery (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 6, R\u2009=\u20090.03, p\u2009=\u20090.70). The statistical significance of this clustering was further confirmed by canonical correspondence analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.03, Fig. 3b), and the significant differences in the relative abundances of the bacterial taxa reported above were also consistent with respect to a mother\u2019s intrapartum antibiotic use. More specifically, the families Streptococcaceae, Gemellaceae and order Lactobacillales were enriched in infants whose mothers were not exposed to antibiotics, whereas families from the phylum Proteobacteria were significantly more abundant in infants whose mothers used antibiotics (Fig. 3c). The different classes of antibiotics administered did not affect the bacterial community structure in the neonatal oral microbiota (R\u2009=\u20090.039, p\u2009=\u20090.62) (Supplementary Figure 7). However, the oral microbiomes of the infants of two mothers who were given a cocktail of antibiotics (Cephazolin, Benzylpenicillin and Metronidazole) clustered separately from the infants whose mothers received only one antibiotic.",

Currently, more than 40% of pregnant women receive antibiotics in the intrapartum period33; however, the immediate and long-term effects of antibiotic treatment during pregnancy and at delivery on either the maternal and infant microbiome have not been studied extensively34. Emerging evidence shows that antibiotic administration to mothers during labour significantly affects the development of the intestinal microbiota in preterm neonates35, reduces intestinal host defences1 and leads to alterations in the vaginal microbiota prior to birth36. To our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm that the effects of intrapartum antibiotics also influence the oral microbiota composition in neonates irrespective of the mode of delivery. Holgerson et al.37 reported that differences in baby\u2019s oral microbiota were associated with mode of delivery; however, since all women delivering by C section received antibiotics in that study vs. none of those who delivered vaginally it is possible that the results reflect antibiotic use rather than mode of delivery. Since antibiotics are routinely administered to mothers delivering by caesarean section to reduce the risk of peripartum infections32, this constitutes a confounder in other studies reporting delivery mode as the main driving factor for differences in infant microbiome development.",

                    "text": "The two main antibiotics administered intrapartum in this study are Cephazolin and Benzylpenicillin. These antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed antimicrobials in Australia38. Their spectrum of activity includes both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms targeting diverse strains of Streptococci. This could explain the decreased abundance of the family Streptococcaceae and the greater diversity in the oral microbiota of infants from mothers who were given intrapartum antibiotics. As a result in the absence of the Streptococcaceae family, families belonging to phylum Proteobacteria colonize the infant\u2019s oral cavity. This pattern is often regarded as a signature of dysbiosis and inflammation39. The families Bradyrhizobiaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae, Neisseriaceae and Oxalobacteriaceae are commonly isolated from hospitals40,41,42, and harbor possible opportunistic human pathogens. In contrast, the families Streptococcaceae, Gemellaceae and order Lactobacillales were all significantly enriched in neonates whose mothers were not exposed to antibiotics. Of note, oral Streptococci are widely recognized as one of the key group of early colonizers43, and their adhesion to surfaces within the oral cavity promotes the establishment of later colonizers, by their secretion of polysaccharides and adhesins that recruit both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria44. This allows for the formation of a mature and stable biofilm community in the very early stages of human life. Streptococcus spp. can also metabolize milk carbohydrates45. Furthermore, maternal intrapartum antibiotic use has been reported to decrease the vertical transmission of the genus Lactobacillus to neonates46 and given the links between Lactobacillus establishment in neonates and infants with combatting allergy development later in life47 our findings reveal the need to consider how best to ensure restoration of these microbes in neonates. Lastly, the family Gemellaceae is predominantly abundant in the buccal epithelium of adults48 but little is known about their role in newborns. These results indicate that the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be advisable in order to limit unintentional effects on the development of the initial microbiota in the neonate.",

                    "text": "A critical outcome of antibiotic usage is the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, which is a serious public health concern. Here, neonatal oral microbiota DNA was screened for the presence of a limited group of genes encoding \u03b2-lactamases. The main antibiotics used for intrapartum treatment in this study belong to \u03b2-lactam group. Maternal antibiotic exposure was associated with expression of carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes of the Vim-1 gene in 6 of 23 neonates that received antibiotics. Previous studies have also reported the presence of Vim-type genes in infants49,50. Carbapenem-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative non-fermenters have been identified to be Vim-1-containing microorganisms51. Further, the use of antibiotics in the first days after birth has been associated with high prevalence of late onset sepsis by potentially antibiotic resistant microorganisms such as Pseudomonas52. The presence of the family Pseudomodaceae in the low-similarity group could be the source of expression of the Vim-1 gene in this study. Regardless of the origin of Vim, this study provides evidence that the oral microbiota can harbor antibiotic resistance genes within days after delivery, which could result in microbial community instability later in life. From this study, it is however not possible to determine if the observed alterations in the oral microbiome profiles by intrapartum antibiotics in infants will last through childhood and disturb gut development. The effects of antimicrobials on bacterial succession, diversity and resistance are nevertheless known to endure long past infancy53, even after only a single dose54,55.",

DNA amplification was carried out using the following conditions: 1 cycle of 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, annealing for 10\u2009s and elongation at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s. Each reaction was run in duplicate. Positive controls and negative controls were added to each PCR run. QuantiTect Probe PCR, further validated presence or absence of Vim-1 gene on the Rotorgene Q real-time PCR instrument. The reaction mixtures consisted of 10\u2009\u03bcL of QuantiTect Probe PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Australia), 10\u2009\u03bcM each forward and reverse primers, 0.2\u2009\u03bcM of Vim probe 20\u2009ng of extracted oral DNA (Table S1). Amplification and detection were achieved using the following two-step cycling conditions: an initial hold at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009minutes, followed by 55 cycles at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s and 60\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u2009s.",

Alpha diversity was determined by the Chao 1 index for richness and Shannon-Wiener index for diversity. Microbial beta diversity was visualised by principal component analysis (PCA) using the Calypso software tool (http://bioinfo.qimr.edu.au/calypso/). The Adonis statistic for permutational multivariate analysis of variance available through Calypso was used to measure differences in variance between groups based on weighted UniFrac distances. The R-value measures the strength of the statistic test where 1 signifies total difference between groups. Statistical significance of any observed clustering was further tested by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Bar plots and boxplots at phylum and family level were generated to visualise the taxonomic distribution of the neonatal oral microbiome. The LDA Effect Size (LEfSe: Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size) algorithm was used to identify taxa with differentiating relative abundance using the online interface Galaxy (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu)61. The threshold for the logarithmic LDA score was set at 3.0 for biomarker discovery. Analyses for clinical characteristics were performed with nonparametric testing and expressed as median with interquartile ranges (Q1\u2013Q3). Comparison between categories was performed by Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher\u2019s exact test to compare proportions. A p value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant.",
