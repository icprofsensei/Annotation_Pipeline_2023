Here we investigated the interactions between IBS symptoms and the gut microbiome, including the relation to rifaximin (1200\u00a0mg daily; 11.2\u00a0g per a treatment). We recruited 72 patients, including 31 with IBS-D (diarrhea), 11 with IBS-C (constipation), and 30 with IBS-M (mixed constipation and diarrhea) and 30 healthy controls (HCs). Of them, 68%, 64%, and 53% patients with IBS-D, IBS-C, and IBS-M, respectively, achieved 10\u201312\u00a0week-term improvement after the rifaximin treatment. Stool samples were collected before and after the treatment, and fecal microbiotic profiles were analyzed by deep sequencing of 16S rRNA, while stool metabolic profiles were studied by hydrogen 1-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Of 26 identified phyla, only Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were consistently found in all samples. Bacteroidetes was predominant in fecal samples from HCs and IBS-D and IBS-M subjects, whereas Firmicutes was predominant in samples from IBS-C subjects. Species richness, but not community diversity, differentiated all IBS patients from HCs. Metabolic fingerprinting, using NMR spectra, distinguished HCs from all IBS patients. Thirteen metabolites identified by GC-MS differed HCs and IBS patients. However, neither metagenomics nor metabolomics analyses identified significant differences between patients with and without improvement after treatment.",

However, some of the IBS patients do not present visible abnormalities in the microbiota composition, and rifaximin may not induce direct changes in the targeted microbiota composition.34 Therefore, alternative mechanisms responsible for rifaximin efficacy, including those directed at the microbiota-gut-brain axis 3,5,7,35,36 should be also considered.",

Overall, 10\u201312\u00a0week-term improvement after rifaximin treatment, defined as similar improvements in symptom severity scores and adequate relief measures for all 4 tested parameters (see Methods), was achieved by 21 (68%), 7 (64%), and 16 (53%) patients with IBS-D, IBS-C, and IBS-M, respectively. The effect sizes in Mann-Whitney paired U-test with power of 80% in a comparison before and after treatment were estimated for 0.53, 0.97 and 0.54 for patients with IBS-D, IBS-C and IBS-M patients, respectively. Therefore, our study had enough power to detect moderate effects for IBS-D and IBS-M, and large effects for IBS-C patients. The effect size in Mann-Whitney paired U-test with power of 80% in a comparison before and after treatment for the whole group of 72 patients was 0.34.",

The most prevalent genera within most samples were Prevotella and Bacteroides, in accordance with enterotypes 1 and 2.48 The Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio in IBS-C patients was lower than in other groups, and the bacteriome of patients with IBS-C was characterized by the prevalence of bacteria from the class Clostridia, especially from families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, in agreement with enterotype 3.48 Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed differences between healthy individuals and IBS-C patients. By contrast, there were no differences between HCs and the other types of IBS (Fig.\u00a0S2). Pairwise Mann\u2013Whitney comparisons of HCs and patients with different subtypes of IBS revealed statistically significant differences in 15 taxa between HCs and patients with IBS-C.

Those differences include those involved in the most abundant metabolic pathways, including alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism; and oxidative phosphorylation, all of which are under-represented in the metagenome of IBS-C patients. By contrast, methane metabolism and pyruvate metabolism were over-represented in IBS-C patients (Fig.\u00a0S4).

Analytical revision of studies assessing the association between intestinal microbial profiling and IBS 14 has shown that culture-based techniques allow identification of only a small proportion of gut colonizers. By contrast, bacterial identification based on the taxonomically informative 16S rRNA gene sequences (culture-independent techniques) provide a more global picture of gut microbial configuration but, despite this, no standardized procedure for metataxonomic approach has been accepted so far. While some investigators prefer to sequence amplicons of individual hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, including V1, V3, V4 or V5, others employ sequencing of a single amplicon spanning 2 or more regions, eg. V1-V2,51 V1-V3.52 In a consequence, an arbitrary choice of the region(s) for a library creation may lead to an amplification bias which results from, among other causes, an insufficient specificity of primer annealing to capture relevant bacterial taxa.52 This study utilized a sequencing protocol for the PGM platform using an Ion 16S Metagenomics Kit that allows a consensus view across 6 regions (V2, V3, V4, V6-7, V8 and V9) and, as we showed recently, it reliably captures and quantifies the composition of a reference mock community.44",

Both the quality and significance of the results may be influenced by the inter-individual variability in the gut microbiome, which could be attributed to different IBS symptoms. The limitations of this study were due primarily to the HC group, which consisted mostly of hospital employees. This group may not accurately represent the bowel habits, daily activities, and stress levels of the general population.50 However, the selection of the control group in the study on intestinal microbiome in IBS patients is particularly challenging keeping in mind that etiology of functional disorders is mainly unknown and their diagnosis is based on clinical findings, on one hand, while diversity of gut microbiota is modified by a plurality of factors, on the other hand. Despite this, our taxonomic findings in IBS patients are in good agreement with work by Soldi et\u00a0al.,34 who in 15 non-constipated IBS subjects, treated with rifaximin at daily dose of 1650\u00a0mg for 14\u00a0days, have observed effective relief of IBS symptom without changes of the overall composition of the core microbiota, even at the end of treatment, although they have found some fluctuations in a few bacterial groups.",

However, the relatively small number of patients in each IBS subgroup did not permit the differentiation among all 4 studied groups (IBS-D, IBS-M, IBS-C, and HCs) using one model, or between each IBS subgroup and HCs using the 2-group PLS-DA model. Also, fingerprint profiling did not differ significantly in IBS patients before and after rifaximin treatment. Nevertheless, trends were detected toward distinguishing IBS-C from the 2 other IBS subgroups and controls (Fig.\u00a06). The direct causal link between the microbial composition and the corresponding fecal metabolite profiles suggests that the low discrimination potential of metabolomic profiles in IBS patients confirms the rather subtle dysbiosis in IBS patients.",

Probiotics and antibiotics targeting colonic microbiota improved some IBS symptoms, suggesting a direct link between microbiota and IBS. Alterations in intestinal microbiota may also indirectly link the development and maintenance of IBS with impairment of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Thus, dysbiosis may not only be a consequence of IBS, but a plausible causative factor.14 However, the relationship between human gut microbiota and IBS is still not well understood, and further experimental research is required. Although symptoms attributed to IBS may be more frequent after an episode of gastroenteritis66 and may be caused by SIBO, no difference among major phyla or genera were found in small intestine microbiota.78",

The observed differences among the taxonomy of gut microbiota in IBS patients may reflect difficulties in classification of IBS subtypes and variability in IBS patient cohorts, but may also be due to differences in methodology and the lack of statistical power of the research. Thus, the relationships of IBS with gut microbiota composition and metabolite production are still undetermined, and it is unclear whether IBS is a disorder of the small intestine, large intestine, or both.78 Although analyses of dysregulation of colonic microbiota and their metabolic activities cannot be currently employed in clinical practice, further studies may identify candidate bacteria and/or metabolites that are practically useful.",
