Median length of stay before KPC-Kp detection was 14.5\u00a0days. At time of KPC-Kp acquisition, levels of an Enterobacteriaceae OTU increased significantly compared with pre-acquisition samples and to samples from control patients (Wilcoxon test, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Similarly, we observed a decrease in total diversity of the fecal microbiota at time of acquisition in cases (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Compared with controls, cases exhibited decreased intra-individual fecal microbiota similarity immediately prior to acquisition of KPC-Kp (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Comparison of microbial features at time of admission using random forest revealed a higher abundance of Enterococcus and Escherichia OTUs in controls vs\u00a0cases.",
