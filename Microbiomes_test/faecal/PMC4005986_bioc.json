Here we report the pathology observed in the gastrointestinal organs of juvenile to adult CFTR-knockout ferrets. CF gastrointestinal manifestations included gastric ulceration, intestinal bacterial overgrowth with villous atrophy, and rectal prolapse. Metagenomic phylogenetic analysis of fecal microbiota by deep sequencing revealed considerable genotype-independent microbial diversity between animals, with the majority of taxa overlapping between CF and non-CF pairs. CF hepatic manifestations were variable, but included steatosis, necrosis, biliary hyperplasia, and biliary fibrosis. Gallbladder cystic mucosal hyperplasia was commonly found in 67% of CF animals. The majority of CF animals (85%) had pancreatic abnormalities, including extensive fibrosis, loss of exocrine pancreas, and islet disorganization. Interestingly, 2 of 13 CF animals retained predominantly normal pancreatic histology (84% to 94%) at time of death. Fecal elastase-1 levels from these CF animals were similar to non-CF controls, whereas all other CF animals evaluated were pancreatic insufficient (<2 \u03bcg elastase-1 per gram of feces). These findings suggest that genetic factors likely influence the extent of exocrine pancreas disease in CF ferrets and have implications for the etiology of pancreatic sufficiency in CF patients. In summary, these studies demonstrate that the CF ferret model develops gastrointestinal pathology similar to CF patients.",

We have also evaluated the extent of bacterial overgrowth in the CF intestine and the types of bacterial flora found in the intestine of non-CF and CF animals. Our findings demonstrate that juvenile and adult CF ferrets naturally acquire gastrointestinal disease at frequencies similar to that observed in CF patients. Of great interest, a small subset of CF animals was pancreatic sufficient from birth, implicating modifier genes that can compensate for the loss of CFTR in the exocrine pancreas.

Heterozygous matings were performed at Marshall Farms (North Rose, NY) and pregnant jills were shipped to the University of Iowa at 21 to 28 days gestation. After birth, kits were rapidly genotyped as previously described.13 CF kits that passed meconium were paired with a non-CF animal, and generally all other kits were removed from the litter. CF and non-CF kits were reared as previously described.14 Each CF animal was paired with a non-CF sibling control and treated identically in terms of feeding, antibiotics, oral laxative, and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. This approach was used to control the variable clinical care of each CF animals (ie, antibiotics to control lung infection and oral laxatives to control gut obstruction). All kits were reared from birth on 20 mg/kg metronidazole s.c. (2\u00d7 daily) and 4.0 mg/kg piperacillin-tazobactam s.c. (2\u00d7 daily), with each dose in 100 \u03bcL of saline. If weight gain decreased in CF animals over a 12- to 18-hour period, both the non-CF control and CF animals were placed on 10 mg/kg enrofloxacin s.c. (2\u00d7 daily). If weight gain decreased a second time, the non-CF control and CF animals were placed on 30\u00a0mg/kg cefazolin s.c. (2\u00d7 daily). This antibiotic protocol was required because CF ferrets are highly susceptible to lung infections during the\u00a0early neonatal period.14 Porcine pancreatic enzymes (Viokase-V; Neogen Corporation, Lexington, KY) supplementation was initiated at approximately 20 to 30 days when kits were transitioned to artificial nipple feeding. When animals reached 21\u00a0weeks of age, the dose of antibiotics was reduced by 25% per week until the animals were free from antibiotics at 6\u00a0months of age.",

Morphometry was performed to determine the percent normal pancreas in two pancreatic sufficient and two pancreatic insufficient CF animals.

Metagenomic Phylogenetic Analysis was used to profile the composition of\u00a0microbial communities from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data.19 Metagenomic Phylogenetic Analysis relies on unique clade-specific marker genes identified from 3000 reference genomes and compares each metagenomic read from a sample to this marker catalog to identify high-confidence matches at the species or higher taxonomic levels. The total number of reads in each clade was normalized by the nucleotide length of its\u00a0markers to provide the relative abundance of each taxonomic unit. This method provided the identities and relative abundances of bacterial taxa identified in each sample.",

In the current study, we evaluated the histopathology of the pancreas in older CF and non-CF animals (Figure\u00a01). Eighty-five percent (11 of 13) of CF animals had significant loss of the exocrine pancreas with associated fibrosis, ductal proliferation, and plugging of intralobular ducts (Figure\u00a01, G\u2013L). Interestingly, two CF animals (CF-1 and CF-12) had pancreata that were largely histologically normal (Figure\u00a01, A\u2013D, and Supplemental Figure\u00a0S1, A\u2013G). However, each of these CF animals also had focal lobules with extensive loss of exocrine parenchyma and cystic dilation of ducts similar to that seen in other CF animals (Figure\u00a01, E and F, and Supplemental Figure\u00a0S1, H and I). These findings demonstrate that the ferret model retains the variability in pancreatic phenotypes also seen in CF patients,23 where 10% to 15% of CF patients retain partial or complete exocrine pancreas function.",

The finding that 15% of the CF ferrets analyzed had largely normal pancreatic histology raised the possibility that these CF animals were pancreatic sufficient from birth. To this end, we evaluated fecal elastase-1 (EL-1) levels in samples collected from CF animals with abnormal and largely normal pancreatic morphology at the time of death. All CF ferrets, with the exception of CF-1 and CF-12, had fecal EL-1 levels <2 \u03bcg EL-1/g feces at all time points evaluated (Figure\u00a03, B and F), regardless of whether animals were fed oral porcine pancreatic enzymes (Viokase-V) (Figure\u00a03B). This level of fecal EL-1 in CF animals was >1000-fold lower than non-CF controls. Reconstitution experiments spiking various amounts of Viokase-V into CF feces lacking immunoreactive EL-1, or non-CF feces containing significant immunoreactive EL-1, did not alter EL-1 ELISA results (Figure\u00a03C). In contrast to most CF animals, the two CF animals with largely normal pancreatic morphology (CF-1 and CF-12) had levels of fecal EL-1 that did not differ from non-CF control littermates (Figure\u00a03, D and E). These findings demonstrate that a small subset of CF ferrets is pancreatic sufficient. Although 2 of 13 CF animals evaluated in this study were pancreatic sufficient, the overall prevalence of this pancreatic sufficient phenotype in the CF colony is likely much less frequent. This conclusion is based on the finding that CF-1 and CF-12 had growth curves from birth that were similar to non-CF controls and the fact the frequency of this observation in our rearing experience is approximately 1% to 2%.",

Grossly, the CF gallbladder was dark in appearance in cases where histopathology was identified (Figure\u00a04, G and J). In one CF case (CF-1), the animal with a predominantly normal pancreas, the gallbladder was grossly and histologically very similar to the non-CF control (Figure\u00a04, A\u2013F).

The majority of both non-CF (75%) and CF (67%) animals demonstrated minor-to-moderate portal lymphoid aggregates (Figure\u00a05, A\u2013D and F). Biliary ducts were generally unremarkable except for rare luminal cell debris and rare lymphocytes within the epithelium.

Intestinal inflammation of varying degrees was also noted in some of the non-CF controls; however, villous atrophy was not a feature. Crypt dilatation with the accumulation of periodic acid-Schiff-positive mucin staining was common to all CF animals older than 1 month of age and generally not observed in non-CF controls (Figure\u00a06, C, F, I, and L). The lumen of the CF small intestine was often dilated by ingesta and contained significantly greater number of bacterial colonies, often adhered to the epithelial surface and within the ingesta, confirmed by colony forming unit titers of intestinal tissue and Gram stain (Figure\u00a07, A, C\u2013H). Both aerobic and anaerobic titers of bacteria cultured from the small intestine (at the level of the ileum) were significantly higher in CF animals (>103-fold) as compared to controls (Figure\u00a07A).

A mild increase in inflammatory cells within the lamina propria was also observed in CF animals. In one CF animal, the colon was white in color on gross examination. Histologically the abnormal appearance was due to lymphangiectasia with dilation of lymphatic vessels, rupture, and inflammation within the lamina propria and submucosa (Figure\u00a08, A\u2013F). Rectal prolapse was observed in several CF animals at approximately 1 month of age (Figure\u00a08, G\u2013I, and Table\u00a01). Of the 13 animals reported in this study, two animals were sacrificed due to rectal prolapse, and two others showed signs of early stages of rectal prolapse, but were rescued by increased use of laxatives. Although rectal prolapse did not occur in all animals, all CF animals demonstrated constipation and diarrhea at different times in the rearing process. Constipation was treated with increased GolYTELY (Braintree Laboratories Inc, Braintree, MA) administration and/or MiraLax (Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, Whitehouse Station, NJ), whereas diarrhea was treated with probiotic. The use of probiotics typically resolved diarrhea within 3 to 4 days.",

The most common change was submucosal edema (30% of animals) (Figure\u00a09, B, F, and J) and gastric gland dilation by mucus (30% of animals) (Figure\u00a09L). In one CF animal (CF-5), there was gross evidence of digested blood within the gastric contents indicative of loss of mucosal integrity that was histologically confirmed as mucosal ulceration with submucosa edema and inflammation (Figure\u00a09, E\u2013H). Two other CF animals (CF-4 and CF-10) exhibited moderate mucosal erosion with submucosal edema (Figure\u00a09, I\u2013L). The finding of compromised gastric integrity in some CF animals may be linked to CFTR function in the gastric glands. Alternatively, because all CF animals failed to thrive during end-stage disease, these findings may simply reflect the increased stress that the CF animals are under. In older CF male animals, the vas deferens was difficult to find and absent in most sections (Supplemental Figure\u00a0S3). Infrequently, remnant islands of vas epithelium (dysplastic and lacking) could be detected. These changes are consistent with progressive loss or absence of the vas deferens.",

Given the extreme susceptibility of newborn CF ferrets to lung infections,12 all CF animals were reared on antibiotics with the goal of removing them at 6 months of age (the age ferrets are considered to be sexually mature). Of the 14 CF animals studied, only four lived beyond the age of 6 months, despite continued antibiotic therapy. As observed in CF patients,31 CF ferrets develop disease in the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, stomach, and intestine to various degrees. Variability in the severity of disease in these organs of CF patients has been thought to be due to multiple factors, including the type of CFTR mutation, modifier genes, and environment.32,33 Our results, demonstrating that disease variability exists on a CFTR null background, emphasize the importance of modifier genes and/or environmental factors in determining CF phenotypes. Given the more controlled environment in which CF ferrets are reared (ie, housing, chow, etc.), as compared to humans, modifier genes likely play a more dominant role in the variability of organ disease severity.",

Similar to CF patients, for which 85% to 90% demonstrate exocrine pancreatic insufficiency,20,21 the majority of the exocrine pancreas was histologically destroyed in 85% of CF ferrets (11 of 13 animals).

Whether the bacterial overgrowth was the cause or consequence of villous atrophy frequently observed in the CF ferrets remains unclear. However, these findings do suggest some level of impaired innate immunity in the CF ferret intestine, which could result from altered motility of ingesta and/or nutrients that are not absorbed. Metagenomic deep sequence analysis also demonstrated that Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Escherichia were among the most abundant genera found in CF ferret feces. These bacteria are the predominant pathogens that colonize the lungs of CF ferrets, representing >80% of culturable bacteria in the lung of 9 of 10 CF animals tested.14 Thus, these findings reinforce the likely importance of fecal to oral transfer of pathogens before lung colonization, as suggested by a recent study in CF infants.40 This study demonstrated that the fecal microbiome significantly overlaps with the oropharyngeal microbiome in CF infants, with pathogens such as Enterococcus, and Escherichia (also observed in CF ferret feces and lungs) increasing in the stool before oropharyngeal colonization.40",

However, it is interesting that gastric ulcers have been reported to occur in >50% of older CF pigs, requiring euthanasia before terminal end-stage lung disease.41 CF-specific liver disease was relatively minor in the ferret model when compared to controls; however, hepatic steatosis and biliary fibrosis were observed at frequencies similar to CF patients.42",

                    "text": "One of the more interesting findings in the CF ferret model was the phenotypic variability observed in the extent of pancreatic disease. Approximately 85% to 90% of CF patients demonstrate pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.20,21 Based on histological criteria, 2 of 12 CF animals had a predominantly normal exocrine pancreas and maintained fecal EL-1 levels throughout life that were similar to non-CF controls. In contrast, CF pig are born with the majority of their exocrine pancreas destroyed,11 whereas CF mice lack pancreatic disease.43 This finding is somewhat surprising, given that the CFTR genotype has been proposed to significantly influence pancreatic phenotypes in CF patients.33 Thus, one could interpret findings in the CF ferret model to suggest that either genetic modifiers and/or environmental factors play an unappreciated role in determining the extent of exocrine pancreatic damage in CF. However, because the two pancreatic sufficient CF ferrets (CF-1 and CF-12) had this phenotype from birth, genetic factors are likely more important in determining the pancreatic phenotypes than the environment. During the first year of life, fecal EL-1 levels in CF infants have been shown to dramatically fluctuate.44 In this later study, 4 of 82 infants had fecal EL-1 levels that rose from <200 \u03bcg/g at 2 months of age to >200 \u03bcg/g by 12 months of age.44 CF-1 demonstrated two time points in which fecal EL-1 dropped below 200 \u03bcg/g feces within the first 35 days of life, whereas CF-12 maintained fecal EL-1 levels above this threshold for defining pancreatic insufficiency. Very little is known about the early pathology in the neonatal human CF pancreas because only indirect measures of function can be used to interrogate pathology. In humans, the extent of pancreatic disease has been thought to be due predominantly to the severity of CFTR mutation. However, because the CF ferrets studied were deficient in CFTR, our findings suggest that modifier genes are the most likely explanation for the pancreatic sufficiency from birth in CF-1 and CF-12. Such modifiers may include alternative chloride or bicarbonate channels that compensate for the lack of CFTR. If these factors could be identified and manipulated, they could be of significant value to CF patients.",

There was a significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) increase in fecal EL-1 levels between 1 to 2 months of age in wild-type control animals, and this increase also occurred in CF-1. This is the window in which ferrets are weaned and may account for the increase. It is presently unclear if similar changes occur in humans at weaning, however, the fecal EL-1 levels in juvenile ferrets are three to four times higher than typically found in humans.45,46 Thus, this change may be species-specific. CF ferrets have been shown to have glucose excursions >200 mg/dL during the 1- to 2-month period when weaning occurs,13 and it is possible that a decline in endocrine function during this time window is linked to increased pressure on the pancreas to produce pancreatic enzyme.",
