The study of the nature and extent of the commonly shared taxa (\u201ccore\u201d), versus those less prevalent, establishes a baseline for comparing healthy and diseased groups by quantifying the variation among people, across body habitats and over time. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine and better define what constitutes the taxonomic core within and across body habitats and individuals through pyrosequencing-based profiling of 16S rRNA gene sequences from oral, skin, distal gut (stool), and vaginal body habitats from over 200 healthy individuals. A two-parameter model is introduced to quantitatively identify the core taxonomic members of each body habitat\u2019s microbiota across the healthy cohort. Using only cutoffs for taxonomic ubiquity and abundance, core taxonomic members were identified for each of the 18 body habitats and also for the 4 higher-level body regions. Although many microbes were shared at low abundance, they exhibited a relatively continuous spread in both their abundance and ubiquity, as opposed to a more discretized separation. The numbers of core taxa members in the body regions are comparatively small and stable, reflecting the relatively high, but conserved, interpersonal variability within the cohort. Core sizes increased across the body regions in the order of: vagina, skin, stool, and oral cavity. A number of \u201cminor\u201d oral taxonomic core were also identified by their majority presence across the cohort, but with relatively low and stable abundances. A method for quantifying the difference between two cohorts was introduced and applied to samples collected on a second visit, revealing that over time, the oral, skin, and stool body regions tended to be more transient in their taxonomic structure than the vaginal body region.",

Within the cohort, members present in low abundance, ubiquity, or both, may contribute to the high interpersonal variation of the microbiome and represent a vast source of genetic material. The ecological roles of this low abundant fraction of the community however, are even less defined and may include a wide range of possibilities several of which are discussed here. Some of these members may exert minimal functional contributions to the community, for example, if they are dormant or transient (exhibit short residence time) [7]. However, increasing evidence suggests that the low abundant fraction may include metabolically active members that embody a range of ecological strategies [6]. For example, they could be stress tolerant organisms with low growth rates or metabolic specialists, and as such, represent possible sources within the human body that may contribute to commensalism, pathogenesis, or dysbiosis, upon shifts in the equilibrium of the microbial community [8], [9], [10]. Therefore, understanding what constitutes core and non-core taxa is essential to improving our knowledge of microbial ecology and links of taxonomy to metabolic function. This is critical for driving future research in directly testing the influences of evolution, ecology and stochastic processes on biogeographic patterns and facilitating the ability to use taxonomic profiles as possible diagnostic markers of health and disease states.",

This has enabled the identification, evaluation, and examination of the shared microbial diversity among a cohort of healthy individuals and over time. Work by Huse et al. [2], commenced an analyses of the core microbiota present in HMP data sets by identifying these members at various prevalence levels (ubiquity) using a fixed abundance cutoff. In this current work, we build from these initial findings a more nuanced core analysis by advancing a probabilistic interpretation of core taxa for individual body habitats and their collection into body regions. This analysis exposes the continuous relationship between abundance and ubiquity; thus providing enhanced insight into the variation across the cohort's microbiome and the taxa present in the long tail of the rank abundance distribution. Through the inclusion of key graphical representations to help visualize and compare this additional complexity within and between body habitats, the concept of \"minor core\" taxa is introduced, identified, and supported. Within this probabilistic context, the temporal stability of the microbiome across the cohort is further explored through the examination of core taxa between subsequent donor sample collections.",

These indices are represented by a scalar real value between 0 and 1, where 1 is maximum similarity, when every taxon between the microbial community members have equal membership and abundance, and 0 refers to no overlap, whatsoever.

The interaction of the multitude of organisms in a habitat, and the variation inherent to both sampling and sequencing depth, precludes a presence/absence, or all/nothing approach, which is frequently used to generate simple Venn-style diagrams [19]. Thus, \u201cin-or-out\u201d set-based enumerations of shared taxa are misleading if they do not take into account the effects of sampling depth on the detection of low abundant taxa. Furthermore, platform-dependent sequencing errors will also affect the taxonomic classification of reads, potentially leading to spurious OTUs and inflated measurements of diversity, thus making direct comparisons between studies difficult. The detection of extremely low abundant taxa, i.e., organisms whose detection are barely at or below the sampling depth of the sequencing methodology, require qualification with a condition defined probabilistically. For example, the presence/absence classification of a taxon of interest can be qualified as the probability of detecting that organism upon resampling and sequencing to the same coverage depth. This coverage depth could be standardized if multiple depths were used across the samples being compared, and the use of bootstrapping is commonly applied to simulate this. Ultimately, a taxon would be included as \u201cin\u201d if it could be asserted that its presence would be detected in \u226595% of the bootstrap simulated samples. See \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d for an explanation of how the binomial distribution can be utilized to make this assertion without resorting to computational bootstrapping.",

In particular, the relationship between taxonomic abundance and ubiquity for each taxon reveals characteristics that may be used to distinguish between taxa across a cohort, as well as body habitats from each other. The term \u201cabundance\u201d can be defined as the proportion that a taxon of interest exists in a specific donor\u2019s sample. The abundance of a taxon is computed by normalizing the taxonomic counts across the 16S profile for a single sample, such that their normalized values sum to 1, thus generating a set of proportions, i.e., compositional data. Defining an abundance cutoff would then establish a lower bound threshold for set inclusion (\u201cin\u201d), thus converting each taxon\u2019s proportion to a Boolean value. The term \u201cubiquity\u201d can be defined as the proportion of the cohort that a taxon of interest may be detected in. The detection criterion would then be delineated by a taxon exceeding the defined abundance cutoff for a specific donor. Thus, for a specific taxon, the ubiquity would be the proportion of donors with that taxon exceeding the abundance cutoff. Finally, to define a \u201ccore\u201d, a ubiquity cutoff would be delineated. For a specific taxon, if the ubiquity exceeds the defined cutoff, then that taxa would be considered a member of the core. Thus, applying both the abundance and ubiquity (two-parameter) cutoffs across each taxa for the cohort would construct a set of taxa, defined as the \u201ccore\u201d taxa, for the cohort.",

When comparing categorical data, for example with a \u03c72 test, low count categories are generally conserved into a newly created low abundance category [22] and degrees of freedom are reduced accordingly.

When plotted with other Ub-Ab curves for taxa in the same cohort, context is provided for comparing the abundance levels at which taxa exist and their variation across the donors. As will be demonstrated and discussed in the Results and Discussion section, the relationship between ubiquity and abundance varies between taxa and is dependent upon the habitat from which the samples were collected. There is not a simple linear relationship between ubiquity and abundance, although by definition, the ubiquity is a monotonically decreasing function as abundance increases. As such, it can be considered a cumulative distribution function (cdf), however with a domain from 1 to 0, thus decreasing in y (ubiquity), as x increases (abundance). The differences that can be seen between the various Ub-Ab curves for each taxon is attributed to the variance of abundance among the donors, which depends on the taxon, body region of study, and the cohort.",

Next, the minor core is revealed across the various body habitats and their characteristics in the Ub-Ab plots are explained. The variation of taxon abundance across the cohort is explored for each body habitat, reinforcing the appropriateness of the core election criteria and their distinction from other taxa. An interpretation of the two-parameter model for body regions, the composite of individual body habitats, is described and then applied to genera-based taxonomic profiles, to identify body region core taxa members. Finally, a comparison is made between the microbiota of two cohorts with the introduction of the Ubiquity-Ubiquity (U-U) plot. This provides a graphical representation of the differences between the two-parameter representations of two cohorts, and a test statistic named, the \u201cabundance-weighted\u201d Kolmogorov-Smirnov (AWKS) statistic [23] is introduced to quantify the magnitude of the differences.

Due to the inverse relationship between abundance and ubiquity, for each of the 4 combinations studied, the ubiquity cutoff was incrementally increased from 75% to 90% in order to maintain a manageable number of taxa to review. These numbers may be examined in Table 1 (Number of Core Genera and OTUs at Selected Ubiquity and Abundance Cutoffs). As demonstrated in Figure 1 (Genera Ub-Ab Plots for 4 Body Habitats), there is a not a single pair of cutoffs that can define core for all body habitats illustrating precisely why confidence intervals (CIs) must be provided for core number estimates. CIs for each of the core computes were estimated with bootstrapping; resampling with replacement from both the distribution of taxonomic classifications from each donor, and the donors included. The majority of the 95% confidence intervals were only within 1 or 2 members away from the median core value. \u201cObserved\u201d core member numbers were calculated directly on the 16S profiles without bootstrapping, thus representing the core member numbers calculated on the observed, unperturbed set of donors and read counts. The majority of median and observed core member counts were identical, but both values were included so that the table could be reconciled with the Ub-Ab plots, that represent the cohort\u2019s observed 16S profile.",

When all taxa curves are plotted simultaneously in a single figure, context is provided among taxa and the viewer is able to quickly identify taxa of interest. These plots will be referred to as Ubiquity-Abundance (Ub-Ab) plots (Figure 1, Genera Ub-Ab Plots for 4 Body Habitats). For an environment rich in taxonomic diversity, it has been seen that the drop off of taxonomic abundance follows a power-law probability distribution, thus the majority of taxa have vanishing low proportions when below 10% in abundance. Performing the log10 transform on the abundances (x-axis) is critical, since it essentially provides a visual magnification of these low abundant taxa. Body habitats from the same body region tend to have a similar collection of curves, with respect to their clustering, slopes and degrees of inflection. Collectively, these qualitative characteristics which can be discerned with only visual inspection will be referred to as the \u201csignature\u201d for a cohort\u2019s microbiome.",

The differences between body habitats from the same body region were less visually distinctive. The 4 Ub-Ab plots were generated and marked with a ubiquity and abundance cutoff at 80% and 1%, respectively. The number of, and labels for, each taxa curve above each of the bull\u2019s eye, are the same counts and named taxa for the corresponding body habitats in Table 1 (The Number of Core Genera and OTUs at Selected Ubiquity and Abundance Cutoffs) and Table 2 (The Core Genera and OTUs at 10% | 75% and 1% | 80%). The Ub-Ab plot for the oral habitat of tongue dorsum (top left subplot), reveals that there is a continuum of ubiquity and abundance cutoffs that arguably could have been chosen to define the core taxa of the microbiome, especially since the curves may cross each other. The Ub-Ab curves for two taxa will cross each other when the more ubiquitous taxon does not maintain its level of ubiquity above the less ubiquitous taxon at a greater abundance level. For example, this occurs when a highly ubiquitous but low abundant taxon is compared against a low ubiquity taxon that is highly abundant in the subset of donors it is found in. The lack of a distinctive grouping of Ub-Ab taxon curves makes the choice of an ideal two-parameter cutoff less prescribed, thus making the decision between a focus on greater ubiquity or greater abundance, more subjective. Examination of the skin habitat of the right (R) antecubital fossa (top right subplot), reveals that by significantly reducing the abundance cutoff of the two-parameter model from 1% to 0.1% (\u22122 and \u22123, respectively, in log10 scale), only 3 more taxa would have been added to the core microbiome. A compression of taxon Ub-Ab curves can be observed below 80% ubiquity, revealing that a majority of the sampled cohort share many taxa, but at a low abundance. The bottom left subplot, the vaginal introitus body habitat, reveals that a single genus of Lactobacillus is the clearest core member. It is significantly abundant and ubiquitous across all donors. For this body habitat, the two-parameter cutoff could have been defined across a large area of ubiquity and abundance cutoffs, and yet still revealed the single core genus. The last Ub-Ab plot on the bottom right is for the stool habitat. It has characteristics of the vaginal region, in the sense that the ubiquity and abundance of a single genus, Bacteroides, is clearly apparent. However, it also has characteristics of the skin region in that a second tier of core microbiome members could be defined by maintaining the ubiquity cutoff at 80%, while reducing the abundance cutoff by a single order of magnitude.",

The analysis of the core members of the microbial communities based on taxonomy for body regions is discussed later.

The core OTU identifiers for each body habitat were annotated next to their respective genera in Table 2 (The Core Genera and OTUs at 1% | 80% and 10% | 75%). With the exception of Streptococcus, OTUs #2 and #6, and Pasteurellaceae unclassified, OTUs #16 and #19, the core genera that were present across the body habitats could be represented by a single core OTU. At 1% | 80%, there were many cases in oral, skin, and stool body regions, where the OTUs underlying a core genus were no longer considered core OTUs because their distribution across the cohort was no longer ubiquitous. In Table 2 (The Core Genera and OTUs at 1% | 80% and 10% | 75%), these genera were marked with a hyphen within the parentheses. Nonetheless, in general the two approaches were in overall agreement.",

Since there were a large number of Lactobacillus reads across all the vaginal samples, one might expect a proportionately larger measured OTU diversity due to spurious under-clustering because of sequencing error.

However, without the detection of body habitat specific core OTUs, the differentiation between body habitats is a more difficult problem, as they represent a finer resolution of physical location and physicochemical characteristics which may not significantly discriminate between them. By using a two-parameter model for defining a core, a quantitative differentiation can be made between taxa that are not widespread in a population, i.e., not ubiquitous, versus those in low abundance but very widespread, i.e. very ubiquitous, or common. An alternative analysis where all donors are pooled together by averaging normalized abundances and then analyzed for overall composition would not be able to identify these important differences.",

Briefly, each ANDES profile contains the position-by-position nucleotide probability distribution for a group of sequences, e.g. an OTU, based on its underlying multiple sequence alignment (MSA). With this representation, the dissimilarity between two OTUs, independent of cluster size and necessity to identify a single representative sequence, can be computed by measuring the averaged root mean squared deviation (RMSD), across all positions. The smaller the RMSD between two ANDES profiles, the more similar they are. The reference sequences used to annotate the UPGMA tree were based on the 16S sequences from Silva [25]. A more sophisticated identification of evolutionary relationships using a phylogenetic tree building algorithm was not utilized to avoid the necessity of selecting a single representative sequence for each OTU. If a single sequence was selected to represent the OTU, it might not be an accurate representative of the cluster or its centroid, since the OTU might be composed of a distribution of strains along with noise from sequencing error. For the purposes of identifying the closest reference sequence to an OTU when treated as a whole, this distance-based approach, comparing the average of each OTU\u2019s underlying sequences, was considered sufficient (Figure 3, UPGMA Dendrogram of Stool Bacteroides OTUs). Twenty-seven reference 16S sequences from the Silva database were selected based on the underlying matching reads of the OTUs using Mothur [26]. Of the twenty-seven reference 16S sequences, fifteen were labeled as uncultured bacterium that were isolated from turkey cecum, mouse fecal, human colon, human fecal, or rat fecal samples. The matching cultured isolates included the species of B. acidifaciens, B. massiliensis and B. vulgatus. The reference sequence AM420078, isolated from an oral sample putatively associated with Prevotellaceae, may have been mislabeled. The closest reference associations of OTUs #31, #44, and #17, were B. acidifaciens (AB021157), B. massiliensis (AY126616), and B. vulgatus (CP000139), respectively. From the UPGMA dendrogram, the closest cultured isolates to the top 4 most ubiquitous OTUs (#27, #17, #31, and #45) were all members of the Bacteroides and are listed as B. acidifaciens (AB021160-4), B. vulgatus (CP000139), B. acidifaciens (AB021157) and B.acidifaciens (AB021157), respectively. At an average RMSD of 0.0010, the species of B.acidifaciens, B. massiliensis, and B. vulgatus, were separated into non-overlapping clusters. The OTUs #539, {#145 and #77}, and #449 may be considered novel species, due to their more distinctive clustering away from the remaining reference sequences and associated OTUs. These 4 OTUs joined the 3 known species clusters at an RMSD exceeding 0.00125. The most ubiquitous stool Bacteroides OTUs are labeled in Figure 2 (OTU Ub-Ab Plots for 4 Body Habitats, Stool Panel). None of the novel OTUs were in a majority of the cohort, although #881 and #1004 were more ubiquitous than the other potentially novel OTUs.",

                    "text": "The variation in the abundance of a taxon across a cohort can be attributed to a combination of multiple evolutionary, ecological and stochastic sources. Prominent sources likely include dynamic biological relationships between the organism and its habitat, the interaction of predatory, competitive and cooperative strategies between community members, and of special consideration in the study of the human microbiome, influences from host genetics and lifestyle. If these influences are not uniform across the cohort, then these forces may result in the presence of multiple community structures that have recently been described as \u201cbiome types\u201d within a body habitat, for example the description of \u201centerotypes\u201d in the gut [28]. This implies that with a large enough cohort size, it is possible to detect subsets in the cohort that may exhibit community structures that are more similar to other members in the same subset than across other subsets. In analysis of variance (ANOVA) terms, the variance between subsets is statistically significantly greater than the variance within the subsets. The stability and degree of separation between biome types for a healthy adult human population remains to be further explored. Nonetheless, in this scenario, it would be possible to reduce the variance of taxa proportions across the cohort by stratification, for example, by a subset of taxa combinations or donor phenotype data. After stratification, the intra-strata variance would be more equivalent to that of a homogenous cohort. The final influence on variance is the abundance of the taxa. The closer the abundance approaches 0.5, the greater the variance, following the variance formula for a sample proportion [31]:",

This constancy could be detected by a lower relative variation, if this characteristic was plotted against abundance. In Figure 5 (Variation of Abundance Plot), two variation versus abundance (Var-Ab) plots were selected for tongue dorsum and R antecubital fossa. See \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d for the steps and reasoning behind how the data was first transformed. When there is a clear core, such as in the R antecubital fossa, vaginal introitus or stool (not shown), then the core taxa will tend towards the bottom right of the variation plots, supporting the expectation that core taxa should be both stable, and thus exhibit low variation, and relatively high in abundance. The tongue dorsum body habitat is very distinctive among the body habitats sampled. As discussed earlier, selecting a single ubiquity-abundance pair was less clear than the other body habitats, and this is supported by the Ub-Ab plot for tongue dorsum in Figure 1 (Genera Ub-Ab Plots for 4 Body Habitats), where the non-core taxa curves interweaved with some of the core taxa curves. This complexity is also observed in the Var-Ab plot in Figure 5 (Variation of Abundance Plot). Instead of the core taxa being clustered only at the bottom right quadrant of the plot, the core, as identified with the two-parameter model, revealed Fusobacterium and Neisseria, as well. These taxa had among the highest variation across all taxa. The majority of Var-Ab plots resembled that of R antecubital fossa, sharing the characteristic that the core taxa were consistently restricted to the bottom right quadrant. The other distinctive characteristic of the tongue dorsum habitat\u2019s Var-Ab plot are the locations of the 3 minor core taxa, which are identified in green. Due to the low abundance of the minor core, their variation tended to be low as well, but this may be a result of following the expected variance of estimated sample proportions (Equation 1). The Var-Ab plots for all 18 body habitats are available as Supplemental Material, File S2 (Var-Ab Plots 18 Body Habitats).",

One question that may be asked is, given a set of body habitats from a body region, \u201cwhat is the probability that a body habitat from that body region will contain a taxon of interest at a specified abundance?\u201d This may be useful in estimating which taxa may be discovered in a new habitat from an already characterized body region. This is calculated by averaging body habitat ubiquities across a body region. The alternative question that may be asked is, \u201cwhat is the probability that a taxon of interest will be detected across all body habitats for a specified body region?\u201d The answer to this question may relate more directly to the idea of a body region core, in the sense that the taxa that are identified must be detected in every body habitat for a region above the specified abundance cutoff. The methodology used to acquire the probability that a taxon will be discovered across all body habitats involves the \u201cand\u201ding, or multiplying, of ubiquities across all body habitats of a body region. This implies that as more body habitats are included in a body region, fewer taxa will remain in the core, thus quickly reducing the core to low ubiquities, since repeated serial multiplication of values less than 1 can only reduce the final product\u2019s magnitude. Thus, it may be less desirable to compare the core member sizes of multiple body regions, if the number of body habitats in each body region is not identical.",

Each member of a cohort is actually a sample from the population of interest, thus making the cohort size the actual sample size that should be used in testing for the statistical significance of differences between the microbiota of any two groups. Utilizing the number of sequenced reads per sample as the sample size will generate incorrect conclusions with respect to the statistical significance of any differences identified. The high sequencing depths made available from 454 pyrosequencing should be defined as \u201camplification magnitude\u201d, rather than \u201csampling depth\u201d. In the early cycles of PCR, 16S sequences are \u201csampled\u201d from the bacterial genomes present as the template and then amplification occurs exponentially. Subsequent PCR cycles may preferentially amplify the initial copies over the original templates, thus leading to the magnification of early sampling bias. As a result, pairwise analyses of 16S sample replicates with moderate sequencing depth frequently reject the null hypothesis of no difference when using a statistical methodology such as Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test. As a result, pooling samples, focusing on sequencing depth, while not taking the actual cohort sizes into account, detrimentally hides critical information that could be useful and may generate misleading inferences. The advantage of utilizing the proposed two-parameter model for the comparison of two cohorts is the attempt to circumvent these issues by allowing the sampling variance of each cohort to be reflected in the taxonomic ubiquity that is compared.",

A comparison of the Ub-Ab plots between two cohorts should reveal differences in the core microbiomes, such as control and treatment. To estimate the amount of deviation that would represent a significant difference between the microbiota of two cohorts, it is necessary to first quantify the variation in a cohort by measuring the statistic\u2019s variance within the cohort (i.e., estimate a null distribution), and then calculate a p-value to give confidence that the statistic\u2019s magnitude is significant.",

The Ubiquity-Ubiquity (U-U) plot provides a visualization of the differences between microbiomes by incorporating the ubiquity measurements of two Ub-Ab plots into a single plot. The x and y axes of the U-U plot are ubiquities, thus their minimum and maximum percentages range from 0 to 100. For each taxon, a curve is drawn that represents a shift of the ubiquity between the two cohorts. If the ubiquities of a taxon are identical across all abundances between the two compared cohorts, then a line will fall along the diagonal, where the thick grey line has been drawn as a \u201cno change\u201d reference. The ubiquities for the first and second cohort are represented along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The magnitude of the positive shift of a taxon\u2019s abundance in the second cohort is represented by the distance of the taxon\u2019s curve\u2019s deviation above the grey reference line. Contrariwise, the magnitude of the negative shift of a taxon\u2019s abundance in the second cohort is represented by the deviation of the taxon\u2019s curve below the grey reference line.

For Staphylococcus, the greatest difference in ubiquity occurred at 52% in R retroauricular crease, versus 14% in the R antecubital fossa. The underlying core OTU for Staphylococcus, #5, had a maximum shift from 52% to 15% (not shown). Since the measured abundances are analyzed as compositional data, the decrease in relative abundance for these genera in R antecubital fossa, necessarily increased the proportions for its taxa in the R retroauricular crease. The greater diversity of the microbiota in the R antecubital fossa allowed the increase of ubiquity to be distributed across a larger number of taxa. One of the most salient differences of ubiquity could be found for Streptococcus at 19% and 76%, for R retroauricular crease and R antecubital fossa, respectively. The underlying core OTUs (not shown) for Streptococcus had similar shifts in ubiquity for OTU #2 from 22% to 77%, and for #6 from 23% to 78%.

In order to determine if there had been any significant shift of the cohort\u2019s microbiota over time, the AWKS statistic and p-values were computed between first and second visits for all body habitats. The calculations were performed on profiles based on both genera and OTUs. See Table 4 (Comparisons of First and Second Visit for 18 Body Habitats). Using a false discovery rate (FDR) rate of \u03b1\u200a=\u200a0.05, of the 18 body habitats that were tested, 10 were rejected using genera-based profiles and 9 were rejected using OTU-based profiles, where the null hypothesis was that there was no differences between visits. While the order of statistical significance was slightly different between OTU and genera-based profiles, the only conflict in the set of body habitats rejecting the null hypothesis (\u201cno difference between visits\u201d) was the saliva habitat. The \u201c1-Tailed p-value\u201d column contains the unadjusted p-value between the first and second visit, and the \u201cBH Adjusted \u03b1 Threshold\u201d column contains the Benjamini and Hochberg [29] adjusted threshold for a FDR with \u03b1\u200a=\u200a0.05, m\u200a=\u200a18. A body habitat was considered statistically significantly different, if the 1-tailed p-value was less than the BH adjusted \u03b1 threshold. Slightly more than half of skin and oral samples appeared to be statistically significantly different between visits. The single stool habitat was statistically significantly different between visits, as well. In contrast, the vaginal body habitats tended not to show statistical significance between the donors\u2019 two visits. Figure 12 (Buccal Mucosa, Second vs. First Visit U-U Plot) and Figure 13 (Palatine Tonsils, Second vs. First Visit U-U Plot) are included to visually demonstrate the differences between a body habitat with an insignificant change versus one with a significant change. From this analysis, it appears that there is not a clear distinction between microbiomes of body habitats that do or do not change between visits for skin and oral body regions, since a small change in the targeted FDR rate would change the number of body habitats that rejected the null hypothesis. Only the vaginal body habitats appeared to be stable between visits, as both skin and oral body habitats fell along a spectrum. It is important to note that because the profiles represent a collection of healthy individuals, rather than replicates of the same individual, changes in an individual\u2019s microbiome over time may be more statistically significant than the results would indicate for a cohort over time. For example, if biome types were to exist in a cohort and individuals shifted biome types as if they were discrete states, a methodology based on comparing heterogeneous cohorts would not detect individual shifts, if the biome type proportions remained constant across the cohort. Additional research associating the range of disease severity and the magnitude of dysbiosis would aid in determining what limits must be crossed in order to confidently associate a microbiome state with a diseased individual based on the comparison with a healthy cohort alone. Additional work, for example, following a cohort of healthy donors and producing a time series data set would better quantify the amount of variation that could be considered healthy for that duration for a single individual, thus better defining biological significance, rather than the statistical significance that is currently being quantified.",

The Ub-Ab plots identify which organisms contribute to the taxonomic diversity within a cohort, exposing low abundant taxa with high ubiquity, while simultaneously providing a backdrop of other taxa as context for their importance. A significant number of low abundant taxa, while not ubiquitous at a high degree, i.e., >80%, were discovered across the cohort\u2019s body habitats, revealing the vast richness that may contribute to the microbial community\u2019s sources of genetic material (whether as a pool available for generating mutations or lateral gene exchange), biological functions, regulatory processes, or other interactions within the community ecology. While a single ubiquity and abundance cutoff may be specified to define the core members of a microbiome rigorously, a single parameter pair does not appear to be generalizable for all body habitats, as there is a continuum of possible definitions from which one single parameter pair cannot be preordained. From an alternate perspective of variation and its relationship with abundance, the two-parameter definition of a core is supported in terms of a taxa\u2019s stability across the cohort, providing further support for the potential importance of a contingent of minor core. While there may be statistically significant differences in the microbiome for many body habitats over time, a general microbiome signature appears to be reasonably conserved among body habitats of the same body region and between visits suggesting that a relatively stable microbial community structure is maintained throughout the human microbiota, possibly serving as an overall indicator of health. Analyses of the variation for the abundances of taxa across the cohort reveal that the detected core taxa are also stable. An examination of the OTUs comprising each genera-based taxonomic unit indicates that there were no body habitat specific core OTUs and that the same OTUs were conserved across the cohort as well.",

The abundance weighted KS statistic was then introduced as a means to quantify the differences seen in the U-U plots, and applied to the 18 body habitats to determine how constant the microbial community structure is conserved between the first and second visits that were collected from the healthy cohort. Statistical inference was performed with the aid of bootstrapping. This led to the observation that oral and stool habitats tended to vary more than skin and vaginal body regions. The lack of a discrete separation between conserved and varying microbiomes of habitats between visits revealed that much like the complexity of defining the core taxonomic members of a microbiome across a healthy cohort, addressing the question of whether a microbiome varies over time, also falls along a continuous spectrum.",

Neither of these approaches takes into account the sampling depth, i.e. reads per sample. Awareness of the sampling depth is crucial for comparing two samples with low abundance taxa, especially when these two samples have been sampled at different depths and have a significant proportion of taxa with abundances barely at, or just below, the maximum sampling sensitivity. The inverse of the sampling depth is the lower bound for the least abundant taxa that may be quantified. To properly determine whether a taxon should be in or out of a set, it is useful to make this Boolean decision based on a probabilistic condition, or cutoff. To include a taxon of interest into a set, an assertion of the confidence of resampling redetection should be made. One possible assertion is that upon repeated resampling and resequencing, the taxon of interest will be detected (i.e., have an abundance greater than zero) in at least 95% of the samples. This calculation can be made using the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution\u2019s probability mass function is described by two parameters, n, number of trials (read depth) and p, the probability of successful detection (abundance).",

Across the cohort, even if a taxon is ubiquitous, the variation of that abundance in each donor will vary as well. This may reflect a variety of conditions such as the physiochemical range in which the taxon in question is adapted to, and/or the cooperative or competitive lifestyle interactions with the other members of the microbial community also inhabiting the body habitat in question. In order to measure the variation of the abundance across the cohort, three key issues needed to be addressed. The first issue is the non-normal distribution of abundances. Taxonomic distributions tend to follow a power-law probability distribution. Thus, a log10 transformation was applied to the abundance before computing the variance. This introduced the second issue of zero counts in the data. Zeroes may occur in the data due to the read sampling depth being insufficient to assay a very low abundance, thus leading to transformation errors resulting from log10(0) equaling negative infinity. To deal with this problem, it is common to treat a zero abundance as a \u201cnon-response\u201d [30], thereby excluding it from the analysis and reducing the sample size for that taxa. Due to the various read depths used, a minimum abundance of 10\u22124 was used as a lower bound for presence. The final issue was the correlation between variance and proportion. The variance for a sample proportion [31] is estimated by the formula, p(1-p)/(n-1). As p (the abundance) approaches 0 or 1 from the midpoint proportion of 0.5, or n (the reads per sample) increases, the sampling variance will decline independent of the taxon\u2019s biological characteristics. Since reads per sample varied and amplification bias may occur, applying a correction to the observed variance based on a theoretical expected variance, does not work well. Thus, a scatter plot was used to better identify the taxa that do not follow a common trend. In these plots, the x-axis is the mean of the log transformed proportions, and the y-axis is the standard deviation of the log transformed abundance. Utilizing the standard deviation in the plot, instead of the variance, makes the scale more intuitive and relative to the log abundance. To account for the variability of sample size, i.e. ubiquity, for each taxon, each glyph\u2019s size was plotted proportional in size to the ubiquity of the underlying taxon. From these plots, the core taxa tended to be located in the bottom right quadrant, because of their characterization by low variance and high abundance. The minor core, if existent in a body habitat, may be found at comparable levels of variation to the high abundance core, but located in the bottom left quadrant, where they are characterized by their low abundance and low variance, but wide ubiquity.",

The ubiquity comparison plot (U-U Plot) represents one group of samples (1st cohort) on the x-axis, and the second group of samples (2nd cohort) on the y-axis. The units on both axes represent ubiquity, and thus range from 0% to 100%. When the taxonomic abundance of the two samples compared have the same ubiquity, they will fall on the idealized diagonal line of slope\u200a=\u200a1 and y-intercept\u200a=\u200a0. Thus, the more similar the microbial communities of two groups are the closer to this line they will fall. Deviations of the U-U plotted lines above the idealized diagonal indicate a greater ubiquity towards the group labeled on the y-axis, while curves deviating below the idealized diagonal represent greater ubiquity towards the group represented along the x-axis. All U-U curves will diverge from (0, 0) and then converge at (100%, 100%). The reader familiar with statistical methods may recognize the similarity of the U-U plot to the quantile-quantile (Q-Q plot) [32] or Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve [22].

Thus, the null hypothesis (H0) would then be that the two cohorts have the same taxonomic profile, and the alternate hypothesis (HA) would be that there existed a difference. Standard caveats hold that 1) statistical significance is not the same as biological or practical significance, where an effect size can be associated with a disease state, 2) with large sample sizes, methods can be very sensitive to small deviations, and 3) the act of sampling without replacement will perturb the system. To measure the difference between taxonomic profiles of two cohorts, a test statistic was devised in order to capture the difference of ubiquities between cohorts across abundances, for each taxon.

Data from the \u201chigh stringency\u201d pipeline was used in this analysis and quality was assured with the following steps described here in brief. For sample multiplex barcode deconvolution and 16S primer trimming, a one nucleotide unambiguous mismatch to the sample barcode and up to two nucleotide mismatches to the adjacent PCR primer were allowed, respectively. Sequences with an ambiguous base call or a homopolymer stretch longer than eight nucleotides were removed from subsequent analyses. The high stringency pipeline incorporated a strategy of calculating the average quality score within a 50 nucleotide window that was shifted along the sequence. When the average quality score of the window decreased to <35, the sequence was trimmed. After trimming, all sequences were aligned using a NAST-based sequence aligner [33] to a custom reference based on the SILVA [34] database of curated alignments. Sequences shorter than 200 nucleotides or that did not align to the anticipated region of the reference alignment were removed and extraneous bases that extended beyond the targeted variable region were trimmed. Chimeric sequences were then identified using the Mothur [26] implementation of the ChimeraSlayer [35] algorithm which was trained to the \u201cGold\u201d database (http://microbiomeutil.sourceforge.net). These filtered alignments formed the data set used for the generation of taxonomic classifications using RDP [36]. From the read processing described above, a total of 3,044 samples (17,371,356 total reads) were analysed.",
