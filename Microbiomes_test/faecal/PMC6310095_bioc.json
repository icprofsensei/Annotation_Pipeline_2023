Although current research suggests a multifactorial pathogenesis including genetic, environmental, and autoimmune factors, the etiology of IBD remains an enigma (2\u20135). The enteric microbiome, which includes bacteria, fungi and viruses, has been purported to play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD (6). Distinct gut microbial communities have been demonstrated in patients with IBD, but the origins and underlying causes of these patterns remains unknown. Enteric viruses combined with other factors such as the microbiome, host genetics, and immune status are hypothesized to be modulating factors influencing disease severity by impacting intestinal and immune development and chronic inflammatory responses (7).",

Published reports focus on describing the components of the enteric virome, investigating if any common differences exist among IBD patients. Norman et al recently characterized the enteric virome of three adult IBD cohorts (n=12 controls; n=18 Crohn\u2019s disease; n=42 ulcerative colitis) and showed that adult IBD patients exhibited increased relative sequence abundance of Caudovirales bacteriophages compared with normal controls (8). Wang, et al, focused on intestinal tissue RNA rather than fecal samples, demonstrating a difference in the abundance of reads matching mammalian viruses and endogenous retrovirus sequences of adult IBD patients versus healthy controls (10 IBD patients; 5 controls) (6). A recent study of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) showed that phage richness in UC patients did not differ from healthy controls at any time point before or after FMT. However, eukaryotic viral richness was higher in patients with UC compared with healthy controls and in non-responders versus responders of FMT (9). Eukaryotic viral reads matched mainly members of the Anelloviridae and Picobirnaviridae known to infect humans, Virgaviridae infecting plants, and Circoviridae of unknown tropism. Documentation of alterations of the microbiota in adult patients with IBD may provide a basis for targeting future therapies, monitoring disease state, and/or assessing response to medical therapy.",

The filtrate was treated with a mixture of DNase and RNase enzymes to digest unprotected nucleic acids. Viral nucleic acids protected from digestion within viral capsids were extracted using a Maxwell 16 viral nucleic acid purification kit (Promega, Madison, USA). Reverse transcription into cDNA used a primer containing a fixed 18-bp sequence plus a random nonamer at the 3\u2032 end (GCCGACTAATGCGTAGTCNNNNNNNNN). The 2nd strand DNA was generated using Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA). Fifteen cycles of PCR were performed after adding the fixed 18-bp portion primer (GCCGACTAATGCGTAGTC) according to protocol N1 (10). The resulting PCR products were used to construct a DNA library using the Nextera XT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA). The library was then sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina platform with 250 base paired end reads. Viral sequences were identified through translated protein sequence similarity search (BLASTx) to annotated viral proteins available in GenBank\u2019s databases. This protocol has been shown to amplify both RNA and DNA viral genomes (10).",

An E-value of 10\u22125 was the cutoff value for significant hits, and the phage sequences were identified. Sequence based classification therefore allowed reads with translated protein similarity (threshold BLASTx E value \u226410\u22125) to any of the currently sequenced viruses in GenBank to be identified. A recognized limitation of this approach is that sequences from viruses without detectable protein sequence similarity to any of all the viral proteins in GenBank are not recognized (11\u201313). In each fecal sample, phages were sorted based on their number of reads, and the 20 most abundant phages in each individual sample were selected. Phages that share >80% identity at the amino acid level over >80% of their entire genomes were considered the same virus. Based on this criterion, the large collection of phages for the total of 24 fecal samples was collapsed into the small database comprising of 107 unique phage genomes (Supplemental table 1). The MiSeq data were then compared to this database of most abundant phages. Based on BLASTx output, reads were classified into different phage strains based on the taxonomic origin of the best-hit (lowest E-score) sequence match. The relative abundance of phages was determined by the number of matching sequence reads (divided by the total number of reads to adjust for slight differences in library size), while the richness of phages was measured by the number of different phage strains. Shannon\u2019s diversity measures both the richness and distribution of phages within each viral taxon. Data were visualized and tested for statistical significance using Kruskall Wallace and Dunn\u2019s post-hoc tests in R.

There were no significant differences in alpha-diversity between healthy subjects and IBD patients (Supplemental Figure 1a-c, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; P >0.05), though control subjects trended towards richer bacterial gut microbiota compared with IBD subjects. PERMANOVA analysis was used to examine whether variation in bacterial community composition was explained by clinical variables, including probiotic supplementation and markers of inflammation. Of the factors examined, IBD diagnosis (yes/no, Supplemental Figure 2), multiple markers of health status (albumin, hemoglobin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and probiotic supplementation were significantly related to the composition of the gut bacterial microbiota (Table 2). Although antibiotic treatment is a potential confounding factor, the control subject taking antibiotics at the time of sample collection clustered with the remaining controls, indicating that the administration of antimicrobials did not dramatically shift the composition of the microbiota of this participant. Of note, the dominant bacterial family explained the greatest degree of gut microbiota compositional variance (Figure 2), while dominant phage detected in these samples did not significantly relate to community composition. These data suggest that the health status of pediatric participants in our study was related to the composition of their gut microbiota, and that probiotic supplementation influences gut bacterial microbiota composition.",

As this was an exploratory study, sample size limited our ability to elucidate differences and patterns. Our intent was to evaluate a general pediatric IBD population. Enrolled patients vary based on several factors, including medications, disease location, age, and disease severity, although specific disease activity was not recorded. Recent studies have begun to suggest that medications used in treatment may be beneficial in part due to their impact on enteric microbiota (20, 21). Given various pressures on the microbiome, recruiting patients with similar disease phenotype and medication exposures might improve our capability to identify differences. Another limitation is recruitment of our control population from general gastroenterology clinic rather than from the general population. Controls were screened for colitis and other disorders related to IBD, and none had macroscopic or microscopic evidence of IBD. By recruiting from the same subspecialty clinic, we were able to standardize our collection instructions and methods including the geographic recruitment area. Collectively, these limiting factors \u2013 small sample size, heterogeneity of IBD cases, and control subjects being drawn from a gastroenterology clinic \u2013 may explain our ability to only detect a statistically significant trend in lower bacterial richness in IBD cases relative to controls. Additionally, only stool samples were analyzed in this study; further studies would be enhanced by also including rectal mucosal samples.",

Previous studies in adults, also analyzing low numbers of patients and cases, report distinct virome patterns in IBD patients compared with household and geographical controls (6, 8), possibly reflecting differences between children and adults and/or use of different starting materials (colon tissue RNA versus feces). The borderline p-values for the observed differences indicate that conclusions regarding relevance to IBD be considered tentative. Bacterial microbiota exhibited significant relationships with disease status and with multiple objective markers of host health, indicating that composition and function of bacterial communities in the gut may influence such attributes. While these results lend further support to the role of gastrointestinal bacterial and viral communities in IBD pathogenesis, larger studies are necessary to account for confounding factors such as age and duration of disease, and more in-depth studies are needed to identify mechanisms by which the gut microbiome may modulate immune function in pediatric patients.",
