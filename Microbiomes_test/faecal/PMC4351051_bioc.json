                    "text": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory disease of the newborn bowel, primarily affecting premature infants. Early intestinal colonization has been implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC. The objective of this prospective case-control study was to evaluate differences in the intestinal microbiota between infants who developed NEC and unaffected controls prior to disease onset. We conducted longitudinal analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of 312 samples obtained from 12 NEC cases and 26 age-matched controls with a median frequency of 7 samples per subject and median sampling interval of 3 days. We found that the microbiome undergoes dynamic development during the first two months of life with day of life being the major factor contributing to the colonization process. Depending on when the infant was diagnosed with NEC (i.e. early vs. late onset), the pattern of microbial progression was different for cases and controls. The difference in the microbiota was most overt in early onset NEC cases and controls. In proximity to NEC onset, the abundances of Clostridium sensu stricto from Clostridia class were significantly higher in early onset NEC subjects comparing to controls. In late onset NEC, Escherichia/Shigella among Gammaproteobacteria, showed an increasing pattern prior to disease onset, and was significantly higher in cases than controls six days before NEC onset. Cronobacter from Gammaproteobacteria was also significantly higher in late onset NEC cases than controls 1-3 days prior to NEC onset. Thus, the specific infectious agent associated with NEC may vary by the age of infant at disease onset. We found that intravenously administered antibiotics may have an impact on the microbial diversity present in fecal material. Longitudinal analysis at multiple time points was an important strategy utilized in this study, allowing us to appreciate the dynamics of the premature infant intestinal microbiome while approaching NEC at various points.",

These children are especially prone to inflammatory disease as a result of a poorly-regulated immune system and an inappropriate inflammatory response[1\u20135]. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an inflammatory disease of the immature bowel that has been associated with aberrant intestinal colonization, represents the most common cause of gastrointestinal (GI) morbidity and mortality among premature infants and is a major contributor to poor growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes[6,7]. In spite of decades of research, the prevalence of NEC among infants born between 500 and 1500 grams persists at approximately 7 percent[8], and according to the National Institutes of Child Health and sHuman Development Neonatal Network, may range from 4 to 19 percent in infants born prior to 28 weeks of gestation[9]. In short, developing an improved understanding of the etiology of NEC so that more effective prevention and treatment interventions may be developed is needed.",

Thus, when prematurity cannot be prevented, intestinal colonization is the major modifiable risk factor contributing to NEC. As a result, better understanding the pattern of intestinal colonization and community structure of the microbiome associated with NEC is an important area of study in the etiology of the disease. The research conducted to date on intestinal colonization and the microbiome aspects of NEC in premature infants using non-culture based techniques has resulted in inconsistent findings. Some studies have been unable to demonstrate clear differences among cases and controls[10,11], while others have shown that the community structure of the microbiome of the premature infant gut prior to and at the time of disease onset is unique[12\u201316].",

At one week prior to disease, the microbiome of cases and controls has also appeared differently[14,16]; however, these differences do not persist to within 72 hours of disease onset, which may be explained by the greater degree of heterogeneity in the microbiome under conditions of disease when compared to the more stable and similar nature of the microbiome in control infants[16].

To understand this developmental process, we examined how different factors affect the bacterial community structure. Bacterial community structure refers to the bacterial compositions and abundances in one sample or a group of samples. As shown in the NMDS plot, the day of life is the most striking driver of the development of the gut microbiota among these premature infants(Fig. 1, S2 Fig.), and this age dependent cluster pattern was especially evident in the samples analyzed at the genus level. Samples were not clustered by antibiotic usages and health status (NEC and healthy control) (S3 Fig.).",

Six of the twelve NEC cases in this study had samples available for analysis at the time of disease onset. No clear separation was observed between NEC cases and the controls (S4A, C Fig.); PERMANOVA testing showed no statistically significant differences between NEC and controls at day of NEC onset (p = 0.52 for genus level and p = 0.40 at class level). Instead, at the genus level, the six NEC samples were segregated in the first dimension of the NMDS plot, with the three NEC samples from onset day 23 to 35 on the left side and the three NEC samples from onset day of life (DOL) 10\u201322 on the right side of the first dimension (S4C Fig.). Barplots of the top five abundant classes demonstrated that three NEC subjects (1, 2 and 3 DOL< = 22) were dominated by Clostridia with the relative abundances of 50.0%, 94.8% and 29.7%, respectively, while the other three NEC(4, 5,6) were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria with the relative abundances of 73.4%, 98.8% and 46.2%, respectively(S4B Fig.). At the genus level, three (NEC 1, 2 and 3 DOL< = 22) out of six NEC subjects were dominated by Clostridium sensu stricto from Clostridia class, while the NEC samples 4,5,6 with high abundance Gammaproteobacteria class were heterogeneous, with Pseudomonas, Pasteurella, Serratia and Klebsiella being the most prevalent genera, respectively (S4D Fig.).",

To minimize the effect of day of life on the microbiome when comparing the NEC cases and their controls, we separated the NEC subjects into two groups: (1) early onset disease (day of NEC onset < = 22) and (2) late onset disease (day of NEC onset >22). In the absence of any consensus regarding cutoffs for early versus late onset NEC, we chose this interval after inspecting pilot NMDS data from samples obtained on the day NEC was diagnosed (S4C Fig.), as described above.",

Interestingly, we observed a clear separation of early onset NEC and controls at the second week of life at the genus levels (p = 0.01) (Fig. 2A, S1 Table), suggesting that the microbiota were different between early onset NEC samples and control. However, no significant difference was found between early onset NEC and controls at the third week of life (p = 0.36).",

At the same time points, the median relative abundance of Negativicutes showed minor changes in NEC and controls with no statistical significance (S5B Fig.). At the genus level, Clostridium sensu stricto was seven times more abundant in NEC cases than in controls at second week of life, and decreased significantly after one week in NEC (p = 0.05) but increased in controls although no significant difference was found (p = 0.22).

The NEC subjects were also distinct from each other, and the individualized distribution became more notable with increasing age, especially at six weeks of life. The latter observation was in line with the NMDS portrayal at day of NEC (S4 Fig.). While we have reported significant p values in all of the above analysis, these should be interpreted with caution given the small sample sizes included in both the early and late onset analyses.",

In analyzing the data in this manner, we found that prior to early onset NEC, four classes of bacteria showed interesting patterns in the microbiome 9 days prior to disease (Fig. 3A): (1) The amount of Gammaproteobacteria in controls maintained the same predominance for 9 days before NEC onset, yet it is significantly higher in controls than in NEC samples at 7\u20139 and 4\u20136 days prior to NEC onset (p = 0.01 and 0.008, respectively), and not significantly different just before disease onset as a result of Gammaproteobacteria from NEC cases showing an increasing trend while approaching disease. As seen in Fig. 3A, 1\u20133 days before NEC onset, Gammaproteobacteria in cases reached a similar level as the controls. Klebsiella is the major genus from Gammaproteobacteria in the early onset group, however, its relative abundance was not significantly different between NEC and controls. Escherichia/Shigella was significantly higher in controls than early NEC cases (p = 0.005) (2) Strikingly, bacteria from the Clostridia class (Clostridium sensu stricto as the major genus) in the NEC samples was found to be significantly higher than in the controls consistently from 1\u20139 days before NEC onset (p = 0.01,0.05 and 0.01 for 7\u20139, 4\u20136, 1\u20133 days before onset) (3) Bacilli (especially Staphylococcus genus) decreased within the 9 days of disease in the early onset NEC cases, while no obvious changes were detected in controls samples. (4) Negativicutes were low in abundance and we did not find any significant changes for bacteria in this class among the early onset group.",

(1) Gammaproteobacteria showed a steady decreasing trend in controls and increasing trend in NEC samples (Fig. 3B). The Gammaproteobacteria became significantly higher 1\u20133 days prior to the late onset NEC (p = 0.03). Genus level analysis demonstrated that not all of the genera from Gammaproteobacteria showed an increasing trend in NEC samples. Escherichia/Shigella indicated a drastic increase, as they became significantly higher than controls 1\u20133 days and 4\u20136 days prior to NEC (p = 0.02). Klebsiella and Enterobacter decreased towards diseases onset and Enterobacter became significantly lower in the 1\u20133 days prior to NEC. (2) The abundance of Bacilli (mainly Enterococcus) showed no significant difference between cases and controls, and their abundance did not show significant variation over the 9 days prior to late onset NEC (p>0.05). (3) In contrast to early onset NEC, Clostridia (mainly Clostridium sensu stricto) decreased or maintained a low abundance at the class level in samples representing NEC cases, while the control subjects demonstrated a microbial trajectory characterized by an increasing proportion of Clostridia within 9 days before disease. The abundances of Clostridia were not significantly different between case and controls at the three time points (p>0.05) (4) Negativicutes increased in the late onset control subjects while no obvious change was detected in the late onset NEC subjects. However, at the genus level, we found Veillonella was significantly higher in controls than NEC cases 1\u20133 days prior to NEC onset (p = 0.005).",

We used mixed linear regression to assess the effect of different variables including, day of life, mode of delivery, gestational age, and gender, on the microbial complexity among samples in this study. The microbial complexity measured by richness and Shannon diversity describes the number of different taxa and their abundances in a sample, respectively. The goal of using mixed linear regression on the microbial diversity is to evaluate the difference in diversity variation between comparison groups over time. In this study, we analyzed the diversity at the genus level, given the more complex bacterial community at a lower taxonomical level. Richness and Shannon diversity from the samples before NEC onset increased significantly over the 2 months of life (p = 9.76E-14 for Shannon diversity, and p = 0.003 for richness), indicating day of life is a critical factor affecting the complexity of the bacterial community.",

For example, the type, dosage, and duration of antibiotic usage may all have an effect on the intestinal microbiota. In this study, the infants received broad spectrum intravenously (IV) administered antibiotics (not oral antibiotics) following birth, which is a routine practice common to preterm infants in the NICU. While recent findings have shown that there is a disturbance in the gut microbiota associted with IV antibiotic therapy in adults[26], the molecular mechanisms require further study and whether or not this same influence is observed in preterm infants early in life is unknown.. Here, we performed an initial investigation relative to this issue by comparing the microbial diversity between healthy subjects who received antibiotics within 5 days of sample collection and subjects who did not have antibiotic usage at least five days before sample collection. We chose only the control subjects to exclude the potential effect of disease itself on diversity. The selected samples were obtained between days of life 7 to 14. The comparison was done after adjusting day of life, gender, feeding, mode of delivery and presence of maternal infection. The diversity including richness and Shannon diversity were lower in subjects treated by antibiotics within five days vs subjects who did not (S6 Fig.), with a marginally significant difference on richness (p = 0.09 for richness and 0.18 for Shannon diversity), suggesting IV antibiotic treatment may influence the complexity of the premature infant intestinal microbiome. As described above, NEC samples tended to have lower microbial diversity than controls, and they also have marginally more antibiotics usage than controls (Table 1 before p value correction). We speculate that the low diversity in NEC samples may be due in part to the increased exposure to antibiotics outside the treatment for NEC among these infants.",

The time dependent variation in the microbiome is not surprising because the infants\u2019 intestinal microbiota is under rapid development in early life and the microbiome has been shown to be highly dynamic until approximately two years of age [27]. As seen in our results, the changing microbiota was largely affected by day of life and less by other clinical variables, which suggests that the microbiome comparison between NEC cases and their controls should be confined to a similar time frame following birth.",

This wide range in age at the time of disease is a confounder in the microbiome comparison between NEC cases and controls. This is evident from our NMDS plot using all of the NEC onset data in which early and late onset NEC samples were distinct. To deal with the influence of day of life on the microbiome community structure, we divided the NEC samples into early and late onset groups and compared the colonization pattern of the microbiome with their matching controls. We observed a clear separation of early onset NEC samples with their controls. However, this separation is less clear for late onset NEC samples and controls. In the latter case, the microbiome appears to have a more individualized pattern. The high inter-subject variation in late onset NEC and their controls is consistent with previous study on the process of intestinal bacterial colonization early in life [28, 29]. Previous studies showed NEC cases and controls were segregated, suggesting their microbiomes were different [12,14,16]. However, these studies are based on single sampling points or smaller sample size, considering the high inter-subject variation, future studies that involve larger sample sizes and cross-center data comparisons will have the ability to further explore the inter-subject variation that has currently been identified with greater accuracy.",

The pathogen that has been most commonly associated with NEC, Cronobacter sakazakii, has demonstrated that virulence is not a property of a bacterial species as a whole [30\u201333]. Rather, pathogenicity may be a function of the host response to the characteristics of specific strains within a certain species of taxa [30] In addition to Cronobacter, earlier studies using culture based techniques and recent studies using metagenomic approaches have linked several bacteria to NEC. These bacteria have primarily been identified as Gram-negative species (i.e. Klebsiella pneumoniae) [10,12,14,15,34,35]. However, there have also been observations suggesting that Gram-positive bacteria (i.e. Enterococcus faecalis) [36] and anaerobic species (i.e. Clostridium) may contribute to the etiology of NEC[37]. Our study investigating NEC using a metagenomic approach demonstrated an imbalanced bacterial community in NEC. By analyzing the data 9 days prior to NEC onset, we found a higher abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto (genus) from Clostridia (class) in early onset NEC samples when compared to their controls. This observation did not hold true in late onset NEC cases, where Escherichia/Shigella were higher. The inconsistent finding between early and late onset NEC may have resulted from the age difference of the infants at the time of disease, as the bacteria associated with NEC are influenced by the natural colonization process over time in these infants. Taken together, these findings suggest that a common specific pathogen associated with all NEC is lacking. This is not surprising, given that in the molecular and high throughput sequencing era of microbiology, where multiple PCR and metagenomic sequencing of biological specimens have the potential to discover numerous organisms or pathogens, the concept of one pathogen resulting in one disease is currently being challenged. Experimental animal model based validation is warranted to identify the real causative agents.",

Focusing on the early onset NEC samples, we can see that it is not an absolute change in abundance of a specific bacteria that is most relevant when studying the microbiome in proximity to disease. Rather, it is the trend among the members of the microbiome over time that seems to be associated with disposition for disease. The abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in early onset NEC provides an important example of trending microbiome data. As seen in Fig. 3A, if we evaluate the differences in Gammaproteobacteria at discrete time points prior to NEC, we would likely conclude that Gammaproteobacteria is overwhelming protective against NEC (i.e. higher Gammaproteobacteria observed in controls at all of the time intervals before disease). However, the trend data as observed over the nine days preceding NEC shows that while NEC cases do indeed have a lower abundance of Gammaproteobacteria than controls, this abundance dramatically changes as the infant approaches disease. Therefore, NEC may evolve as a result of an increasing abundance of Gammaproteobacteria as the infant approaches disease. This changing trend is in stark contrast to the relatively unchanging abundance observed in controls at the same time points, suggesting that the change may be contributing as much to the etiology of the disease as the community structure of the microbiome.",

As in many other diseases, where the disease evolves as a result of the interaction between the pathogen and the host, we think that there is a greater need to understand the premature infant inflammatory response to intestinal bacteria, as this response is likely playing a significant role in the etiology of NEC. This area of inquiry is especially important given recent findings, which have shown that the immune system of the infant born at term is \u201cturned-down\u201d for a period of time early in life, presumably to allow for the rapid intestinal colonization that occurs following birth [38]. How the immature immune system is programmed to facilitate early intestinal colonization of the premature infant is unknown. Future research on the immature immune response, in tandem with early intestinal colonization, may help develop interventions that attenuate the inappropriate inflammatory response that characterizes NEC in premature infants.",

Of these, nutrition is likely to be a significant contributor to the development of the microbiome and its role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as NEC. For example, studies have shown a protective effect of breast milk against NEC [40] due to the bifidogenic nature of breast milk. In addition, studies have shown that the intestinal microbiome is strongly influenced by diet during infancy [29,41,42]. Further analysis of the influence of nutrition on the microbiome and in association with NEC was outside the scope of the current study design as the infants included in this study were fed a mix of human milk and infant formula. Future study designs that have the ability to investigate groups of infants who are fed a diet that is exclusive for human milk or infant formula will be best positioned to explore the influence of nutritional exposures on the acquisition and development of the preterm infant intestinal microbiome.",

While this is the largest such study reported to date, its major limitation remains a small sample size. Fluctuations in microbial content in this interval in life, and the nearly 7 week interval of life over which NEC occurred, further reduce our ability to compare cases and controls. Therefore, we recommend that caution should be taken in the calculation and interpretation of the statistics applied to the study. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to more fully describe the differences in the premature infant intestinal microbiome associated with NEC.",
