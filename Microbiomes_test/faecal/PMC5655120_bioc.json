Key aspects of the management program include supplementary feeding and translocation of k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d between different predator-free islands to optimize the genetic composition of the breeding populations. While these practices have helped boost the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d population, their impact on the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota is uncertain. Previous studies have found that the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d possesses a low-diversity fecal microbiota, typically dominated by Escherichia/Shigella spp. However, the question of whether the low diversity of the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota is an inadvertent consequence of human interventions has yet to be investigated. To that end, we used high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons obtained from fecal material of 63 k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d representing different diets, islands, and ages. Remarkably, neither supplementary feeding nor geographic location were associated with significant differences in the overall fecal microbial community structures of adult k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, suggesting that the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d's low-diversity fecal microbiota is both inherent to this species and robust to these external influences.",

As a result, scientifically-informed management practices, including supplementary feeding and relocation among different islands, have helped the population increase from a low point of 51 birds in 1995 (Powlesland et al., 2006) to nearly 160 as of late 2016. In an attempt to further aid conservation efforts, k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d research interests have recently expanded to the gut and fecal microbiota (Waite et al., 2012, 2013, 2014). Avian gut microbiotas are shaped by diet (Rubio et al., 1998; Torok et al., 2008; Janczyk et al., 2009; Hammons et al., 2010; Waite and Taylor, 2014) and can impact host health in diverse ways ranging from increased energy harvest from food (Torok et al., 2011) to modulation of the host immune system (Crhanova et al., 2011). Hence, greater understanding of the influence of diet and geography on the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota may contribute to improved management practices and disease prevention.",

Given that the supplementary food is made from grains, legumes, and seeds, whereas the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d's natural diet primarily consists of shoots, leaves, rhizomes, and (when available) podocarp fruit (Best, 1984; Cottam et al., 2006), we hypothesized that data generated from supplementally-fed birds might not reflect the natural state of the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota.

Fresh fecal samples from chicks were collected during the 2016 breeding season on Codfish Island and Anchor Island (45\u00b0 45\u2032 S, 166\u00b0 31\u2032 E). Codfish Island and Pearl Island harbor similar vegetation dominated by indigenous forests (Elliott et al., 2006), including podocarp trees such as rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum), miro (Prumnopitys ferruginea), and totara (Podocarpus totara) (Whitehead, 2007). In contrast, Maud Island contains pastures and a non-native pine plantation, along with some indigenous forest but no podocarps (Walsh et al., 2006). Anchor Island harbors beech (Nothofagus spp.), yellow silver pine (Lepidothamnus intermedius), and pink pine (Halocarpus biformis) in addition to the podocarp species found on Codfish Island (Department of Conservation, 2013). While a previous study (Waite et al., 2012) also included swab samples from the crop and choana of chicks, such samples are more difficult to access in adult k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, due to both anatomical differences between chicks and adults and the difficulty of safely restraining adults. Therefore, we did not pursue collection of crop or choana samples in this study in order to have a more consistent basis for comparison across chicks and adults.",

All subsequent steps of sequence processing were performed in QIIME 1.8.0 (Caporaso et al., 2010b). Following alignment of the representative sequences from each OTU against the Greengenes reference alignment version 13_8 (DeSantis et al., 2006) with PyNAST (Caporaso et al., 2010a), the representative sequences were assigned taxonomic classifications by calling the mothur na\u00efve Bayesian classifier (Wang et al., 2007; Schloss et al., 2009) and the RDP v14 reference taxonomy provided on the mothur wiki (www.mothur.org/wiki/RDP_reference_files).

Good's coverage was >0.96 for all samples, indicating that the majority of bacterial diversity had been captured. Alpha diversity metrics were somewhat higher than in Waite et al. (2014), with a mean Shannon diversity index of 1.98, Simpson's diversity index of 0.63, and Chao1 richness of 82.5, as compared to 0.95, 0.58, and 60.5 respectively, which may reflect the greater sampling depth. Nevertheless, these alpha diversity metrics remain lower than those reported for the fecal microbiota of other parrots such as budgerigars and cockatiels (Garcia-Mazcorro et al., 2017), as well as more distantly related avian species such as the emu (Bennett et al., 2013), chicken (Hou et al., 2016), hoatzin (Godoy-Vitorino et al., 2008), and various penguins (Dewar et al., 2013). Simpson's evenness was also low in our samples, with a mean value of 0.12, indicating that most samples were dominated by relatively few OTUs. Two OTUs identified as Escherichia/Shigella appeared in all samples. These were also the only OTUs to appear in >90% of samples. Intriguingly, the abundances of these two OTUs were highly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.96, p < 0.001), which could suggest that they share a cooperative relationship or similar ecological niches. Alternatively, it could be that the same Escherichia/Shigella genome possesses two divergent copies of the 16S rRNA gene (Acinas et al., 2004). Taken together, these results reinforce previous findings that the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d possesses an unusually low-diversity fecal microbiota of which Escherichia/Shigella is a characteristic member (Waite et al., 2014).",

Similarly, nMDS ordination revealed no obvious patterns related to diet, as the samples did not form separate clusters on the basis of diet classification (Figures 2B,C). HPC samples appeared to have the greatest dispersion, potentially implying greater inter-individual variation than within other diet groups; however, testing for homogeneity of dispersions with PERMDISP indicated that this difference was not significant (p > 0.05, Table S3). The Chao1 species richness metric and Simpson's evenness were similar for all diet groups (p > 0.05 for Pumpkin and Unfed referenced to HPC; Table S4, Figure S2). However, despite the lack of a significant difference in overall community structure between birds on different diets, LEfSe analysis indicated that one OTU\u2014OTU_156 (Clostridium XIVb)\u2014tended to be present in greater abundance in Unfed birds compared to birds on HPC or Pumpkin, although it was also highly abundant in a few birds on HPC (p = 0.022, LDA score = 2.214; Figure S3).",

This result contrasts with previous studies in which dietary supplements significantly affected the bacterial community composition of avian gut microbiotas (Rubio et al., 1998; Torok et al., 2008; Janczyk et al., 2009). However, those studies were carried out in domestic chickens, allowing for a more tightly controlled experimental setup than is possible with a wild, free-living bird. Moreover, studies on the gut microbiota of domestic chickens are routinely based on samples of intestinal tissue and gut contents rather than fecal material. Unlike those studies, we cannot examine whether changes occurred elsewhere in the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d gut microbiota that were not reflected in the fecal microbiota, as destructive sampling to obtain intestinal tissue or contents is not possible in such a critically endangered species.",

Together with the lack of a statistically significant difference between different diet groups in terms of overall community structure, this observation suggests that the inter-individual variation cannot be explained by the supplementary feeding regime. Unfortunately, to date, technical and logistical limitations have prevented accurate assessment of the types and quantities of natural foods consumed by individual k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, which could potentially account for the observed variation in fecal microbiota composition. Genetic differences between individuals might also contribute to differences in their fecal microbiota, as has been demonstrated in other species (Banks et al., 2009; Hall et al., 2017). An effort is currently underway to sequence the genomes of all living k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, which may help address this hypothesis.",

To our knowledge, the relationship between the diversity and stability of fecal microbiotas has not previously been investigated in birds; however, in humans, lower diversity of the fecal microbiota has been associated with decreased stability upon a change in dietary fiber intake (Tap et al., 2015). It is possible that the core members of the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota are more metabolically flexible than those of domestic chickens and humans and are therefore sufficient to utilize a variety of substrates. Indeed, Waite and Taylor (unpublished data) found that the dominant bacterial lineage in the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota (identified as Escherichia fergusonii) possesses genes for metabolizing both starch, which is a major component of the supplementary diets, and cellulose, which is the primary carbohydrate form in natural k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d foods (Toft and Wright, 2015). However, additional functional characterization of the enzymes encoded by these genes would be required to support this proposed explanation for the robustness of the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota to supplementary feeding.",

All adult samples were included regardless of diet, given the above finding that supplementary feeding had no significant effect on the overall composition of the fecal microbiota. As expected, the majority of both adult and chick samples were dominated by Escherichia/Shigella, with a smaller number containing a high proportion of Firmicutes such as Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, or Clostridia (Figure \u200b(Figure3A).3A). PERMANOVA of unweighted UniFrac distances initially suggested a significant effect of age on the overall fecal microbiota community structure (p = 0.0152, Table S2). However, after randomly subsampling down to one sample per individual 1000 times, we found that a significant p-value (< 0.05) was retained in only 60.6% of PERMANOVA trials (Table S5). The nMDS plot for unweighted UniFrac is consistent with these mixed statistical results, as adults and chicks clustered largely but not entirely separately (Figure \u200b(Figure3B).3B). For weighted UniFrac distances, on the other hand, neither PERMANOVA (p > 0.05, Table S2) nor nMDS ordination (Figure \u200b(Figure3C)3C) indicated any difference between adults and chicks. Overall, these results suggest that adults and chicks tend to share similar dominant taxa, and that while there may be differences in the presence of rarer taxa, these differences are not consistent.",

Species of Lactobacillus in particular commonly dominate the avian crop (Kiero\u0144czyk et al., 2016); thus, one possible explanation for the higher abundance of Lactobacillus in the chick fecal microbiota is that k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d chicks feed on pre-masticated food that presumably has been stored in the mother's crop (Cottam et al., 2006). However, despite the differential abundance of particular OTUs in adults vs. chicks, previous studies found no significant differences between adults and chicks in terms of overall community structure of the fecal microbiota (Waite et al., 2012, 2014). While our results were mixed, and therefore not necessarily inconsistent with the earlier studies, one likely explanation for the lack of any statistically significant overall difference in those studies despite OTU-level differences is the much smaller sample sizes\u2014three samples per age group in the 2012 study, and eight to 10 samples per age group in the 2014 study, compared to 52 adult samples and 27 chick samples in the present study.",

                    "text": "The lack of a significant difference between adult samples collected on Pearl Island and Codfish Island was not entirely unexpected, as both islands share similar vegetation. Maud Island, on the other hand, possesses distinct vegetation characteristics and lacks podocarp trees (Walsh et al., 2006), which are a favored food source for k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d when available (Cottam et al., 2006). The failure of samples from Maud Island to cluster separately in nMDS ordination plots therefore suggests that even though the natural food availability differed on that island, the microbial communities in our samples were more strongly shaped by factors unrelated to geography. Similar to these results, studies of wild neotropical songbirds, hummingbirds, and insectivorous birds, as well as Adelie penguins, found little evidence of a relationship between geographic distance and fecal microbiota composition (Banks et al., 2009; Hird et al., 2015). This is in contrast to a study of wild mice, in which the authors found that geographic location was the most significant factor contributing to inter-individual variation in gut microbiota composition, which they suggested could be due to neutral dispersal limitation among microbes (Linnenbrink et al., 2013). Based on the lack of a geographic signature in our study, neutral dispersal limitation does not appear to explain a significant proportion of the variance among adult k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiotas, although this is not surprising given that many k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d have been relocated at least once.",

The two groups visibly differed upon plotting the relative abundances of major taxonomic groups in their fecal microbiotas: representatives of the phylum Firmicutes were nearly absent from the Anchor Island samples, but accounted for a high proportion of sequences in several Codfish Island samples (Figure \u200b(Figure6A).6A). Indeed, in contrast to the results for adults on different islands, PERMANOVA of unweighted UniFrac distances for chicks indicated that samples collected on Anchor Island differed significantly from those collected on Codfish Island (p = 0.0022, Table S2), in accordance with the clustering apparent in the nMDS plot (Figure \u200b(Figure6B).6B). When we randomly subsampled down to one sample per individual 1,000 times to remove potential effects of pseudoreplication, PERMANOVA still returned a significant p-value (< 0.05) in 97.8% of the trials, which we interpret as reasonably strong evidence of a true difference in OTU membership between the two chick populations (Table S6).",

Importantly, PERMANOVA tends to lose power when used on unbalanced data sets in which the larger group has significantly greater dispersion (Anderson and Walsh, 2013). Using PERMDISP, we confirmed that the dispersions of samples from Codfish Island (n = 27, average deviation from group centroid = 0.167) were significantly larger than those of samples from Anchor Island (n = 12, average deviation from group centroid = 0.076) (p = 0.0254, Table S3). Thus, the failure to detect a significant difference based on weighted UniFrac distances may reflect the use of an overly conservative test. To our knowledge, alternatives to PERMANOVA that are robust in the face of unbalanced designs with heterogeneous dispersions have yet to be developed.",

Given that we also found differences in fecal microbiota composition between adults and chicks on Codfish Island, these results may suggest that the fecal microbiota of k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d chicks is more sensitive than that of adults to dietary and/or other environmental influences related to geographic location. One explanation that would be consistent with these results is that k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d chicks have a more restricted diet than that of adults, being fed almost exclusively on rimu fruit where available, or otherwise on supplementary food pellets, whereas adults generally consume a more diverse range of foods throughout the year (Best, 1984; Cottam et al., 2006). Thus, it would not be surprising if the fecal microbiota of chicks is more strongly tied to geographic location, and hence diet. Additionally, k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d chicks may have a less well-developed immune system than adults, as has been demonstrated in other avian species (Killpack et al., 2013), which could lead to greater susceptibility to invasions of environmental bacteria; such bacteria could differ between islands. However, as we lacked sufficient adult samples from Anchor to compare with those of Anchor chicks and Codfish adults, it remains unclear whether the fecal microbiota of k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d chicks is indeed shaped more strongly by dietary and/or other environmental influences, or if Anchor Island possesses unique characteristics that similarly affect the adult fecal microbiota.",

As these practices have played a key role in increasing k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d breeding success rates in recent years, this work underscores the relevance to conservation biology of understanding the microbiotas of endangered species. While our data do not rule out potential effects of differences in natural food consumption or genetic background, this apparent robustness to human interventions is remarkable in light of the low diversity of the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota and the well-known effects of diet on other vertebrate fecal microbiotas. Future investigations of the metabolic capacity of the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota may help shed light on the mechanisms underlying its robustness to supplementary feeding and geographic location. It will also be important to follow up on the chicks that were hatched on Anchor Island and Codfish Island, in order to determine whether the differences present at an early age persist into adulthood. Nevertheless, it appears that both low diversity and a consistent presence of Escherichia/Shigella are true hallmarks of the natural k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d fecal microbiota.",
