Microbiota profiles in fecal DNA were determined by Illumina sequencing and taxonomy of 16S rRNA genes. Estrogens were quantified in urine. Case-control comparisons employed linear and unconditional logistic regression of microbiota \u03b1-diversity (PD_whole tree) and UniFrac analysis of \u03b2-diversity, with two-sided statistical tests. Total estrogens correlated with \u03b1-diversity in control patients (Spearman Rho = 0.37, P = .009) but not case patients (Spearman Rho = 0.04, P = .77). Compared with control patients, case patients had statistically significantly altered microbiota composition (\u03b2-diversity, P = .006) and lower \u03b1-diversity (P = .004). Adjusted for estrogens and other covariates, odds ratio of cancer was 0.50 (95% confidence interval = 0.30 to 0.85) per \u03b1-diversity tertile. Differences in specific taxa were not statistically significant when adjusted for multiple comparisons. This pilot study shows that postmenopausal women with breast cancer have altered composition and estrogen-independent low diversity of their gut microbiota. Whether these affect breast cancer risk and prognosis is unknown.",

The gut microbiota modulates estrogen homeostasis through enterohepatic circulation, with large differences among individuals (12\u201316). The microbiota also modulates many other metabolic and immunologic pathways (17\u201319). Independent of estrogen levels, cancer risk is increased with metabolic syndrome through growth factors like insulin (20,21). Inflammation probably also contributes (22), as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was associated with a 20% to 30% reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in some studies, albeit with inconsistency by estrogen receptor (ER) tumor expression (23\u201329). Noting that gut microbial differences could affect breast cancer risk through several pathways, herein we tested the hypothesis that the gut microbiota of postmenopausal women with incident breast cancer, pretreatment, differs from control women.",

Microbiota profiles in fecal DNA were determined by amplification, Illumina sequencing, and taxonomy of 16S rRNA genes (34\u201338). Urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites (EMs) were quantified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (39). Microbiota alpha diversity was estimated as follows. Richness: number of unique species-level taxa, unadjusted for their relative abundances. Chao1: richness, but bias-corrected for rare (singleton, doubleton) taxa. Phylogenetic diversity (PD)_whole tree: sum of the branch lengths of a phylogenetic tree constructed from all taxa in the sample. Shannon index: a conservative estimate that adjusts for relative abundance of each taxon and that is defined as (negative) the sum over taxa of the product of the relative abundance of each taxon times the natural logarithm of its relative abundance. Estrogen associations with microbiota alpha diversity were tested by Spearman rank-order correlation. Alpha diversity associations with case-control status were tested by linear and unconditional logistic regression, with adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), and total estrogens. Composition of the microbiota (beta diversity) was compared by unweighted and weighted UniFrac analysis of the distance matrix with 10 000 permutations (40). All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Detailed methods can be found in the Supplementary Materials (available online).",

The novel implication of our current study is that breast cancer was statistically significantly associated with other functions of the gut microbiota, unrelated to systemic estrogen levels. Low gut microbial diversity occurs with adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, leukocytosis, and elevated C-reactive protein (17), some of which are associated with breast cancer (20,42\u201347).",

In both mice and people, microbiota composition is acquired directly from the mother during birth (48\u201353). The distinct microbiota of adults who were born by cesarean vs vaginal delivery (54), as well as the similarity of microbial composition within adult dizygotic twin pairs (55\u201357), implies that composition is stable for decades. Breast cancer risk is affected by obscure early-life effects that also are transmitted through the maternal line (3). Such maternal effects could reflect differences in systemic estrogens, but genetic determinants of estrogen levels have been inconsistent (58\u201360). We postulate an effect for maternal transmission of the microbiota.",

Estrogen parameters were correlated with microbiota alpha diversity, although only in control patients (16,33). Our case-control design is another important weakness, precluding exclusion of reverse causality\u2014that cancer caused the microbiota distinction. To minimize this possibility, our case patients received only an outpatient breast biopsy, no surgical or systemic therapy prior to specimen collection. Excluding case patients who reported antibiotic exposure, perhaps biopsy-related, had no major impact on the microbiota associations.",
