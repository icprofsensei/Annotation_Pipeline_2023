Enhanced urine culture techniques have provided clear evidence that FUM microbes are alive; unlike standard urine culture protocols, these enhanced culture techniques provide the appropriate conditions for growth for a wide range of microbes [6, 8]. The living microbial community within the female bladder may provide insight into a variety of common urinary disorders, including urinary incontinence and urinary tract infections. The presence and response to urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) treatment appears related to FUM diversity and/or composition in adult women with UUI [2, 9]. There is also an association between the FUM and risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) following urinary tract surgery [10] or instrumentation [5, 11]. However, there is a lack of information regarding the FUM of adult women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The two most common forms of bothersome urinary incontinence (UUI and SUI) often coexist in adult women, especially those seeking surgical treatment for SUI. Information concerning the FUM has the potential to further develop the phenotype of adult women affected by urinary incontinence, with the hope of improving the targeting of treatment in order to improve overall outcomes.",

The V4 region is ~250 bp, ideal for MiSeq sequence technology (Illumina), and sufficient to classify most bacteria to the family or genus level [15\u201318]. DNA isolation was performed in a laminar flow hood to avoid contamination. Genomic DNA was extracted from 1 ml of urine, using validated protocols [2, 6, 19]. The V4 region was amplified by a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using modified universal primers 515F and 806R, as described [2, 6]. Extraction negative controls (no urine) and PCR negative controls (no template) were included to assess contribution of extraneous DNA from reagents. Final PCR products were purified from unincorporated nucleotides and primers using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and Agencourt AMPure XP-PCR magnetic beads (Beckman coulter). Purified samples were normalized to equal DNA concentration, as determined by Nanodrop spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The sample library and PhiX sequencing control library (Illumina) were denatured and added to the 2x250 bp sequencing reagent cartridge, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Illumina).",

Using mothur\u2019s built-in average-linkage clustering algorithm, the cleaned high-quality sequences were clustered into species level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on the commonly used 97% similarity cutoff, resulted in 2579 and 3082 OTUs for replicas 1 and 2, respectively. We used the resultant OTU count table and the R package vegan [23, 24] to determine the Chao1 richness estimate, Pielou evenness index, and Shannon diversity index, which accounts for both richness and evenness, two measures of microbial diversity. Richness is a measure of the total number of unique taxa within a given individual, but does not take into account the distribution of those taxa. In contrast, evenness is a measure of distribution, or equality of representation, of taxa within an environment.

Richness, as estimated by Chao1, was significantly associated only with urine pH (p=0.03). In contrast, richness and evenness, as measured together by the Shannon index, were significantly associated with MESA urge index score (p=0.04), BMI (p=0.02) and hormonal status (p<0.001) (Table 3). For a 10% increase in MESA urge index score, the Shannon index increased by 0.03 units (p=0.04). On average, a 10-unit increase in BMI was associated with a 0.1-unit increase in Shannon diversity (p=0.02). Post-menopausal women not on exogenous hormones had a Shannon index 0.23 units higher than did pre-menopausal women (p=0.004).",

A similar relationship was observed between microbial evenness and both hormone status and BMI. The clinical impact of these findings is significant, given the common coexistence of UUI in women who undergo surgical SUI treatment. While considerable uncertainly persists about the effect of SUI surgery on pre-existing UUI symptoms and each individual patient\u2019s risk of developing de novo UUI symptoms following SUI surgery, the microbiota may provide useful information for clinical phenotyping of patients prior to surgery. Without comparison to an age and hormone-status matched continent control group, we cannot conclude that women with \u201cpure\u201d SUI are like continent women. However, it does appear the presence and characteristics (i.e. evenness) of the FUM relate to UUI in this clinically relevant cohort of women undergoing SUI surgery. Our findings will require further research to validate and clarify the physiological mechanisms.",

These results suggest that predominance (most often by Lactobacillus species) is typical of hormone-positive women and that loss of that predominance might be associated with UUI symptoms. Increased microbial diversity, in particular community evenness, positively correlated with UUI and BMI symptoms, but not with SUI symptoms. BMI is considered a contributing factor to urgency symptoms [25], and the FUM of UUI women have been reported to be associated with BMI [2].

The study has limitations associated with the cross-sectional study design. The study would have benefitted from controls matched for age, BMI and estrogen status, paired vaginal samples and/or longitudinal sampling, further details regarding hormone status, a higher proportion of participant samples, increased proportion of catheterized specimens and concurrent enhanced urine cultures [6]. Also, the known relationship between estrogen status and aging may mask a biological relationship that is rightfully attributed to only one of these variables. A larger study that includes women with various forms of urinary incontinence and matched controls will be needed.",
