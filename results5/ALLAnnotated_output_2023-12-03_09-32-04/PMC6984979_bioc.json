Modern immunosuppression and antimicrobial prophylaxis has reduced acute allograft losses, but long-term fibrotic changes over the lifespan of the allograft have persisted1. Much research has been conducted to elucidate causative factors in the development of CAD. The microbiome of transplant recipients is increasingly studied as a factor associated with CAD. The gut microbiome in allograft recipients has been studied, both to quantify alterations in normal gut flora following immunosuppressive therapies2\u20134 as well as the effects of microbiome alterations on immune function, though these studies have looked at mouse models5 or non-transplant human cohorts6. Alterations in the normal gut microbiome have been shown to stimulate intestinal innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and inflammation7. Conversely, absence of regulatory T cells in mice was associated with increased Th2-type inflammation as well as alterations in microbiota, suggesting that chronic inflammation can result in dysbiosis8. Thus, the relationship between the microbiome and the transplanted host appears to be bidirectional8,9.",

Once felt to be a sterile body site, there is increasing knowledge of the composition of the urinary microbiome in healthy hosts10\u201313. Alterations in the urinary microbiome have been explored in a variety of lower urinary tract disorders such as urinary incontinence, interstitial cystitis, urologic cancers, and chronic prostatitis10, but little is yet known about urinary microbiome alterations in renal allograft dysfunction. Quantification of the urinary microbiome in renal allograft recipients has been performed in small cohorts14,15 and dysregulation of the microbiome has been associated with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA)16. However, to our knowledge, the urinary microbiome has not been studied in CAD prior to IFTA development. We hypothesized that CAD is associated with alterations in the urinary microbiome in renal transplant recipients. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case-control analysis of urine microbiome from kidney allograft recipients with and without CAD using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) V4 microbial sequences for bacteria as well as Internal Transcribed Spacer rRNA (ITS1 and ITS2 rRNA) region for fungi.",

Once it was determined that there were significant differences between the cases and controls, we analyzed male versus female cases of CAD. Mean Shannon diversity index for male cases was 4.9\u00b10.6 and for female cases was 4.1\u00b10.7 (Monte Carlo permuted two sample t-test; p=0.002) Mean Chao1 index for male cases was 243.93\u00b142.72 and for female cases was 217.55\u00b162.06 (Monte Carlo permuted two sample t-test; p=0.183) (Supplemental Figure 8). Despite a higher mean Shannon index for male cases, the calculated equitability (a measure of homogeneity within the sample) was higher in males (82.5%) compared with females (95%), reflecting a more homogenous male urinary microbiome compared to female cases. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac revealed significant grouping comparing male vs female cases (ANOSIM; p=0.007) (Supplemental Figure 5).",

Out of 67 patients, a total of 31 patients were on tacrolimus while the remainders were on cyclosporine (two patients were not on any calcineurin inhibitor). We grouped these patients into high (\u22651.4) and low (<1.4) tacrolimus groups based on their dose-normalized levels. There were no significant differences in Shannon diversity or beta diversity indices observed between these groups. However, by LEfSe, class Clostridia emerged as a significant taxon abundant in the low dose-normalized tacrolimus group. With Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA testing, genera Actinomyces (p=0.008) and Anaerococcus (p=0.02) were identified as more abundant in low tacrolimus dose-normalized level group (Supplemental Figure 9).",

Corynebacterium was the only genus found in greater abundance in cases when compared with controls, but there were a number of OTUs that showed a trend toward different abundance in cases versus controls. Using Kruskal-Wallis testing, 21 distinct OTUs were identified, and LEfSe analysis identified 22 distinct OTUs. Within both analytic frameworks, Corynebacterium was highlighted as a significantly prevalent genus in the microbiome of cases. The same analyses using only female patients also showed Corynebacterium emerging as a significant genus in cases proving that despite the sex differences, this genus has an association with CAD. While we were unable to identify Corynebacterium to the species level based on our alignment, there are Corynebacterium species that are found in the urine in addition to the skin (including C.urealyticum) that have been associated with indwelling catheters and can be pathogenic in humans38.",

                    "text": "Our research is, to our knowledge, the first to analyze the urinary microbiome of transplant recipients with early CAD, as well as the first to highlight the fungal species present in the urinary microbiome in patients with graft dysfunction. Lee et al2 investigated kidney transplant recipients found to have AR but the authors examined the gut microbiome rather than urine. The work of Modena, Salomon, and colleagues16 studied the urinary microbiome as a marker for kidney allograft dysfunction, but all of these patients had already developed the irreversible changes of IFTA (scored moderate to severe by 2007 Banff criteria). Based on index biopsy data, the prevalence of moderate to severe IFTA in our cohort was less than in Salomon\u2019s cohort (see Table 2B); greater than 80% of our allograft biopsies (cases as well as controls) were scored at 0 or 1 by Banff criteria for interstitial fibrosis. Thus, changes in the urinary microbiome may precede development of IFTA and their identification may allow for earlier detection of allograft dysfunction or risk development of severe fibrosis. Of transplanted patients with IFTA in the Saloman cohort, their findings noted a non-significant decrease in female Lactobacillus prevalence (compared with healthy females) and a significant increase in Streptococcus in males with IFTA compared to healthy or unaffected transplanted males. Fricke et al 15 studied various body site microbiota post-transplantation and found genera Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus to be dominant in \u201chealthy\u201d subjects post-transplantation. Dominant genera outlined in each of these studies (including ours) have some overlap \u2013 namely, Lactobacillus in females and Pseudomonas as well as other Proteobacteria subgenera in males \u2013 but also exhibit distinct genera. We feel these variations between each of these study cohorts highlight the need for larger prospective studies designed to evaluate the urinary microbiome throughout the course of transplantation \u2013 pre-transplant, immediately post-transplant, and as CAD develops \u2013 to identify the \u201cnormal\u201d post-transplantation urinary microbiome and assess alterations that may be associated with development of graft dysfunction.",

Using this knowledge, restricting controls to female participants minimized the risk of undersampling normal flora in male control patients. An interesting finding in our patient population was the proportion of cases with no calculated panel reactive antibodies (cPRA) at the time of transplantation compared with controls.

                    "text": "One limitation in the general study of the urinary microbiome is the inability to perform causal experimentation in mouse models. Human microbiota-associated (HMA) mice have been used to study gut flora, but no such model exists associating mouse urine with the human urinary microbiome. Thus, it is unclear whether changes in the urinary microbiome associated with CAD in patients are only a consequence or may also be a cause of CAD. Nevertheless, the identification of changes in the cases\u2019 urinary microbiome that occur well before development of advanced IFTA suggests that longitudinal analyses of the urine microbiome may be useful as part of a biomarker panel to detect allograft damage and predict CAD development. Our sample size is smaller and was not designed to be a prospective trial, and thus no baseline urine samples were collected prior to transplantation or in the immediate post-transplantation period. Now that we have established that there is a difference in the urinary microbiome of CAD patients, future studies will be designed prospectively with larger cohorts and baseline urine sampling to not only facilitate comparisons between groups, but even within an individual throughout the post-transplantation course. Another limitation of this study is the potential for skin and vaginal flora to contaminate our sample collection. Several Corynebacterium species are known skin and mucosal commensals and others are known to cause urinary tract infections, but the significant incidence increase in cases suggests their presence is due to more than simple contamination. All patients were instructed by study coordinators on proper clean-catch technique for urine sampling, and this would have minimized skin flora contamination as in other urine microbiome studies with similar outlined protocols16. Our study initially set out to identify both bacterial and fungal signatures in the cohort. However, the fungal results were not revealing, due in part to low numbers of OTUs aligning with existing mycobiome libraries, but further study with ongoing development of a more robust ITS1/2 database may shine light onto this arena. Additional studies into the mycobiome would be of interest, as we would expect opportunistic fungal organisms to be more abundant in transplant recipients. There may also be differences in the mycobiome between patients with varying levels of immunosuppression. Lastly, this study was funded as a supplement to the existing cohort studies specifically to evaluate sex differences in post-transplantation data and thus only female participants were recruited as controls.",

It is thought that alterations in microbiota are both reflections of and drivers for changes conferred by allotransplantation and immunosuppression, and there is increasing understanding of the alterations in adaptive immune responses conferred by changes in the microbiota following immunosuppression7,9,42\u201344. How individual microbial communities interplay with the immune system to modulate the risk of various diseases is only starting to be investigated, but it is becoming increasingly clear that dysbiosis may be associated with chronic inflammatory conditions. For example, there are multiple animal models in which immune tolerance to transplanted organs is prevented by inflammatory stimuli from bacteria45\u201347,45\u201347. Such infections appear to stimulate the innate immune system that enhances alloreactivity in a bystander manner and switches the balance from regulatory to effector immune responses7,48\u201351. Moreover, certain intestinal commensal communities, but not others, can enhance alloreactivity and accelerate skin graft rejection when transferred orally into germ-free mice51, demonstrating a different impact on allograft outcome of different commensal community structures. The microbiome is clearly not merely a passive marker of an underlying process, though how the urinary microbiome may affect local or systemic immune responses is not yet known. In summary, the urinary microbiome holds significant potential in the ongoing quest to identify a microbial signature associated with CAD in transplant recipients.",
