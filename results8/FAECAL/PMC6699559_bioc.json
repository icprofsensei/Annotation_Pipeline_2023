Chinese immigrant children in Australia with matched Chinese children in China are a relatively homogeneous population, yet living in an industrialized or non-industrialized environment.

Linear regression was used to investigate the associations of bacterial relative abundance and AC/CC groups, after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, breastfeeding percentage, and antibiotic usage. If the taxa that show a change in abundance in AC children relative to CC children play a role in the occurrence of allergic conditions, we expect that these taxa will show a similar change in children with allergic conditions compared to children without allergic conditions. To examine such trend, we selected taxa with significant differences (at two significance levels: p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.05 and p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.01) in relative abundance between AC and CC children at 5 taxonomic levels (phylum, class, order, family, and genus). Subsequently the mean difference of taxa abundance between children with positive and negative allergic conditions (atopy, food allergy, and wheezing) was calculated in AC children, and those with mean difference over 0.01% and 0.1% were selected for further analysis respectively. If the mean relative abundance of a bacterium is higher or lower in AC children (compared to CC children) and also higher or lower in children with allergic conditions (compared to children without allergic conditions), a \u201c1\u201d was assigned to the bacterium, otherwise a \u201c0\u201d was assigned. A new variable with these binomial values (1 and 0) was created for all the selected taxa and used to test for consistency using a binomial probability test. The null hypothesis for the binomial probability tests is that the proportion of 0 (inconsistent) or 1 (consistent) is equal to 50% which indicates that there is no consistent trend. We used this consistency test of the major distinct taxa to infer the influence of the western environment on the human microbiome and its relation with allergic conditions.

This indicates that the trend is inverse, an increase in abundance of the fecal taxa in AC children corresponds to a decrease in these taxa in children with food allergy or wheezing.

We hypothesized that the Australian environment has modified the human microbiome in Chinese immigrant children (microbiome modification by the western environment), thereby leading to more allergy in AC children (the western microbiome causing allergy). Consistent with the first part of our hypothesis, we found significant differences in microbial diversity, composition, and functional pathway expression in both OP and fecal microbiota between Chinese children living in Australia and China. We designed the study to measure significant differences in the microbiome between AC and CC children, rather than identifying specific taxa associated with allergic conditions in the population. To examine the hypothesis of the western microbiome relating to allergy we investigated if the change in relative abundance of taxa in AC children (compared to CC children) is also apparent in children with allergic conditions (relative to children without allergies) among the AC population to examine the hypothesis of the western microbiome relating to allergy. Such a consistent trend was significant (>50%) for food allergy and wheezing in the OP microbiome. This means that OP taxa which increase/decrease in the western environment are likely to show the same increase/decrease in children with food allergy and wheezing. In contrast, we found that such trend was significantly lower than 50% for fecal samples with these two phenotypes. fecal taxa which increase/decrease in the western environment likely show an opposite effect, namely decrease/increase, in children with food allergy or wheezing. Conceivably, the environment of upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract are very different, and the way the microbial component interacts with the immune system differs considerably. The gut has numerous immunogenic regions, where microbial elements interact rapidly with regulatory T cells.18 The segmented filamentous bacteria have the function of promoting intestinal T helper type (Th17) responses.19 Therefore, the mechanism of interaction could be very different between the two sites as is the diversity and taxonomic groups in those two distinct areas.",

Children with food allergy and wheezing may have a changed immune status that changes the abundance of taxa. This may partly explain the inverse trend mentioned above. We think that the observed trends are unlikely to be false findings as they are consistently significant in all 4 analyses. Our study shows that western oropharyngeal and gut microbial flora are associated with allergic conditions in Chinese immigrant children. More studies are required to clarify the opposite trend that is observed for OP and gut microbiomes with food allergy and wheezing in industrialized countries.",

Lynch et\u00a0al. reported that healthy children were exposed to richer and more diverse bacterial communities in the first year of life, compared to those children that developed either atopy or recurrent wheeze.20 Another recent study compares the prevalence of asthma between Amish and Hutterites schoolchildren (similar genetic ancestries and lifestyle). It revealed that Amish children, living on a traditional farm, have been exposed to a more enriched microbiota environment and demonstrate low rate of asthma, compared to Hutterites children whose farming practice is industrialized.21 There is emerging evidence that the environmental influence (environmental microbiomes) on shaping human microbiomes is a key element in tuning immune system and development of allergy. Several studies have shown that a reduced diversity of the human microbiome may be a risk for asthma and allergy.22 A low microbial diversity in early infancy can potentially predict atopic dermatitis.23 A longitudinal study demonstrated a lower oral bacterial diversity among children who developed allergic disease, particularly asthma at an age of 7 years.24 There are different indexes that estimate microbial diversity such as the Chao1 index as a richness estimator and the Shannon index for the bacterial evenness.25 In our study both OP and fecal samples in AC children had a lower Chao1 index but a higher Shannon index. This indicates that the western environment has shaped the microbiome to have less richness and more evenness. In another population comparison study it was found that the alpha-diversity of the fecal microbiome (Chao1 and Shannon indexes) was higher in African children (non-industrialized) compared to those of European (industrialized environment like Australia) children.26 The findings of these studies are largely consistent with our study. Microbial diversity variations in the human microbiome related to the western environment may provide a mechanistic explanation for the allergy epidemic in the past 60 or 70 years.",

The genus Streptococcus (Firmicutes), a Gram-positive bacterium, has the largest abundance in both AC and CC children in OP samples but in a significantly higher proportion among AC children compared to CC children. Studies have shown that Streptococcus is associated with allergic symptoms. A 234 children cohort study revealed that early colonization of Streptococcus in the nasopharyngeal microbiota was a strong predictor for asthma during the first year of life, and its colonization was linked to atopy by the age of two years and chronic wheeze at age five.27 Similarly, another study of neonatal oropharynx bacteria showed that a high burden of Streptococcus within the first month of life increased the risk for recurrent wheeze and asthma development.28 That the gut microbiota is critical for immune development has been well documented.29 The majority of genera that showed a significantly higher abundance in AC children compared to CC children were in the class Clostridia of phylum Firmicutes. Interestingly, a recent study found that the same class and phylum were enriched in fecal microbiome of food-allergic children compared to siblings and healthy children, but other Clostridium species were enriched in non-food-allergic subjects.30 Class Clostridia has been associated with immune tolerance in mouse models of allergy and aids protection from allergic inflammation.31 Our inverse association between the western fecal microbiome and food allergy and wheezing partly supports the association of the class Clostridia with food allergy reported in the literature.",

To Chinese migrants, the change to a western environment is the combination of a different diet, less air pollution, exposure to new allergens and, greater hygiene, all of which can lead to different microbiota composition/diversity, and contribute to the increased allergies in AC children.33, 34 However, in this study we could only focus on the overall influence of a western environment on the microbiome and the relation with allergy. Thirdly, recent antibiotic usages are known to have a significant impact on the human microbiome. Antibiotic use during the two-week period prior to the recruitment was 3 to 4 times more common in CC than in AC children. The disparity of antibiotic use in the two population may confound the findings in this study. Unfortunately, we did not collect a detailed history of antibiotic use in this population. In addition, the resolution of 16s rRNA sequencing is reliable down to the genus level. Studies utilizing whole-genome sequencing or real-time PCR, are of interest to further investigate the species and strains of bacteria that are different between the industrialized and non-industrialized environment, as well as to understand how the western microbiome shapes the immune system, leading to the development of asthma and allergy. Moreover, a comparison of microbiota and allergies present before and after immigration is worthy of investigating for future study.",
