The results of these studies showed very little overlap, probably due to the complexity and variability of the gut microbiome composition. This already starts at the beginning of fecal sampling collection. Differences in collecting methods of these samples or differences in DNA extraction techniques could already lead to differences in results [10]. On top of that, different sequencing techniques were used in these studies; two of them used tag sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to determine the gut microbiota composition and one study used metagenomics sequencing. Furthermore, over a 100 factors have been identified to be of influence of the gut microbiome composition [11]. In order to make different studies comparable to one another, the same factors should be taken into account. Thus, genome-microbiome associations should be assessed with caution and replication of gene-microbiome associations is certainly warranted [12].",

The microbiome taxonomy was determined by operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking using QIIME and Usearch (V.7.0.1090) based on similarity of 97%, and Greengenes (V.13.8) was used as a reference database [5]. This led to the identification of 12,556 OTUs. Samples with less than 10,000 counts were removed. In comparison with the discovery paper, the OTUs were filtered based on availability in at least 10 percent of the samples. Lastly, these OTUs were classified into 250 different taxa by summing the read counts and transform them into relative abundances. The codes used for these analyses are publicly available at:",

Overall microbiome composition (beta diversity) was assessed by Bray-Curtis, Jensen-Shannon, Jaccard unweighted Unifrac and weighted Unifrac measurements. Associations between the SLC39A8 [Thr]391 risk allele and the overall composition of the gut microbiome were estimated by calculating the proportion of variance explained by the mutation on the different beta diversity distance matrix, using a PERMANOVA test as implemented in the adonis function of the vegan package in R [16]. Additionally, we analysed the alpha diversity by calculating the Shannon, Chao1 and Simpson index as well as the number of observed species per sample using vegan and phyloseq R packages. Differences in alpha diversity between carriers and non-carriers were analysed through the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.

For patients with CD and UC, the amount of years having the diagnosis IBD was also added as a covariate in the linear models. All analyses were corrected for multiple testing by using the false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini Hochberg method) incorporated in the Q-package in R. An FDR of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. In the discovery papers, only analyses in individual OTUs correcting for less confounding factors was performed [13]. In this study, we corrected for more factors, to prevent identifying false-positives by the influence of confounding factors.",

Smoking is defined as current smoker at time of faecal sampling. Active disease is defined as a score of higher than 4 of the Harvey-Bradshaw index (disease severity measure for CD) or a score higher than 2.5 of the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (disease severity measure for UC). There were no statistically significant differences between carriers and non-carriers of the SLC39A8 missense variant and the clinical characteristics in the described groups (Table 1). We did identify a trend in which carriers of the missense variant have had longer the diagnosis IBD at time of faecal sampling than non-carriers in patients with CD (means of 15 vs 12 years, P = 0.066, as depicted in Table 1). Therefore, we took this factor into account in the analyses of the gene-microbiome interaction. Patients with CD were more often carriers of the SLC39A8 risk allele than HC (OR = 2.1, P = 0.01).

This provides an increased power in order to detect true associations between carriers and microbial changes. The SLC39A8 gene is known as a transporter of Zinc [17]. Zinc deficiency has been associated before with a boost of inflammatory responses and with the increase of oxidative stress, indicating the role of Zinc in immune functions [18,19]. The role of Zinc has also been studied in the context of IBD, in which an in vitro study has shown that Zinc affects the integrity of the intestinal mucosa [20]. In our previous study we have shown multiple factors to be associated with the gut microbiome composition in the context of IBD [5]. Given the large effects of the missense variant on the gut microbiome composition observed by the discovery paper, the association of the missense variant to Crohn\u2019s disease and the role of Zinc on the immune system, we hypothesized that this missense variant could also be of influence in the altered gut microbiome composition in IBD we observed earlier [5,13,17\u201320].",

Therefore, it is very hard to determine if the reported results are indeed positive findings or false positive results. It seems that on top of filtering the minimum prevalence of each taxon (done at 10% in discovery and replication cohort), filtering for minimum abundance of each OTU could reduce the amount of variation between cohorts but also reduce the amount of potentially false positive associations. However, the observed differences between our study and the discovery paper could also be due to the different experimental design [13]. The discovery paper used mucosal lavage samples while the presented study uses faecal content. Although both methods target the same ecosystem, the gut microbiota, different collection methods as well as the use of intestinal preparation for the mucosal lavage can introduce significant changes in the proportion of microbes characterized [21]. In addition, we should also consider the possibility that the findings are cohort specific due to geographical and cultural differences. Furthermore, some extra variation could be introduced by discrepancies in the computational processing and analyses of the samples. Finally, the effect of individual OTUs could be biologically that small, that these effects cannot be detected in alpha and beta diversity.",

One example of these associations are the one between CD and the increased abundance of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
