Butyrate improves the intestinal barrier by facilitating tight-junction assembly [8], suppresses inflammatory and allergic responses by inducing differentiation of colonic regulatory T cells [9], regulates cell apoptosis [10], and stimulates production of anorectic hormones [11]. Indeed, reduced concentrations of butyrate have been associated with the incidence of graft-versus-host disease [12, 13], kwashiorkor [14], colon cancer [15], and obesity [11].

Here, we report on the impact of dietary supplementation with resistant starch (unmodified potato starch; RS type 2) on fecal butyrate concentrations and composition of the gut microbiota in 20 healthy young adults. RS consists of starch that is resistant to hydrolysis by human enzymes and passes through the small intestine unabsorbed. In the large intestine, RS can be metabolized and then fermented by microbes to a variety of products, including butyric acid [16]. In this study, we find that the response to RS supplementation varies between individuals in ways that can be explained, at least in part, by variation in the composition of their microbiota. Recognizing inter-individual variability in responses to fiber supplementation and determining the microbiota characteristics that underlie it are essential first steps towards personalized plans for managing gut microbiomes for desirable functionality, including the production of butyrate.",

Eight external standards (0.1\u201320\u00a0mM) for acetic, propionic, and butyric acids were used to generate the standard curve. These standards were run after every 100 samples. LC Solutions Software (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD) was used to curate the data and calculate concentrations based on the standard curve generated during the run.

This revealed that fecal butyrate and acetate concentrations increased with RS intake in the study population (p\u2009<\u20090.05). For all subsequent analyses, the median value of butyrate for each person before and during RS consumption was used so that the number of samples compared was not artificially inflated. Paired or unpaired t tests were employed as appropriate. To determine if RS intake altered microbial community composition, a permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) analysis was conducted with the Bray-Curtis similarity index. Each individual was used as the blocking factor to account for repeated measures of microbiota composition from each individual. This analysis revealed that RS intake altered the composition of gut microbiota in the study population (p\u2009<\u20090.05). For further analyses, we used the median abundance of each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in each individual before and during RS consumption. To identify specific OTUs that had changed with RS consumption, LEfSe and Random Forest analyses were performed for each individual separately (comparing their four samples before and four samples during RS consumption). LEfSe [21] was implemented within mothur using the correction for multiple comparisons.

This conclusion was corroborated by results from a PERMANOVA analysis to determine if RS supplementation altered the composition of microbiota in the overall study population.

We therefore looked for correlations between features of the microbiota and butyrate concentrations in subsets of participants that had similar responses in fecal butyrate following RS supplementation. The study population was separated into three groups using k-means clustering based on butyrate concentrations before and during RS. An elbow plot [22] revealed that there were three \u201cclusters\u201d. The categories identified were enhanced, high, and low (Fig.\u00a03a, b). The concentration of butyrate in the \u201cenhanced\u201d group (n\u2009=\u200911) increased significantly following consumption of RS (from 9 to 15\u00a0mmol/kg wet feces, paired t test p\u2009=\u20090.0003). Individuals in the \u201chigh\u201d group (n\u2009=\u20093) maintained butyrate concentrations \u226511\u00a0mmol/kg wet feces during the course of the study. Individuals in the \u201clow\u201d group (n\u2009=\u20096) had less than or equal to 8\u00a0mmol butyrate/kg wet feces both before and during RS (paired t test p\u2009=\u20090.14; Fig.\u00a03c).",

Random Forest revealed OTU #7 as the most prominent feature of the microbiota distinguishing the low from the enhanced group (Table\u00a03). Sequences within this OTU are identical to those from Bifidobacterium adolescentis. The relative abundance of this OTU before RS was similar in all three groups (~0.7\u20131.4\u00a0%; t test p\u2009>\u20090.27; Fig.\u00a04a). However, the enhanced and high groups had dramatically higher abundances of this OTU during RS (average 8.9\u00a0% in enhanced and 7.8\u00a0% in high; p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a04a). The abundance of this OTU did not change in the low group (average before RS\u2009=\u20091.5\u00a0%, average during\u2009=\u20093.7\u00a0%, p\u2009=\u20090.13). This finding was further corroborated with a LEfSe analyses comparing four samples before to four during RS consumption for each individual. As one would expect, the abundance of OTU 7 increased in 8 out of 11 individuals in the enhanced group, 2 out of 3 individuals in the high group, but in only 2 out of 6 individuals in the low group (LEfSe p\u2009<\u20090.05 correcting for multiple comparisons).",

OTU #7 in which sequences were identical to the 16S rRNA encoding gene of B. adolescentis was detected in 14 out of 20 total individuals and increased in abundance in 12 individuals. This OTU did not increase in individuals U026 and U024 (LEfSe p\u2009>\u20090.05 correcting for multiple comparisons). However, OTU #7 [B. adolescentis] was not detected in six individuals. In these individuals, LEfSe was used to find other OTUs that increased in abundance during RS supplementation, since these could be RS-degrading bacteria. In three individuals in whom B. adolescentis sequences did not increase, OTU 19 increased in abundance (LEfSe p\u2009<\u20090.05 correcting for multiple comparisons). Sequences in that OTU are identical to Ruminococcus bromii, another group of RS-degrading bacteria [23]. In individual U005, neither B. adolescentis nor R. bromii increased in abundance with RS. A potential candidate for a RS-degrading organism in this individual is OTU 50, whose average abundance increased from 2.6 to 7.1\u00a0% albeit not statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.29). Sequences in this OTU are most closely related to Ruminiclostridium [Eubacterium] siraeum. This organism has not been reported to degrade RS, but it is in the same taxonomic family as R. bromii.",

Sequences within this OTU are identical to E. rectale\u2014a known and prominent butyrogenic microbe in human guts [24]. E. rectale was more abundant in individuals in the high group than in the other two groups\u2014both before and during RS (Fig.\u00a05b). While individuals in the high group fall into a very distinct cluster in the k-means clustering (Fig.\u00a03), there are only three individuals in this group. This limited sample size does constrain the strength of the finding that E. rectale is more abundant in the high group vs. the other two groups. Some individuals in the enhanced group exhibited increases in abundances of E. rectale during RS supplementation (Fig.\u00a05a, LEfSe p\u2009<\u20090.05 correcting for multiple comparisons), but in general, its abundance did not change as a result of RS addition to diet in any of the three groups (Fig.\u00a05b). We looked specifically at other butyrogenic organisms known to be present in the human colon such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [25]. An OTU with the same V4 16S-rRNA encoding gene sequence as F. prausnitzii was present at about 3\u20136\u00a0% relative abundance in all three groups, but did not change with RS in any of the groups (t test p\u2009>\u20090.15). Since B. adolescentis\u2014the prominent RS-degrading microbe in our cohort\u2014produces lactate as the primary fermentation product, we also investigated if organisms known to produce butyrate from lactate increased in abundance. OTUs in which sequences were most closely related to Eubacterium halii and Anaerostipes caccae were present at less than 0.4\u00a0% abundance in our cohort and did not change with RS (paired t test p\u2009=\u20090.4).",

In this cohort, the average ratios of acetate:propionate:butyrate before and during RS supplementation were 58:25:15 and 58:22:20, respectively. These ratios agree well with previously documented ratios of ~60:20:20\u00a0in human feces [26\u201329]. In response to RS supplementation, the concentration of fecal butyrate increased from 8 to 12\u00a0mmol/kg wet feces in the overall study population (repeated measures ANOVA p\u2009=\u20090.02). The inter-individual variation in butyrate concentrations before and during RS was striking (Fig.\u00a02). Most previous studies with RS have documented only population-wide response in butyrate concentrations [16], while one other study reported considerable heterogeneity between individuals in regard to fecal butyrate concentrations [30]. This pronounced inter-individual variability suggests that a single approach to improving beneficial functions from the microbiome is unlikely to be universally successful. Rather, personalized approaches may be needed to manage microbiomes for health. In line with this endeavor, we attempted to identify features in the microbiota that could explain different responses to dietary supplementation with RS.",

Weak relationships were identified between butyrate concentrations before RS and the abundances of OTU 4 (E. rectale). Random Forest failed to reveal any relationships between OTU abundances and butyrate concentrations during RS supplementation. It is possible that the number of individuals in this study (n\u2009=\u200920) may have been too small to detect robust correlations between butyrate and the abundance of OTUs at the population level. Alternatively, it is not necessary that the abundance of a single organism be correlated with butyrate concentrations. After all, the potential for producing butyrate is fairly widespread within the phylum Firmicutes [31]. Rather, we expect that the abundance of genes encoding butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk) would be correlated to butyrate concentrations.",

This finding complements and extends previously published reports on the effects of RS supplementation on the composition of the human gut microbiota. In a study with overweight adult males, only individuals with detectable abundances of R. bromii in their gut microbiota were able to degrade RS (type 3\u2014Novelose 330; Walker et al. [32]). In another study with ten human subjects (five males and females; 28\u201338\u00a0years old), dietary supplementation with either type 4 RS (FiberSym RW) or type 2 RS (HiMaize260) increased the relative abundance of B. adolescentis and R. bromii, respectively (Martinez et al. [33]). These in vivo studies are nicely complemented by in vitro microcosm studies, which showed that isolates of R. bromii and B. adolescentis are capable of degrading several forms of RS [23]. Thus, different types of resistant starches are likely to promote the growth of B. adolescentis or R. bromii, with both organisms exhibiting substrate specificity depending upon the type and source of RS.",

                    "text": "In addition to RS-degrading organisms, another OTU (OTU #4) was identified as distinguishing the high group from the enhanced and low groups (Table\u00a03, Fig.\u00a05). Its V4 sequence is identical to that of E. rectale, well established as a prominent butyrogenic bacterium in the human gut microbiome [24, 35]. Its relative abundance in the high group was consistently about 6\u00a0%, compared to 3\u00a0% in the other two groups. Surprisingly, the abundance of E. rectale did not change in any of the groups in response to RS\u2014even though butyrate concentrations increased appreciably in the enhanced group (from 9 to 15\u00a0mmol/kg wet feces). E. rectale generates butyrate from acetate, and there is a net gain of ATP in that process [35]. So if E. rectale was responsible for increased butyrate production in the enhanced group with RS, one might expect an increase in its relative abundance. We offer two possible explanations for the increased butyrate production in the enhanced group without a measurable increase in the abundance of E. rectale. First, changes in the relative abundance of E. rectale may be subtle and masked by the dramatic increase in the abundance of RS-degrading organisms (~from 2 to 10\u00a0% in the enhanced group). It is also possible that populations of E. rectale take longer to respond to RS supplementation. We used an acclimatization period of only 3\u00a0days during which the amounts of RS in diet were gradually increased, and after this period, four fecal samples were collected. It remains to be seen whether there is a detectable increase in the abundance of E. rectale following a longer duration of RS consumption. Also, as mentioned earlier, it is well documented that butyrate production is widespread within the phylum Firmicutes in human gut microbiomes. Therefore, rather than a single organism, if more acetate is being converted to butyrate, the genes encoding butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk) should increase in abundance with RS supplementation.",

                    "text": "Our data show that dietary supplementation with RS type 2 as unmodified potato starch increases fecal butyrate concentration, but with remarkable inter-individual variation. We were able to infer potential explanations for some of these differential effects by investigating the composition of microbiota. Fecal butyrate concentrations increased by an average of 67\u00a0% in a subset of the study population (n\u2009=\u200911 of 20; 9 to 15\u00a0mmol/kg wet feces). Most individuals in this group showed a dramatic increase in the relative abundance of the RS-degrading organisms\u2014B. adolescentis or R. bromii. In five of these individuals, the prominent butyrogenic microbe E. rectale also increased in abundance. Another subset of the population (3 of 20) consistently maintained high butyrate concentrations both before and with RS (\u226512\u00a0mmol/kg wet feces). In this subset, RS-degrading organisms increased in abundance, suggesting that RS is being degraded. But there was no concomitant increase in fecal butyrate concentrations. These individuals may be experiencing a plateau effect [36] in butyrate production even before RS is administered. In fact, the microbiota structures of these individuals also did not change as much with RS (ANOSIM R\u2009=\u20090.17) as compared to changes in the microbiota in the enhanced group (ANOSIM R\u2009=\u20090.64). It is tempting to suggest that the microbiota of these individuals are performing well with regard to butyrate production, and they do not benefit from additional dietary input of fermentable carbohydrates. A third subset of our study population (6 of 20) had consistently low concentrations of butyrate even when consuming RS (\u22648\u00a0mmol/kg wet feces). In this group, RS-degrading organisms did not increase in abundance, suggesting that their microbiota did not break down RS. Based upon this result, we propose that increasing butyrate in these individuals will require either (i) testing another form of dietary fiber such as inulin or arabinoxylan that their microbiota might degrade, (ii) a synbiotic approach that combines a dietary fiber with the appropriate fiber-degrading bacteria, or (iii) targeted removal of microbes if any are antagonistic to RS-degrading organisms. The findings of this study illustrate the importance of studying individual responses to dietary modifications. This will uncover the mechanisms that underlie these responses and in time provide actionable insights towards precision management of microbiomes.",
