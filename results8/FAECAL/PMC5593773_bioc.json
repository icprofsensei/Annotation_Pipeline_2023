For example, in 9 healthy participants studied twice over 3 months, the inter-individual variability exceeded the intra-individual variability.7 In another study, fecal samples evaluated with the low-error amplicon sequencing (LEA-Seq) technique were stable in 37 healthy adults sampled 2 to 13 times up to 296 weeks apart.8",

Data from the Human Microbiome Project indicate that only approximately 30% of samples, as defined by taxa abundance-based metagenomic \u2018codes\u2019 and a measure of beta diversity, were stable for up to 450 days.6 Conceivably, temporal variations in the microbiota profile may be related not only to the disease state but also to alterations in diet, drugs, colonic transit, body mass index (BMI), and antibiotic use.3, 12\u201315 Hence, longitudinal assessments may be useful to more rigorously characterize fecal microbiota profiles in disease states.16 In IBS, particularly in diarrhea-predominant IBS, the fecal microbiota evaluated with older methods, not 16S rRNA techniques, were unstable over time.17\u201319 Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the intra-individual stability of the fecal microbiota with 16S rRNA techniques in IBS and chronic constipation. Indeed, because there is an association between stool consistency and the composition of microbiota,20 it is conceivable that alterations in the fecal microbiota at least partly explain the temporal fluctuation in symptoms, most frequently from constipation- or diarrhea-predominant IBS to mixed type IBS or vice versa.21",

Phylotype profiles of the microbiota from healthy and constipated populations were generated using deep rDNA hypervariable tag sequencing of the hypervariable V3\u2013V5 region of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, which has been validated for use with human microbiota and is the preferred technique by the Human Microbiome Project. With the longer reads from the MiSeq (300\u00d7300 paired end reads), sequencing included the V3\u2013V5 regions, thereby optimizing the phylogenetic analysis 26; the 300 base pair reads ensured optimal phylogenetic identification. Barcoding of samples prior to sequencing yielded an average of 49,186 reads for the first stool sample (range 9438 \u2013 161,117) and 48,237 for the second stool sample (range 17,465 \u2013 164,321), ensuring detection of both dominant (core microbiota) and poorly-represented taxa (variable microbiota). Paired end reads were stitched, aligned, and classified using a custom pipeline (TORNADO v2.0) 27. Briefly, low base quality reads were either trimmed or discarded,28 and these reads were not classified as a bacteria kingdom29 or matched to the bacteria 16S rRNA secondary structure.30 To evaluate the microbial diversity and abundance, UPARSE was used for Operational Taxonomical Units (OTU) clustering,31 and FastTree was used for phylogeny.32 The 16S data were clustered into OTUs at 97% sequence similarity, and the taxonomy was assigned using the Ribosomal Database Project classifier and Greengenes database (v13.5)",

The total daily caloric intake was less (P=.005) in constipated (1265\u00b1350 kcal) than healthy participants (1597\u00b1402 kcal). Compared to patients, healthy participants also consumed more carbohydrate (P=.054), protein (P=.002), fat (P=.03), and fiber (P=.01) when expressed as an absolute amount, but not as a proportion of the total calorie intake. Gastric emptying at 2 hours, but not at 4 hours, was lower (P<.01) in constipated patients than in healthy participants. There was no difference in small intestinal transit between the two groups. Fourteen patients (9 with functional constipation, 3 with IBS-C, and 2 with mixed IBS) but only 2 controls (P<.005), had delayed colonic transit. Six healthy participants but no patients had rapid colonic transit.

When the ICC for the reproducibility of microbiota parameters is incorporated into the sample size assessment, a greater sample size is required, as the ICC declines (Figure 3) to a comparable extent for all 3 hypothetical effect sizes. For example, to identify a strong difference, 25 samples per group are required when the ICC is 1.0.

For example, Jalanka-Tuovinen et al. used the coefficient of variation (CoV) to study the temporal stability of the core gut microbial taxa in healthy subjects.34 The reason we chose the ICC measure over other measures is that ICC is directly related to statistical power, a key issue in the study design.

The ICC for number of observed OTUs, which reflect the richness of microbiota, indicated strong agreement. For the Shannon index, which reflects the richness and evenness of fecal microbiota, the agreement between two stool samples was moderate. Similarly, for most measures of beta diversity, the ICCs suggested moderate or strong agreement. Extending previous studies,7 these observations suggest that for most diversity indices of microbiota composition, a single sample is cost-effective, not only in healthy people but also in constipated patients. However, if the sample size is the major constraint, statistical power could be improved moderately by using several technical replicates. The study also suggested that the composition of fecal microbiota was affected by a laxative.",

Agreement for the weighted UniFrac and the generalized Unifrac distance was also moderate or strong in healthy people, constipated patients, and patients with slow colonic transit. However, the agreement for the weighted UniFrac and generalized Unifrac distances in patients with normal colonic transit was poor, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations related to a small sample size; only 19 participants had normal colonic transit. An alternative or additional explanation is that the weighted UniFrac and generalized Unifrac distances are influenced, respectively, predominantly and partly, by the most abundant lineages. Confirming this, the reproducibility of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was also lower in patients with normal colonic transit. These observations are consistent with the observation that bowel cleansing with a purgative prior to colonoscopy reduced the abundance of taxa belonging to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes but not the overall diversity of microbiota.40 At the genus level, variations in Bacteroides, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus explained the low ICC in participants with normal colonic transit. Conceivably, this poor reproducibility may be partly explained by the effects of laxatives on colonic transit and stool consistency, which, to speculate, may be more pronounced in people with normal compared to slow colonic transit. The fecal microbiota, stool consistency, and colonic transit are known to be univariately associated with each other. Alterations in colonic transit affect stool consistency.41, 42 Stool consistency is associated with several measures of microbiota composition, i.e., species richness, enterotypes and taxonomic composition.43 Indeed, in a study of 3948 people, stool consistency had the largest effect size on the variation of fecal microbiota.44 Polyethylene glycol significantly increased the relative abundance of Bacteroides in ex-germ free mice colonized with human fecal microbiota.45",

This provides further evidence for the intra-individual reproducibility of fecal microbiota and also supports the association between fecal microbiota and colonic transit as well as with breath methane production.3 However, minor differences were observed, which can again be explained by stochastic fluctuation related to a small sample size. However, alternative explanations are also possible. For example, in contrast to the first stool sample, total calorie intake was not significantly associated with the unweighted Unifrac distance, perhaps because the caloric intake was recorded for 3 days before the first stool sample and not thereafter. Acute changes in caloric intake are known to affect the stool microbiota.14, 46",

Additional studies are necessary to ascertain if the fecal microbiota is stable over longer time periods, particularly since bowel symptoms may change over time, most frequently from constipation- or diarrhea-predominant IBS to mixed type or vice versa.21 Similar to a previous study,48 dietary caloric intake was lower in constipated than healthy participants. However, the reported average daily caloric intake in constipated participants was 1265 Kcal. We cannot exclude the possibility that this 3-day dietary assessment period was not representative of their regular caloric intake.",
