In this study, the two techniques were compared and contrasted for analysis of the bacterial composition in three fecal and three small intestinal samples from human individuals. As PCR remains a crucial step in sample preparation for both techniques, different forward primers were used for amplification to assess their impact on microbial profiling results. An average of 7,944 pyrosequences, spanning the V1 and V2 region of 16S rRNA genes, was obtained per sample. Although primer choice in barcoded pyrosequencing did not affect species richness and diversity estimates, detection of Actinobacteria strongly depended on the selected primer. Microbial profiles obtained by pyrosequencing and phylogenetic microarray analysis (HITChip) correlated strongly for fecal and ileal lumen samples but were less concordant for ileostomy effluent. Quantitative PCR was employed to investigate the deviations in profiling between pyrosequencing and HITChip analysis. Since cloning and sequencing of random 16S rRNA genes from ileostomy effluent confirmed the presence of novel intestinal phylotypes detected by pyrosequencing, especially those belonging to the Veillonella group, the divergence between pyrosequencing and the HITChip is likely due to the relatively low number of available 16S rRNA gene sequences of small intestinal origin in the DNA databases that were used for HITChip probe design. Overall, this study demonstrated that equivalent biological conclusions are obtained by high-throughput profiling of microbial communities, independent of technology or primer choice.",

This community increases in numbers as well as diversity along the longitudinal axes of the GI tract and ultimately reaches populations as high as 1011 bacteria per gram of contents in the large intestine (6, 26, 46). The diversity and population dynamics of the lower GI tract microbiota have been well documented (26, 35, 51). In contrast, the microbiota of the upper GI tract has been poorly described, which is mainly due to sampling difficulties (5, 26). Recently, the human small intestinal microbiota was characterized using samples obtained from ileostomy subjects (5, 20), and samples from the small intestine of healthy individuals were obtained with an orally introduced catheter (E. G. Zoetendal et al., submitted for publication).",

The means by which this research has been conducted underwent a revolution from culture-based approaches to molecular technologies during the last few decades (see references 46 and 49 for reviews). Molecular technologies based on 16S rRNA and its encoding gene, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (19), quantitative PCR (qPCR) (38), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (4), and terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) (13), as well as the classical 16S rRNA gene amplicon cloning and sequencing approach (12), are commonly used for compositional studies of the intestinal microbial ecosystem (47, 49). However, these approaches are laborious, especially when one aims for in-depth microbial community profiling (49). Phylogenetic microarrays (33, 35) and pyrosequencing technology (28) have become popular methods since they principally allow high-throughput and in-depth monitoring of microbial communities. While the former relies on 16S rRNA gene-targeted oligonucleotide probes for detection of bacteria in environmental samples (35), the latter allows de novo community profiling by sequencing and subsequent identification of partial 16S rRNA gene amplicons (1).",

This notion is exemplified by the underestimation of Bifidobacterium abundances in fecal samples by the commonly used universal 27F primer (21). One constraint of phylogenetic arrays for microbial profiling is their being limited to detecting phylogenetic groups for which probes are represented on the array, although higher-taxonomic-level probes can still provide information for those groups (33), whereas analysis of data from pyrosequencing is challenging due to the vast number of obtained sequences that may contain sequence errors that hinder appropriate data interpretation (18).",

This filtering was performed using an in-house perl script that passed sequences with exact matches to the forward primer, no ambiguous bases (N), and read lengths not longer or shorter than 1 standard deviation (SD) from the average sequence length (>87 to 157 and <314 to 359 nucleotides; see Table S2 in the supplemental material for the actual upper and lower read length limits per sample). Additionally, primer sequences were removed from the pyrosequencing reads, and the remaining sequences were analyzed. The numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), rarefaction curves, and total species richness estimations (abundance-based coverage estimators [ACE] and Chao1) (22) for the quality filtered sequences per sample were calculated using ESPRIT (43) with default settings (without removing low-quality reads) at an 0.02 distance level.",

(11). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of these phylotypes are present in a nonredundant ARB (27) database that was used for HITChip probe design, the human unique OTU database (35, 36). The sequences with corresponding assignments present in this database were exported and used to train the RDP classifier. This yielded a classifier that (in combination with a trial multiclassifier provided by the RDP staff) could classify pyrosequencing reads originating from different samples on a large scale with the same assignments as those produced by HITChip analysis. The confidence threshold used for classification of the pyrosequences was kept at 80%. Moreover, the multiclassifier summarized the assignments per taxon, which facilitated calculation of relative contributions and subsequent construction of microbial profiles for comparison with those that were generated by HITChip analysis.",

Each reaction was performed in quadruplicate in a total volume of 50 \u03bcl containing 1\u00d7 PCR buffer (Promega), 200 nM (each) primer (Biolegio), 200 \u03bcM (each) deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (Promega), 1.25 U GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 1 \u03bcl of the extracted DNA. The amplification program was performed on a T1 thermocycler (Biometra, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) and consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 2 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 52\u00b0C for 40 s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 90 s; and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR products were verified by gel electrophoresis using 5 \u03bcl of the reaction mixture on a 1.0% (wt/vol) agarose gel containing 0.4 \u03bcg/ml ethidium bromide (Bio-Rad). Quadruplicate PCR products from the same sample were pooled and subsequently purified with a High Pure cleanup microkit (Roche) using 10 \u03bcl elution buffer (Roche) for elution. The purified PCR products were diluted 10 times, of which 1 \u03bcl was used for ligation into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) overnight at 4\u00b0C according to the manufacturer's instructions. XL1-Blue competent cells (75 \u03bcl; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were transformed with 2 \u03bcl ligation mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently plated on LB agar containing ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma), isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 0.16 mM; Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal; 100 \u03bcg/ml; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for blue-white color screening. White colonies were randomly selected and separately cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C in LB medium containing ampicillin. Subsequently, 2 sets of 96 clones from each clone library were randomly selected and the cloned inserts were sequenced from both ends using the T7 and SP6 priming sites (GATC-Biotech, Konstanz, Germany). The obtained sequences per clone were assembled using Clone Manager 9 Professional Edition (Scientific & Educational Software, Cary, NC), yielding nearly full-length 16S rRNA sequences, which were analyzed with DNA Baser v2.71.0 (Heracle Software, Lilienthal, Germany) to trim vector sequences. Subsequently, sequences were tested for chimeras using Mallard (2) according to the instructions of the authors with the default settings to identify chimeric sequences. Putatively anomalous 16S rRNA sequences identified by Mallard were further analyzed according to the anomaly confirmation protocol suggested by the authors, and unambiguously anomalous sequences were excluded from further microbiome interpretations. Nonchimeric sequences were taxonomically classified using the in-house customized RDP classifier described above. Sequences for which no classification could be obtained above the 80% confidence threshold were classified using the locally installed version of the RDP classifier version 2.2 (48) with a default confidence threshold of 80%.",

As anticipated, most pyrosequences were assigned to the Firmicutes (85.6%), Actinobacteria (7.6%), and Bacteroidetes (2.9%; predominantly encountered in fecal samples F1 and F2 as well as in the ileal lumen content sample S3). Notably, only 1.5% of all pyrosequences could not be classified using the confidence threshold of 80% and are represented as Unclassified_Human unique OTU (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). Furthermore, microbial profiles obtained using all pyrosequences (without quality filtering) revealed essentially the same profiles as those obtained with the quality-filtered sequences, albeit with a raised abundance of the Unclassified_Human unique OTU (see Fig. S2), indicating that the quality filtering step does not drastically influence the reconstruction of the microbial community but predominantly eliminates noise.",

Microbial profiles constructed on the basis of pyrosequences per sample were highly correlated for the different primers (average r of 0.88 \u00b1 0.14 at level 2 community data [data not shown]). Furthermore, hierarchical clustering (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material) of the microbial profiles revealed distinct clusters of microbial profiles for each of the samples using the four forward primers, except for sample S3 as discussed below, indicating that the effect of primers on microbial profiling is smaller than the sample-specific effect and supporting a high level of technical reproducibility of the pyrosequencing method. Analogously, comparison of rarefaction curves (see Fig. S4) and species richness estimators Chao1 and ACE, as well as Shannon diversity indices (Table \u200b(Table2),2), did not reveal a particular primer giving consistently the highest or lowest value for any of these ecological metrics. Nonetheless, qualitative comparison demonstrated that the microbial profiles deduced from pyrosequencing using amplicons generated with the 27F-DegL, 27F-DegS, and 35F-Nondeg primers were notably more abundant in Actinobacteria than were those using the 27F-Nondeg primer (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2),2), confirming previous reports on the underestimation of the Actinobacteria using the 27F-Nondeg primer (21).",

In general, the two clusters showed approximately the same fractions (\u223c90%) of pyrosequences that had a perfect match with at least one of the HITChip probes. For cluster I, Eubacterium rectale et rel. and Ruminococcus obeum et rel. contained the most pyrosequences that lack a HITChip probe perfect match, while Veillonella showed the highest number of sequences (19.3%) without a perfect match for the HITChip probes for cluster II.",

Surprisingly, Bifidobacterium abundances assessed with the qPCR assay were relatively low as well, whereas estimations by pyrosequencing using the 27F-DegL, 27F-DegS, and 35F-Nondeg primers showed relative abundances varying from 1.10% to 6.98% for samples F1, F2, F3, and S3 and from 4.04% to 16.37% for samples S1 and S2. For Veillonella and E. coli, relative abundances were highest by pyrosequencing analysis, followed by intermediate values obtained from qPCR and lowest values assessed by HITChip analysis. Sample S3 was the only sample for which an E. coli abundance above 1.5% was detected, and it showed relative contributions as high as 31.8% and 17.4% in microbial profiles from pyrosequencing using the 27F-DegL and 27F-DegS primers, respectively. Although the proportion of E. coli bacteria as assessed by the HITChip was considerably lower, with an abundance of 0.44%, the E. coli-specific qPCR assay revealed a contribution of 5% and confirms the abundant presence of E. coli in sample S3. Additionally, this observation suggests that microbial profiling using primers 27F-DegL and 27F-DegS results in a more accurate representation of the microbial composition in intestinal samples that contain higher proportions of E. coli.",

Out of the total of 297 cloned sequences, 6 could not be classified at level 2 assignments above the 80% confidence threshold using the RDP classifier trained with the human unique OTU database. Consequently, these sequences were grouped to Unclassified_ with the specific level 1 assignment (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4).4). To determine if the resolution of the identifications could be improved, sequences were reclassified using the standard RDP classifier (see Materials and Methods), which is based on a set of 16S rRNA gene sequences more exhaustive than that of the human unique OTU database. This showed that both Unclassified_Bacilli sequences were assigned to the order Lactobacillales, though deviating in their genus-level classifications as Granulicatella for one and Streptococcus for the other. The sequence classified as the latter also showed <98% identity to 16S rRNA gene sequences represented in the human unique OTU database. Sequences of the Unclassified_Clostridium cluster XIVa group could be classified no further than the family Lachnospiraceae, whereas the Unclassified_Proteobacteria were assigned to the genus Variovorax belonging to Betaproteobacteria.",

The finding of a relatively large proportion of these phylotypes among the Veillonella 16S rRNA gene sequences supports the suggestion that the HITChip probes display relatively poor sequence matches with these sequences (see above). Detailed analysis indeed showed that 5 out of 7 HITChip probes specific for Veillonella had more than 2 mismatches with sequences classified as Veillonella, whereas the remaining two probes at most had 1 mismatch (see Fig. S8 in the supplemental material).",

Out of the 72 cloned sequences classified as Veillonella, only one sequence did not show a perfect match with the reverse primer. In contrast, 16 sequences had a single mismatch with the forward primer (see Fig. S8 in the supplemental material). Interestingly, 13 of these sequences were also identified as novel intestinal phylotypes (see above). This shows that the forward primer for the Veillonella qPCR assay is not in agreement with the 16S rRNA gene sequences of Veillonella and could also explain the lower Veillonella abundances as determined by qPCR in comparison with those estimated by pyrosequencing (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3).3). Taken together, these results suggest that the human small intestine is inhabited by novel Veillonella phylotypes that previously have not been reported to inhabit this niche.",

The two techniques generated similar microbial composition profiles for fecal and terminal ileum-lumen samples, whereas more distinct profiles were obtained for ileostomy effluent samples. Ileostomy effluent, in comparison to fecal samples, contained less rich and diverse microbial communities, which were abundant in Streptococcus spp., Veillonella spp., and members of several Clostridium clusters. These findings are consistent with results published by Booijink et al. (5) as well as with the recent study by Zoetendal et al. that concluded that the phylogenetic composition in ileostomy effluent is different from that of the ileum and resembles the microbiota in the proximal small intestine, i.e., the jejunum and proximal ileum (Zoetendal et al., submitted).",

Thereby, this study confirms that the two profiling technologies facilitate robust microbial profiling and generate essentially equivalent biological conclusions regarding compositions of microbial communities. Nonetheless, abundance estimates for several phylogenetic groups deviated between pyrosequencing and HITChip analysis. Determining the exact cause for the technical divergence is not trivial, but possible reasons for this are (i) probe-based versus sequence-based quantification, (ii) failure to detect species that were not represented in the reference sequences used for probe design and cognate overestimation of relative abundances of the detected phylogenetic groups, (iii) sequencing errors, (iv) incorrect taxonomic classification of sequences, and/or (v) a difference in dynamic ranges between technologies. The last was also apparent from comparison of HITChip analyses with very deep pyrosequencing, resulting in a level of depth that is comparable to close to 200,000 reads per sample (8). Sequencing depth could be improved by employing the Illumina sequencing platform, with which microbial community diversity is analyzed with increased depth relative to pyrosequencing (7, 9). However, to date, this approach is still challenging due to the limited phylogenetic resolution obtained from such short sequence reads and the increasing sequence error rates for reads extended beyond 60 bp.",

                    "text": "HITChip probe design is based on a 16S rRNA gene database that predominantly contains sequences with a fecal or colonic origin. Since the two profiling techniques correlated strongly for fecal samples and the HITChip offers a broader dynamic range of detection, HITChip analysis is preferred for profiling of the lower GI tract microbiota. However, HITChip coverage of the small intestinal microbiota appeared to be more incomplete (5), and therefore, pyrosequencing would be the method of choice for de novo profiling of these microbial communities. Furthermore, this finding exemplifies the intrinsic constraint of microarray approaches that are limited to detection of phylogenetic groups for which sequences were included during array design. This may to a large extent explain the lower correlations between pyrosequencing and HITChip analysis that were obtained for the ileostomy effluent samples and suggests that ileostomy effluent harbors novel intestinal bacteria that have not been detected in feces or other large intestinal samples. To identify these phylotypes, pyrosequences were screened per phylogenetic group for perfect matches with the respective HITChip probes. All groups had multiple sequences without a probe match, which may indicate the presence of novel intestinal phylotypes, suggesting that HITChip probe design may be improved by the addition of probes to detect this expanding community. The latter would require a flexible array design strategy as suggested by Rajili\u0107-Stojanovi\u0107 et al. (35). However, despite quality filtering to improve overall pyrosequence data set reliability, this technology still suffers from a relatively high sequence error rate (\u223c0.5% for the GS 20 and GS FLX platform [31]), which erroneously may contribute to the number of sequences that mismatch with the HITChip probes. Analogously, the pyrosequencing technology was reported to overestimate microbial diversity as a consequence of these sequencing errors (37).",

Other novel phylotypes from the clone libraries were identified as Variovorax bacteria, which have been cultured from soil (42) and have been detected in the rabbit cecum (30). However, to the best of our knowledge, Variovorax spp. have not been identified as inhabitants of the human GI tract to date. Therefore, the human small intestine contains a range of species that were not previously associated with this niche, and elucidating the role of these microorganisms, especially of the abundant Veillonella, in their environment is a task for the future.",

Discrepancies were observed between relative abundances as determined by qPCR and the two profiling techniques. This can at least in part be attributed to the difference in abundance calculations, which are based on a separate total bacterial assessment for qPCR, whereas for the HITChip and pyrosequencing relative abundances are calculated based on probe signals or number of pyrosequences per phylogenetic group as part of the total, respectively. Streptococcus abundance levels were consistently highest with HITChip analysis relative to qPCR assays and pyrosequencing. This observation corroborates the results previously published by Rajili\u0107-Stojanovi\u0107 and colleagues (35), who reported a significantly higher relative abundance estimate of Streptococcus spp. in fecal samples based on HITChip analysis than based on group-specific FISH analysis.",

With the exception of sample S3, microbiota compositions per sample were highly similar for the different primers. This underpins the degree of reproducibility of microbial profiling by means of pyrosequencing and suggests that correlations between technical replicates can be expected to be even higher. Moreover, primer choice did not profoundly affect species richness and diversity estimates, which is in agreement with a recent study that showed consistent species evenness estimates when using different primer pairs targeting the same region of the 16S rRNA gene (14). Qualitative analysis of the microbial profiles, however, clearly revealed a lower abundance of Actinobacteria found by the 27F-Nondeg primer, which confirms the observations by Hayashi et al. (21) showing that the 27F-Nondeg primer is incomplete in its coverage of Bifidobacterium spp.",

Nonetheless, based on the results described here, it is our recommendation to use either the 27F-DegL or the 27F-DegS primer, since both these multiple-degenerate primers appear to provide a more complete assessment of Actinobacteria and E. coli abundances.",
