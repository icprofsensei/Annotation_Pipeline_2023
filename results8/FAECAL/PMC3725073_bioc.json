To investigate the origin and evolution of the human gut virome, we analyzed the viral community of one adult individual over 2.5 y by extremely deep metagenomic sequencing (56 billion bases of purified viral sequence from 24 longitudinal fecal samples). After assembly, 478 well-determined contigs could be identified, which are inferred to correspond mostly to previously unstudied bacteriophage genomes. Fully 80% of these types persisted throughout the duration of the 2.5-y study, indicating long-term global stability. Mechanisms of base substitution, rates of accumulation, and the amount of variation varied among viral types. Temperate phages showed relatively lower mutation rates, consistent with replication by accurate bacterial DNA polymerases in the integrated prophage state. In contrast, Microviridae, which are lytic bacteriophages with single-stranded circular DNA genomes, showed high substitution rates (>10\u22125 per nucleotide each day), so that sequence divergence over the 2.5-y period studied approached values sufficient to distinguish new viral species. Longitudinal changes also were associated with diversity-generating retroelements and virus-encoded Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats arrays. We infer that the extreme interpersonal diversity of human gut viruses derives from two sources, persistence of a small portion of the global virome within the gut of each individual and rapid evolution of some long-term virome members.",

Despite their importance, the forces diversifying bacteriophage genomes in human hosts have not been studied in detail. Humans show considerable individual variation in the bacterial lineages present in their guts (11\u201313); this variation likely is one reason for the differences in their phage predators (5\u20138, 14). The large differences in phage populations among individuals also may be influenced by within-individual viral evolution.",

Virus-like particles were extracted by sequential filtration, Centricon ultrafiltration, nuclease treatment, and solvent extraction. Purified viral DNA was subjected to linear amplification using \u03a629 DNA polymerase, after which quantitative PCR showed that bacterial 16S sequences were reduced to less than 10 copies per nanogram of DNA, and human sequences were reduced to below 0.1 copies per nanogram, the limit of detection.

When reads were aligned back onto contigs generated within each sample, only 71% of reads could be aligned. Improved contigs then were generated using a hybrid assembly method combining all samples, taking advantage of the fact that viruses that are rare at one time point may be abundant at another. After this step, 97.6% of the reads could be aligned to contigs, allowing assessment of within-contig diversity. Rarefaction (collector\u2019s curve) analysis showed that the detection of these contigs was saturated at <107 reads per sample and at 7\u201310 samples (Fig. 1B), well below our sampling effort. After quality filtering and manual editing, 478 contigs showed >20-fold coverage (median, 82-fold); from the purification results, we infer these contigs to be mostly or entirely DNA viruses (Fig. 1C). Sixty contigs assembled as closed circles (ranging in size from 4\u2013167 kb), an indication of probable completion of these genome sequences, providing an estimate of the viral population size and composition in unprecedented detail. One circular genome was sequenced independently using the Sanger method and was confirmed to have the structure predicted from the Solexa/Illumina data (SI Methods). The abundance of each contig at each time point was measured by the proportion of reads that aligned to it, normalized to the length of each contig. The correlation coefficient between replicate samples from the same time point was at least 0.99, indicating a high degree of reproducibility (Fig. S1).",

Gyrovirus is a Circovirus genus with very small genome sizes (\u223c2.3 kb) recently reported to infect humans (17). However, the number of reads aligning was modest (10 total), and in no case did both reads of the paired end reads align.

The Podo-, Myo-, and Siphoviridae all package dsDNA genomes and showed lower substitution frequencies. The lowest substitution rates were seen for temperate bacteriophage (P = 0.015, Kruskal\u2013Wallace test), which can integrate into the host bacterial genome. Temperate phages were identified as contigs satisfying at least one of three criteria: (i) encoding integrase genes, (ii) homologs present as prophage in sequenced bacterial genomes, or (iii) annotated as resembling previously studied temperate phage (5). When integrated, temperate phage DNA is replicated by high-fidelity bacterially encoded machinery, and temperate phage also may undergo fewer lytic replication cycles; both result in lower substitution rates. Temperate bacteriophage showed significantly lower substitution rates even when Microviridae were excluded from the comparison (P = 0.044).

An alternative explanation for these high substitution rates could be the immigration of new closely related Microviridae into the community. To investigate this possibility, we reconstructed the consensus genome for the four contigs at multiple time points and aligned them against a large collection of Microviridae genomes. In every case the contig consensus sequences for all time points clustered closely together (Fig. 3B), arguing against immigration of related Microviridae and supporting the model of continuous substitution in long-term viral residents.",

DNA sequences from invaders such as bacteriophage or plasmids are incorporated as spacers into arrays in the bacterial genome. Transcription of such arrays allows the CRISPR spacer RNAs to be incorporated into nucleoprotein effector complexes that target the destruction of sequence-complementary invaders. Thus, bacteriophages are under pressure to mutate to evade degradation by the CRISPR system, as has been documented in model systems (23\u201325, 27). The deep analysis of viral sequences presented here, together with the shotgun metagenomic analysis of host bacterial sequences, allowed the influence of the CRISPR system in vivo to be studied in detail. A total of 34 types of CRISPR repeat sequences and their associated spacers were identified in the bacterial metagenomic sequence. Table 1 shows that several of these spacers targeted contigs from the virome sequence data. Up to 28 spacers could be identified targeting a single viral contig.",

In another approach to associating phage\u2013host pairs, phage sequences annotated as integrated prophages in sequenced bacterial genomes could be recognized that resembled our newly sequenced phage contigs, thereby also specifying potential hosts (4\u20136). Bacterial lineages identified as harboring phage from the virome analysis included Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium siraeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia hansenii, and Lachnospiraceae, all of which were found to be present in metagenomic sequence analysis of total stool DNA (Fig. S2).

We analyzed the viral contigs described here to investigate whether DGRs were detectably active within the human gut. DGRs were identified by searching contigs for regions that matched three criteria: (i) they contained protein-coding regions resembling reverse transcriptases, (ii) they encompassed short repeat regions containing mismatches in adenine positions, and (iii) they contained hypervariable regions. Of the 20 contigs with both a reverse transcriptase and an adenine-mismatched repeat, six were associated with hypervariable regions (located no more than 100 bp away; Table S3) and were selected for further study. As was found previously, hypervariation was directed toward asparagine AAY codons in genes encoding either predicted C-type lectin or Ig-superfamily proteins (6, 30\u201333).",

The longest gap between sample collections was 22 mo, so to maximize sensitivity we asked whether the hypervariable regions had evolved to become clearly different over this time interval. Of the two hypervariable regions with sufficient longitudinal coverage for analysis, one (contig 42) showed change over the 22-mo time period, and change was greater than for samples closer together in time (P < 0.0001) or for pairs of samples from the same time point (P < 0.0001). For the second (contig d03-2), we did not obtain evidence for longitudinal variation. We conclude that one of our DGRs was active in the human gut. For the others, it is unclear whether they were inactive or whether we did not have enough sequence coverage to detect activity. Analysis showed that DGR-containing contigs were not among the most variable, highlighting the local nature of DGR variation and emphasizing the contributions of other mechanisms. The possibility that some of the DGRs were inactive raises the question of whether the mutagenic activity might be regulated in the human host.",

Most viral contigs showed diversity within each time point and accumulated variation over time. Temperate DNA phages showed relatively modest rates of variation compared with lytic phage, as is consistent with temperate phage DNA replication by accurate bacterial polymerases in the prophage state, and potentially fewer total rounds of replication. In contrast, the strictly lytic ssDNA Microviridae showed up to 4% substitutions in the major variants present over the time period studied. DGRs showed high diversity in variable repeat regions, and one was detectably active over the time series studied. CRISPR arrays encoded in viral genomes also were associated with longitudinal variation. Thus, multiple mechanisms contributed to viral sequence variation, and our data provide a detailed picture of their relative contributions.",

Rare reads did align to genomes of animal cell viruses, but it is uncertain whether these alignments represent true detection of these viruses or rare regions of homology between animal cell viruses and phages. In contrast, several studies have reported frequent detection of animal cell viruses in metagenomic analysis of stool DNA from humans and other primates, raising the question of how these studies differed. One observation is that samples from sick individuals (34, 35) or SIV-infected macaques (36) have yielded animal cell viruses more frequently than samples from healthy controls. Some of these studies did not attempt to analyze bacterial viruses, instead using bioinformatic filters to extract animal cell viruses from complex sequence mixtures, potentially leading to an under-appreciation of the size of the phage populations. Thus, our data emphasize that in the healthy human gut bacterial viruses are much more numerous than animal cell viruses, although it remains possible that some of our contigs with no database matches correspond to previously unknown viruses infecting human cells.",

Microviridae lineages showed up to 4% substitution in the main variant over the 2.5-y period studied, consistent with laboratory experiments also showing high mutation rates for Microviridae (39). There is no single threshold of sequence identity accepted for splitting related viruses into separate species (40), but different Microviridae species specified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses show as little as 3.1% divergence (Table S4). Evidently the divergence seen here for Microviridae contigs 122_321 and 001_39 approaches the level sufficient for designation as speciation events. Extrapolating from these rates, our data suggest that multiple new viral species commonly will arise in the gut of a typical human over the course of a human life. Thus, part of the explanation for the extremely large populations of gut viruses inferred from sequence information and for the extreme differences among individual humans appears to be rapid within-individual evolution of long-term viral residents.",
