Specifically, exposure of fecal samples to room temperature or long term storage in deep freezing conditions may alter the composition of the microbiota. Thus, we stored fecal samples at room temperature and monitored the stability of the microbiota over twenty four hours. We also investigated the stability of the microbiota in fecal samples during a six month storage period at \u221280\u00b0C. As the stability of the fecal microbiota may be affected by intestinal disease, we analyzed two healthy controls and two patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We used high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the microbiota in fecal samples stored at room temperature or \u221280\u00b0C at six and seven time points, respectively. The composition of microbial communities in IBS patients and healthy controls were determined and compared using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline. The composition of the microbiota in fecal samples stored for different lengths of time at room temperature or \u221280\u00b0C clustered strongly based on the host each sample originated from. Our data demonstrates that fecal samples exposed to room or deep freezing temperatures for up to twenty four hours and six months, respectively, exhibit a microbial composition and diversity that shares more identity with its host of origin than any other sample.",

Thus, current research relies upon DNA-based culture-independent methods for characterization of the intestinal microbiota [6], [7]. The handling and treatment of biological samples used to characterize the intestinal microbiota is critical when comparing the composition of this complex microbial community between different ecological niches or diseases. This is particularly important in studies investigating the association of the intestinal microbiota with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where fecal samples have been left at room temperature for up to six hours before isolation of fecal DNA [8]. A recent report highlighted the significant effect of \u2018length of time\u2019 at \u2018room temperature\u2019 (approximately 25\u00b0C) on the composition of the microbiota in a cystic fibrosis sputum sample, whereas freezing temperatures (\u221220 and \u221280\u00b0C) did not significantly alter the composition of the microbiota [9]. Additionally, the effect of a range of temperatures (20, 4, \u221220, and \u221280\u00b0C) at two time points (3 and 14 days) on the fecal microbiota has been assessed [10]. This study reported a lack of effect of time and temperature on the composition of the microbiota in fecal samples. However, this study compared the fecal microbiota at three and fourteen days, but did not include a baseline sample that is reflective of the fecal microbiota at the time of defecation. Thus, the aim of our study was to characterize the composition of the microbiota in fecal samples left at room temperature at baseline (30 minutes following defecation) and monitor the stability of the microbiota at six time points over twenty four hours. Additionally, we sought to investigate the stability of the microbiota in fecal samples at seven time points during a six month storage period at \u221280\u00b0C. As the fecal microbiota in healthy individuals and patients with intestinal disease may be affected differently by the length of time at a given temperature, we included IBS patients and healthy controls in our study.",

Briefly, sequences that were less than 200 bp or greater than 1,000 bp in length, contained incorrect primer sequences, or contained more than 1 ambiguous base were discarded. The remaining sequences were assigned sample aliquots based on their unique nucleotide barcodes, including error-correction [17]. Chimeric sequences were removed using ChimeraSlayer [18]. Sequences were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on their sequence similarity at 97% sequence similarity (similar to species level) using UCLUST [19]. A representative sequence for each OTU was chosen for downstream analysis based on the most abundant sequence from each OTU. PyNAST was used to align sequences with a minimum length of 150 bp and a minimum percent identity of 75.0 [20]. OTUs were assigned to a taxonomy using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Naive Bayes classifier v 2.2 with the confidence level set at 0.8 [21]. \u03b2-diversity (diversity between groups of samples) was used to generate principal coordinate plots for each sample using un-weighted and weighted UniFrac distances[22]\u2013[24]. PCoA plots were used to visualize the similarities or dissimilarities of variables that best represent the pair-wise distances between sample groups.",

When a data set was identified as not having a normal distribution it was transformed by log10\n[25], and retested for normality. Data sets normally distributed were compared using a Student\u2019s t-test. All statistical comparisons were carried out using GraphPad software (v4.0a; Prism, San Diego, CA). We used taxon and phylogenetic-based analyses to compare 16S rRNA gene sequences within IBS patients and healthy controls over time at room temperature or \u221280\u00b0C. Taxon-based: The means and standard deviations of abundances of bacterial groups (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, and Genus) and OTUs were calculated and compared between all samples stored at room temperature and \u221280\u00b0C, and between samples stored at room temperature and \u221280\u00b0C for each individual. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant after testing for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. Zero values for taxa and OTUs were considered as absences and not included when calculating averages. Phylogenetic-based: Phylogenetic trees for IBS patients and healthy controls were generated using the QIIME pipeline [16]. Each tree was subjected to weighted and unweighted UniFrac analysis[22]\u2013[24] through the QIIME pipeline. UniFrac distances represent the fraction of branch length that is shared by any two samples\u2019 communities in a phylogenetic tree built from 16S rRNA sequence data from all samples. Statistical differences between groups of samples (i.e. room temperature versus \u221280\u00b0C samples, and room temperature and \u221280\u00b0C samples from each individual) were tested using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM \u2013 available through QIIME) by permutation of group membership with 999 replicates. The test statistic R, which measures the strength of the results, ranges from \u22121 to 1: R\u200a=\u200a1 signifies differences between groups, while R\u200a=\u200a0 signifies that the groups are identical.",

Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances for all sample aliquots stored at room temperature or \u221280\u00b0C (n\u200a=\u200a52) revealed four distinct clusters (Figure 2 A&E). Each cluster contained samples obtained from one subject for all time points at both room temperature and \u221280\u00b0C. Additionally, each cluster contained samples obtained from one subject for all time points. PCoA plots of unweighted UniFrac distances revealed no significant clustering of samples based on storage temperature. PCoA plots of weighted UniFrac distances revealed no significant clustering of samples based on storage temperature for both HC samples and one IBS sample, however samples from one IBS individual (IBS1) exhibited clustering based on storage temperature (Figure 2 B&F). ANOSIM confirmed that the samples from the two HC and one IBS individual did not cluster based on storage temperature (HC1: unweighted Unifrac - R\u200a=\u200a0.16 p\u200a=\u200a0.07, weighted UniFrac - R\u200a=\u200a0.01 p\u200a=\u200a0.39; HC2: unweighted Unifrac - R\u200a=\u200a0.07 p\u200a=\u200a0.72, weighted UniFrac - R\u200a=\u200a0.07 p\u200a=\u200a0.22; IBS2: unweighted Unifrac - R\u200a=\u200a\u22120.05 p\u200a=\u200a0.70, weighted UniFrac - R\u200a=\u200a0.14 p\u200a=\u200a0.08), and that samples from one IBS individual did cluster based on storage temperature (IBS1: unweighted Unifrac - R\u200a=\u200a\u22120.01 p\u200a=\u200a0.48, weighted UniFrac - R\u200a=\u200a0.21 p\u200a=\u200a0.04).

Interestingly, the combined average weighted UniFrac distances for HCs were significantly lower (p<0.05) than the combined average weighted UniFrac distances for IBS subjects. This significant decrease was not observed in the unweighted analysis, indicating that HC samples may be more stable than IBS samples during storage based on the relative abundances of specific OTUs.",

However, Lauber et al\u2019s [10] study lacked a baseline sample representing the structure of the fecal microbiota immediately following defecation. Thus, it is possible that the microbiota in fecal samples degraded rapidly and maintained this composition over time. To address these points we designed a study where a baseline aliquot (30 minutes following defecation) was collected and compared to aliquots of the same sample stored at room temperature over a twenty four hour period. We also investigated the stability of the fecal microbiota from aliquots of the same samples stored at \u221280\u00b0C over six months. Furthermore, as fecal samples from ulcerative colitis and IBS patients have significantly higher protease activity [27], it is possible that the fecal microbiota from individuals with intestinal disease may be affected differently by the length of exposure to room or freezing temperatures. Thus, healthy individuals and IBS patients were included in this study.",

This finding suggests that fecal samples kept at room temperature for up to twenty four hours retain a microbiota that is similar in composition to a fresh sample from that individual. Likewise, during long-term storage at \u221280\u00b0C, we found the composition of the microbiota from all subjects and samples segregated based on the subject they originated from rather than the length of time they were exposed to deep freezing conditions. This finding suggests that fecal samples kept at \u221280\u00b0C for up to six months also retain a microbiota that is similar in composition to a fresh sample from that individual. However, we found that the composition of the microbiota from samples stored at room temperature significantly segregated from the microbiota of samples stored at \u221280\u00b0C for one IBS individual. The samples from the second IBS individual did not display the same significant separation between storage temperatures; however clustering of samples on a weighted PCoA displayed greater variation when compared to HC, implying that the microbiota from this IBS patient may also be less stable at room temperature to that of healthy controls. Indeed, the microbiota from both HC samples exhibited lower average weighted UniFrac values than the microbiota from both IBS samples. In support of this observation, our weighted PCoA analysis shows that HC samples cluster tighter than IBS samples. This observation suggests that abundant taxa in the HC samples in our study are less affected by temperature than the IBS analyzed in our study. Although, the IBS samples we analyzed were more affected by storage temperature than HC, the microbiota in these samples bore more similarity to their individual of origin than to storage temperature, and we did not identify any specific OTU or higher taxonomic group that significantly differed between storage temperatures in IBS individuals. This indicates that although IBS samples stored at room temperature for up to 24 hours may alter in microbial composition, these samples still closely represent the intestinal microbiota of that individual. It is unclear why the microbiota of IBS fecal samples are less stable during storage at room temperature, however as intestinal metabolites are altered in IBS patients [27], [28] it is tempting to speculate that elevated levels of proteases and acids may result in faster degradation of fecal DNA.",

It has been reported that the length of time at different storage temperatures affects the densities of specific bacterial groups [29] in swine feces. Although we did not see a significant effect of length of time at a storage temperature on bacterial taxonomic groups or individual species-level OTUs, our analysis did not provide the resolution to investigate fluctuations of taxa at the species or strain level. Additionally, we did not investigate the stability of the microbiota in fecal samples between 8 and 24 hours at room temperature, where the microbiota may be less stable. It is also important to note that although we generated a relative large number of sequences per sample, our depth of coverage will not detect very low abundant taxa. It is, therefore, possible that low abundance taxa may be affected by storage temperature. Furthermore, fecal DNA used in our study to characterize the microbiota of fecal samples was stored at \u221280\u00b0C for different lengths of time, and we have not investigated that stability of fecal DNA over time during freezing conditions.",
