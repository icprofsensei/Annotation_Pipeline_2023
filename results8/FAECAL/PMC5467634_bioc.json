Loss of immune protection of the intestinal mucosa allows translocation of microbial products (such as lipopolysaccharides) into the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract and, eventually, into the systemic circulation [2\u20134]. This is known as bacterial translocation (BT), which was firstly described in HIV-infected patients in 2006 [5,6]. These bacterial products induce a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine production via toll-like receptors, contributing to immune activation and inflammation [2,4]. The degree of BT is linked to the severity of HIV progression independent of viremia and several studies have demonstrated that increased BT and proinflammatory cytokines are partially responsible for HIV-related comorbidities [7\u201311].",

Dysbiosis (an imbalance in microbiota composition) has been linked with chronic inflammation associated with several pathologies such as obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and cardiovascular disease. Alterations in GM in HIV infection are also present and have been related to the development of non-AIDS events [13,14]. The resilience mechanisms are not able to restore GM composition and persist despite combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) [15\u201317]. A very recent study addressed the role of different families of ART (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) vs. protease inhibitors (PIs)) on GM composition, although no differences were observed [17]. To our knowledge, other cART combinations have not yet been investigated. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyse the long-term effects of different combinations of cART on BT and GM composition in HIV-infected patients with undetectable viral load. We also tested whether these families of antiretrovirals were able to restore GM composition compared with an uninfected population.",

Sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq Instrument (two readings per 150 base pairs) (Illumina, INC, San Diego, CA, USA). Computational analysis was carried out by Era7 Bioinformatics (Granada, Spain). Briefly, the first step was to assemble the two reads obtained from the Illumina technology. The computational tool FLASh was used to extend the reads prior to assembly to obtain a larger sequence for a more specific taxonomic assignment of the reads which was carried out based on direct similarity of each read, one-by-one, compared with any sequence 16S included in the Ribosomal Database Project [21] through the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) programme. Two different taxonomic assignment approaches were used: BBH (Best Blast Hit: each read was assigned to the taxon corresponding to the BBH over a threshold of similarity) and LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor: adopted by advanced tools of metagenomic analysis such as the last version of MEGAN 24). The median number of sequences assigned per patient was 89,030.21 with the LCA method, whereas 100,888.61 sequences were obtained with the BBH method. Both \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity were analysed: \u03b1-diversity is a measure of sample-level species richness, with healthy subjects typically exhibiting more species richness than those with intestinal conditions [16], whereas \u03b2-diversity describes inter-subject similarity of microbial composition and facilitates identification of broad differences between samples [22].",

Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Prism\u00ae, La Jolla, California, USA). \u03b1-diversity was calculated and presented as four indices (number of observed species, Margalef\u2019s diversity index, Chao 1 and Alpha index) using R (version 3.2.2; The R foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), whereas \u03b2-diversity was assessed using the web server METAGENassist [23]. Data obtained from \u03b2-diversity were statistically analysed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum non-parametric test. A principal component analysis (PCA) was also developed. Results are plotted according to the first two principle components [23].",

Thus, we compared GM composition (at lower taxonomic units) of HIV+(cART) patients against the uninfected subjects (controls). A combination of NRTIs+INSTIs produced a pronounced increase in bacteria belonging to Desulfovibrionales and Selenomonadales orders, Desulfovibrionaceae and Lachnospiraceae families and Desulfovibrio genus, whereas only a significant depletion in the abundance of unclassified Clostridiales order was observed. Patients using NRTIs+NNRTIs showed an increased abundance of Coriobacteriales order, Coriobacteriaceae and Lachno-spiraceae bacterial families, as well as Pseudomononas genus, whereas a lower abundance of Bacteroidales order, Bacteroidaceae family and Streptococcus genus was observed. Finally, patients using NRTIs+PIs showed a significant increase in the presence of Clostridiales order, Lachnospiraceae family and Eggerthella genus, and a significant reduction in Actinomycetales, Pseudom-onadales, and Sphingomonadales orders, Eubacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae families, and Prevotella, Pseudom-onas and Solobacterium genera (Table 3). More specifically, NRTIs+INSTIs and NRTIs+PIs patients showed a higher abundance of Blautia sp. 3. In addition, a significant increase in the abundance of Flavonifractor plautii was observed in NRTIs+PIs patients, whereas an increase in the levels of Parabacteroides merdae was observed in NRTIs+INSTIs patients. A higher number of bacterial species were reduced in HIV patients using NRTIs+PIs (10 species), whereas patients using NRTIs+NNRTIs or NRTIs+INSTIs regimens showed a lower abundance of only six bacterial species compared with controls (Table 3).\n\n",

Our study demonstrated that sCD14 levels (a marker of BT) were significantly increased in HIV-infected patients, still evident despite cART, as previously described [15,24\u201327]. Surprisingly, levels of sCD14 in NRTIs+INSTIs patients did not differ from those observed in the control/uninfected group. Furthermore, NRTIs+INSTIs patients also showed similar levels of IL-6, VCAM and ICAM to the controls, suggesting that this regimen is able to counteract the increased BT induced by HIV infection and also diminish systemic inflammation, potentially reducing future HIV-related complications (such as cardiovascular events) triggered by BT and inflammation. In this context, several studies have previously demonstrated that starting treatment with INSTIs and/or the intensification or switching to this regimen is associated with a favourable effect on HIV-related immune activation and also with inhibition of CD4-T cell depletion [28\u201332] which is in line with our findings. It is also important to note than although an increase in BT and inflammation was observed in HIV-infected patients compared with the controls, such a difference was only significant in HIV-patients using cART. This could be due to the low number of naive patients recruited in this study which makes difficult to reach statistical significance. A potential impact of cART on inflammation markers cannot be ruled out as Hileman et al. demonstrated that patients who were switched to cART showed different effects on immune activation, which may affect vascular inflammation markers [30].",

Among them, coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus could have significant clinical relevance. In our cohort, around 50% of HIV patients were also coinfected with these hepatotrophic viruses. Although no significant differences were found in the percentage of HIV-coinfected patients under the three different treatments, we decided to analyse the effect of such coinfection independently on cART on BT as well as on GM composition. Our study demonstrates that coinfected patients presented higher levels of BT than non-coinfected. However, these differences were only observed in LBP levels and not sCD14, which has been suggested to be a more relevant biomarker of disease progression as it reflects the host response to products of BT [33]. Thus, these discrepancies could be explained by the different markers used. Measurement of more than one marker is recommended in order to have a broader view of what is really happening in gut [33,34].",

Our results show a significant and clear collapse in \u03b1-diversity in HIV+(naive) compared with the controls as occurs in other pathologies such as obesity [6]. Compared with controls, we observed a more pronounced decrease in untreated patients than in those using cART, suggesting that cART is able to partially restore the bacterial diversity in gut. A study by Lozupone et al. also observed that long-term cART is able to partially restore \u03b1-diversity to the values obtained in HIV-negative individuals; however, in contrast with our findings, they observed a significant increase in \u03b1-diversity in chronic HIV+(naive) patients compared with controls [36]. These discrepancies could be due to the different indices used to compare \u03b1-diversity. Concerning the effects of different antiretrovirals, our study demonstrates that NRTIs+INSTIs patients present a microbial diversity similar to the controls, which highlights the ability of this regimen to counteract the actions of HIV infection on gut bacterial richness. The superior capacity of cART with INSTIs to restore GM diversity may be due to the fact that INSTIs induce a greater reduction in proviral DNA, which could lead to rapid immunologic reconstitution [37\u201339].",

                    "text": "Regarding GM composition, HIV infection and usage of different ART did not translate to significant changes at higher taxonomic levels, suggesting that HIV infection could be more closely related to changes in lower taxonomic units (specific bacteria) and diversity rather than at the phylum level, as occurs in other metabolic pathologies [6]. These findings contrast with other studies that observed changes in some of the most abundant phyla when HIV-infected patients (both naive and using cART) were compared with healthy individuals [16,40]. Thus, McHardy et al. showed a significant decrease in Firmicutes phylum in HIV+(naive) patients and intermediate depletion in HIV+(cART) compared with controls, whereas we only observed a slightly depletion in this phylum in both HIV+(naive) patients and patients using NRTIs+PIs compared with the controls [16]. In contrast, we observed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in HIV+(cART) with no differences among the different ART used, whereas others have not reported any differences [41]. A potential explanation for these discrepancies could be the type of sample used (rectal mucosal biopsies vs. faeces). There is no agreement regarding the best sample to use for these determinations, and, therefore, this is an issue that needs further investigation. However, it is worth mentioning that the majority of the changes observed at lower taxonomic levels in our study were detected in taxonomic groups belonging to Firmicutes phylum and, especially, to the Clostridiales class. Thus, seven bacterial species were found to be depleted in NRTIs+PIs patients, four were depleted in NRTIs+NNRTIs patients, and five depleted in NRTIs+INSTIs patients. In contrast, within the Clostridiales class, Lachnospiraceae family, one of the major taxonomic groups of the human GM known to degrade complex polysaccharides to short-chain fatty acids to be used as energy by the host, was significantly increased with cART, suggesting that these patients are more efficient from an energetic point of view [42]. Eubacterium eligens and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were two species whose abundance was significantly depleted by all treatments used. Nowak et al. also observed a decrease in Eubacterium genus in HIV-infected patients compared with healthy subjects, especially after introducing cART [17]. Of interest, a decrease was observed in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in NRTIs+PIs patients. F. prausnitzii is a beneficial intestinal commensal bacterium with known anti-inflammatory properties; thus, the decrease observed could imply loss of protection and persistent inflammation [43,44]. These findings are in agreement with the increased BT observed in these patients. In addition, a reduction in the abundance of several bacteria normally present in gut (Roseburia inulinivorans and Roseburia intestinal) has also been observed in the patients on this regimen, corroborating the loss of richness observed compared with the controls. Finally, patients using NRTIs+INSTIs showed a lesser reduction in bacteria from the Clostridiales class. In addition, a reduction in Desulfovibrio sp. 6 was observed. This bacterium belongs to the Desulfovibrio genus, known to produce hydrogen sulphide, a compound that can be toxic to human cells. Surprisingly, this genus was found to be increased in our patients. Similarly, higher frequencies of this genus has been found in other pathologies such as IBD and also in HIV infection [36,45,46]. In contrast, Nowak et al. found a significant increase in viraemic patients compared with controls, although the relative abundance of this genus decreased after introduction of ART [17]. These discrepancies could be due to the fact that Nowak et al. did not include patients on the NRTIs+INSTIs regimen [17].",

The usage of INSTIs in these patients was considered a very effective rescue therapy. In fact, similar CD4 counts were observed when compared with the other groups. Therefore, differences in GM composition could not be due to the CD4 counts. In fact, these patients presented a GM composition similar to uninfected volunteers, which highlights the interest of such findings and merits further investigation.",

Important aspects that could have an impact in GM composition have not been controlled in this study, such as the exact composition of the diet, stress conditions and HIV acquisition (heterosexual, men who have sex with men, intravenous drug user, etc.) [47\u201350]. Moreover, it would be interesting to compare the GM composition in the HIV+(naive) patients with different CD4 count ranges; however, this comparison could not be performed because of the small sample size and because patients with a CD4 count <400 cells/mm3 were not included in this study. The effects of coinfection are of interest and could influence GM composition [51]. However, no significant differences were found in the percentage of HIV coinfected patients on the three different treatments. Thus, we could suggest that the potential effects of HCV in GM are similar in the three groups under cART and, therefore, the changes observed in our study are mainly due to the drugs and not to HCV. However, we also performed a metagenomic analysis, separating HIV-infected patients depending on coinfection and independently of cART. As previously mentioned with BT, very slight effects were observed on BT and major phyla abundance. Some changes at genus and species levels were observed. Thus, our results demonstrated a different microbiota composition in HIV coinfected patients when compared with non-coinfected patients, at least at lower taxonomic levels, and for this reason, the impact of such coinfection could not be discarded and should be taken into account in these types of studies. Another limitation is that all patients using NRTIs+INSTIs were only treated with raltegravir, as it was the first INSTI approved for clinical practice and the only one available when patients were recruited for this study. Thus, it is unknown whether elvitegravir or dolutegravir would have similar effects and deserves further investigation. Finally, our study also included a very limited number of untreated HIV-infected patients. However, the comparison among controls and HIV+(naive) has been previously described and our purpose was to analyse the effects of different cART. In fact, our study includes more patients on cART than others published to date [15\u201317,35,36,41]. Our study provides a clear description of GM composition in HIV-infected patients compared with a healthy population and specifically investigates in-depth the impact of different antiretrovirals in order to better understand which regimen is able to restore GM composition and, therefore, resist the actions of HIV infection on BT and subsequent immune activation, disease progression and future complications.",

The NRTIs+PIs regimen showed the highest reduction in bacterial species, which could suggest a significant loss of diversity and increased dysbiosis. In contrast, NRTIs+INSTIs increased the abundance of several bacterial orders, families, genera, and bacterial species and induced a minor loss of bacterial species suggesting a healthier gut, which, in turn, could contribute to the lower inflammation and BT observed. However, further studies are needed to analyse whether INSTIs other than raltegravir have similar effects. In addition, longitudinal and functional studies are needed to ensure that the changes observed in this study are clinically significant.",
