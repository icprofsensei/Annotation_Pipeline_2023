An additional randomized controlled trial would be required in order to reach definitive conclusions, as this is an exploratory study without a placebo control arm.

In addition, a delayed-release formulation of metformin improves glycemic control to the same extent as the immediate-release form despite lower systemic exposure [9]. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the effects of metformin are partially explained by its interaction with the gut microbiome. The connection between the effects of metformin and the gut microbiome has been supported by several recent studies [10\u201317]. These studies suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in both the therapeutic and side effects of the drug, yet details of this interaction remain obscure.",

There is also evidence that metformin increases the abundance of some other mucin degrading and short-chain fatty acids producing genera [10], as well as opportunistic pathogens such as Escherichia spp. [11, 12].

There were no significant changes in representation of taxonomic groups at the phylum level at any of the contrasts between the M0, M24h, and M7d samples. One week treatment with metformin was associated with significant decreases in the families Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae_1 and four genera within these families: Peptostreptococcaceae_unclassified (family Peptostreptococcaceae), Clostridiaceae_1_unclassified (family Clostridiaceae_1), Asaccharospora (family Peptostreptococcaceae), and Romboutsia (family Peptostreptococcaceae). Comparison of the M24h and M7d samples showed significantly increased abundance of the order Enterobacteriales, including the only family in this order\u2013Enterobacteriaceae with the genus, Escherichia-Shigella.",

We believe that this design should have minimized false associations and conclusions arising from unaccounted treatment status by metformin or other medications in T2D patients, including the unknown true duration of T2D before diagnosis and the high interindividual variation of the gut microbiome. It has been recognized that, in similar time series studies, individuals can be treated as their own controls before and during treatment [32]. In addition, the strong effect size in previously described metformin studies [12] allowed us to consider the longitudinal study design as sufficiently powerful to achieve the goal of our study. Taking in account our results, this study design has as well prevented any confounding effects induced by the known high interindividual variety of diet [33], as we did not find any significant association between the changed taxonomic composition and data from the 7-day food record. Furthermore, there has been an increase in the use of metformin beyond diabetes, so this research may give additional insights into general features of the interaction between metformin and the gut microbiome, which may be further applicable to its use across a broad range of diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease [34], polycystic ovary syndrome [21], various types of cancers [20], and prevention of diabetes in individuals with prediabetic symptoms [35]. We also chose to include the first sampling point 24 hours after metformin administration in order to observe the effects as soon as possible and to avoid the potentially strong influence of diarrhea and other side effects known to occur after metformin administration. The generally accepted incidence of metformin-induced GI side effects is 20 \u2013 30% [36, 37]. However, our data agreed with recent reports [38, 39], as we observed a high rate of side effects in our study (50% of study group experienced strong and 33% experienced mild side effects). This could be explained by the rather high initial dose of metformin, or the possibility that the design of the recent studies was more feasible for patients, which ensured higher treatment adherence and higher rate of reporting side effects.",

In addition, a recent study using metagenome sequencing showed that metformin improves microbial gene richness among T2D patients, while metformin users generally have lower gene richness than healthy controls have [11]. It should be noted that, in our case, the reduction of diversity was observed at the markedly short time period of 24 hours, in the absence of diarrhea (only four participants experienced loose stools on the day 1). The small increase in inner diversity when comparing the M24h and M7d samples indicates the tendency of the gut microbiome to regain its ecological equilibrium even in participants experiencing diarrhea, as seen in the group of participants with severe side effects, in which nine people experienced loose stools or diarrhea. Likewise, this explains the growth of opportunistic pathogens including members from genus Escherichia-Shigella spp., which in previous studies has been associated with metformin treatment in T2D patients [11, 12]. Although, we cannot attribute the rapid increase of this genus between 24-hour and 7-day time points as a direct effect of metformin, this effect could be ensured by the trait of persistence of this genus [40] and high abilities to adapt [41]. Therefore, it can occupy the space open due to unfavorable conditions created by yet fully unknown effect of metformin. In other words, the reduced diversity in the gut presents Escherichia-Shigella spp. the free niche needed to emerge in larger numbers compared to the concurrent bacterial species. The connection between reduced alpha diversity and the further increase in the representation of opportunistic pathogens has been described before in the context of antibiotic treatment, various diseases and aging [11, 42\u201345].",

                    "text": "The characteristic GI side effects in most cases manifest at the beginning of metformin therapy and usually disappear after several weeks [46, 47]. Several species from Escherichia-Shigella spp. have been identified as pathogens [48]. Assuming that the reason for adverse effects may be an increase of such opportunistic pathogens from Escherichia-Shigella spp., later reduction of adverse reactions could be associated with specific characteristics of these taxonomic groups. Escherichia and Shigella are two closely related genera that share bioenergetic mechanisms that allow them to fill a specific niche in the gut microbiome ecosystem [49]. Despite a competitive advantage as a facultative anaerobe, the population of Escherichia coli is known to be dependent on substrates provided by polysaccharide-degrading anaerobes [50]. Thus, the rapid initial growth might be terminated by the lack of mono- and disaccharides caused by reduced abundance of anaerobic mucus-associated taxonomic groups and increased competition for the limited amount of energy substrates within the taxa. Also, T2D therapy accompanying a specific diet with reduced amount of simple carbohydrates [51] may play a role in limiting the amount of substrate. That could lead to further stabilization of the microbial ecosystem and recovery of metformin tolerance. Nevertheless, the initial side effects are the main reason for metformin discontinuation in 5% of patients [37]. Our results show an increased initial presence of Escherichia-Shigella spp. in the samples taken before metformin administration from the participants later experiencing side effects versus those without side effects (Escherichia-Shigella spp. below detectable limits). Development and implementation of a test for the presence of pathogens prior to metformin administration may allow stratification of treatment strategies (e.g. dose reduction or use of slow release forms) in high-risk patients.",

It has been suggested that, despite induction of GI associated side effects, metformin may also exert its positive effects through its capability to modulate the gut microbiome. The strongest observable and specific effect of metformin in our study was the reduction in abundance of the family Peptostreptococcaceae and three genera within it. Members of this family, in principle, have been associated with compromised health\u2013one of the most convincing examples being Clostridium difficile. Increased abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae has also been associated with such conditions as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [55], ulcerative colitis [56], and colorectal cancer [57], as well as with reduced lifespan [58]. In addition, reduced abundance of this family has been found in mice fed with a low-fat diet [59] or with calorie restrictions [58]. Interestingly, both families, significantly decreased by metformin, have been described to show similar response tendencies in various studies. Both Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae_1 possibly mediate the effect of eugenol treatment on mucus production in mice [60] and may be associated with dietary protein restriction induced improvement of ileal barrier function in pigs [61].",

Recently, it has been shown that metformin has a direct effect on some, but not all of the gut microbiome bacteria, that was demonstrated by decreased growth in the presence of metformin in vitro [12]. It is not yet clear whether these direct effects of metformin are sufficient to explain the broad range of taxa affected in gut. Alternatively, the microbiome changes at least in part can be the result of systemic effects of metformin on the host (e.g. altered enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and salts) as suggested in McCreight et al. (2016) [7]. Our data, however, show rapid metformin-induced effects, and thus are in favor of the direct action of metformin, although this has to be proven using additional in vitro studies.",

As this is an exploratory study without a placebo control arm, it would require additional randomized controlled trial in order to reach definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, our results indicate the possibility of developing a personalized approach in metformin therapy by pre-screening gut microbiota for abundance of opportunistic pathogens, followed by adjusted therapeutic strategies in patients with higher risk of developing side effects.",
