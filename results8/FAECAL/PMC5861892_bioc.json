We used a previously validated 34-item frailty index (FI34) to identify changes in gut microbiota community structure associated with biological age of community-dwelling adults. Stool 16S rRNA cDNA libraries from 85 subjects ranging in age (43\u201379) and FI34 score (0\u20130.365) were deep sequenced, denoised, and clustered using DADA2. Subject biological age but not chronological age correlated with a decrease in stool microbial diversity. Specific microbial genera were differentially abundant in the lower, middle, and upper 33rd percentiles of biological age. Using Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association and Statistical Inference (SPIEC-EASI) and Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), we identified modules of coabundant microbial genera that distinguished biological from chronological aging. A biological age-associated module composed of Eggerthella, Ruminococcus, and Coprobacillus genera was robust to correction for subject age, sex, body mass index, antibiotic usage, and other confounders. Subject FI34 score positively correlated with the abundance of this module, which exhibited a distinct inferred metagenome as predicted by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt). We conclude that increasing biological age in community-dwelling adults is associated with gastrointestinal dysbiosis.",

Frailty is not necessarily a function of one\u2019s chronological age. Persons of a given age are not at equal risk for adverse outcomes or shortened life expectancy (6).

In this same population, changes in GI microbiota have been suggested to more closely correlate with biological age than chronological age (16). Specific determinants of these observations and their potential significance in the frailty process remain to be fully explored. Moreover, geographic location has been shown to influence various properties of the GI microbiota (17). Using a 34-item frailty index (FI34) previously validated to predict mortality (18), we hypothesized that diversity in the gut microflora changes with biological aging in community-dwelling adults. We further hypothesized that these changes are more specifically related to one\u2019s estimated biological age rather than chronological age and that changes in the gut microbiota differentiate biological from chronological aging.",

Coabundant genera were identified by SPIEC-EASI ranging in correlation strength from \u22120.24 to 0.22 (Supplementary File 1B). Follow-up Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) on all positive correlations detected seven subcommunities or modules of co-occurring genera (represented as colors) numbering two to four per module (Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure 5 and File 1C). Genera that failed assignment to a module were given the color white and disconnected from other genera (Figure 4A). FI34 significantly and positively correlated with abundance of one module (turquoise; Figure 4A and \u200bandB,B, Supplementary Figure 6 and File 1D) after correction for clinical and technical covariates (p = 8 \u00d7 10\u20136) as well as false-discovery rate (q = 6 \u00d7 10\u20135). Omission of a potential outlying subject (FI34 = 0.365) yielded no change in findings (p = 3 \u00d7 10\u20134, q = 2 \u00d7 10\u20133). Chronological age positively correlated with one module after similar correction for covariates (green, p = .02, q = 0.17; Figure 4A and \u200bandB,B, Supplementary Figure 7 and File 1D). Comparable results were observed when modeling subject family membership as a random- or fixed-effect (Supplementary File 1A). Family membership as well as BMI, sex, and antibiotic usage failed to significantly associate with turquoise or green module abundances (p > .05, data not shown). Sample read count modestly correlated with turquoise and green module abundances (q < 0.03). Spearman rho correlation coefficients between turquoise module abundance and FI34 as well as green module abundance and chronological age were 0.25 and 0.26, respectively. Turquoise module members consisted of Eggerthella, Coprobacillus, and Lachnospiraceae-family (Lachn.) Ruminococcus. The green module comprised Haemophilus and Veillonella. Biological and chronological-aging-associated module relative abundances were comparable (1.4% \u00b1 0.06% and 1.7% \u00b1 0.09%, respectively, p = .16). The prevalences of the turquoise module genera approximated that of the green module genera (37% \u00b1 7% and 59% \u00b1 6%, respectively, p = .13).",

Module biochemical pathways were inferred from the annotated reference genomes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (27). The presence or absence of 6,909 KEGG protein-coding genes was examined in each module (Supplementary Figure 8A). Clustering modules by similarity in KEGG gene content revealed a high degree of variability between modules, suggesting potential module-specific biological activities (vertical dendrogram, Supplementary Figure 8A). Turquoise and green module predicted metagenomes were directly compared. Turquoise and green shared numerous KEGG genes that together made up 64% and 60% of their respective inferred KEGG gene contents (Supplementary Figure 8B). KEGG genes were grouped into canonical biochemical pathways for assessment of higher functionality. Many genes shared between the turquoise and green modules belonged to core biological functions such as amino acid and nucleic acid metabolism, DNA replication and repair, ribosome assembly, and protein translation (Supplementary Figure 9). The remaining unshared genes differentiated the turquoise and green modules (Supplementary Figure 8C). Turquoise and green modules differed primarily in genes associated with \u201cmetabolism\u201d and \u201cenvironmental information processing\u201d followed by \u201cgenetic information processing\u201d and \u201ccellular processes\u201d (Supplementary Figure 8C).

These changes were robust to correction for potential confounders of the gut microbiota that include BMI and recent antibiotic usage. We additionally corrected for participant family relatedness arising from the sampling methodology of this study\u2019s parent study, which has identified a genetic basis of aging and longevity (18). We were unable to identify a relationship between family membership and the gut microbiota in this study.

We confirmed previously reported observations that frailty correlates with combined measures of richness and evenness in subject stool samples (15). However, we then differentiated between the two domains of alpha-diversity to clarify the impact of each in association with biological aging. This is necessary as changes in microbial dominance or abundance equitability (evenness) is biologically distinct from the introduction or loss of whole species in the GI microbial community (richness). Colonization of the GI tract by a wide range of species may be key for normal GI resilience to changes in environment, including new disability, hospitalization, institutionalization, or other frailty-related complications. Our data suggest that biological age, compared with chronological age, may more accurately reflect the risk of community-dwelling adults for complications due to decreased intestinal richness, which is associated with commensal opportunism, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation (9,30,31).",

We thus explored how well biological age or chronological age predicted between-subject taxonomic relatedness in gut microbiota. We found that FI34 scores significantly grouped subjects by microbiota phylogenetic similarity. Thus, gut microbial community structure varies according to subject FI34 scores and tends to be similar between subjects of similar FI34 score but not so for those of similar chronological age. Repeating this analysis for abundance-weighted between-sample differences in OTU taxonomy abolished the correlation between biological age and beta-diversity. This suggests that (a) biological aging more strongly influences the taxonomic membership of intestinal microbial communities but not member relative abundance or that (b) our sample size is insufficient to identify a relationship between biological age and a composite index of abundance and taxonomic relatedness. We addressed (b) by normalizing OTU counts to stabilize variance, which has been shown to increase the sensitivity of detection of between-sample differences (32). Variance-stabilized weighted differences improved correlation significance; however, these differences still fell below the threshold of significance for association with biological age.",

Coprobacillus was additionally assigned to a WGCNA module that independently and positively correlated with subject frailty. The WGCNA workflow groups OTUs into modules based strictly on OTU coabundance patterns unbiased to clinical variables. Modules are then later correlated against clinical variables such as chronological age or FI34 score.

Together these measures may reveal the most salient and robust coabundance relationships between microbial organisms in human stool. In turn, we identified a frailty-associated coabundance module consisting of Eggerthella, Coprobacillus, and Lachn. Ruminococcus, all of which have been previously reported as individual correlates of frailty (13,15).

Although this analysis alone does not replace true metagenomic deep-sequencing, it does offer hypotheses and potential targets to guide the design of future metagenome sequencing studies. In our study, the biological age-associated turquoise module was predicted to contain genes responsible for bacterial persistence in the gut such as sporulation and germination and bacterial motility (Supplementary File 1E). Bacterial motility proteins were particularly present in Eggerthella (Supplementary Figure 10) and included those for bacterial ciliary function, which is known to confer adherence to epithelial surfaces in some species (34). Genes for sporulation were sequestered in Coprobacillus and Lachn. Ruminococcus (Supplementary Figure 10 and File 1F). Interestingly, the latter two have been historically reported as nonspore formers based on findings in insult-free, anaerobic, axenic cultures (35) despite the presence of major genetic determinants of sporulation including the Spo0A master regulator (KEGG ID: K07699, Supplementary File 1G) (36). Recent work has found that culturing conditions favoring sporulation are, however, critical to reveal this phenotype, and many previous \u201cnonspore formers\u201d such as Lachn. Ruminococcus gnavus, Blautia producta, and others observed in our cohort, indeed form spores when (a) challenged with ethanol and atmospheric air and (b) grown in polymicrobial culture (37). This study further concluded that spore formation likely promotes survival of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the human gut as well as their transmission between individuals in the environment (37). We speculate that these factors may support microbial growth, transmission, and virulence in the gut of individuals undergoing biological aging.",

                    "text": "Knowledge of the pathways encoded in coabundant microbial genomes may illuminate mechanisms of co-operation in potentially virulent organisms. Recent work has revealed novel virulence factors in key species of Eggerthella and Lachn. family Ruminococcus. Ruminococcus species including R. gnavus have been shown to secrete mucolytic alpha- and beta-glucosidases that may sensitize mucous sugars and mucin protein to degradation and consumption by other, co-cultured microbial species (38). Eggerthella is completely dependent on amino acid harvest for energy and may benefit from the activity of Lachn. Ruminococcus (39). In addition, Eggerthella is predicted to produce acetaldehyde from threonine (KEGG ID: K01620, Supplementary File 1G), which is characteristically abundant in mucin proteins (40) and may serve as substrate to increase gut barrier permeability (41). In turn, co-operation may encourage growth, epithelial attachment, and invasion of Eggerthella lenta, which has been recently shown to adhere to the surface of gut epithelial Caco-2 cells in vitro (34) and has been reported in numerous cases of elderly bacteremia (42,43). In our cohort, Eggerthella and Lachn. family Ruminococcus genera were significantly coabundant. One hundred percentage of Eggerthella OTUs were specifically assigned to E. lenta and 99% of Lachn. Ruminococcus were assigned to R. gnavus. Whether Eggerthella spp. co-operate with Lachn. Ruminococcus spp. to achieve virulence in the gut of frail persons through mucolysis remains to be experimentally investigated. If validated, co-operation between virulent symbionts may drive chronic low-grade inflammation and subsequently the aging process and frailty trajectory (44).",

Previous studies have demonstrated that Eggerthella directly inactivate cardiac glycosides such as digoxin (46). Increased Eggerthella abundance in frail persons may yet prove as an emerging biomarker of frailty as future studies further characterize its role in frailty syndrome.",

Custom designed stool collection kits were provided to participants designed to minimize variation in sampling effort. It is difficult to completely control for subject-to-subject variation due to at-home sampling. In addition, luminal microbial communities may differ from communities more proximal to the gut epithelium such as those in the outer mucous layer (47). How these differences translate physiologically for the host is a question of on-going research. The outer mucous layer is known to constitutively migrate into the luminal space throughout the GI tract (48), and its accumulation and clearance in stool may mitigate these differences to some degree.",

Biological age correlated with the growth of specific, coabundant organisms in the gut lumen, which differentiated biological from chronological age. Further study of these changes and their role in aging physiology may open the field to the development of novel therapy. Specific interventions reversing or slowing these and other changes in the gut microbiota may promote healthy aging in prefrail or frail persons.",
