ABR has become a major global clinical problem with the emergence of multidrug resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) [2]. ABR may arise in a number of different ways, including the accumulation of point mutations and horizontal gene transfer from other bacterial populations through transformation, transduction and/or conjugation [1, 3, 4]. The increased use of antibiotics in agriculture and healthcare has led to a dramatic increase in the prevalence and incidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, presenting a severe challenge in the treatment of patients infected with these multidrug resistant organisms.",

C. difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming, toxin producing bacteria that is present in 3% of the healthy adult population; however, up to 20%\u201350% of adults in hospitals and long-term care facilities become colonized [6]. CDI is treated with metronidazole or vancomycin, but the risk of the recurrence is 20%\u201330% within 30 days of initial treatment and increases further up to 50% after a second episode [7, 8]. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as an effective and safe therapy for recurrent C. difficile infection (RCDI), with over an 80% success rate [9]. This study was designed to analyze the gut resistome in patients with RCDI undergoing FMT and to examine how FMT influences the ABR profile of the recipients. We hypothesized that patients with RCDI would harbor large numbers of antibiotic-resistant microbes and that FMT would reduce the number of antibiotic-resistant genes.",

Outputs were visualized in MEGAN (version 5) for taxonomic assignment and reads aligned using Bowtie2 against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). CARD contains 6020 different sequences from 4120 genes related to ABR, 3008 of which are tagged specifically for ABR, consisting of 31 different antibiotic classes [11]. Following alignment to CARD, the total read count was 5414 reads, with 228 different ABR genes detected as having at least a single read in one sample. In the HMP cohort there were 671 total reads, with 143 different ABR genes detected in at least one sample. Genes with different accession numbers but with \u226598% sequence similarity were grouped together and not considered distinct genes for the analysis. Positive detection of an ABR gene was considered if there was >0 read counts in just one of the samples for initial analysis.",

RCDI patients had increased numbers of ABR genes compared with donors (Figure \u200b(Figure33A).

Beta-lactam, multidrug efflux pumps, fluoroquinolone, and antibiotic inactivation ABR gene classes were increased in the RCDI cohorts compared with donors. The RCDI patient cohort that responded to a single FMT had the highest number of ABR genes with 73 unique and a total of 151. Patients who required a repeat FMT had 25 unique and a total of 101 ABR genes (Figure \u200b(Figure44B; Supplementary Figure 3). The donor cohort had 14 unique ABR genes and a total of 26, the majority of which were tetracycline antibiotic resistant genes. Although ABR genes were still detected in our donor cohort, 76% of those ABR genes detected were observed in fewer than 10% of the 29 donor samples and did not appear in the top 100 most detected ABR genes (Supplementary Figure 3). Three of the tetracycline genes were detected in 90% of the healthy donors; these included tet (W), tet (O), and tet (Q). In the healthy cohort from the HMP, tet (W) was also highly detected and was found in 45% of the individuals. The genes detected in the RCDI patients prior to FMT belonged to a total of 31 different ABR classes, where only one was unique to each of the RCDI cohorts and none to the donor cohorts (Figure \u200b(Figure44C). Seventeen classes were shared among all 3 cohorts, whereas 11 were unique to the RCDI patient cohorts. These were most evident in the classes of glycopeptide resistance, polymyxin resistance, sulfonamide resistance, lipopeptide resistance, streptothricin resistance, and peptide ABR (Supplementary Figure 3). The sole class that was unique to the single FMT cohort was genes conferring fosfomycin resistance, whereas the class unique to the repeated FMT cohort was genes conferring trimethoprim resistance.\n",

In sum, 90% of the donor samples had all 3 of the ABR genes, tet (O), tet (Q), and tet (W). Genes within the antibiotic classes of tetracycline, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, macrolides, erythromycin, and multidrug efflux were the most prevalent antibiotic classes detected on the microarray, similar to what was seen in the metagenomic data. Samples taken from the donors were analyzed for stability over time on the microarray and RDCI recipients for similarity to the donor. Antibiotic resistant profiles in the donors remained relatively constant over the period of donation (Figure \u200b(Figure55A). Figure \u200bFigure55B shows percent similarity of the single FMT RCDI patients to their respective donor before FMT and PFT. Following a successful FMT, the resistome of the recipient became more similar to the resistome of the donor and this was maintained up to a year following the FMT. In contrast, in the RCDI patients who failed the first FMT, the resistome did not become more similar to the donor (Figure \u200b(Figure55C). However, following the second successful FMT, the resistome did become more similar to the donor, although there was more variability in this group compared with the single FMT group.\n",

In congruence with our data, it has been previously shown that genes conferring resistance to the antibiotic tetracycline are present in the microbiota of the majority of individuals and are also the most abundant family of resistance genes [12, 13]. The majority of the ABR genes detected in the healthy stool donors are found predominately within Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, whereas ABR genes in the RCDI patients are found almost exclusively in Proteobacteria with a small number in Firmicutes [14]. This increased load and diversity of ABR genes likely reflects the significant dysbiosis that was seen in the RCDI patients with predominance of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella.",

This would suggest that the change in the ABR gene profile was likely due to the change in microbial composition, in particular the reduction in Proteobacteria induced by the FMT. However, although we did show a significant reduction in total Proteobacteria in patients following FMT, it is also possible that FMT reduced their abundance to below our limit of detection [15, 16]. Nonetheless, case reports showing eradication of multidrug-resistant organisms in patients following FMT together with evidence from a murine study suggesting that multidrug-resistant bacteria such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella penumoniae (CRKP) can be eliminated from the gut following FMT supports the potential for this procedure [17, 18, 19]. The elimination of bacteria harboring ABR genes is thought to be a direct result of the ability of FMT to reestablish a healthy gut ecosystem, which provides colonization resistance against pathogens by removing favorable growth conditions [20].",

Although selective digestive decontamination together with the intravenous administration of antibiotics has shown benefit as an infection prevention measure in critically ill patients [21\u201323], the problem arises in that this regimen is associated with dramatic increases in ABR genes [24]. In addition, once the treatment is discontinued, the patients remained colonized with these multidrug-resistant pathogens, and as the gut becomes recolonized following removal of antibiotics an increased horizontal transfer of resistance genes from the surviving organisms to opportunistic aerobic pathogens may occur [25]. Eradication of virulent organisms containing ABR genes from the gut may also help in alleviating systemic infections, as studies have shown pathogenic organisms to predominate in the gut prior to translocating to and infecting other body sites [26]. Thus, these findings have significant clinical implications and suggest that FMT may have a role beyond that in treating patients with RCDI.",

In that the average age of our donors (36 years) was less than that of the patients (67 years), the increased ABR genes in the RCDI cohort could theoretically have arisen even without prolonged exposure to antibiotics. However, in that the linear regression of our data comparing age and number of ABR genes showed no significant correlation, it is more likely that the increase in ABR genes in this cohort was related to their extensive antibiotic usage.",
