We hypothesized that ethnically distinct UC patients exhibit discrete gut microbiotas with unique metabolic programming that differentially influence immune activity and clinical status. Using parallel 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer 2 sequencing of fecal samples (UC, 30; healthy, 13), we corroborated previous observations of UC-associated bacterial diversity depletion and demonstrated significant Saccharomycetales expansion as characteristic of UC gut dysbiosis. Furthermore, we identified four distinct microbial community states (MCSs) within our cohort, confirmed their existence in an independent UC cohort, and demonstrated their coassociation with both patient ethnicity and disease severity. Each MCS was uniquely enriched for specific amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism pathways and exhibited significant luminal enrichment of the metabolic products of these pathways. Using a novel ex vivo human dendritic cell and T-cell coculture assay, we showed that exposure to fecal water from UC patients caused significant Th2 skewing in CD4+ T-cell populations compared to that of healthy participants. In addition, fecal water from patients in whom their MCS was associated with the highest level of disease severity induced the most dramatic Th2 skewing. Combined with future investigations, these observations could lead to the identification of highly resolved UC subsets based on defined microbial gradients or discrete microbial features that may be exploited for the development of novel, more effective therapies.",

These findings offer new insight into the potential value of the gut microbiome as a tool for subdividing UC patients, opening avenues to the development of more personalized treatment plans and targeted therapies.",

Increasingly, disease endotypes have been described among patients within clinically defined chronic inflammatory diseases (2), suggesting that, in the context of immune dysfunction, distinct pathogenic processes may converge upon a common clinical disorder. Since UC pathogenesis is related to gut microbiome composition, we rationalized that factors that dictate the composition and function of these communities may lead to the development of distinct gut microbiome states that function as discrete pathogenic units to deterministically influence immune activation status and disease severity.",

Indeed, healthy subjects in the United States, Venezuela, and Malawi exhibit a significant relationship between ethnicity and both the composition and function of the fecal microbiota, with diet representing strong selective pressure on the gut microbial assemblage (4). Independently, Frank et al. demonstrated that in a U.S. cohort, IBD risk alleles ATG16L1 and NOD2 (associated with autophagy and the host response to microbes, respectively) are significantly associated with gut microbiome \u03b2 diversity (5). However, a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies indicated that such UC risk alleles characteristic of Caucasian populations do not confer a heightened risk on ethnically distinct north Indian subjects (6). On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that distinct pathogenic microbiotas exist within UC patients that covary with both patient ethnicity and disease severity. Given the emerging evidence of gut microbial metabolic dysfunction as a characteristic of immune activation (7), we further postulated that these distinct pathogenic microbiotas exhibit a predictable program of luminal metabolism that induces significantly different degrees of Th2 activation.",

Several studies have examined bacterial community composition in fecal samples from UC patients; however, to date, none have examined the mycobiome of adult UC patients. Using parallel, high-resolution bacterial (16S rRNA) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer 2 [ITS2]) biomarker gene profiles, we confirmed that our ethnically restricted UC population exhibited bacterial microbiota dysbiosis consistent with that previously described (1). Compared to healthy subjects, UC patients had significantly reduced \u03b1-diversity (P = 0.010; Fig.\u00a01a) and were compositionally distinct (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA]: weighted UniFrac, R2 = 0.058, P = 0.023) (Fig.\u00a01b). Neither fungal \u03b1- or \u03b2-diversity differed between healthy and UC patients (P = 0.523; see Fig.\u00a0S1a in the supplemental material) (PERMANOVA: Bray-Curtis, R2 = 0.038, P = 0.129; see Fig.\u00a0S1b), indicating that while profound bacterial depletion is characteristic of the UC gut microbiota, more subtle changes in fungal taxonomy characterize these patients.",

Healthy EU and SA participants exhibited no significant difference in bacterial or fungal \u03b1 diversity (see Fig.\u00a0S1C and D in the supplemental material). However, SA-UC patients consistently exhibited less bacterial diversity than either healthy ethnically matched controls or EU UC patients (see Fig.\u00a0S1c). They also were significantly depleted of fungal diversity compared to the EU UC group (see Fig.\u00a0S1d), indicating more severe interkingdom microbiome depletion in these patients, though no difference in clinical disease severity between EU and SA-UC patients was observed (see Fig.\u00a0S1e). Ethnicity was also significantly associated with bacterial, but not fungal, \u03b2 diversity when all of the participants were considered (see Fig.\u00a0S1f and g). Because health status was significantly associated with gut microbial composition (Fig.\u00a01b), it represented a potential confounding factor. We therefore repeated PERMANOVA with only UC patients and showed that, while fungal community composition does not exhibit a significant relationship with patient ethnicity (PERMANOVA: Bray-Curtis, R2 = 0.061, P = 0.107), bacterial \u03b2 diversity does (PERMANOVA: weighted UniFrac, R2 = 0.075, P = 0.039; Fig.\u00a01e), an observation validated by PhyloChip data (see Fig.\u00a0S1h). Thus, these data indicate that, despite chronic colonic inflammatory disease, ethnicity remains associated with compositionally distinct bacterial communities in the UC gut, though it explains only a small proportion (7.5%) of the observed variation in \u03b2 diversity across these patients.",

Using hierarchical cluster analysis and multiscale bootstrap resampling, we identified four subgroups of UC patients based on fecal bacterial community composition and termed these microbial community state 1 (MCS1) to MCS4 (Fig.\u00a02). These distinct patient subgroups were confirmed by PERMANOVA with both 16S rRNA sequence and PhyloChip data (see Fig.\u00a0S2a and b in the supplemental material).

MCS1 patients exhibited more severe disease with higher median SCCA scores, a significant increase in the number extracolonic manifestations, a greater number of first- and second-degree relatives diagnosed with IBD, and longer disease duration (Fig.\u00a03).

These MCS-specific bacterial enrichments extended beyond the dominant family and were further emphasized when the highest disease severity group (MCS1) was compared to each of the other three groups (MCS2, -3, or -4). Specifically, a majority of the bacterial taxa enriched in MCS1 were members of the Bacteroides genus, while the other subgroups were enriched for Blautia, Ruminococcus (MCS2), Prevotella (MCS3), or Bifidobacterium (MCS4, generalized linear models, P < 0.05) species (see Fig.\u00a0S2d and Table\u00a0S2a in the supplemental material). Using the dominant bacterial family as a classifier, we validated the existence of MCS1 and -2 (the two major MCSs in EU UC patients) in two publicly available UC microbiota data sets obtained from patients primarily of European descent (see Fig.\u00a0S3) (9, 11), indicating that these MCSs are not exclusive to our study but exist in UC patient populations nationwide. Mycologically, C.\u00a0albicans and Debaryomyces species were most highly enriched in MCS1 patients compared to each of the other three MCSs (generalized linear models, P < 0.05) (see Table\u00a0S2b), indicating that interkingdom gut microbiome expansion of Bacteroides species, C.\u00a0albicans, and Debaryomyces species is associated with more severe UC disease.",

Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt; http://picrust.github.io/picrust/) (13) was used to predict bacterial functional capacity. Presently, this algorithm cannot be used to predict fungal community function. Predicted metabolic capacity varied significantly by MCS (PERMANOVA: Bray-Curtis, R2 = 0.384, P = 0.002). A total of 144 bacterial KEGG pathways discriminated MCS1 to -4, including those involved in amino acid and lipid biosynthesis and metabolism (Kruskal-Wallis test, q < 0.0006) (see Table\u00a0S3a and Fig.\u00a0S4 in the supplemental material). Specifically, differential enrichment of glycerolipid, fatty acid, inositol, and multiple amino acid metabolism pathways, including phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, glutamate, and glutamine, differentiated these groups (see Table\u00a0S3a and Fig.\u00a0S4). We also generated functional predictions for MCS1 and -2 stool samples from the studies of Morgan et al. and Gevers et al. (9, 11). A total of 121 KEGG pathways were differentially enriched between MCS1 and MCS2 in our study; of these, 74 (61.2%) also discriminated MCS1 from MCS2 in both the data sets of Gevers et al. and Morgan et al., indicating a high degree of conserved microbial function associated with MCS1 and -2 across multiple independent studies (see Table\u00a0S3b).",

Indeed, each MCS exhibited significantly distinct metabolic programs (PERMANOVA: Canberra, R2 = 0.209, P = 0.004) that were significantly related to both the fecal microbiota present (Mantel test, r = 0.38, P < 0.0001) (see Table\u00a0S4a) and its predicted metagenome (Mantel test, r = 0.21, P < 0.008) (see Table\u00a0S4a). We were particularly interested in those luminal metabolites that discriminated the more severe MCS1 from each of the remaining MCSs. Of the 805 metabolites detected across all of the samples, 207 exhibited significant inter-MCS differences in relative concentration (Welch\u2019s t\u00a0test, P < 0.05) (Fig.\u00a05; see Tables\u00a0S4b to d). Compared to MCS groups with lower disease severity, MCS1, as our in silico predictions suggested, was significantly enriched for ophthalmate (a biomarker of increased oxidative stress and depleted glutathione) (14), oxidative-stress-inducing putrescine (15), proinflammatory p-cresol sulfate (16), 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid and (9-HODE) and 13-HODE (a proinflammatory, leukocyte-recruiting monohydroxy fatty acid) (17, 18), and 9,10-dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (9,10-DiHOME; a neutrophil-recruiting, cytotoxic dihydroxy fatty acid) (19), as well as bioactive lysolipids involved in leukocyte activation (Fig.\u00a06; see Table\u00a0S4b to d) (18, 20). In contrast, lower disease severity MCSs (MCS2, -3, and -4) were enriched for a range of potentially protective dipeptides (including anti-inflammatory alanyl-glutamine) (21, 22), \u03b3-glutamyl dipeptides indicative of improved oxidative stress coping mechanisms (23), and antioxidant immunosuppressive myo-inositol (24, 25).

We therefore hypothesized that the luminal milieus associated with distinct MCSs differentially influence CD4+ T-cell activation in a manner consistent with disease severity. To assess this, we developed an ex vivo assay involving coincubation of human dendritic cells (DCs; obtained from healthy donors) with filter-sterilized fecal water prepared from study participants\u2019 feces. DCs were then cocultured with autologous CD4+ T cells prior to analyses of T-cell phenotypes and cytokine productivity. Compared to healthy participants, UC patients exhibited a significant reduction in the ratio of Th1 to Th2 cells, significantly increased numbers of both Th1 and Th17 cells, and trends toward increases in both T-regulatory and Th2 cell populations (linear mixed effects, P < 0.05) (Fig.\u00a06a to \u200btoe).e). CD8+ T-cell subsets did not differ significantly between healthy participants and UC patients (data not shown).

With the exception of a minor significant increase in Th1 populations in response to MCS4 fecal water, no significant differences in overall Th1 or Th2 cell populations were observed between MCS groups and controls (Fig.\u00a06f and \u200bandg).g). However, when the Th1-to-Th2 ratio was calculated for each group, the MCS1 group exclusively exhibited a significantly lower Th1-to-Th2 ratio compared with healthy controls (Fig.\u00a06h). Of note, no difference in the Th1-to-Th2 ratio was observed when UC patients were compared on the basis of ethnicity (EU UC versus SA UC, see Fig.\u00a0S5 in the supplemental material), providing evidence that patient ethnicity alone is not responsible for the altered T-cell activity observed ex vivo. Furthermore, when considering the two MCSs demonstrating the greatest difference in disease severity (MCS1 and MCS2), only MCS1 fecal water significantly increased secretion of Th2-associated cytokines compared with healthy controls (Fig.\u00a06i to \u200btok).k).

Colitis development necessitates microbial involvement, and gut microbiome dysbiosis is characteristic of adult UC patients, but while genetic, therapeutic, and environmental factors are related to UC bacterial \u03b2 diversity, they explain a small proportion of the observed variation in these microbial communities (5, 9). Microbial species engage in inter- and intraspecies interactions that dictate coassociated microbes and their physiology (27, 28). For example, C.\u00a0albicans coaggregates with specific bacterial species in the oral microbiota, facilitating more robust, stress-resistant mixed-species biofilms (27). In turn, the products of these coassociated bacteria induce a physiological shift toward unicellular morphology in C.\u00a0albicans (27). Similarly, because of metabolic cross-feeding, Streptococcus gordonii facilitates coassociation with Fusobacterium nucleatum (28). Hence, we rationalized that, under the proinflammatory conditions of the colitic gut, distinct patterns of pathogen coassociation occur whose composition and function are relatively conserved across patients and related to immune activation and disease severity. Our data support the existence of four distinct UC MCSs that differ significantly in their prevalence along ethnic divides. Internal and external validation confirmed the existence of the predominant microbiota states, indicating that, despite inherent patient variability, treatment regimens, and geography, conserved patterns of pathogenic microbiota coassociation exist across UC populations within the United States. To improve our understanding of the progression and development of these MCSs, it will be important for future studies to investigate UC patient factors, be they temporal, clinical, genetic, or environmental, that directly drive the microbiome toward these differential microbial states.",

MCS1 characteristically exhibited expansion of Bacteroides species, which can produce enterotoxin previously associated with UC, stimulate interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) secretion in intestinal epithelial cells, and intensify colitis symptoms in a murine model of UC (29,\u201331). MCS1 patients also exhibited the greatest expansion of C.\u00a0albicans and Debaryomyces species. Gut microbial expansion of these fungal species has also been described in adult and pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease, as well as pediatric IBD (Crohn\u2019s disease and UC patients combined) (10, 32, 33). Together with our study, these data indicate that expansion of Saccharomycetales fungi in the context of depleted bacterial diversity is a consistent feature of IBD in pediatric and adult populations. Whether C.\u00a0albicans directly influences UC pathology in patients in our study is unclear. However, gastrointestinal colonization by C.\u00a0albicans impairs gastrointestinal healing in both UC patients and a murine model of UC and can induce a Th2 response following gastrointestinal infection of mice with antimicrobial-depleted gut microbiota diversity (34, 35).",

Prevotella species (enriched in MCS3) are capable of suppressing lymphocyte activity, while Bifidobacterium species (enriched in MCS4) can reduce the production of both IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 in intestinal epithelial cells (39, 40). It should be noted that one patient in our study, who demonstrated a dramatic enrichment of Porphyromonadaceae (Fig.\u00a02; see Fig.\u00a0S2a and b in the supplemental material), was not classified as having one of the four main MCSs identified here and, though removed from our analysis, may represent an additional, clinically relevant MCS that, given additional patient enrollments, future studies may further characterize and draw conclusions from. Though confirmation that the MCSs identified in our study are also present in independent UC microbiome studies indicates the relative durability of these microbial states, their long-term stability cannot be assessed in cross-sectional studies. It is likely that these MCSs represent discrete points along a nonlinear continuum of pathogenic microbial successional states that relate to disease progression and severity, similar to the microbial gradient identified by Gevers et al. in pediatric Crohn\u2019s disease (11). Though these cross-sectional studies are informative, more expansive, longitudinal studies are necessary to determine the natural history of the gut microbiome in UC development and progression.",

                    "text": "While interkingdom microbial taxonomic states represent an economical means to stratify patients in large studies, the functional capacity and productivity of these compositionally discrete pathogenic microbiota are paramount to dictating host immune responses and clinical disease severity. Indeed, in our study, programs of metabolic productivity idiosyncratic to the predicted pathways encoded by bacteria present in each MCS were identified. In particular, 9-HODE, 13-HODE, 9,10-DiHOME, and lysophosphatidylcholines (significantly enriched in MCS1) can increase leukocyte recruitment and proinflammatory cytokine secretion (17,\u201320). Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, which prevent 9,10-DiHOME formation, attenuate UC in both chemical and genetic murine models (41), underscoring a potential role for these oxylipins as contributors to more severe disease and that treatments inhibiting their production may be especially efficacious in this specific patient subgroup. In addition to enrichment of leukocyte chemotactic metabolites, MCS1 patients also had high fecal concentrations of p-cresol sulfate, a microbe-derived metabolite (42), and putrescine, both of which can stimulate a leukocyte oxidative burst (15, 16). Consistent with these observations, ophthalmate was also enriched in MCS1 patients, indicative of greater oxidative stress due to low or depleted levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching glutathione (14). While the metabolome of high disease severity MCS1 indicated conditions of high oxidative stress, that of UC MCSs associated with lower disease severity (MCS2 to -4) exhibited an increased capacity for ROS quenching due to enhanced \u03b3-glutamyltransferase activity indicated by enrichment of \u03b3-glutamyl amino acids (critical for maintaining glutathione levels) and high concentrations of superoxide scavenging myo-inositol (23, 24). Metabolic signatures indicative of immunosuppressive activity, such as enrichment of anti-inflammatory dipeptides (i.e., alanyl-glutamine) and myo-inositol (both of which decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and reduce leukocyte recruitment in animal models of colitis) (21, 22, 25), were also observed in MCS2 to -4 with lower disease severity. This suggests that the specific metabolic productivity associated with each MCS may govern host immune activity and resulting differences in UC severity.",

                    "text": "MCS-associated luminal products, which include host- and/or microbe-derived immunomodulatory metabolites, provide a multifaceted mechanism by which a pathogenic gut microbiota may influence host physiology and dictate clinical disease severity. Though pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) have traditionally been considered paramount to driving host immune responses to microbes, emerging data in the field of immuno-metabolism indicate that microbe-derived metabolites are equally effective in dictating immune cell phenotypes. In addition to the established direct immunomodulatory activity of microbe-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids or p-cresol sulfate (16, 38), recent studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiota-associated metabolites taurine, histamine, and spermine comodulate NLRP6 inflammasome signaling, epithelial IL-18 secretion, and downstream antimicrobial peptide production (43). Indeed, our data suggest that specific programs of microbe-derived metabolism in combination with an array of PAMPs presented by pathogenic bacteria and fungi in the distal gut of UC patients serve as effective drivers of immune dysfunction related to UC disease severity. Support for this concept comes from our demonstration ex vivo that sterile fecal water from the most severely ill MCS1 patients induced the greatest degree of Th2 skewing in T-cell populations and associated cytokine production, a feature not observed among the other subgroups with less severe disease. While this observation does not directly implicate the microbiome as a causative agent of UC, it does provide evidence of the ability of the microbiome to perpetuate the inflammation and symptoms associated with UC in a manner specific to microbiota composition. This finding also indicates that the Th2 skew traditionally considered characteristic of UC patients (26) is not a consistent finding across our cohort and may, in fact, be driven by the most severely ill patients in UC cohorts (i.e., MCS1). Whether or not different inflammatory phenotypes present among UC patients select for phenotype-maintaining microbes or are the result of initial, discrete dysbioses remains to be addressed. Regardless, this raises the possibility that distinct immunological features not examined in this study characterize patients with lower disease activity and distinct gut MCSs. Future larger studies will be important in further characterizing the potential immunomodulatory contributions of theses MCSs while confirming the observations presented here. Hence, therapies tailored to the specific microbial, metabolic, and immune dysfunctions exhibited by UC patient subgroups may prove a highly efficacious strategy for more effective treatment of this disease.",
