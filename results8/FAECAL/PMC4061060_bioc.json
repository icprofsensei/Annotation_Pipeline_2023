However, these microbiomes are not readily available from public culture collections, hampering their potential for widespread use. The main reason for this lack of availability is the lack of an effective cryopreservation protocol. Due to this critical need, we evaluated the functionality as well as the community structure of three different types of microbiomes before and after cryopreservation with two cryoprotective agents (CPA). Microbiomes were selected based upon relevance towards applications: (1) a methanotrophic co-culture (MOB), with potential for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, environmental pollutants removal and bioplastics production; (2) an oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification/denitrification (OLAND) biofilm, with enhanced economic and ecological benefits for wastewater treatment, and (3) fecal material from a human donor, with potential applications for fecal transplants and pre/probiotics research. After three months of cryopreservation at \u221280\u00b0C, we found that metabolic activity, in terms of the specific activity recovery of MOB, aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB) and anaerobic AOB (AnAOB, anammox) in the OLAND mixed culture, resumes sooner when one of our selected CPA [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and DMSO plus trehalose and tryptic soy broth (DMSO+TT)] was added. However, the activity of the fecal community was not influenced by the CPA addition, although the preservation of the community structure (as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing) was enhanced by addition of CPA. In summary, we have evaluated a cryopreservation protocol that succeeded in preserving both community structure and functionality of value-added microbiomes. This will allow individual laboratories and culture collections to boost the use of microbiomes in biotechnological applications.",

The latter strategy has been gaining importance since the last decade [1], [3], [6], [8], [9] and in certain applications microbiomes are known to outperform pure cultures [9]\u2013[13]. Hence, the use of mixed microbial communities is interesting both from a purely scientific point of view as well as from the viewpoint of practical applications. Nonetheless, no optimized approach to maintain a reproducible mixed community inoculum is available to date (even when correcting the inherent variability found in mixed bacterial communities (i.e. community dynamics [7]).",

In non-BRC labs the preservation method of freezing at \u221280\u00b0C is preferred over freeze-drying or other drying techniques, because of the direct access to electrical freezers for most researchers and the straightforwardness of the procedure [16]. To avoid cellular damage during cryopreservation and subsequent thawing, a wide array of cryoprotective agents (CPA) has been applied. Of these, cryopreservation with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is comparatively more successful than the commonly used glycerol [17]. Moreover, recent studies on preservation of fastidious pure cultures have shown the effectiveness of complex media for cryopreservation of methanotrophic bacteria (MOB) [18], aerobic and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB and AnAOB) [19], [20] and nitrite oxidizing bacteria [21]. These complex cryopreservation media exploit the concerted protective effects of a fast penetrating CPA (DMSO) and the innate cryoprotective effects of carbon-rich media (Trehalose and Tryptic Soy Broth, TT). Apart from the choice of CPA, which has been indicated to be one of the most determining factors for cryopreservation success [17], a rigorous protocol for freezing, thawing, resuscitation and storage with as less temperature variations as possible is essential for successful cryopreservation [16].",

Among the described preservation methodologies, the use of DMSO and DMSO+TT as CPA has been evaluated for highly enriched anammox communities, without further evaluation of the community structure [20]. The preservation of the activity of anammox enrichments has also been evaluated at \u221260\u00b0C (not at \u221280\u00b0C) without evaluation of DMSO as a CPA but with evaluation of community changes by means of comparative FISH [25]. Cryopreservation of gel entrapped nitrifying sludge has also been evaluated [26] but not with DMSO as a CPA, nor with further evaluation of the community structure. The recovery of both activity and community structure (evaluated with DGGE) have been evaluated for cryopreserved denitrifying biomass [24]. However, DMSO nor TT were incorporated as CPA in the study design. Finally, cryopreservation of the oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrification/denitrification (OLAND) biofilm has been evaluated previously [22] but cryopreservation was not evaluated at \u221280\u00b0C nor with the use of DMSO or DMSO+TT as a CPA.

DMSO was chosen over glycerol as the CPA. The combination of DMSO and TT was evaluated as a separate CPA. Storage was performed at \u221280\u00b0C. Three different bacterial mixed communities were included: (i) a highly enriched co-culture of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) and heterotrophs [27], (ii) a biofilm from the OLAND process [28] which contained both nitrifiers (aerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria, AerAOB and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, NOB) and anoxic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (or anammox bacteria: AnAOB) and (iii) a human fecal microbiome. These mixed bacterial cultures were selected based upon their relevance for science and industry. MOB mixed communities are the key drivers of a variety of biotechnological processes [29]: methane removal in gaseous or liquid wastestreams, production of added-value compounds from these wastestreams [2], [30], [31] or biodegradation of hazardous organic compounds [32]. The OLAND mixed communities form a one-stage sustainable nitrogen removal process removing ammonia from wastewaters with a low C/N ratio and ammonia loaded gas streams through a combination of partial nitritation and anammox [28], [33], [34]. Finally, the fecal microbiome opens perspective for pre- and probiotics testing and fecal transplantations [4]\u2013[6].",

No particular precautions were made to avoid exposure of the anaerobized fecal slurry and OLAND biofilm to air in preparation of the 50 mL falcon tubes for freezing [20]. To the OLAND and fecal biomass, 20 mL of autoclaved tap water (Ghent, Belgium) or basal medium [36] was added, respectively. Immediately upon arrival at the cryopreservation site, 20 mL of the selected CPA (Table 1), was added and gently mixed. Addition of CPA was performed at 4\u00b0C to decrease DMSO toxicity. Biomass was allowed to equilibrate with the added CPA for 30 minutes at room temperature (21\u00b0C). Immediately after, biomass was transferred to \u221280\u00b0C. The falcon tubes were stored in non-insulated cryopreservation boxes in an aluminum rack placed in the \u221280\u00b0C ULT freezer. The freezing and thawing rates in medium with 5% DMSO at \u221280\u00b0C were similar to values determined by the authors in a previous experiment [19] as an identical protocol and equipment were used. In this experiment it was shown that the rates of freezing to \u221280\u00b0C were much lower than in liquid nitrogen, while thawing rates were similar. A slower freezing rate is beneficial for preservation success, as a rapid cooling can increase the chance of intracellular ice formation, leading to cell death.",

The key specific activity (MOR) was comparable to the original activity, when a CPA was added prior to cryopreservation (Figure 2A), on both media. When no CPA was added, the average specific activity over 48 h was significantly lower than the original activity on both media (p<0.0001). The largest activity recovery was obtained when only DMSO was added as a CPA both with NMS (147.2\u00b12.6%) and dNMS (156.1\u00b110.1%), which exceeded the original activity. When DMSO+TT was used as a CPA, the original specific activity was obtained on NMS (96.4\u00b110.7%) and dNMS (116.5\u00b120%). Both on NMS and dNMS with DMSO+TT as a CPA the specific activity was not significantly different from the initial activity (p\u200a=\u200a1).",

Also one OTU was classified as a non-proteobacterial MOB, part of the Verrucomicrobia phylum, namely Candidatus Methylacidiphilum. While the Methylococcaceae family was an abundant community constituent (up to 46% of all sequences of the inoculum), the Methylocystaceae and Candidatus Methylacidiphilum were less abundant (Figure S4, Figure S7). All of these methanotrophic taxa were detected in the mixed culture before and after cryopreservation, irrespective of the added CPA (Figure S4). However, the relative abundances of the MOB OTUs among all experimental conditions simultaneously (t0, t1 and t3) were significantly different for each MOB family (p<0.0001). More specifically, the relative abundance of Methylococcaceae within dNMS pre (t1) and dNMS DMSO (t3) did not significantly differ from the inoculum (t0, p\u200a=\u200a1). There was also no significant difference in Methylococcaceae relative abundance between the dNMS pre (t1) and dNMS samples at t3 with DMSO and DMSO+TT (p\u200a=\u200a1). However, on NMS, all conditions at t3 differed significantly from t0 and t1, regardless of CPA addition (p<0.0001). There were no significant differences in relative abundance of Methylocystaceae between t3 and the initial inoculum (t0, p\u200a=\u200a1), although the NMS samples showed a significant difference between t3 and t1 in samples with CPA addition (p<0.0001). No significant differences (p\u200a=\u200a1) were found in the relative abundance of Candidatus Methylacidiphilum between t0 on t3 only when DMSO was used as a CPA and incubation was performed on NMS. Between t1 and t3 on NMS no significant differences were found when DMSO+TT or no CPA was used (p\u200a=\u200a1). On dNMS, DMSO+TT maintains the relative abundance between t1 and t3 (p\u200a=\u200a1).",

Compared to the initial levels (4.98\u00b10.01 mM (n\u200a=\u200a2)) propionate levels were highest without CPA addition (70.5\u00b12.8%, 3.5\u00b10.1 mM (n\u200a=\u200a4)) and only slightly lower with DMSO (69.1\u00b15.7%, 3.4\u00b10.3 mM (n\u200a=\u200a3), p\u200a=\u200a0.51) or DMSO+TT (67.3\u00b13.5%, 3.4\u00b10.2 mM (n\u200a=\u200a4), p\u200a=\u200a0.87). Finally, the concentration of butyrate was highest with DMSO+TT (1.8\u00b10.2 mM (n\u200a=\u200a4)), which was 42.0\u00b15.5% of the initial 4.2\u00b10.07 mM (n\u200a=\u200a2) while DMSO and no CPA resulted in 1.7\u00b10.2 mM (n\u200a=\u200a3) and 1.7\u00b10.2 mM (n\u200a=\u200a4), respectively.",

Incertae sedis families (Figure S3). A total of 18 different families, with documented associations with the fermentative metabolism in the gut, were investigated for their relative abundance before and after cryopreservation (Figure S6). Variable results were obtained in the different taxonomic groups (Table S2). Similar to the MOB and OLAND mixed community, most OTUs from the fecal microbiome remained present in all experimental stages and conditions, irrespective of CPA addition (Figure 5). Of all observed OTUs, 29% (representing 8.5% of total sequences) were not detected in at least one of the experimental conditions (pre-freezing, post-freezing with or without CPA). This percentage excludes the OTU presence in the fecal inoculum due to the drastic change of the community upon first cultivation. Addition of CPA during cryopreservation of the fecal biomass was necessary to maintain comparable community dissimilarities to the reference activity test (Figure 6D), but differences in community dissimilarity between the conditions with and without CPA were not significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.24).",

This was indeed confirmed with the MOB mixed culture and the AnAOB and AerAOB (with DMSO+TT) in the OLAND mixed community. Gel-entrapped AerAOB and NOB (denitrifying sludge) were previously shown to have better preservation in the absence of a CPA [26]. However neither DMSO nor DMSO+TT were evaluated for the gel-entrapped sludge. Also, in the current study, OLAND biomass was not gel entrapped but part of a RBC biofilm. In contrast to the findings on gel entrapped AerAOB, addition of a CPA (DMSO+TT) enabled AerAOB recovery comparable to the initial activity in this experiment. The increase in activity recovery on DMSO+TT and the reduced recovery on DMSO alone corroborate with earlier findings for Nitrosomonas spp. [19] for preservation at \u221280\u00b0C. No pre-preservation growth was executed with TT medium, which is known to enhance activity recovery of certain Nitrosomonas spp. [19]. Earlier findings for AnAOB showed that addition of TT along with DMSO without any pre-incubation enhanced recovery over DMSO without TT [20]. These findings aid in elucidating the overall impact of the time point of carbon addition to the preservation medium, which remain poorly understood.",

In the case of the mixed methanotrophic community, both the effects of cryopreservation on the key ecosystem drivers (the MOB) as well as the peripheral heterotrophic community [32], [56]\u2013[59] are of interest. Concerning the autotrophic mixed community drivers, type I and type II MOB show distinct ecophysiological features [56] and have been suggested to possess different life strategies [60]. Hence, to allow a mixed methanotrophic culture to perform in a broad range of circumstances, representatives of both type I and type II MOB should be preserved during cryopreservation. Both type I and type II MOB were recovered after cryopreservation. Methylocystaceae (type II MOB) did not require addition of a CPA to maintain relative abundances in the mixed culture. As our analyses were DNA-based, it is possible that the detected type II MOB are part of the microbial seed bank in the reactor (as previously demonstrated for soils [61], [62]). Type II MOB are known to have more persistent resting cells than type I MOB [63]; hence, the addition of a CPA does not influence their cryopreservation. This is in agreement with the diagnostic microarray results where the least changes in MOB diversity occurred when no CPA was added (the micro-array was only run on the NMS samples) and where Methylocystis sp. (strain M or related) was reduced in relative abundance when no CPA was added (Figure S7).",

Because of the importance of these interactions [30], [66], [67], investigation of the total community structure before and after cryopreservation was performed within the scope of this study. Although, a differential impact was seen on 21% of the MOB community, this was not linked to phylogeny, even at the genus level. For instance, most OTUs classified as Methylotenera occurred in every experimental condition, while others were enriched after cryopreservation, and even others required addition of a CPA for cryopreservation on dNMS. Furthermore, OTUs belonging to Devosia, Methylobacillus, Rubrivivax required a CPA for cryopreservation on NMS. All manipulations were performed at 4\u00b0C to avoid DMSO cytotoxicity and, while some OTUs did not survive when DMSO alone was used as a CPA, no single taxonomic group was found to be more sensitive than others.",

For an OLAND RBC biofilm, AerAOB, AnAOB and NOB were present at 10\u201328%, 33% and <5% of total cells, respectively, as determined by FISH [68]. In the current study, 6% of the total community could be classified as AerAOB, 10% as AnAOB and 0.1% as NOB. The comparatively low percentage of AnAOB might be due to underrepresentation of the Planctomycetes phylum in the current 16S rRNA gene sequence databases [70] or, until recently, the lack of a proper PCR protocol for the phylum [71]. Interestingly, even though NOB have a higher relative abundance with DMSO+TT after cryopreservation, their activity recovery was the lowest. This might result from a competition for nitrite with AnAOB that have the best activity recovery when DMSO+TT was used as a CPA. The increased activity recovery of AnAOB could result from the effect of DMSO on the phospholipid bilayer [72] of intracytoplasmatic membranes which contain the key enzymes for ammonium oxidation [19]. Besides the autotrophic functional community members, filamentous bacteria from the phylum Bacteriodetes and bacteria belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria were described [69] in the OLAND biomass. However, not much is known about the role of the peripheral heterotrophic community in the OLAND community. The current OLAND community shows presence of both Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Only one genus required CPA addition for every representative to be cryopreserved: Leptonema. Some, but not all, unclassified Rhizobiales required the addition of TT to DMSO whereas this addition was a prerequisite for the recovery of the sole representative of the Bdellovibrionales order. All representatives of Geosporobacter thermotalea, Thauera, Anaerovorax, Methylomonas, Peptinophilus, Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio were enriched after cryopreservation. The only representative of the Veillonella genus occurs only after cryopreservation with a CPA. Apart from the peripheral heterotrophic community, peripheral autotrophs such as MOB were also detected in OLAND biomass [45], and could mitigate methane emissions from the OLAND WWTP. Type I MOB were detected in all conditions after cryopreservation up to 0.05% of relative abundance in the conditions where DMSO and DMSO+TT were added.",
