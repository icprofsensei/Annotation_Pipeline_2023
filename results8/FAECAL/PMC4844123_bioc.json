Distortions of the gut microbiota have been found to correlate with fatal diseases in preterm infants, however, developmental patterns of gut microbiome and factors affecting the colonization progress in preterm infants remain unclear. The purpose of this prospective longitudinal study was to explore day-to-day gut microbiome patterns in preterm infants during their first 30 days of life in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and investigate potential factors related to the development of the infant gut microbiome. A total of 378 stool samples were collected daily from 29 stable/healthy preterm infants. DNA extracted from stool was used to sequence the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene region for community analysis. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and \u03b1-diversity of the community were determined using QIIME software. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, accounting for 54.3% of the total reads. Result showed shift patterns of increasing Clostridium and Bacteroides, and decreasing Staphylococcus and Haemophilus over time during early life. Alpha-diversity significantly increased daily in preterm infants after birth and linear mixed-effects models showed that postnatal days, feeding types and gender were associated with the \u03b1-diversity, p< 0.05\u20130.01. Male infants were found to begin with a low \u03b1-diversity, whereas females tended to have a higher diversity shortly after birth. Female infants were more likely to have higher abundance of Clostridiates, and lower abundance of Enterobacteriales than males during early life. Infants fed mother\u2019s own breastmilk (MBM) had a higher diversity of gut microbiome and significantly higher abundance in Clostridiales and Lactobacillales than infants fed non-MBM. Permanova also showed that bacterial compositions were different between males and females and between MBM and non-MBM feeding types. In conclusion, infant postnatal age, gender and feeding type significantly contribute to the dynamic development of the gut microbiome in preterm infants.",

As a result, aspects of care management have shifted to focus on the prevention of diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis, and improving long-term neurologic and developmental outcomes related to the immature neuro-immune systems and stressful early life experiences [3]. At the same time growing evidence supports that a functional communication exists between the central nervous system and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this brain-gut axis, the gut microbiome is proposed to play a key role in the early programming of health outcomes through a bidirectional signaling system, in terms of both top-down and bottom-up effects [4\u20138]. However, the developmental patterning of the gut microbiome and the factors affecting how colonization progresses in preterm infants during early life remains unclear and needs further investigation.",

Although the exact composition of a \u201cnormal\u201d neonatal gut microbiome is still unknown, researchers have begun mapping the human GI microbiota using recently developed culture-independent, DNA-based genomic technologies [10]. After birth, newborn GI microbial colonization appears to begin with facultative anaerobes, followed by the establishment of anaerobic genera [9]. Compared to the adult, newborn GI microbiota may be more variable both over time (e.g. day-to-day) and between individuals [11]. Full-term infants born by vaginal delivery have greater microbial diversity that appears to be more desirable for both short and long term outcomes. Conversely, preterm infants born via caesarian section have been found to have less diversity within their microbiome because they are not exposed to maternal vaginal, fecal and epithelial microbes [12, 13].",

Rather, they are more likely to be colonized with potentially pathogenic microorganisms, showing reduced microbiota diversity, reduced levels of strict anaerobes, and a relatively high abundance of Proteobacteria [14\u201316]. Such alterations of gut microbial patterns in preterm infants have been found to correlate with life-threatening diseases such as NEC and late-onset sepsis [17, 18]. These alterations in GI microbiota, also called dysbiosis, are one of the pivotal factors linked to preterm infant mortality and morbidity [17\u201319].

                    "text": "In the literature, feeding types have been found as one of the major factors influencing neonatal gut microbiome and GI function. For example, infants fed directly at the breast can gain additional variability in microbiota through breastmilk and also through contact with the mother\u2019s skin [20]. Six Bifidobacterium strains have been isolated from human breastmilk showing phenotypical and genotypic characters of commercial probiotics, which are important specifically for neonates and for potential use in targeted interventions [21, 22]. In healthy full-term breastfed infants, human milk oligosaccharides can selectively shape the growth and function of beneficial GI microbiota. Full-term breastfed infants have more predominant Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus in the GI tract compared to that of formula-fed infants [23]. In preterm infants, limited studies have shown very low amounts of anaerobes present in the GI tract, including Bifidobacteria and Bacteroidetes. This delay in anaerobic establishment is hypothesized to impede immune maturation in the preterm population [16, 24, 25]. The dynamics of bacterial colonization and composition of microbial communities in preterm infants remain largely unknown. Therefore, the effects of using mother\u2019s own breastmilk feeding on infant gut microbiome development needs further investigation.",

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to analyze the association between demographic characteristics and clinical variables with \u03b1-diversity. \u03b2-diversity was analyzed using both Bray-Curtis and Jaccard in Vegan package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html) and visualized using multidimensional scaling (MDS). To further examine the effect of demographic and clinical characteristics on gut microbiome patterns, the permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices (PERMANOVA) and multivariate analogue of Levene's test for homogeneity of groups dispersions (BETADISPER) were conducted. Indicator value analyses using Indicspecies package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/indicspecies/index.html) were also performed to identify species that drive the differences in microbiome patterns among preterm infants with different clinical characteristics.",

In the final analysis of 29 subjects (Table 1), the majority of the infants were male (52%), white (75%), non-Hispanic (69%), and delivered by cesarean-section (55%). Infants were born at 31.3 \u00b1 1.7 weeks of gestation and with 1459.8 \u00b1 445.3 g of birth weight. Enteral feedings were introduced between postnatal day 1 to day 6 (2.1 \u00b1 1.0 days), depending on the infants\u2019 clinical condition. During the study period, 69.0% of the total feedings were with MBM and the days of using MBM for each infant varied from 0 to 20 days (6.0 \u00b1 5.9 days). The infant feeding type was then categorized based on the MBM fed proportion of all feedings during the study period that the infant was included in the MBM group when he/she received MBM in 50% or more of feedings, otherwise the infant was included in the non-MBM group. The number of NPO days were similar between the MBM and non-MBM groups. Feeding types received by male and female infants were also similar during the study period (Table 1). In this group of infants, the time to regaining birth weight was from 4 to 18 postnatal days (11 \u00b1 4 days).",

The mean interval between sample collections was 1.5 \u00b1 1.1 days with a median of 1 day. Twenty-eight out of the 378 samples including 10 meconium stools yielded DNA concentration less than 1ng/ml and were therefore excluded from Miseq sequencing due to the low concentrations. Meconium, a sticky stool with a color of dark olive green, is the earliest stool of infants in the first week of life. In total, 25.6 million high quality and chimera free reads were produced. Twelve samples yielded less than 10,000 reads and were excluded for QIIME analysis.

The distribution of the mean relative abundance of OTUs at order level were calculated for each infant (Fig 1) and at each day (Fig 2) during the first 30 days of life. Gut microbiome communities in this group of preterm infants appeared individually diverse and often dominated by a single OTU. Three emerging types of composition patterns were found, Type 1 with Enterobacteriales dominating, Type 2 with mixed composition, and Type 3 with Clostridiales and Lactobacillales dominating (Fig 1). Comparisons of infant demographic and clinical characteristics among the three types of microbial composition are shown in S1 Table and examples of daily gut microbiome development from individual infants that belong to three types of microbiome patterns are shown in S1 Fig. A heat map of daily microbial development was created at genus level and showed a shifting pattern of increasing Clostridium and Bacteroides, and decreasing Staphylococcus and Haemophilus over time during early life (see S2 Fig). The nonmetric multidiminsional scaling (NMDS) of the samples based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of the OTUs was calculated and displayed (S3 Fig).",

Richness measures the number of species present in a sample and evenness is a measure of the relative abundance of the different species composite in the sample. A community dominated by only a couple of species is less diverse than one in which several different species have relatively similar abundance. The \u03b1-diversity ranges from 0, the lowest diversity to 1, the highest diversity. The gut microbiome data from our study showed that \u03b1-diversity increased from 0.31 \u00b1 0.32 at postnatal day 5 of life to 0.49 \u00b1 0.19 at day 30 of life, with an average increase of 0.008 per day, p < 0.001. To further explore contributing factors to the microbial complexity among infants, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were performed to assess the effect of different infant characteristics on the richness and evenness of the infant gut microbiome with \u03b1-diversity. The contributing factors entered to the models included gender, premature rupture of membranes, birth gestational age, delivery mode, severity of illness, feeding type, antibiotics use, location (two NICU sites), and postnatal days. Results showed that time (postnatal days), p < 0.01, feeding type (using MBM or not), p < 0.01, and gender, p < 0.05 were significantly associated with \u03b1-diversity.",

Female infants showed a pattern of higher abundance at the order level in Clostridiates, and less abundance in Enterobacteriales than males during their first 10-day periods of life. Indicator species analysis was then performed to identify the genera that reflected the differences in gut microbiota among preterm infants between genders (Table 2). Among all the microbes at the genus level, the abundance of Pantoea and Campylobacter (in Proteobacteria phylum) were statistically higher in males than in females, while the abundance of unidentified microbes and Yersinia (in Formicate and Proteobacteria phyla) are significantly higher in females than males from birth to 30 days of life (Table 2).",

The MBM fed infants were more likely to belong to Type 2 pattern with mixed compositions and Type 3 pattern with Clostridiales and Lactobacillales dominating. The non-MBM fed infants were more likely to belong to Type 1 pattern with Enterobacteriales dominated, (Type 1: MBM = 2, non-MBM = 8; Type 2: MBM = 7, non-MBM = 0; Type 3: MBM = 10, non-MBM = 1). MBM fed infants had significantly higher abundance in Clostridiales (p < 0.001) and Lactobacillales (p < 0.05) than non-MBM fed infants. Furthermore, we compared the composition of bacterial community by the feeding types during each postnatal day (Fig 6). In the MBM fed infants, the composition of Enterobacteriales shifted from about 50% at postnatal day 5\u201320 down to about 30% thereafter, whereas, Clostridiales and Lactobacillales developed quickly from about 20\u201330% at postnatal day 5\u20137 up to 60\u201370% after day 20 (Fig 6). On the contrary, non-MBM fed infants had a different gut microbiome community pattern that was dominated by Enterobacteriales (more than 65%) throughout the first 30 days of life and the pattern shifted slowly day-by-day (Fig 6). The indicator species analysis was then conducted at the genus level to identify the differences of the bacterial composition between feeding types. Results showed that Granulicatella, Lactobacillus, and other genera belong to Firmicutes phylum were statistically higher in the group of MBM fed infants than their cohorts (Table 3).",

We also found that over the first 30 days of early life, gut microbiome diversity index began low and increased daily after birth for this group of preterm infants. The gut microbiome community patterns shifted by increases in Clostridium and Bacteroides sequences, and decreases in Staphylococcus and Haemophilus with time (S1 Fig). Meanwhile, time (postnatal days of life), gender, and mothers\u2019 own breastmilk feeding were found to be significant driving factors influencing the dynamics of gut microbiome development in preterm infants. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that demonstrate preterm infants, as opposed to healthy full-term infants, show a remarkably less diverse microbiome, relatively low abundance Bifidobacteria and Bacteroidetes and high abundance of Proteobacteria, and increased colonization by pathogens [15, 16, 24, 31, 32]. Healthy newborn gut microbial community begins with colonization of facultative anaerobes, followed by the establishment of anaerobic genera, such as Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium [33]. An appropriate balance in the diversity and type of microbes within the microbiome community plays a critical role in promoting immune maturation and maintaining the host health status in this population. The alteration or imbalance in the richness and diversity of the microbiota termed as dysbiosis, has also been recently attributed to delayed maturation of the microbiota in infants [34]. Distortions and/or delayed maturation of the gut microbiota with community changes dominated by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes have been found to be correlated with NEC and late-onset sepsis in preterm infants [17\u201319, 35]. A recent study also shows that reduced bacterial diversity and the absence of certain bacterial classes of the gut, such as Clostridia in stool samples may be associated with the severity of NEC [36].",

Dysbiosis in high risk infants is associated with exposure to potentially detrimental factors, including caesarean delivery, increased exposure to antibiotics and acid-suppressing agents, lack of breast-feeding, and exposure to environmental toxicants [35]. Moreover, exposure to early life physiological and psychosocial stressors, such as prolonged painful experience and maternal-infant separation, can lead to oxidative stress within the intestines, which may modulate the process of microbiome establishment in premature infants [37, 38]. More research is needed to better understand the mechanism of gut microbiome development in high risk including preterm infants.",

                    "text": "We found that gut microbiome communities in males and females were different after birth in this group of preterm infants. Male infants began with a lower diversity index, whereas females tended to have a higher diversity shortly after birth. Interestingly, our results show that female infants were more likely to have higher abundance of Clostridiates, and less abundance of Enterobacteriales than males during their early life. As these differences in the composition of the microbiota correlate with different clinical outcomes, it will be important to confirm these findings in studies at other sites and with an even larger number of subjects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reported gender associations of the gut microbiome composition in human neonates. Studies reporting gender specific differences in gut microbiome are few and inconsistent in human. One study reported strong associations between gender and microbial community types identified at several body sides in young adults (median: 25 years old) and showed that men more likely harbor fewer Bacteroides and higher Prevotella in the stool community compared to women [39]. Whereas, a recent study in older adults showed a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum in women than men (58 \u00b1 13 years old) [40]. However, gender differences in initial gut microbiota colonization and abundance of select taxa of early life in neonates have not been documented. One report briefly mentioned that males had a lower relative abundance of Bacteroides species than females in Caucasian infants at 3 months of age [41]. The mechanism of the gender specific differences on gut microbiome community remains poorly understood.",

                    "text": "It has been speculated that the variation of gut microbiome communities influenced by sex are related to hormone-immune-microbe interactions and genetic traits [42]. Evidence has been established that many autoimmune disorders are gender related, generally more common in females, while gut microbiome is involved. Sex steroids may play an important role of shaping the gut microbiome in a sex specific way after puberty, such as in dietary and autoimmune disease studies [40, 43]. However, this mechanism may not be appropriate to explain the gender differences found in our infant gut microbiome study. Animal studies recently demonstrated that males and females respond to diet and pathologic and probiotic microorganisms differently [44, 45]. Differences in relative abundance of microbial species were found in the female GI tract of mice as compared to the male [44], which seems consistent with our study results where we detected differences in the microbiome of female and male infants. Additionally, cytokine productions were observed to be significantly different between male and female rodents in the colon, cecum and liver at basal levels and also at experimental conditions, indicating sex traits and sex related host immune-microbe responses to newly introduced diet and microorganisms [44, 45]. Meanwhile, colon tissues of male and female mice were also found to be significantly different in that males had higher concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (butyrate and acetate) and females had greater increases in o-phosphocholine or histidine [44]. These recent findings suggest that sex biases in the fecal communities may be influenced by sex specific metabolic and immune activities, as well as immunoregulation in GI tissues. However, the mechanisms underlying and gender differences in gut microbiome community in early life including host immune functions and metabolic environment in the GI are still largely unknown and further investigations are needed.",

                    "text": "We found that infants fed MBM had a significantly more diverse gut microbiome and higher abundance of Clostridiales and Lactobacillale than those fed non-MBM (human donor milk and/or formula). In contrast, infants fed non-MBM had a different type of microbiome community that was extensively dominated by Enterobacteriales throughout the first 30 days of early life. Interestingly, we found these difference even though the infants in the MBM group could have received some donor milk or formula during the study. It appears that receiving greater than 50% of MBM matters. These differences could be attributable to a reduced number of bacteria in pasteurized donor milk and formula or differences in the composition in mother\u2019s milk, the donor milk, and formula [46]. Our data also suggest that the microbiome from mother\u2019s breastmilk potentially play important roles in infant health. Recent evidence supports that mother\u2019s own breastmilk feeding promotes the growth of commensal bacteria in the infant GI tract [23, 25, 46\u201348]. The composition of infant diet including sugars, amino-sugars, and fatty acids has shown an important role in defining gut microbiota in immature infant GI tracts [48]. One of the mechanisms of the effect of breastmilk on shaping infant gut microbiome is that breastmilk provides many nutrients for supporting the growth of bacteria that are adapted to the infants digestive tract and typically do not cause disease. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), prebiotics, the third largest component of breastmilk are shown to have bio-active effects beyond providing nutrition to the infant. Specific beneficial microbes including Bifidobacteria and Bacteroidetes may grow quickly by digesting and utilizing HMOs through specific glycosidases, but most potentially pathogenic microbes, such as Enterobacteriaceae are unable to utilize HMOs as a food source because of lack of specific enzymes [49]. Therefore, healthy breastmilk fed full-term infants have Bifidobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominant in their gut microbiome community and have nearly twice the abundance of gut bacterial cells than non-breastmilk fed infants [47].",

                    "text": "Currently, little is known about the influence of feeding type on the development of gut microbiota in preterm infants. Breastmilk produced by mothers of preterm infants has been found to be largely different from that of mothers of full-term infants including the individual variations and the amounts and types of HMOs, as well the \u201cpremature\u201d human milk may impact the premature gut in different mechanisms [50]. Preterm infants may also respond differently to HMOs compared to full-term infants. One study showed that supplemental HMOs administrated to the feedings in preterm infants did not show the expected increase in abundance of Bifidobacteria [25]. Our result appears consistent with previous studies that preterm infants did not have a significant increase in Bifidobacteria fed by MBM, but had higher abundance of a group of Firmicutes bacteria (e.g. Clostridiales and Lactobacillales) in MBM fed infants than non-MBM fed infants. Compared to term infants, investigation of preterm infant gut microbiome and associated factors contributing to health is challenging because of the complex situations of during their early life. In addition to the factor of feeding type, we also need to consider that the NICU environment, including feeding tubes, delayed enteral feeding, medication use and other hospital-acquired organisms contributes to the microbiome development in preterm infants. In addition, these infants have a reduced exposure to microorganisms from their parents, siblings, pets and the environment.",

While, this is the first study to date that reported gender differences in gut microbiome of preterm infants, one of its limitations remains a small sample size. Another limitation is that only stable preterm infants without severe comorbidities, i.e., NEC or late onset sepsis were recruited in this study and it may limit the generalizability of these results to high-risk preterm population. Future studies with larger sample sizes and multiple geographic locations, as well as including clinically unstable infants are needed to lead a greater understanding of the concept of dysbiosis and fully describe the associations of contributing factors including gender and feeding type with microbiome and health outcomes in premature infants.",
