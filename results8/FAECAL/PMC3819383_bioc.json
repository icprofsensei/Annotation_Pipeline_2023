Among the meconium samples, the taxonomy analyses suggested that the overall bacterial content significantly differed by maternal diabetes status, with the microbiome of the DM group showing higher alpha-diversity than that of no-diabetes or GDM groups. No global difference was found between babies delivered vaginally versus via Cesarean-section. Regression analysis showed that the most robust predictor for the meconium microbiota composition was the maternal diabetes status that preceded pregnancy. Specifically, Bacteroidetes (phyla) and Parabacteriodes (genus) were enriched in the meconium in the DM group compared to the no-diabetes group.",

Clinical characteristics of the infant included sex, birth weight (BW), birth length, time of sampling (hours after birth), neonatal complications, gestational age, and delivery method. Clinical variables of the mother included age, body mass index (BMI) at 1st and 3rd trimester, glucose level (1 hour glucose challenge test, or GCT, completed at 24\u201328 weeks), medications during pregnancy, maternal smoking, and diabetes status. A subclinical group included 4 no-diabetes mothers with glucose levels higher than the cut-off point of 130 ng/dL, who did not meet the criteria for gestational diabetes at the diagnostic 3-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT). Such women are known to carry additional obstetric risk, such as fetal macrosomia and other morbidities [33], [34].

Figure S1B in File S1 demonstrates that the mean CCS read length was 443 base pairs (bp, ranging between 400 and 500 bp). We tested reproducibility of our 16S rRNA sequencing technique by comparing duplicate samples. Taxonomy assignment showed that, the correlation between the duplicates was within the range of 99.5% to 99.9% at any taxonomy level (Figure S1C in File S1). When we examined the bacterial composition of the control E.coli strain BL21, 99.5% of the CCS reads were correctly assigned at the phyla through family level and 97.1% at the genus level, suggesting a high accuracy and low misclassification rate (Figure S1D in File S1).",

Our results indicated that all 23 meconium samples were not sterile. At the phylum level, all four major phyla, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, were represented accounting for about 99% of the microbial content (\nFigure 1A\n). However, the average taxa abundance of the newborn meconium was very different from that of the adult stool samples (\nFigure 1B\n). Specifically, when compared with the adult feces (\nFigure 2\n), the meconium from the neonates born to no-diabetes (healthy and preclinical DM) mothers had a significantly higher proportion of Proteobacteria (71.0% in the meconium vs. 3.1% in the adult stool), and a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes (2.5% in the meconium vs. 42.8% in the adult stool), Firmicutes (20.0% in the meconium vs. 44.7% in the adult stool) and Verrucomicrobia (0.06% in the meconium vs. 3.2% in the adult stool) (FDR-adjusted p<0.05). At the family level, Comamonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly enriched in the meconium samples compared to the adult stool (FDR-adjusted p<0.05). Further analyses showed a significant reduction in Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Veillonellaceae (FDR-adjusted p<0.05) in the meconium. The four most abundant genera in the meconium included Comamonas, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella and Proteus. Similar to the no-diabetes group, the meconium from DM and GDM groups also showed enrichment of Proteobacteria and reduction of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, in comparison with the adult stool samples.",

Consistent with the PerMANOVA results, weighted and unweighted UniFrac PCoA showed a separation of the DM from no-diabetes samples on the PC1 vs. PC2 plot (Figure S2B in File S1), mostly driven by the enrichment of Bacteroidetes and reduction of Proteobacteria in the DM meconium samples (Figure S3 in File S1). Notably, the 4 subjects with subclinical DM (subjects BM3, BM180, BM52 and BM276) showed no separation from other no-diabetes samples (Figure S3 in File S1). Furthermore, we compared the abundance of the OTUs among these three groups. \nFigure 4\n depicts all OTUs that showed significant difference (p<0.05) at the phylum, class, family and genus level between DM and no-diabetes controls. Specifically, several OTUs, such as Bacteroidetes (phyla), Lachnospiraceae (family) and Parabacteriodes (genus) that were enriched in adult Type 2 diabetes patients [42], were also significantly enriched in the meconium samples of babies born to DM mothers compared to the no-diabetes group.

A number of studies using culture-dependent or independent methods have established the presence of live bacteria in the fetus prior to birth [12], [21]\u2013[26], [30]\u2013[32], [43]. However, until the development of the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, the detailed characterization of the microbiome at the taxa level was challenging. Moreover, while a number of studies have compared the bacterial composition of the adult stool with early infant stool [9], [11], [19], [20], [28], only a handful of small studies have been carried out in meconium [24], [25], [32]. Using a culture-independent NGS technology, we demonstrated that the meconium microbiota substantially differ from those in adult feces, with the overall microbiome diversity being significantly lower than that of the adult stool (\nFigure 1\n). While at the phylum level the meconium microbiome was more similar to that of infants [9], [11], [19], [41] than adults, at the genus level, the dominant taxa found in the early infant stool were not prevalent in the meconium samples.",

Moreover, they have shown that some of the species that reach the fetal gastrointestinal tract prenatally can be present in the infant long into the first year, underlining the potential long-term clinical consequences of the initial microbiota content. We speculate that the bacterial diversity in the gut of a fetus may reflect pathophysiological processes occurring during pregnancy or represent a direct transmission of maternal intestinal bacteria. Prospective studies will be required to further clarify the path of the mother-to-baby efflux of commensal microbes during pregnancy, as well as the impact of the maternal microbiome on predisposition to adult-onset diseases.",

However, in our study, no significant differences in the overall microbiome composition by the mode of delivery were detected in babies born to mothers with and without diabetes. Furthermore, we observed that neither of the dominant OTUs reported previously [9] at the genus level in the stool of young infants delivered vaginally (Lactobacillus, Prevotella) or via C-section (Acinetobacter, Propionibacterineae, Micrococcineae, Corynebacterineae) were prevalent in the majority of the meconium samples. Instead, the most common OTUs at the genus level in the meconium included Comamonas, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella and Proteus, which are predominantly aerobic or facultative anaerobic organisms. Comamonas was found in human appendix, a small pouch attached to the first portion of the large intestine [46] and Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella and Proteus occur naturally in the human gut [47], further supporting our hypothesis that the initial colonization in the human gut starts prior to birth. While our findings are consistent with a recent report that also showed no substantial overlap of the meconium microbiota with maternal habitats, especially in babies born via C-section [24], it contrasts previous analyses demonstrating that the microbiota recovered from multiple newborn sites closely resembles vaginal or skin microbiota, depending on the mode of delivery [9]. Emerging studies point toward pregnancy as the beginning of bacterial exposure for the developing fetus [23]\u2013[25]. A recent study on the microbiome dynamics in the gut of pregnant women has shown that the bacterial composition evolves between the 1st and 3rd trimesters, with the maternal gut microbiome in the 3rd trimester being more similar to what we observed in the meconium, including the increased variability in beta-diversity, the compositional dissimilarity among samples, increasing abundance of Proteobacteria, and the reduction in alpha-diversity between samples [48]. Taken together, it further suggests that the maternal microbiota can be transferred to the fetus during pregnancy.",

Nevertheless, it was comparable to the size of a recent study with similar objectives and design [24] and allowed us to detect significant differences with regard to maternal diabetes status. Also, we did not have access to the matched maternal samples; thus, evidence connecting the fetal microbiome directly to the maternal microbiome is lacking. Future studies comparing bacterial composition of the matched maternal (vaginal, placental and fecal) and neonatal microbiome are warranted to determine the major source of the newborn microbiota. In addition, since the gut microbiota changes dramatically during pregnancy [48], a direct comparison between pregnant and non-pregnant women with DM will be important to explore the effect of pregnancy on bacterial content in the context of DM. Furthermore, numerous prenatal factors, such as chorioamnonitis or premature rupture of membranes, maternal prenatal smoking, maternal stress, and others , may contribute to the initial colonization of the gut microbiome. Women were also excluded from the study if they received antibiotic treatment over the course of pregnancy, precluding testing the relationship between maternal infection, diabetes, and meconium content. However, women undergoing C-section and receiving a prophylactic dose of an antibiotic as a standard of care were retained in the study, which could potentially affect the meconium microbiota, especially if antibiotics were given before cord clamping. The sample size of this study would not allow to systematically assess the effect of these and other factors on the meconium microbiome profile. Larger studies collecting extensive prenatal and neonatal data are underway to explore the role of other factors that have effects on the meconium microbiome. Also, health-related information, such as BMI, maternal smoking or glucose level, was not accessible on several enrolled subjects due to the lack of consent or ethical issues associated with administering GCT to individuals with established DM. Therefore, we were unable to establish the relationship between these traits and the meconium microbial composition. Moreover, the time of sampling widely varied among the newborns raising the possibility that environmental exposures may have influenced the bacterial content for those who passed their first stool at a later time. However, the time of sampling was not significantly different between the study groups; therefore, it is unlikely to systematically bias our results. Also, it is known that maternal diabetes can increase the risk of pre-term birth, due to an increase in both fetal and maternal indications for delivery. In our study, we did not see microbiota differences by gestational age among DM, GDM, and no-diabetes groups; however, future studies with a larger sample size will have to examine whether gestational age at delivery is associated with the meconium microbiota. In addition, we did not account for susceptibility loci predisposing to DM, which could also be transmitted from a mother to an infant and potentially affect the microbiome. Future studies will have to determine if host DM risk alleles are associated with a \u201cdiabetic\u201d microbial profile.",
