Despite the recent advances on the biological principles that underlie microbial symbiosis in the gut of mammals, mechanistic understanding of the contributions of the gut microbiome and how variations in the metabotypes are linked to the host health are obscure. Here, we mapped the entire metabolic potential of the gut microbiome based solely on metagenomics sequencing data derived from fecal samples of 124 Europeans (healthy, obese and with inflammatory bowel disease). Interestingly, three distinct clusters of individuals with high, medium and low metabolic potential were observed. By illustrating these results in the context of bacterial population, we concluded that the abundance of the Prevotella genera is a key factor indicating a low metabolic potential. These metagenome-based metabolic signatures were used to study the interaction networks between bacteria-specific metabolites and human proteins. We found that thirty-three such metabolites interact with disease-relevant protein complexes several of which are highly expressed in cells and tissues involved in the signaling and shaping of the adaptive immune system and associated with squamous cell carcinoma and bladder cancer. From this set of metabolites, eighteen are present in DrugBank providing evidence that we carry a natural pharmacy in our guts. Furthermore, we established connections between the systemic effects of non-antibiotic drugs and the gut microbiome of relevance to drug side effects and health-care solutions.",

Our affiliated microbial partners contain \u2a7e100 times the number of genes embedded in our Homo sapiens genome, providing us with a genetic landscape and functional features we do not have to evolve on our own (Backhed et al., 2004). These tens of trillions of microbes that live in our gastrointestinal tract represent an anaerobic bioreactor programmed to synthesize several molecules that direct the human immune system locally and systematically (Hooper, 2004). The biosynthetic variability of our gut microbiota, which remains largely unexplored, could shape the human physiological phenotypes and is viewed as a modifier of the host epigenome (Li et al., 2008). As a matter of fact, the indigenous metabolic processes coded in the host metagenome are a source of pharmacologically active secondary metabolites involved in host metabolic regulation (Nicholson, 2006; Sonnenburg et al., 2006). Although we know that the symbiotic gut microbiome has evolved to exert control over a number of important mammalian metabolic regulatory functions, little is understood of the systems level interactions between the chemical signatures that characterize the organism-level metabolic status and host cellular pathways.",

Turnbaugh et al. (2009) have shown that the gut microbial community structures of adult monozygotic twin pairs had a degree of similarity that was comparable to that of dizygotic twin pairs, and only slightly more similar compared with their mothers, whereas Palmer et al. (2007) revealed that gut community assembly during the first year of life followed a more similar pattern in a pair of dizygotic twins compared with unrelated infants. This interpersonal variation in the composition of the human microbiota implies that studying the role of gut bacteria in the development of pathophysiology and as complimentary metabolic machinery for drugs and diets across a small set of individuals may inappropriately treat these diverse phenomena as a single, albeit noisy phenomenon. In contrast, averaging the effects of a disturbance across large cohorts of individuals with distinct disease phenotypes can reveal the links between bacterial dynamics and host physiology and pathology.",

We could, in this manner, retrieve all the MetaHit genes (from now on called \u2018metabolic genes') coding for proteins that are part of a metabolic pathway (from now on called \u2018metabolic proteins'). Using strict criteria, two proteins were considered to be homologs when they shared 85% identity and at least 80% coverage, and a total of 3775 MetaHIT sequences accounting for 1490 metabolic reactions were retrieved (Supplementary Table S1). We should emphasize here that the metabolome profile assigned to each individual is solely based on genomic data that indicate the metabolic potential of the bacterial population with no further evidence that the detected genes are actually expressed to produce the metabolites. A binary presence/absence (1/0) matrix was constructed using these 1490 metabolic reactions for the healthy samples. This matrix revealed a large variation in the total number of metabolic reactions that were assigned in the microbiome of each healthy individual. To investigate further this metabolic diversity in connection to the composition of the microbiome, we visualized the frequency of each metabolic reaction per individual taking into account its essentiality. Reactions were divided into essential and non-essential (Figure 1b) based on the Database of Essential Genes (Zhang and Lin, 2009) (DEG) 6.5 (http://essentialgene.org). By aligning the sequences from 18 prokaryotes in DEG to the MetaHIT sequences we retrieved 310 protein hits responsible for 425 essential metabolic reactions. Assigning a metabolic reaction as essential in our metagenome data should be always interpreted with caution so as not to neglect the symbiotic relationships in the bacterial population. Nevertheless from Figure 1b it is apparent that non-essential metabolic reactions have lower frequency among individuals compared with essential reactions (P-value <2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216 using Welch t-test). To capture a snapshot of the highly conserved among healthy individuals metabolic network, we visualized the metabolic reactions with frequency >70% using iPath2.0 (http://pathways.embl.de/). The parts of the microbiome metabolism that show a higher conservation among individuals are glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid and nitrogen metabolism (Figure 1c).",

To create this set of metabolites we overlaid the putative gut microbiome metabolism with the Homo sapiens Recon 1 (Duarte et al., 2007) metabolic model. We obtained a set of 482 metabolites with known structure, which can be potentially synthesized or degraded only by the gut bacteria. This study revealed at the same time a significant overlap between the human and the bacterial metabolic capacity (376 shared metabolites), comparable to the number of human-specific metabolites (472 metabolites). The set of 482 metabolites that cannot be produced or metabolized by humans (\u2018non-human' metabolites) was the base for the subsequent analysis. ChEMBLdb (Gaulton et al., 2011), a manually curated database of bioactive molecules, was used for generating an interactome map of the \u2018non-human' metabolites and the human proteome space. From the 62 metabolites that were linked to the human proteome (Supplementary Table S2), and after filtering for small organic molecules, 33 were found to be associated with a disease-relevant protein complex, while 18 of them were present in DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011) as experimental drugs. In the metabolic reactions of the metagenome, in which the \u2018non-human' metabolites are involved, five appear as substrates (S), eight appear as products (P), and the rest appear as both a substrate and a product (S and P) (Figure 2b). The taxonomy of genes encoding the bacterial enzymes involved in these reactions revealed Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter cloacae (and E. cancerogenus), Shigella sp. and Citrobacter rodentium as the most efficient producers/consumers (Figure 2a). However, we should keep in mind that linking sequences with species was possible for only one-third of the enzymes.",

Disease protein complexes involved in squamous cell carcinoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, lung cancer and bladder cancer were associated with >10 \u2018non-human' metabolites each. Drug metabolism disorders were also ranked highly in the list, as several metabolites interact with complexes that include enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily involved in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics (Supplementary Table S3). Metabolites quercetin and menadione that were found to interact with disease protein complexes associated with a large number of OMIM IDs, seem to have a significant role in the host-bacterial mutualism. Along with these two \u2018non-human' metabolites, hydroquinone and S-carboxylmethyl-D-cystein formed a cluster sharing many of the disease IDs. Quercetin, menadione and S-carboxymethyl-D-cysteine participate in reversible reactions offering a higher degree of flexibility for regulating their concentrations in the gut, whereas hydroquinone appears as product of an irreversible reaction, according to MetaCyc.",

Five metabolites, namely quercetin, erythronate-4-phosphate, D-glucono-1,5-lactone, 5\u2032,5\u2033-diadenosine triphosphate and hydroquinone, were associated with disease complexes, because of experimental binding activity to a member of the complex of Ki\u2a7d1\u2009\u03bc\u2133, which is a common threshold when considering efficient, small compound ligands (Overington et al., 2005). A cluster on the lower left part of this figure caught our attention, with 13 disease complexes related with different types of cancer that are highly expressed in cells and tissues involved in the signaling and shaping of the adaptive immune system (such as NK cells, B cells, dendritic cells, thymus, monocytes). Quercetin shows high affinity interactions with 11 of the complexes, whereas hydroquinone and D-glucono-1,5-lactone interact with one complex each. The protein complex targeted by hydroquinone is involved in DNA repair (GO:0006281, P-value\u2a7d5.10e\u221215) supporting evidence that this metabolite acts as an inducer of cytogenetic changes and DNA hypomethylation (Ji et al., 2010), whereas the protein complex targeted by \ud835\udc9f-glucono-1,5-lactone is involved in transcription regulation (GO:0045449, P-value\u2a7d5.29e\u221222).",

Following the same approach as the one used for the healthy individuals, we defined the metabolic network of the bacterial community for obese (1487 reactions) and IBD patients (1480 reactions). When clustering the samples for obese and IBD patients, based on binary data, we observed a similar trend as for the healthy individuals with three clusters of high, medium and low metabolic potential (data not shown). As the binary data could not reveal any significant differences in the metabolic potential between healthy and disease samples, we evaluated the abundance of the metabolic reactions per individual in each group (healthy, obese and IBD). The term abundance corresponds to the frequency of the sequences coding for each metabolic protein within the complete set of metabolic genes of the individual. In contrast to the binary data, attempting to cluster the samples of each group based on the abundance values resulted in no distinct clusters. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the most abundant metabolic reactions for healthy, obese and IBD samples. N-succinyl ornithine carbamoyl transferase and GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase were the most abundant metabolic genes not only in healthy but also in obese and IBD samples. When comparing the top-20 most abundant metabolic genes between the different groups very few differences were observed. In the comparison of the healthy against the other two groups, 3-aminobutyryl-CoA ammonia lyase, N-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase and formate C-acetyltransferase were the only reactions that did not appear in the top-20 of obese individuals, while pyruvate synthase, dimethylmaleate hydratase, acetyl-CoA-acetyl transferase, pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate synthase (glutamine hydrolyzing) and hydrogensulfite reductase are the ones absent in the IBD top-20 most abundant metabolic genes.",

The abundance of only two metabolic genes was found to be significantly different (P-value<0.05, both lower abundant in IBD individuals). The first reaction (E.C.1.3.5.4) is catalyzed by fumarate reductase, whereas the second one is the oxidation of menadiol by quinol monooxygenase yielding menadiole, superoxide and H+. As there is an increasing focus on oxidative stress as potential etiological factor and/or triggering factor in Crohn's disease (Iborra et al., 2011), it was interesting to find a reaction containing superoxide significantly different between healthy and IBD patients. While in the literature there are metabolomic-based studies performed in humans or model systems that have reported differences in the concentration of specific metabolites between healthy and non-healthy (obese, IBD) individuals (Waldram et al., 2009; Turnbaugh et al., 2010; Le Gall et al., 2011; Ponnusami et al., 2011), our analysis points out that these differences are not the result of genomic variability in the metabolic potential of the gut microflora. The analysis of transcripts would be the next natural step of the present study, in order to investigate whether there is a uniform functional pattern in healthy, obese and IBD samples or the differences in the metabolome level observed in other studies are the result of differences at the mRNA level.",

A drug and a compound were considered similar if they had a Tanimoto coefficient\u2a7e0.85 and shared at least one known protein interactor in ChEMBLdb. (ii) We evaluated the sequence similarity (90% similarity and 80% coverage) of the drug targets with the metabolic and non-metabolic proteins of the metagenome of healthy individuals. In total, 603 experimental and approved drugs (among them 42 antibiotics) were predicted to perturb 515 unique metabolic reactions (64 drugs linked to metabolic reactions based on drug-metabolite chemical similarity and 556 drugs based on target homology). From these metabolic reactions, 161 are essential reactions (DEG 6.5) (Figure 3a). Interestingly, 16 experimental drugs and 5 approved drugs are identical to metabolites that act as substrates in the microbiome metabolic network, indicating that their therapeutic activity is potentially affected by bacterial metabolism. Looking into the non-metabolic targets of drugs, based on the sequence similarity of the drug target and the MetaHit sequences, we found 334 drugs (among them 60 antibiotics) that could potentially modulate the activity of 495 proteins (Figure 3b) of the bacterial community (170 essential proteins). From the above drug\u2013microbiome interactions there were several notable cases. Tobramycin interacts with two non-metabolic proteins, which are both assigned as essential. Tobramycin is an antibiotic used to treat various types of bacterial infections and shows diarrhea and abdominal pain as highly common side effects (www.sideeffects.embl.de). Olanzapine and aripirpazol were shown to interact each with one non-metabolic protein of the gut metagenome. These two antipsychotic drugs show diarrhea, dyspepsia, constipation and gain weight (only olanzapine) as common side effects. Cytarabine, an anticancer drug, targets five metabolic proteins (one of them essential) of the bacterial metabolic network. According to SIDER constipation is a common side effect associated with this treatment. In Table 1, we present the 18 drugs and their respective Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification codes with the most relevant, to the gut microbiome, side effects (diarrhea, flatulence and so on).",

The finding that from this set of metabolites, 18 are present in DrugBank provides evidence that we carry a natural pharmacy in our guts. In addition, 15 other \u2018non-human' metabolites were found to interact with a set of human protein complexes associated with a wide spectrum of diseases. For example quercetin, a flavonoid compound that is widely distributed in nature, and menadione, a vitamin precursor of K2, were found to interact with disease protein complexes associated with a large number of OMIM IDs. Although there are no official health claims granted to quercetin, several studies have been conducted that report reduction of systolic blood pressure and plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein concentrations in overweight subjects with a high cardiovascular disease risk phenotype (Egert et al., 2009), potential anti-obesity effects (Yang et al., 2008) and protection from colon and prostate cancer (Senthilkumar et al., 2011; Bae et al., 2012). Using here compound-protein interaction data we associated quercetin with disease protein complexes involved in both obesity and IBD. Menadione is a clinically important chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of leukemia and other types of cancer (Laux and Nel, 2001; Matzno et al., 2008). Due to adverse effects associated with it, menadione is used as nutritional supplement only in few developing countries, but is still used in many countries as inexpensive micronutrient for livestock. Understanding the regulation of the metabolic pathways in which the above two and the rest of the 33 metabolites are involved, and monitoring their actual concentration in healthy and disease individuals, could guide us to rationally design diets that promote host homeostasis. However, as genomic data provide only a blueprint or inventory of genes encoding enzymes without any proof of functionality, meta-transcriptomic or meta-metabolomic analysis is necessary before we attempt to shape the bacterial metabolic network activity to benefit the host. Especially, the power of meta-metabolomic analysis for establishing direct links between alterations in the gut microbiome and human host responses has been demonstrated in several studies. Martin et al. (2010) applied microbial profiling of fecal contents in four groups of animals to study dietary-specific modulation of microbial populations and a different profile of amino acids and SCFAs was observed upon modification of the dietary pattern (glucose\u2013lactose mix) in conventional and non-conventional animals. In another notable study Yap et al. (2008) were the first to show that major perturbation of microbiome metabolites manifests with changes to the host's systemic metabolic phenotype.",

Although the effect of antibiotics is short term, as typically most families and genera of gut microorganisms return to typical levels within weeks of exposure, there is no information on how the bacterial communities are affected by other classes of drugs, especially drugs with long-term use from the human host. From the computational analysis applied in our study there are indications that antibiotics are not the only therapeutic treatment that can result in a dysregulation of the symbiosis between the host and its microbiota. Antipsychotic and anticancer drugs were also found to potentially interact with bacterial proteins, and these interactions might explain observed side effects, such as diarrhea and constipation; however, experimental evidence is required to validate these observations. Zheng et al. (2011) have determined the global metabolic effects and dynamic changes of 223 fecal metabolites in antibiotic-treated rats and revealed alterations in metabolic systems not previously correlated with antibiotics. In parallel, Jakobsson et al. (2010) analyzed the 16S rRNA gene using 454-based pyrosequencing and terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism of bacterial populations in human fecal samples after antibiotic administration and revealed marked ecological disturbances that naturally influence the abundance of specific metabolites. These are just a few of the experimental approaches that could be used for studying experimentally drug\u2013microbiome interactions. In contrast to antibiotics, antipsychotic and anticancer drugs are long-duration treatments; therefore a mechanistic understanding of their side effects is of utmost importance.",
