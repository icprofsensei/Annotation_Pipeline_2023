This microbial community could be altered by habitat pollution and other human activities that threaten the host organisms. Here, we satellite-tracked a flock of swan geese (Anser cygnoides) migrating from their breeding area (Khukh Lake, Mongolia), with low levels of human activity, to their wintering area (Poyang Lake, China) which has been heavily impacted by human activities. Twenty fecal samples were collected from each site. High-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS was employed to explore bacterial and fungal composition and diversity of their gut microbiome. Although general composition, alpha-diversity, functional prediction, and the central taxa in the phylogenetic networks showed some similarities between the two habitats, significant divergences were detected in terms of beta-diversity, species abundances, and interaction network topologies. In addition, disease-related and xenobiotic biodegradation pathways, and pathogenic bacteria were significantly increased in bacterial communities from samples at Poyang Lake. Our results reveal that the gut microbiome of swan geese, while somewhat altered after long-distance migration, still maintained a core group of species. We also show that habitat environmental stress could impact these gut microbial communities, suggesting that habitat pollution could indirectly threaten wild animals by altering their gut microbiome.",

These wild geese migrate thousands of miles every year between their breeding and wintering areas. A majority breed in central and eastern Mongolia and adjacent regions of China and Russia, while the main wintering area for this species is the Middle and Lower Yangtze River floodplain wetlands in eastern China1. Swan geese mainly subsist on the young stems of submerged macrophytes, particularly those of Vallisneria spiralis, in both their wintering and breeding areas2. This narrow dietary range makes this species highly sensitive to environmental changes1. Due to habitat loss, excessive hunting, and egg collection, the population of the geese has dramatically declined over the past couple decades. The swan goose was uplisted on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List from Near Threatened to Vulnerable in 1992 and further elevated to Endangered in 20003. Based on combined counts during the non-breeding season in East Asia, the total number of swan geese was 56,000\u201398,0004. While a great deal of effort has been invested in the study of habitat changes and migration routes for its conservation1, there has been less concern about how habitat impacts affect the symbiotic microbiome of swan geese.",

During the last decade there have been rapid developments in the investigation of community composition and structure of vertebrate gut microbiota and interactions with their hosts7,8. Because of their distinct morphological characteristics and high-energy requirements9, the avian gut microbiome is significantly different from those of other animals10\u201312. It should also be noted that these studies have mainly focused on either economically important avians, such as chickens and turkeys, or rare wild species, such as hoatzins13, kakapo14, penguins15, vultures16, Procellariiformes seabirds17 and hooded cranes18. Little is currently known about the gut microbiota of herbivorous geese. Wild Anseriformes of Anatidae are exceptional herbivores in bird lineages, as most are exclusively herbivorous, feeding on leaves, tubers, seeds, or rhizomes of plants19. Swan geese require high-protein foods, such as young tubers of Vallisneria natans, to obtain sufficient energy1.",

Therefore, their gut microbial community plays an important role in the geographic spread of various zoonotic agents, because it is one of the major ways to transport pathogenic bacteria21. Because of their food resources, overwintering and reproduction wetland refuges play very important roles in the migration of birds with a narrow dietary range. As the living areas for most wild animals, wild habitats have huge impacts on the health of all residents, including their behavior, foraging, growth, and breeding22,23. Human activity and environmental pollution have become serious threats to these areas24. The host species is considered to be one important factor in shaping the gut microbial structures25, and dietary nutrients as a second important factor26. The assemblage patterns of birds\u2019 gut microbiome were also driven by nutrients and host species25,27, but the impacts from the habitat environment have not been cautiously studied.",

However, how the distinctly different post-migration habitats affect gut microbiomes remained unknown. In this study, we tracked a flock of swan geese by satellite as they migrated from their breeding to wintering area (1800\u2009km apart) and studied how their gut microbiome changed. The breeding and wintering area of swan geese display different levels of environmental stress. The breeding area, Khukh Lake, is minimally impacted by human activities while their wintering area Poyang Lake sees high level of human activities including fisheries aquaculture. Water quality of Poyang Lake has declined in recent years, particularly due to input from agricultural drainage water with high total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations caused by increasingly intensive use of chemical fertilizers by local farmers29. Thus, we hypothesized, (i) the core group of gut microorganisms are similar due to the same host species and similar diet; while (ii) both bacterial and fungal communities could be altered after long distance migration.",

At lower taxonomic levels, 1,486 genera were detected across all samples. More than 90% of the sequences belonged to 16 genera, with the dominant genera being Clostridiaceae-SMB53 (23.21%), Turicibacter (17.75%), and Clostridium (8.39%).

The dominant phyla were Basidiomycota (48.04%) and Ascomycota (30.25%). At lower taxonomic levels, 287 genera were detected across all samples. More than 90% of the sequences belonged to 11 genera, with the dominant genera being Cryptococcus (39.20%), Sporobolomyces (29.57%), and Pilaira (26.58%). A large proportion of unclassified fungi were found in SG_N (11.54%), while the proportion was relatively smaller in SG_S (3.71%). The dominant phylum of SG_N was Ascomycota (SG_N 55.51%, SG_S 10.37%, P\u2009<\u20090.001), while that of SG_S was Basidiomycota (SG_N 30.01%, SG_S 62.22%, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and both of these phyla were significantly different between the two sampling areas.",

The South habitat gut microbiome pMEN was larger and more complex than the North habitat pMEN (Table\u00a02, Fig.\u00a06A,B), indicating microbiome at Poyang Lake showed more species interactions than gut microbiome at Khukh Lake. The different node typological positions in a network represented different roles for species in the community. Most of the nodes in these two sites are peripheral nodes while several module hub species were identified (Fig.\u00a0S6). In these two pMENs, a majority of the nodes belonged to Firmicutes, the dominant phylum in swan geese gut microbiome, while the node with max degree (node with most neighbors) from both pMENs were the identical OTU_21939 which was an unknown species in genus Clostridium. Although 10 of its neighbors were consistent between both habitats (38% of neighbors in SG_N, 32% in SG_S), OTU_21939 still contained more distinctive neighbors in SG_N and SG_S (Fig.\u00a06C), suggesting the interactions among the major species could be conserved to a certain extent but that most interactions could be swapped in these two areas.",

Both host species and dietary nutrients are potential drivers of gut microbiome assemblies of wild animals25,27, while other factors could also alter gut microbiome composition, including age30, health31, and the habitat environment22,24,32,33. However, it is hard to distinguish its impacts with diet and host genetics in most cases. In this study, we attempted to track a group of swan geese via satellite and collected their fecal samples in different habitat areas separated by more than 1800\u2009km. The breeding area, Khukh Lake, is located quite far from urban centers and is relatively undeveloped with low human population density (Fig.\u00a01C). However, the wintering area located at Poyang Lake, the largest fresh water lake in China, has deteriorated in recent years because of industrialization and urbanization (Fig.\u00a01D)29,34. Swan geese mostly eat the young stem of submerged macrophytes, particularly those of Vallisneria spiralis, in both wintering and breeding areas2. Therefore, these wild birds have a very narrow dietary range, such that the food sources are very similar in these two habitats. Due to the similar dietary regimes in both location, the influence of diet can be ignored as a factor, leaving local environmental factors as the main cause of microbiome differences. As a result, the fecal samples from these two sites showed some differences after the long migration. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS from fecal DNAs were utilized to assess alterations to the gut microbiome composition, diversity, phylogenetic molecular networks, and functional predictions caused by long distance migration between breeding and wintering habitats.",

Compared with the greater white-fronted geese from the same wintering habitat, the swan geese\u2019s gut bacterial communities between showed less divergence between the two habitats (Fig.\u00a04A and Table\u00a01), suggesting the host species is still the most important factor in shaping the gut microbial community structure25. Additionally, Chao1 estimated richness and Shannon index showed that the alpha-diversity of swan goose bacterial communities between two sites showed no significant difference, and both of these values were lower than those of greater white-fronted geese (Fig.\u00a03). At the phylum level, swan goose gut microbiome from both habitats was dominated by Firmicutes, which was in accordance with previous studies on other avian species, such as penguins15, Procellariiform seabirds17, chickens35, hooded cranes18, Swainson\u2019s thrushes and gray catbirds36. Members of the phylum Firmicutes are associated with the decomposition of complex carbohydrates, polysaccharides, sugars and fatty acids, which are major nutrient sources for all animal hosts37,38. PICRUSt functional predictions also showed that metabolic pathways accounted the highest proportion (48.35%) of all classified bacterial functions (Fig.\u00a05A). At the genus level, the dominant group for both sets of swan goose samples was Clostridiaceae-SMB53 (24.77% in SG_N and 21.58% in SG_S). In addition, the networking results showed that the central OTU (the node with most connectivity) was OTU_21939 (Clostridium) in the pMENSs from both sites. Clostridium was firstly discovered bacterial genus in human feces, and it is associated with production of acetic and formic acids39. All of the above results indicated the gut microbiome of swan geese, especially the dominant and central bacteria species, are consistent even after long-distance migration due to the host species and it\u2019s restricted diet. A previous study of Swainson\u2019s thrushes and gray catbirds also showed that energetic condition of migrants was not significantly related to overall microbiome community structure though it cannot be conclusively stated that migratory flight does not impact the microbiome36. Therefore, the core bacteria of the swan goose gut microbiome are conserved after migration.",

After long-distance migration, the phylogenetic beta-diversity of both bacterial and fungal communities showed significant changes, though it should also be noted there was a large amount of inter-individual variation (Fig.\u00a04, Table\u00a01). In the compositions of microbial communities, with some phyla and genera showing significant difference between two sampling sites. For example, Proteobacteria was the most obviously altered phylum between South and North habitats. Compared with the greater white-fronted geese from Poyang Lake, Proteobacteria in these two host species at the same site (Poyang Lake) showed no difference, but both of them were much higher in swan geese at Khukh Lake. Proteobacteria is the most dominant bacterial phylum in the freshwater systems of Poyang Lake40. Additionally, distinctive network topologies were found at each site (Table\u00a02, Fig.\u00a06). The more complex set of network interactions at Poyang Lake showed that microbial species interactions in geese\u2019s gut could be altered according to host species28 and by habitat environmental stresses. Therefore, the gut microbiome of swan geese showed significant difference between the two habitats.",

However, significant divergences of both bacterial and fungal communities were detected between the two these habitats in terms of beta-diversity, community structures and microbial interactions due to the long-distance migration and differing environmental conditions at the two habitats. The breeding area was a lake that is minimally impacted by human activities, while the wintering area is highly impacted by human activities. The activities and behaviors of wild animals have always been affected by human activities41. Migratory animals have also been greatly threatened by human-induced change. For example, twenty years of continent-wide citizen science data assessing population trends of ten shorebird taxa that refuel on Yellow Sea tidal mudflats, a threatened ecosystem that has shrunk by\u2009>\u200965% in recent decades24. In recent years, the water quality of Poyang Lake has deteriorated sharply with the degree of eutrophication becoming more serious due to industrialization and urbanization, as well as a decrease in the size of the lake over time29,42. In this study, the gut microbiome of swan geese showed the obvious enrichment of pathogenic genera in Poyang Lake, including several Gamma-proteobacteria such as Vibrio, Shewanella, and Pseudoalteromonas (Fig.\u00a0S3). In addition to those pathogenic genera, SG_S also had a large number of disease-related pathways than SG_N (Fig.\u00a05B). Xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism pathways, such as DDT degradation, Nitrotoluene degradation, and Toluene degradation, were also higher in swan geese\u2019s gut microbiome in Poyang Lake than uncontaminated Khukh Lake. On the other hand, the network from Poyang Lake was more complex and showed a greater negative correlation, which may be related to environmental stress. Together these results help us to understand the impact of environmental pollution on wetlands, and especially its impact on the migratory birds that utilize those environments. It also supports efforts for the protection of these habitats for migratory birds, and provides basic data regarding the effects of habitat pollution and degradation on the birds.",

Our results revealed the variety of wild swan geese during their migration. We also indicated that, with the exceptions of food nutrients and host genetic distinctions, the habitat environments could alter the gut microbial communities of wild animals leading to the enrichment of some environmental-specific species in their intestines. Thus, polluted habitats may pose serious health threats to wild animals in part through alterations to their gut microbiome.",

In South, feces were collected at Poyang Lake (N 28\u00b054\u203220.22\u2032\u2032 E 116\u00b016\u203213.92\u2032\u2032) in China, in January, 2015 (Fig.\u00a01D). Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve is one of the most important wintering area for migratory geese in China, providing luxuriant food and suitable habitats for a high diversity of herbivorous wintering birds. Access into the lake areas were permitted by the Management Bureaus of Khukh Lake and Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve who are responsible for protection and management of these two lakes, respectively.",

As soon as the swan geese finished feeding and flown away, fresh droppings were collected and stored in sterile tubes.

However, significant divergences of both bacterial and fungal communities were also detected between the two typical habitats in terms of beta-diversity, community structures and microbial interactions. Additionally, many disease-related and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways, pathogenic bacteria, and negative correlation were found in bacteria communities of samples in Poyang Lake, indicating the impact of habitat environment on the gut microbiome of wild animals. Our results revealed that excepting for food nutrients and host genetic distinctions, the habitat environment could also alter the gut microbial communities of wild animals and enrich some environmental-specific species in their intestines. Thus, the polluted habitats are serious health threats to all wild animals in part through their gut microbiomes.",
