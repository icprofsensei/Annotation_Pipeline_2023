A better knowledge of the differences in gut microbiota composition and stability between patients with CF and healthy subjects could lead to optimization of current antibiotic therapies and/or development of add-on therapies. Using conventional culturing and population fingerprinting by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA amplicons, we compared the predominant fecal microbiota of 21 patients with CF and 24 healthy siblings in a cross-sectional study. General medium counts, as well as counts on media specific for lactic acid bacteria, clostridia, Bifidobacterium spp., Veillonella spp., and Bacteroides-Prevotella spp., were consistently higher in sibling samples than in CF samples, whereas the reverse was found for enterobacterial counts. DGGE fingerprinting uncovered large intersubject variations in both study groups. On the other hand, the cross-sectional data indicated that the predominant fecal microbiota of patients and siblings had comparable species richness. In addition, a longitudinal study was performed on 7 or 8 consecutive samples collected over a 2-year period from two patients and their respective siblings. For these samples, DGGE profiling indicated an overall trend toward lower temporal stability and lower species richness in the predominant fecal CF microbiota. The observed compositional and dynamic perturbations provide the first evidence of a general dysbiosis in children with CF compared to their siblings.",

Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, it is known that dietary alterations, changes in environment, physical and/or psychological stress, and antimicrobial agents can disrupt the natural colonization barrier, which may trigger overgrowth by autochthonous opportunistic pathogens and eventually contribute to the development of several disorders (13, 15, 21, 68). Particularly in very young infants, disturbance of the indigenous enteric microbiota could have a tremendous impact on the host's metabolic needs, as well as on the development of the intestine-associated immune system (65).",

Also, for cystic fibrosis (CF), a lethal hereditary disorder leading to respiratory infections and chronic inflammation, a possible association with intestinal dysbiosis has been assumed but never documented. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an ion channel in the apical membranes of exocrine epithelial cells (10, 29). Not only do patients with CF have extremely viscous respiratory secretions, but also, abnormal mucus production in the small intestine is thought to contribute to gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms of malabsorption and obstruction (40, 50). Because of recurrent bronchopulmonary infections, patients with CF are treated with repeated courses of antibiotics. During antibiotic therapy, important bacterial groups may be radically reduced or eliminated from the gut, depending on the dosage of the antimicrobial agent and its pharmacokinetics (21, 42, 51). Although it is commonly accepted that the ecological balance is restored a few weeks after antibiotic administration, there is also evidence showing that antibiotic-associated disturbances can persist for a long period after treatment (25, 27, 49). Furthermore, overgrowth by antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi may emerge from prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents (51). In patients with CF, antibiotic-associated infections with opportunistic pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile, may cause severe diarrhea and/or pseudomembranous colitis (23, 55).",

Aliquots (50 \u03bcl) were spread plated in triplicate onto the general medium for colon bacteria (MCB) (66) and six selective media, i.e., eosin methylene blue agar (EMB) (CM0069; Oxoid) for isolation of Enterobacteriaceae; deMan-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) agar (CM0361; Oxoid) for isolation of lactic acid bacteria; Veillonella agar (VA) (53) for Veillonella spp.; reinforced clostridial medium (DRCM) (CM0149; Oxoid) supplemented with 15 ml 60% Na-lactate (VWR International), 0.001 g resazurin sodium salt (R-7017; Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.25 g l-cysteine HCl (C6852; Sigma-Aldrich) for isolation of clostridia; BCCM/LMG modified Columbia agar (M144) for isolation of Bifidobacterium spp. (39); and medium for Bacteroides-Prevotella (MBP) (35). All plates were incubated anaerobically for 72 h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, the bacterial concentrations (CFU g\u22121) in the original sample were determined, and one MCB plate per dilution was selected for harvesting. The resulting cultured fractions from MCB were homogenized in 500 \u03bcl resuspension (RS) buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M EDTA [pH 8.0]), and the pellets were frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until DNA extraction.",

Whereas the low-%GC richness index (LRI) refers to the number of bands in the low-%GC region, the high-%GC richness index (HRI) is a measure of the number of bands in the high-%GC region. The delineation of these two regions was determined by the position of the reference strain, Escherichia fergusonii LMG 7866 (GenBank accession number NC_011740), which has a genomic %GC of 49.9 and a V3-16S rRNA %GC of 50.8. The region covered by the LRI contains V3-16S rRNA amplicons in the DGGE %GC range of 35.0 to 52.5 and thus mainly represents low-G+C bacteria (genomic %GC < 50.0). The region covered by the HRI contains V3-16S rRNA amplicons in the DGGE %GC range of 52.5 to 70.0, which largely corresponds to the high-%GC bacteria (genomic %GC > 50.0).

Although siblings cannot be considered controls for patients with CF, it can be assumed that the effects of several factors that may influence the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota, such as genetic background, age, and environment, are to a certain extent comparable in the two subject groups. However, other factors, such as the effect of daily diet, certainly differ, since patients with CF are recommended to consume a high-fat diet to meet their energy needs. Provided that such cohorts can be recruited, comparison between patients with CF who are on frequent versus infrequent antibiotic therapy would be an alternative approach to assess the contribution of antibiotics to the development of dysbiosis. In addition to culture-independent community profiling, the study also made use of conventional culturing with the aim of establishing a culture collection of fecal isolates for future functional analyses, such as determination of specific metabolic properties and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. However, by plating fecal samples onto a series of group-specific media for enumeration of metabolically important subpopulations, it is inevitable that nontarget groups will also be recovered on selective media and thus contribute to the counts. Taken together with the intrinsic biases of culture-dependent isolation of intestinal bacteria (43), the results of these enumerations are thus only indicative and should be further substantiated by other, more specific quantitative methods.",

                    "text": "In both the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, the greatest difference in bacterial counts was found on the medium selective for Bacteroides and Prevotella, showing higher mean counts for sibling samples than for CF patient samples. Bacteroides numbers tend to be highly variable among different individuals (14, 32, 58). Whether the observed reduction in MBP counts in CF samples involves the loss of one or more specific species or rather indicates the lower abundance of an entire functional subpopulation requires further investigation. Therefore, preliminary speculations concerning metabolic consequences for patients with CF are difficult to make. Although major quantitative shifts in Bacteroides members have been reported in several intestinal disorders, a causal link with any of these diseases is still not clear. Studies on fecal (54) and mucosal (9) samples from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients revealed a functional reduction of the Bacteroides fragilis subgroup, which potentially shields the host against Escherichia coli-induced colitis. However, other studies have demonstrated a possible increase of Bacteroidetes group members in the mucosal microbiota of patients suffering from Crohn's disease (19, 60) and ulcerative colitis (33). Several studies have shown that orally administered antibiotics can significantly decrease Bacteroides counts (2, 3, 46). In fact, a decline in intestinal Bacteroides numbers has been reported after treatment with amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic that was also administrated to many of the patients in the current study (41).",

In atopic dermatitis (5, 28, 69), type II diabetes (73), and Crohn's disease (17) patients, a reduction in bifidobacteria has also been demonstrated. In contrast, a molecular study assessing the fecal microbial populations of Crohn's disease patients revealed a relatively stable Bifidobacterium community (54). Many studies have reported an antibiotic-induced decrease in Bifidobacterium counts (3, 16, 41, 46). Several Bifidobacterium strains are used as probiotics in healthy and diseased populations (47, 64), but until now, only very few studies have assessed the effects of probiotics in patients with CF (6, 7, 70).",

It has been hypothesized that potentially pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria can proliferate from inflamed intestinal tissue, triggering increased oxygen release, increased availability of pathogen receptors, and competitive advantage in the altered microenvironment (34, 59). Hence, intestinal inflammation in patients with CF could be correlated with increased enterobacterial counts. In addition, several studies concerning IBD pathology (1, 9, 34, 57) and celiac disease (8) have reported increased Gammaproteobacteria levels. Bennet and coworkers (3) examined fecal microbial samples from very young infants during antimicrobial treatment and observed an increase of Enterobacteriaceae.",

Samples from subjects belonging to the same patient-sibling pair did not group together, and no typical CF fingerprint was found. Besides CF-related characteristics, genotype, age, and/or environmental factors also may have contributed to the observation that the fingerprints were unique. In addition, the microbiota of different individuals may respond in unique ways to a single antibiotic (26). Analogous observations were reported when comparing stool samples from children with celiac disease with those from their siblings by DGGE (11). Comparison of mean pairwise similarity values from the cross-sectional study revealed significantly higher compositional variation among CF samples than between samples from healthy siblings. Possibly, this observation could reflect periods with changing rates of dysbiosis mediated by personalized antimicrobial treatment courses. Still, the average similarity appeared to be relatively low in both subject groups, which again indicates the large interindividual variations. Likewise, several comparative studies of the fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease have reported greater variability between samples from patients than between those from healthy controls (54, 57). Relatively low similarity values have been reported between DGGE banding patterns of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, as well as between healthy controls (44). Unlike our findings, Seksik and coworkers observed relatively little variation between the temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) fingerprints of the healthy controls (57).",

In addition, moving-window analysis of banding patterns originating from patients with CF in both patient-sibling pairs revealed greater variation between consecutive sampling points than in those of healthy siblings, which is indicative of a considerable reduction in temporal stability. Interestingly, the culture-dependent study also revealed a remarkable decrease in temporal stability in CF samples (Fig. 1a, c, e, and f). Possibly, a combination of long-term antibiotic administration and intestinal inflammation in patients with CF could explain the observed fluctuations in their fecal bacterial communities. Several comparisons between fecal samples from IBD patients and healthy subjects have also described a highly dynamic bacterial community in the chronically inflamed intestine (12, 37, 54, 57). In addition, Jakobsson and coworkers (26) previously reported that fecal samples showed considerable variation in community structure over a 4-year period of antibiotic administration. Compared to previous population-fingerprinting studies (37, 67, 76), the present 2-year survey revealed less similarity between fecal fingerprints of healthy siblings, suggesting that the gastrointestinal microbiota may be more dynamic over a prolonged period. Also, in this case, dietary regimen, age, and/or environmental conditions are likely to play a role in the observed time-dependent variations of the healthy intestinal microbiota.",

A decrease in species richness is thought to negatively impact the ecosystem's functional stability because the presence of fewer species may result in lower productivity, and it would make the system less flexible to compensate for natural fluctuations (74). In the present study, species richness was measured by determining the total number of bands, as well as determining the band numbers in two defined regions in the DGGE profile representing low- and high-%GC organisms. For both sample types, the cross-sectional study revealed no significant differences in LRI, HRI, and TRI values between patients and their siblings, which again seems to indicate that the complexities of the predominant fecal microbiota in patients and healthy subjects are comparable. In contrast, pronounced differences in species richness between CF patient and sibling samples were found in the longitudinal study. The fingerprints of both patients displayed lower mean LRI values than those of the corresponding siblings. The LRI is linked to the low-%GC region of the DGGE profiles, which mainly represents Gram-negative Bacteroidetes and Gram-positive Firmicutes, the two most abundant phyla in the human colon (14). In IBD patients (19, 36), as well as in patients undergoing antibiotic treatment (2, 3, 41, 46), an underrepresentation of fecal Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes has been reported. Except for the fecal fingerprints of the first patient-sibling pair, HRI values were lower for fecal and MCB fingerprints of both patients. The high-%GC region of the DGGE profiles, which corresponds to the HRI, mainly includes members of the Actinobacteria, such as bifidobacteria. Given the beneficial roles attributed to bifidobacteria in the human gut ecosystem (30), a decline in actinobacterial diversity may have a negative impact on the host's well-being. The fact that antibiotic regimens in patients with CF are often highly personalized, in combination with the subject specificity of the predominant colon microbiota, might explain the observed relative differences in species richness between patient-sibling pairs 1 and 2. On the other hand, the TRI, LRI, and HRI values might have been biased by the small sample size included in the longitudinal study.",

Possibly, both the intrinsic characteristics of the disease (such as abnormal mucus secretions and pancreatic insufficiency) and the detrimental effects of intensive antimicrobial treatment courses play key roles in this dysbiosis. In addition, many of our findings are supported by insights obtained from other gut-related disorders. Furthermore, it can be speculated that some of the borderline significant differences observed between the study groups might further increase in significance if the sample size could be increased. Clearly, much better insight into the dynamics and homeostasis of the intestinal CF microbiota is needed in order to predict how CF dysbiosis may have dramatic functional consequences for the gut ecosystem and the host's well-being.",
