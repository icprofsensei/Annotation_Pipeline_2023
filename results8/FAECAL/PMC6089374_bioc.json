While spatially separated from the brain by both the intestinal epithelial barrier and the blood brain barrier, there is bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS) via the vagus nerve, the immune system, and neuroactive metabolites released into systemic circulation (5).",

For example, in the only study to date showing interactions between brain structure and gut microbes, results suggested that obese patients had brain structural changes in the hypothalamus and caudate nucleus associated with specific microbiota profiles and changes in cognitive function. However, in this cross-sectional design, it was not clear whether these changes may have been a risk factor for, or a result of, obesity status (13). Small studies of probiotic interventions have shown modest effects on mood and variable effects on cognition, leading to speculations that gut bacteria may be evolutionarily programmed to improve our moods, thus making us more social and prone to activities that allow person-to-person transmission of the organisms (14\u201317). We have previously demonstrated in healthy women that 4-week ingestion of a fermented milk product with probiotics can shift functional brain responses to an emotional attention task towards lower reactivity in viscerosensory, somatosensory, and affective regions, providing more direct evidence in humans that brain function can be affected by modulation of the gut microbiota (18).",

They were instructed to collect the stool on the day prior to their MRI visit, freeze it in their home freezer and then transport it on ice packs to the Research Center where the stool was frozen at \u221280 degrees until analysis. Samples were shipped frozen to the laboratory facilities at Danone Research (Palaiseau, France) where it underwent 16S rRNA profiling using 454 pyrosequencing (V5\u2013V6 variable regions). V5 and V6 hypervariable 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) regions were amplified using primers 784F and 1061R (25). Sequencing was performed by DNAVision SA (Charleroi, Belgium) on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument (Roche) using titanium chemistry and primer A. Analyses were performed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) v1.7 (26). Reads were filtered according to the following quality criteria: size between 150 and 500nt, quality above 25 over a 50 base pairs window, no mismatch authorized in primers and barcode sequences, and absence of polymers larger than 6nt. Remaining sequences were denoised using default parameters and clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) defined at 97% identity using CD-HIT (27). Representative sequences for each OTU were aligned and taxonomically assigned using Greengenes (August 2011). ChimeraSlayer was used to discard potential chimeric sequences (28) leading to 5943 +/\u2212 3100 (mean +/\u2212 SD) reads per sample. Normalization was performed using relative abundances. Beta diversity was performed on weighted Unifrac distances using rarefaction of 1770 sequences per sample. To cluster the samples based on weighted distance matrix, we used the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm in the R package \u2018Cluster\u2019. The optimal number of clusters was two, as it had the highest Rousseeuw's Silhouette internal cluster quality index (SI=.36), calculated using the R package \u2018Cluster\u2019 (29). The resulting microbial clusters showed one with greater Prevotella abundance (Prevotella-high, n=7) and one with greater Bacteroides abundance (Bacteroides-high, n=32) (Figure 1), SI=.36. The variance accounted for by the two components that defined the microbiota clusters totaled 57.2% (Component 1=39.5%, Component 2= 17.7%). These two clusters were utilized for the analyses described below. To identify demographic factors which may confound the cluster designations, t-tests were performed for age, body mass index, anxiety and depression (HAD score), and positive and negative affect using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 19).",

The experiment was analyzed in a block design. A first-level fixed effects general linear model (GLM) was applied in SPM8 to determine blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity by specifying as regressors, the 30 second baseline and the three valence conditions (negative, positive, neutral). At the subject-level, regressors for the conditions were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function to estimate brain activity. Individual brain responses were determined by subtracting estimated brain activity during the neutral valence image condition from estimates of brain activity during the positive and negative affect conditions. To determine microbiota-based cluster group differences, a GLM was implemented at the second-level using a region of interest (ROI) approach. ROIs defined by the Destrieux atlas (31) included the extended emotional arousal network (amygdala, anterior cingulate and hippocampus). An initial cluster defining threshold of p<.001 was applied and cluster based extent threshold significance was p<.05 after controlling for family wise error as implemented in SPM (32).",

Each variable has an associated \u201cloading\u201d indexing the relative importance of that variable in the brain signature for group discrimination (42). Variable importance in projection (VIP) scores is a standardized measure that represents contribution of each feature relative to the variance explained by all selected brain signatures (44). Usually, predictors with VIP coefficients greater than one are considered particularly important for discrimination (42). Graphical displays illustrated the discriminative abilities of the algorithms (44). The accuracy of the final models were assessed using leave-one-out cross-validation. This overall error rate or accuracy reflects the number of correct predictions from all the predictions made. During this cross-validation procedure, we calculate the stability of the selected variables comprising a component if a training set is altered (44). Stability is computed by calculating the frequency of selected variables across the cross validation runs. During this cross validation step, it was noted that the classification accuracy for of both models decreased with 2 components, therefore the second component for each model was dropped. PLS-DA is discovery-based method that enables generation of novel hypotheses. Post hoc exploratory evaluation of the specific role of Prevotella and Bacteriodes on specific brain regions and affect was performed by correlating bacterial abundances with brain metrics and PANAS scores (See Tables S1\u2013S3, Supplemental Digital Content 1).",

This tendency towards greater behavioral responses to negative valenced stimuli was associated with both functional and structural differences in the hippocampus. The hippocampus, a brain region involved in emotion regulation, had lower volume and showed less BOLD response during negative image viewing. Reduced hippocampal engagement to negative imagery may be associated with increased emotional arousal. Such changes have been suggested to result in less specificity of encoding the contextual details of incoming stimuli, a deficit seen in the setting of several psychiatric disorders, including depression, post traumatic stress disorder, and borderline personality disorder (45\u201347).

The observed lower hippocampal volume and higher volume of the nucleus accumbens in the Prevotella-high group are consistent with greater reactivity to an affective stimulus, with similar volumetric changes described in some studies of mood disorder (48, 49). The Prevotella-high group was associated with greater white matter connectivity in limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuitry (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex to pallidum, amygdala to caudate), and a smaller hippocampal volume compared to the Bacteriodes-high group, both findings also seen in depression (50). This group also showed differences in regions associated with attention and sensory processing. Specifically, they showed more connectivity between the central sulcus, which borders the primary somatosensory and motor cortices, and the middle frontal gyrus, a region at the convergence of the dorsal and ventral attentional networks (51); more dense white matter tracts were seen between the splenium and thalamus, which along with less cortical thickness in the anterior insula, suggests altered sensory processing. Higher connectivity in the Prevotella group was also noted between multiple regions of the temporal lobe associated with visual conceptual/semantic processing (e.g., fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, collateral sulcus, temporal pole) (52, 53).",

Although these groups were identified using an unsupervised approach based on microbial composition, the identified two clusters of subjects defined by the genera Bacteriodes and Prevotella are similar to clusters previously identified across diverse populations (54\u201356). These clusters have been described variously as enterotypes or enterogradients, though this nomenclature has been controversial both because it implies a fixed characteristic of a individual or group and because not all of the clusters are reproducible across studies and analytic techniques (57). Of the reported \u201centerotypes\u201d the most robust groupings appear to be those based on Bacteroides and Prevotella with frequency in the Western population being dominated by the Bacteroides group, as is seen in the current sample (54\u201356). In previous studies these groupings have been independent of age, sex, body mass index or nationality and are shared between monozygotic twins at a high rate (58). Based on a diet questionnaire recalling food intake over the past year (Food Frequency Questionnaire) (59) but not a short term recall, a diet more plentiful in saturated fat and animal protein was associated with the Bacteroides group and a diet rich in plant based fiber with the Prevotella group (56) suggesting an important role for long term diet. Further, in a short term study using a controlled dietary intervention with either high fiber/low fat or high fat/low fiber, individuals failed to change from one \u201centerotype\u201d to another, despite rapid changes in individual bacterial species (56). Beyond these descriptions, the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Prevotella has not been firmly associated with any specific health or physiologic phenotype and the functional pathways associated with the microbiota clusters are not clearly defined. While \u201centerotypes\u201d have been described to be fairly stable, there has been a published report of a single healthy individual moving between \u201centerotypes\u201d over time, without a specific intervention to induce such change (60). Such changes could certainly be mirrored or even induced by changes in brain function and by affective responses, but changes in structure would not be expected on this temporal scale. Therefore, if an interaction between diet and the brain signatures described in the current study exists, it could be based on long term diet, or potentially on dietary factors in early life, while the brain is developing the cortico-limbic and sensory circuitry featured in the brain signatures.",

Due to the preponderance of individuals in the Western population with lower Prevotella abundance, supported in the distribution seen in this sample, the Prevotella group analyzed is very small. Conclusions drawn from this sample will require further validation in larger samples. Further, it is unclear whether the propensity towards developing a more negative affect during this paradigm is a marker of personality traits, a risk factor for developing clinically relevant negative mood states, or just a healthy variant. Although sPLS-DA was chosen specifically because of its ability to deal with small samples, biases due to the unbalanced nature of the samples may exist. For the fMRI task analysis, non-parametric testing for cluster-based inference may have resulted in alternative p-values and better control over family-wise error rate. Importantly, relatively few brain biomarkers were able to predict microbial subgroup membership better than chance and the variables selected for the solutions make biological sense in terms of previous preclinical data on neurobiological-microbiota associations. Ultimately, future studies are needed to test the generalizability of the solution and the estimates of overall model accuracy to other samples.",

Of primary interest is the directionality of the interaction between the brain and gut microbes in healthy humans. The concept that the gut microbiota can drive affective response is supported by preclinical work showing affect changes in rodents after manipulation of gut microbes using antibiotics, probiotics, or fecal transplants, and is also suggested by the changes exhibited in human brain networks after chronic probiotic ingestion (18, 61\u201363). However, the human gut microbiota is frequently affected by the intake of antibiotics, dietary changes, and other interventions without noting changes in mood or affective response. The clinical studies which have shown that such interventions affect mood symptoms in humans have shown very modest changes (14, 64\u201366). The alternate, more plausible hypothesis is that the brain influences gut microbiota via the autonomic nervous system, stress hormones, and centrally mediated immune modulation. Therefore, the same central drivers that create negative affect may also modulate the gastrointestinal milieu which secondarily shapes microbial composition. Whether the microbiota-brain connections we see in this study reflect the modulation of the gut microbiota structure by the brain, or the influence of the microbiota on the brain and its affective responses, cannot be answered in this cross-sectional view. Careful longitudinal studies, including assessment of gut microbial community structure and microbial metabolomics, in conjunction with neuroimaging and behavioral testing is required to establish directionality and causality.",
