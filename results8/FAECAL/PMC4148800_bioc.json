Newly hatched kakapo chicks are subjected to human intervention and are frequently placed in captivity throughout their formative months. Hand rearing greatly reduces mortality among juveniles, but the potential long-term impact on the kakapo gut microbiota is uncertain. To track development of the kakapo gut microbiota, fecal samples from healthy, prefledged juvenile kakapos, as well as from unrelated adults, were analyzed by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing. Following the original sampling, juvenile kakapos underwent a period of captivity, so further sampling during and after captivity aimed to elucidate the impact of captivity on the juvenile gut microbiota. Variation in the fecal microbiota over a year was also investigated, with resampling of the original juvenile population. Amplicon pyrosequencing revealed a juvenile fecal microbiota enriched with particular lactic acid bacteria compared to the microbiota of adults, although the overall community structure did not differ significantly among kakapos of different ages. The abundance of key operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was correlated with antibiotic treatment and captivity, although the importance of these factors could not be proven unequivocally within the bounds of this study. Finally, the microbial community structure of juvenile and adult kakapos changed over time, reinforcing the need for continual monitoring of the microbiota as part of regular health screening.",

It possesses few defenses against introduced mammalian predators (1), has a low reproductive rate, and usually lays only a single egg. Although kakapos were once common throughout New Zealand (2), the population has declined to 125 individuals at the time of publication, confined to three predator-free islands off the coast of New Zealand. Since the 1980s, kakapos have been subjected to an intensive management program focused on preserving the species and eventually restoring the population to self-sustaining levels (3,\u20135). In an effort to optimize management practices, the New Zealand Department of Conservation has collaborated with researchers from a wide range of biological disciplines, including behavioral ecology, physiology, genetics, nutrition, and, recently, microbiology (6,\u201312).",

Apart from being the world's heaviest parrot, the only flightless parrot, and the only parrot to carry out lek breeding (6), the kakapo has been identified as a potential foregut fermenter due to its herbivorous diet and lack of ceca (13). Microbially mediated foregut fermentation is a common trait in mammals but is rare among avians, with only the South American hoatzin being known to perform this process (14). There are notable differences in feeding strategies between the kakapo and hoatzin, however, with kakapos rarely ingesting fibrous plant material, instead extracting the juices from shoots and leaves and discarding the undigested \u201cchews\u201d (15, 16). There is currently no empirical evidence to support or dispute the occurrence of foregut fermentation in kakapos. Intriguingly, the reproductive cycle of the kakapo is linked to the fruiting of particular native New Zealand trees. The rimu tree undergoes a mast season every 3 or 4 years, during which time kakapos mate and rear young. While the link between kakapo and rimu is well established, the causal link between these two phenomena is unclear and is not simply a matter of additional dietary energy enabling reproduction (17).",

Our previous research into the GI tract-associated bacteria of the kakapo revealed a community dominated by only a few operational taxonomic units (OTUs), mainly from the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and apparently lacking in archaea (12, 25). The kakapo GI tract appears to have a low phylum-level diversity of bacteria compared to other birds (25, 26), and this has led to speculation of a population bottleneck for the gut microbiota. The kakapo microbiota is not well understood, but it is likely that current management practices have an impact on the microbial community, as kakapos are removed from the wild and given veterinary care at the first sign of sickness (27). This captivity results in a change in diet and often includes antibiotic treatment, both of which are frequently linked to shifts in microbial community structure (23, 28,\u201331).",

Previous research into the development of the gut microbiota in other host species has shown that the microbiota of juveniles differs significantly from that of adults in both avians and mammals (32,\u201336), although it is not clear whether this pattern is reflected in the kakapo (12). In many avian species, the juvenile microbiota is a dynamically changing community (37,\u201339) that gradually develops toward the adult community structure (33, 36), but the changes in microbiota as the subject ages vary by host. For example, chickens are enriched in Lactobacillaceae in the first week of life (38), while juvenile turkeys appear to harbor a large proportion of Clostridiales until around 10 weeks of age (39). Moreover, even genetically related individuals undergo different developmental patterns when geographically isolated (40). In order to better understand the temporal dynamics of the kakapo microbiota, and potentially gain insights into the impact of human intervention, samples were collected from juvenile kakapos born during the 2011 breeding season, spanning four time points throughout the first year and a half of life. The aims of this study were to compare differences in the juvenile and adult fecal microbiota, to understand the time required for juvenile kakapos to develop a \u201cnormal\u201d adult gut microbiota, and to investigate the potential effects of captivity on the juvenile microbiota.",

Samples were collected from these juveniles at four time points, which are summarized in Table 1. During the nesting period, each juvenile required a period of captivity, due to either low weight gain or sickness. While undergoing the period of captivity, the juveniles were fed a diet of fruit, lactated Ringer's solution, and the proprietary parrot hand rearing formula Exact (Kaytee Products Inc., Chilton, WI). Eight of the captive juveniles were also treated with the commercially available antibiotics Augmentin and Clavulox, which combine a \u03b2-lactam (amoxicillin) and a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) (Tables 1 and \u200band2).2). Samples collected during this period were taken following 5 days of captivity. Following release from captivity, juveniles were given a \u201crecovery\u201d period of 2 weeks, after which additional fecal samples were collected. A final sample was collected approximately 1 year later, at which point the \u201cjuveniles\u201d had fledged from the nest and were now independent adults.",

Each primer was synthesized with an FLX Titanium adaptor sequence (CCA TCT CAT CCC TGC GTG TCT CCG AC for 533f and CCT ATC CCC TGT GTG CCT TGG CAG TC for 907R), and a 10-bp multiplex identifier (MID) barcode was attached to the forward primer by using commercially available barcode sequences (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Branford, CT). For each DNA extraction, three PCRs with 25-\u03bcl mixtures were performed with a specific barcoded primer. Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100 \u03bcM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) mixture, 2.5 \u03bcM forward and reverse primers, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 units Taq polymerase, and 10 ng of template DNA. Cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 5 min; 20 cycles of touchdown PCR (94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s, with a 0.5\u00b0C decrease in annealing temperature per cycle); 10 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s; and a final elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min, with one negative-control run for each primer pair. Following amplification, PCR products from each sample were pooled and purified by using the Agencourt AMPure XP bead system (Agencourt, Beckman Coulter, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Product size was measured by using the Agilent DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer platform. The purified product was quantified by using the Qubit Quant-iT DNA high-sensitivity assay, and DNA concentration and amplicon size were used to equalize the number of molecules pooled per sequencing run. Samples were randomized across sequencing runs, and pyrosequencing was performed on a Roche GS-FLX Titanium platform (Roche, NJ, USA) by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea).",

Good's coverage values show that amplicon pyrosequencing was able to describe essentially the entire microbiota of each sample group, while ecological diversity measures indicate an uneven bacterial community of low diversity (Table 3). This unevenness was reflected in the low Shannon evenness index calculated for each sample. The Shannon evenness index is the ratio of the Shannon diversity index of a sample to the maximum possible Shannon index for the sample, with a value of 1 being perfectly even. The evenness of all samples was low according to this metric (Table 3), and this was apparent visually (Fig. 1). Community richness (Chao1 and ACE) was lowest during the juvenile captivity period, although this was not reflected clearly in the diversity estimators. Similarly, when amplicon sequences were mapped to previous kakapo gut microbiota clone library data, the diversity within the clone library accounted for a comparatively large proportion of the total reads sequenced but a much smaller proportion of the total OTUs (Table 3). Similar to previous findings, the phylum-level membership consisted predominantly of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. In contrast to the clone library data, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were also frequently, though not universally, detected (in \u223c70% and \u223c33% of samples, respectively).",

These groupings were further stratified by age (adult core and juvenile core), and treatment core was calculated for juvenile kakapos under the influence of antibiotics (treated core). In all core calculations of wild birds, two OTUs were classified as core, taxonomically assigned as Escherichia and Streptococcus. The variable microbiota differed between juvenile and adult birds, with more OTUs recruiting to the variable microbiota of juveniles, consistent with the higher diversity and richness indices reported for the juvenile population (Table 3). The treated core microbiota differed from that of the juvenile core and accounted for more of the microbiota than in wild samples. It is important to note that the classification scheme used was based only on presence or absence of OTUs and did not account for their relative abundance in the sample, although abundance carries biological significance in the interpretation of these data. With a single exception, core OTUs accounted for >5% of the amplicon reads in their respective groupings (Table 4). Some variable OTUs, including OTU02 in the antibiotic-treated microbiota, OTU04 in the adult microbiota and OTU06 in the wild juvenile microbiota, accounted for a large proportion of the microbiota in some individuals but were not commonly observed among different individuals.",

These OTUs were reduced in abundance in the juvenile microbiota, and there were no significantly different OTU abundances between the Adult_First and Juvenile_Third communities. We conclude that the apparent increase in abundance of these OTUs is associated with the young age of the Juvenile_First cohort, with the exception of two OTUs (Table 5, asterisks) that were observed in only two of the individuals comprising the Juvenile_First cohort and that may represent individual-specific variation in the microbiota.",

Due to the differential treatment of juveniles in captivity and the rich wild-type data from the Adult_First, Juvenile_First, and Juvenile_Third groups, some inference can be made from the data, although pending additional testing with an adequate control group, these findings remain speculative. OTUs that fluctuated significantly throughout the captivity period are reported in Fig. 3 and are summarized as follows: OTU03 (Streptococcus) showed a strong, negative correlation with the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic treatment kakapo group compared to any nontreated group (rpb = \u22120.45; P = 0.009) and a weaker, statistically insignificant correlation with captivity overall (rpb = \u22120.16; P = 0.37). Conversely, OTU05 (Enterococcus) was enriched in the antibiotic-treated (rpb = 0.7; P < 0.0001) and captive (rpb = 0.59; P = 0.0003) kakapos compared to the nontreated groups. Samples obtained from kakapos in captivity without antibiotic treatment showed no differences that could not be explained by the observed differences between Juvenile_First and Juvenile_Third or the lack of differences between Juvenile_Third and Adult_First (i.e., some OTUs were enriched in the samples from the youngest juveniles but not in the later samples or adult samples, implying that individual age was driving the decline in abundance).",

Here we document, for the first time, temporal changes in the bacterial communities within the kakapo GI tract but do not find consistent differences between juvenile and adult birds at the community-wide level. Amplicon pyrosequencing confirmed our previous conclusion that the kakapo microbiota is an uneven, low-diversity community. Although differences in experimental factors and sampling depth mean that between-study comparisons must be treated with caution, the diversity and richness estimators calculated in this study are nonetheless low compared to those obtained for other avians. A recent analysis of the emu hindgut reported a mean Shannon diversity index of 3.4 (kakapo = 0.95) and a mean Chao1 richness index of 624 (kakapo = 60.5) (52), while a clone library-based analysis of chicken ceca reported a Chao1 value of 121 (53). A molecular analysis of the hoatzin cecum (54) reported a median inverse Simpson diversity index of >400 (kakapo = 1.78). Kakapo and hoatzin are frequently compared, with the kakapo occasionally being mentioned as a potential candidate for avian foregut fermentation. Despite the marked difference in microbial diversity between the kakapo and hoatzin hindguts, the taxonomic differences between these microbiota are not great. Hierarchical clustering of phylotyped data obtained from hoatzin hindgut analyses (54) revealed no separation between the kakapo juvenile and adult fecal microbiota and the hoatzin cecal microbiota (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). While the microbiota of the adult kakapo crop is unknown, it is interesting to observe a degree of convergence in the hindgut microbiota of these two geographically isolated birds.",

Indeed, while the core microbiota in the current analysis consisted of only Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes, members of additional phyla were also frequently detected in the birds tested. Representatives of the Bacteroidetes were detected in approximately 70% of samples although often at levels lower than our previous methodology was capable of detecting (12). This finding is somewhat at odds with our previous conclusions and emphasizes the value of increased sequencing depth, even in apparently low-diversity environments. Bacteroidetes-associated OTUs occurred in an individual-specific manner, so although Bacteroidetes were observed in many samples, no Bacteroidetes OTUs were classified in the kakapo core microbiota. In other avian systems, the most abundant bacterial phyla detected with molecular methods are the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, followed by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (26), which is notably different from the bacterial community profile of the kakapo. The functional implications of this differing community composition compared to those of other herbivorous birds are a matter for future investigation, and knowledge of the core bacteria that comprise the kakapo microbiota will be of benefit for potential future kakapo bacteriotherapy and probiotic development (25).",

Despite the lack of difference in community structure, some OTUs varied significantly in abundance between younger and older birds, likely reflecting at least some role of bird age in shaping the microbiota. Due to concerns regarding the handling of nesting adults, adults sampled in this study were not the parents of the studied juveniles, and to our knowledge, there was no contact between these juvenile and adult birds. We speculate that this apparently homogenous bacterial community may be due to the small size of Codfish Island, with all adult kakapos utilizing an almost identical diet. It has been observed that kakapos on Codfish Island share overlapping home ranges, with individuals often sharing feeding stations when supplemental feed is provided. Further study into the development of the juvenile microbiota may better resolve this pattern by using a finer time scale to investigate the community structure much sooner after hatching. Although age did not appear to influence community structure, the relative abundance of particular OTUs (including those within the core microbiota) varied with age and time, consistent with the broader avian literature (32, 38, 39). In general, microbial OTUs that were classified as part of the overall core microbiota were present at high levels within the fecal samples, and in each sample grouping, the core and variable OTUs represented over half of the microbiota (Table 4), indicating that these microbes are likely of biological significance in the kakapo. It was interesting that the core microbiota of the juvenile samples accounted for more of the total microbiota and comprised more OTUs than that of the adults. The core microbiota was even more conserved in the antibiotic-treated kakapos, which may be a consequence of a reduction in available niches brought on by a controlled diet and antibiotic pressure.",

With the entire juvenile kakapo population in captivity, there was no adequate control group for comparison other than the adult group, but we nevertheless attempted to identify significant changes in the microbiota that correlated with this period. Studying kakapos that were captive but not treated with antibiotics allowed us to tease apart the influence of diet and antibiotic treatment albeit with a smaller sample size than is ideal. The reported changes in the microbiota were more strongly correlated with antibiotic treatment (OTU03 rpb = \u22120.45; OTU05 rpb = 0.7) than with captivity in general (OTU03 rpb = \u22120.16; OTU05 rpb = 0.59), implying that antibiotic treatment was the primary factor driving the observed differences during captivity. We also observed changes in the microbiota of captive, antibiotic-treated individuals, which adds further evidence that captivity alters the kakapo microbiota. The lack of a juvenile control group makes these findings tentative, but there appears to be no long-term impact of these changes, as the bacterial community structures of treated juveniles and untreated adults converged in later samples, and no differences in relative OTU abundance were detected between adults and juveniles following release from captivity. In future breeding seasons, it would be desirable to attempt to repeat this experiment with finer time scales and more rigid control groups to validate these data (bird health permitting).",

Consistent with this observation, the kakapo fecal microbiota varied over time, with juvenile and adult samples differing after approximately 1 year between samples. It is possible that this change is related to the change in diet, as reproduction in the kakapo correlates with the fruiting of specific trees native to New Zealand. In addition, supplementary feeding is a common practice during breeding seasons, and these changes in kakapo ecology provide a mechanism that may account for the apparent changes in gut microbiota over time. When the early and later samples were compared, a Proteobacteria-associated OTU (OTU02) (Fig. 3) was observed only sporadically in the early samples but was one of the most abundant OTUs at the final time point (Fig. 1). This OTU could not be classified below the phylum level, with results generally alternating between the classes Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Additional chimera testing was performed by using both UCHIME and the chimera.slayer command in mothur against the SILVA gold database (http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Silva_reference_files), but this OTU was not determined to be chimeric in either test. The presence and identity of this OTU will be important for future analyses of the kakapo microbiota, as its identity may be better resolved with more sequence data or a different amplicon region. Changes in the microbiota over time carry significance for the wider field of disease ecology, as they emphasize the need for up-to-date knowledge of animal-associated microbiota in order to better enable pathogen detection (56).",

In order to account for potential biases introduced by the level of OTU similarity, sequence data were binned into two different OTU definitions (OTU0.95 and OTU0.97), and statistical testing was performed between each sample group using each OTU cutoff. The overall robustness of a finding was based on not only statistical significance but also whether a finding was consistent across different OTU definitions and distance calculations. Statistically significant findings were preserved across OTU definitions, giving confidence that the conclusions regarding community structure were not merely artifacts of the bioinformatic approach.",

The finding that age is not a significant factor in shaping the community structure of the kakapo microbiota contrasts with patterns seen in other avian hosts, although age-related differences in OTU abundance indicate that age still plays a role in shaping at least a subset of the kakapo microbiota although possibly on a shorter time scale than normally observed. By comparing our juvenile data to data obtained from adult kakapos, we have teased apart age- and time-based differences and established a working core set of bacteria for further studies of kakapo microbiology. Finally, in confirming that the microbiota changes over time, we have reaffirmed the need for continuous sampling of the microbiota of this endangered bird in order to ensure that knowledge of the healthy microbiota is accurate. The described data, in combination with ongoing ecological and genetic studies, should contribute to the management and, ultimately, the survival of this ancient parrot.",
