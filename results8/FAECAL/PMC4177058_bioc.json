Figure\u00a01B illustrates the viromes of the 102 individuals defined by sampling up to five major body habitats, showing that a broad range of viruses was detected in healthy people. The 102 individuals carried seven distinct families of human DNA viruses (Figure\u00a02A). The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses included members of the virus families Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, and Adenoviridae. In addition to the dsDNA viruses, several genera of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses were detected, including members of the families Anelloviridae, Parvoviridae, and Circoviridae. These ssDNA viruses generate dsDNA intermediates during replication, which allowed them to be detected with the DNA preparation protocol employed that would not otherwise detect ssDNA viruses. The Herpesviridae genera included roseoloviruses (predominantly human herpesvirus (HHV)-7), herpes simplexvirus (HSV-1), lymphocryptovirus (Epstein Barr Virus), and human cytomegalovirus (HHV-5). The papillomaviruses detected were predominantly the most common human papillomaviruses (HPVs): alpha-, beta-, and gamma-papillomaviruses. These included high-risk papillomavirus types, such as HPV-16, HPV-18, and HPV-45. We also detected sequences, predominantly in the nose and skin, with more remote similarity to 17 papillomavirus genera that contain non-human viruses (Figure\u00a02B). This suggests that numerous undescribed HPVs may exist, which is not surprising given that more than 150 HPV genera have been identified [5,6], and new HPVs continue to be discovered [7,8]. Polyomaviruses and adenoviruses were also relatively common. We detected polyomaviruses MWPyV [9], Merkel Cell [10,11], human polyomavirus (HPyV)-6, HPyV7 [12], and JC [13]. The anelloviruses were found in all of the body sites except stool. These viruses establish persistent infections in the blood in the majority of the population early in life [14].

Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between the virome of individuals and the composition of their vaginal bacterial microbiome. Alpha-papillomaviruses were detected in 37.5% of subjects who had vaginal samples sequenced. Consistent with previous studies, we detected several types of vaginal bacterial communities [15,16]. Viruses were found in all of these microbial communities, but alpha-papillomaviruses were more common in samples from individuals with more bacterial diversity than those whose vaginal microbiomes were made up almost entirely of Lactobacillus (Figure\u00a05). Looking only at the posterior fornix samples from the first visit of each individual (34 samples), subjects with communities containing less than 85% lactobacillus were more likely to have alpha-papillomaviruses in their samples compared with other subjects (P\u2009=\u20090.0010, Fisher\u2019s exact test). Subjects carried as many as four distinct alpha-papillomaviruses, including HPV-16, HPV-18, and others that are considered high-risk for tumorigenesis. For example, the vaginal sample from one subject contained HPV-45 (high risk), HPV-53 (probably high risk), and HPV-43 (low risk) [17]. We did not observe other statistically significant correlations of virus sequences with bacteria in other anatomic sites. Nor did we observe statistically significant correlations in other anatomic sites of virus sequences with patient data, such as body mass index, age, gender, or enrollment city (St. Louis, MO or Houston, TX).",

This description of the eukaryotic DNA virome is relatively unbiased in that it did not rely on virus culture or virus-specific assays to define the normal viral flora. Previous studies of the human virome have focused primarily on bacteriophages [18-21], which are closely tied to their bacterial hosts and have only recently been shown to have more direct effects on the human habitats they occupy [22]. We demonstrate that healthy humans harbor a surprising variety of DNA viruses that directly infect eukaryotic cells. Some of these viruses appear to be stable components of an individual\u2019s virome. Other components of the virome were detected at a single time point, suggesting these viruses were present transiently or that levels of some viruses in some samples may have fallen beneath the sensitivity of our assay. Future studies aimed at associating DNA viruses with disease in these body habitats will be able to use the data from these healthy individuals to aid interpretation of their results.",

While symptomatic viral infections are currently most well known to medical science, future research is needed to explore the effects of long-term and asymptomatic infections on human health and disease. The virome may confer benefits on the host, the way the bacterial contingent of the microbiome does. For instance, murine herpesvirus infections have been shown to provide protection from infection with other pathogens in mice by up-regulating components of the immune system [23]. Members of the virome may play similar roles in maintaining human health, in a mutualistic relationship with the human host. Evolutionary considerations suggest that the universal presence of a specific microbe may reflect a beneficial interaction with the host. By contrast, some persistent DNA viral infections are clearly linked with disease, as exemplified by the increased risk for cervical cancer in women infected with high-risk HPV strains. Perhaps this is analogous to the persistence of bacterial pathogens in the microbiome that present a potential for disease that is not always realized [24]. The idea that persistent viral infections can protect or predispose the host to other infections is a hypothesis we are pursuing.",

In addition, we show that although an individual\u2019s virome can change over time, viral presence can be remarkably stable in an individual. Inasmuch as humans are constantly exposed to viruses in the environment, the source of members of the variable virome is not difficult to envision. However, the mechanisms that favor viral-host coexistence likely consist of known protective host defenses and unappreciated processes. Viruses encode proteins to regulate the cell cycle [25], regulate host gene expression, and suppress or subvert host immune responses [26-30]. Viruses also encode micro RNAs that regulate cellular processes [31]. Thus, latent and persistently infecting viruses are continually interacting with the host in many ways. Many virologists are characterizing the complex effects of interactions that occur between virus and host during infection [25-30]. We know that viruses commonly target specific cellular pathways to regulate the cell and promote viral replication, but each virus can have its own mechanism for achieving the same control over a cellular pathway [31,32].

To begin to probe this, we studied relationships between eukaryotic viruses and the composition of vaginal bacterial communities. Previous studies defined subtypes of vaginal bacterial microbiomes [15]. Here, using unbiased metagenomic sequencing we observed that alpha-papillomaviruses, which include the known oncogenic papillomavirus types, were more common in women with a bacterial community characterized by a decrease in Lactobacillus and an increase in anaerobic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis, such as Gardnerella [16]. This is consistent with other studies that show that persistent papillomavirus infection is associated with an increase in anaerobic bacteria [33,34]. Whether either member of this viral-bacterial correlate is causative, or whether each is simply present as a result of simultaneous exposure remains to be determined. The extension of this kind of analysis to disease etiologies and complex traits that are poorly understood may reveal new associations with viral infection and microbial community dynamics.",

The presence of certain viruses does not mean that there will invariably be clinical consequences. For example, we observed human adenovirus C in 17% of the nasal samples, yet these individuals did not have fever or acute illness. Likewise, in another study we found that 21% of afebrile children with minimal or no respiratory symptoms had rhinovirus present in nasopharyngeal secretions based on sequencing assays [35]. Taken together these data indicate that care is required in attributing disease manifestations to a virus that is found to be present, especially using sensitive molecular methods. We also detected adenovirus C in skin (retroauricular crease) samples from some healthy adults, which was unexpected because adenoviruses are typically associated with the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Further work would need to be done to follow up this observation in a prospective study to determine whether the adenovirus sequences in skin samples represent infection or spread of virus-containing material from the respiratory tract. These early descriptions of the human virome suggest the need for additional studies to determine factors that distinguish asymptomatic infections from those that may explain a patient\u2019s symptoms and require interventions including treatment with antiviral drugs.",

                    "text": "The data presented here show that an extensive, unbiased analysis - such as that achieved with high-throughput deep metagenomic shotgun sequencing of a large number of human-derived samples from different body habitats - is a sound approach to identifying the scope of viruses that comprise the human virome, including novel viruses. There are a number of ways this analysis can be extended in the future. Including RNA viruses in the sequencing and analysis and expanding the body sites sampled would lead to a more comprehensive view of the diversity in the human virome. Also, the methods used for DNA preparation and sequencing were limited to detecting ssDNA viruses with dsDNA intermediates, so future studies should include methods to assess ssDNA viral genomes. Deeper sequencing would allow the more robust detection of relatively rare viral sequences, improving the sensitivity of the sequencing assay. Deeper sequencing or the addition of quantitative follow-up assays would also allow us to assess viral dynamics by determining if the same virus strain is present in multiple body sites from the same subject or at multiple time points. Increasing the number of subjects would be beneficial because, while this is a large data set, eukaryotic virus communities are very simple and varied. Thus, some of the results from this set are anecdotal and bring attention to questions that can be better examined in future targeted studies. Sampling the same subjects at many time points would lead to an even more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the human virome, which is of particular interest for chronic infections. This study does not distinguish active and latent infections, and future studies could concentrate on active infections by assessing cell-free virus particles. This analysis relies on identifying sequence similarity to known viruses, and sequences from unknown novel viruses with no sequence similarity to known viruses may be present but not analyzed. New computational methods will thus be required to address this shortcoming. High-throughput sequencing technologies have the potential to play important roles in diagnostic virology, and expanding our knowledge of the human virome is a necessary first step to interpreting results from diagnostic tests and applying that information for effective diagnosis and treatment.",

Our analysis was limited to DNA viruses because RNA was not isolated from the samples in the HMP study. Furthermore, sequencing library construction protocols are designed for dsDNA; therefore, our analysis focused on dsDNA viruses and dsDNA replicative intermediates of ssDNA viruses. The sampled sites included in the WGS data set were nose (anterior nares), skin (retroauricular crease), mouth (buccal mucosa, tongue dorsum, subgingival plaque, supragingival plaque, and throat), vagina (primarily posterior fornix, but a few samples from vaginal introitus and mid-vagina were also included), and gut (stool). In some cases, multiple (usually two) visits from the same individual were included. Samples were collected according to standardized protocols [36]. Clinicians collected samples from each anatomic site using Catch-All\u2122 Sample Collection Swabs, with the exception of the stool sample, which was self-collected. DNA was extracted from each sample using the MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, California, United States). The Illumina GAIIX platform was used to generate 100\u00a0bp paired-end reads, with the target of generating 10 Gb sequence per sample.

Importantly, entry criteria established that the subjects were not symptomatic for acute infections, had not been diagnosed with HPV infection within the last two years, and had not had any active genital herpes infection within the last two months (females) [37]. Subjects were sampled up to three times at the same body sites, with visits separated by 30 to 359\u00a0days.

We optimized the analysis pipeline for viral sequence detection by increasing the sensitivity of the alignments. This was done by allowing mismatches between the query and reference and by including both nucleotide and translated sequence alignments so sequences that were divergent from reference genomes would be detected. This analysis is an improved version of the pipeline we described previously [35]. A brief description of the pipeline follows. First, sequence reads were aligned against a virus reference database using a tool for nucleotide sequence alignment. In this version of the pipeline, a Real Time Genomics map (Real Time Genomics, Hamilton, New Zealand) was used to align sequences to the reference sequence database. The following parameters allowed us to identify sequences with nucleotide sequence similarity to viral reference sequences: \u2212-repeat-freq 97% -e 10% \u2013w 15 \u2013n 255 \u2013penalize-unknowns. The sequences in the reference sequence database included all of the sequences classified as viral in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Nucleotide database [38], which were found by using the search term \u2018virus\u2019. This included viral genomes and partial viral sequences. Next, sequences that were not aligned were subjected to translated sequence alignments to the same viral references, which were translated in six frames. This version of the pipeline used MBLASTX software (MulticoreWare Sunnyvale, California, United States) [39] with the following parameters: \u2212m 30 \u2013e 1e-02. After this initial screen to identify sequences with similarity to viral genomes, the subset of sequences identified was aligned to the larger nucleotide and translated amino acid sequence databases [40], which include entries from a more comprehensive set of organisms. Again, this version of the pipeline used Real Time Genomics mapping and MBLASTX with the parameters described above. Finally, sequences that unambiguously aligned to viral references in the larger databases were considered viral and included in the downstream analysis, and sequences that could not be clearly classified, such as repetitive sequences, were disregarded. This is a conservative method for identifying viral sequences within the samples. The number of sequences aligned to mammalian DNA virus genera are shown in Additional file 1: Table S2. Endogenous retroviruses integrated into the human genome were excluded from analysis because many endogenous retrovirus sequences were removed during the human screening step carried out by the HMP Consortium, and, therefore, the endogenous retrovirus sequence counts obtained from our pipeline are incomplete. Virus sequences were classified at the genus level, and species level classifications were determined after manual review.",
