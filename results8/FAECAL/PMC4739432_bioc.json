In the US population from 1988\u20131994 to 2005\u20132006, self-reported prevalence of physician-diagnosed seasonal pollen allergy (hay fever), for example, increased from 8.8% to 11.3% (Salo et al., 2011, Sheikh et al., 2003). Asthma prevalence in the US population in 2005\u20132006 was estimated to be 14.1% (Liu et al., 2010). Modern hygiene has been postulated to contribute to the increasing prevalence of allergies, based on both functional and observational studies. Children who have fewer early life exposures, such as in small families, are more likely to develop seasonal pollen allergy or eczema (Strachan, 2000). Children in households with at least 2 dogs or cats are 70% less likely to develop serologic or skin prick test reactivity to common respiratory antigens (Ownby et al., 2002). In Europe and other modern societies, risk for allergy and asthma are lower for children on farms (Ege et al., 2011). And asthma prevalence increases with migration from a less to a more highly industrialized country (Gibson et al., 2003, Tobias et al., 2001).",

In the nasopharynx, predominance by Moraxella, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus during the first few months of life predicted development of childhood asthma (Teo et al., 2015). Among adolescents in Finland, sensitization to respiratory allergens was associated with low diversity of Gammaproteobacteria on the skin (Hanski et al., 2012). Gut microbial differences may also contribute to allergy risk in humans (Penders et al., 2014). In two studies, infants who had a higher fecal abundance of Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli, respectively, had an increased risk of developing an allergy in the future (Kalliomaki et al., 2001, Penders et al., 2006). In a very small Swedish study, low fecal microbial diversity at age 1\u00a0month predicted atopic eczema by age 2\u00a0years (Abrahamsson et al., 2012), as well as asthma, but not rhinoconjunctivitis, eczema, or atopy, by age 7\u00a0years (Abrahamsson et al., 2014). In Denmark, fewer fecal bacterial taxa by molecular fingerprinting predicted allergic rhinitis but not asthma or atopic dermatitis by age 6 (Bisgaard et al., 2011).Comprehensive analysis based on next-generation sequencing has not yet clarified whether alteration of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) is associated with allergy in infants or adults. To address this, in adults, we analyzed publicly available data from the American Gut Project, similar to a previous analysis of the microbiota with history of cesarean birth and appendectomy (Goedert et al., 2014).",

Each participant who provided a positive response on the AGP self-administered questionnaire was classified as having an allergy or pet. For foods, the verbatim question, which did not require validation by a physician, was: \u201cI am allergic to ___ (mark all that apply): Peanuts, Tree nuts, Shellfish, Other, I have no food allergies that I know of.\u201d For non-foods, there were three verbatim questions: \u201cDo you have any of the following non-food allergies? Mark all that apply: Drug (e.g. Penicillin), Pet dander, Beestings, Poison ivy/oak\u201d; \u201cDo you have seasonal allergies? Yes/No\u201d; and Have you been diagnosed with any of the following conditions (check all which apply)? \u2026 (e) Asthma, Cystic Fibrosis or Lung Disease.\u2026 (v) Skin Condition\u2026.\u201d Thus, the allergies included four foods (peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, other food) and six non-foods [drug, bee sting, dander, asthma, seasonal, and eczema (specified in skin conditions)].

(2011), to identify individual taxa associated with multiple allergy traits. The test improved statistical power by aggregating weak associations across traits. The significance was evaluated by 100,000 random permutations, which automatically accounted for the correlations among allergy traits. Details are in the Supplemental Online Content.

Approximately 3% of participants reported allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, or shellfish; and 9.1% reported allergy to other foods.

Asthma, dander and drug allergy prevalence in the AGP were lower than the prevalence of these reported in the literature (Table 1), but otherwise prevalence was similar for most of the other allergies. It must be noted that the prevalence of an allergy is lower and its specificity is higher with diagnosis by a doctor, compared to when an allergy is merely self-reported (Hoppin et al., 2011). More allergies were reported by women than men, especially drug allergy (P\u00a0=\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a07).

About 3% reported peanut or tree nut allergy, and nearly 41% reported seasonal allergy. Women reported more drug allergy, and obese participants reported more seasonal allergy. Pet ownership was irrelevant for our adults, which is consistent with previous null or ambiguous associations that may reflect exposure to dogs or particularly to cats outside the home or in early childhood (Dharmage et al., 2012, Simpson and Custovic, 2005). Correlations between the allergies were null or weak, except between dander and seasonal (R\u00a0=\u00a00.34) and between peanut and tree nut (R\u00a0=\u00a00.44). Independent of these within-subject correlations, we found statistically significant fecal dysbiosis across multiple allergies. Specifically, reduced richness and altered composition was found with all allergies except asthma, bee sting, and eczema.

In a longitudinal, fecal microbiome study of Swedish infants, cesarean delivery was associated with significantly delayed Bacteroides colonization and lower blood levels of Th1 cytokines (CXCL10 and CXCL11) but no difference in Th2 cytokines (Jakobsson et al., 2014). Cesarean delivered infants also had low diversity of Bacteroidetes taxa. By age 24\u00a0months, Bacteroides and Clostridia taxa predominated irrespective of delivery route (Jakobsson et al., 2014). The Swedish study is consistent with reports that cesarean-delivered children have a higher risk for developing asthma (1.2-fold), atopic sensitization (1.7-fold), and allergic rhinitis (2-fold) (Kolokotroni et al., 2012, Pistiner et al., 2008, Thavagnanam et al., 2008). In a Danish study based on 16S rRNA fingerprinting, lower fecal bacterial diversity at age 1\u00a0month was not associated with cesarean delivery, but it was associated with increased likelihood of allergic rhinitis (1.3-fold) by age 6\u00a0years (Bisgaard et al., 2011). Consistent with the Danish study, allergy was not associated with cesarean birth in the current study. Moreover, although we found that both cesarean birth and allergies were associated with low richness, they were associated with different taxa (Goedert et al., 2014). These findings suggest that the dysbiosis of allergy in adults develops postnatally.",

The AGP questionnaire asked \u201cHave you been diagnosed with \u2026 Asthma, Cystic Fibrosis or Lung Disease\u201d, implying validation by a health care professional. However, grouping with cystic fibrosis and lung disease would clearly reduce specificity for asthma. Moreover, these respiratory conditions were not explicitly linked to allergy. Non-specificity would be expected to inflate asthma prevalence, which was not seen, as prevalence was lower in the AGP (8.4%) than reported for the US population (14.1%) (Liu et al., 2010). Specificity may also have been poor for eczema, as this was one of several \u201cskin conditions\u201d in the AGP questionnaire. In addition, even true atopic eczema, with 3% estimated prevalence in developed countries (Eyerich and Novak, 2013), is not a simple Th2-mediated disease but also involves genetic and non-genetic dermal barriers (Eyerich and Novak, 2013). Systemic reaction to bee or wasp sting, which also has a prevalence of approximately 3% (Golden, 2013), was unrelated to atopy in three previous studies (Birnbaum et al., 1994, Fernandez et al., 1999, Golden et al., 1989). We found that bee sting allergy was significantly associated with higher abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and g__Paraprevotella but not with global microbiota metrics.",

Some of the allergies were probably misclassified, because the questionnaire data were self-reported with no validation by a physician or an objective test. This would bias toward the null, by introducing noise into a true association between a condition and an exposure. Our cross-sectional design cannot distinguish whether the observed dysbiosis preceded or followed the development of allergies. The specimens represented only one time point, but this also would bias toward the null, reducing the chance to detect associations with time-varying fecal microbiome metrics. We did not investigate possible associations with seasonality, but rather adjusted for it. With this approach, we would not have identified transient changes as reported for pollen season in Japan (Odamaki et al., 2007). Avoidance of particular foods could alter the microbiota, but intake of these foods (peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish) is probably too low to affect the microbiota of the general population. Antihistamines or other medications may have altered the allergic participants' microbiota, although this has not been reported. We adjusted for reported use of probiotics and vitamins, based on the possibility that their use may have altered the microbiota. We excluded participants who used an antibiotic within one month, and adjusted analyses for earlier antibiotic use.",
