Free human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) function as prebiotics by stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria while preventing the binding of harmful bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells. Bacteria have adapted to the glycan-rich environment of the gut by developing enzymes that catabolize glycans. The decrease in HMOs and the increase in glycan digestion products give indications of the active enzymes in the microbial population. In this study, we quantitated the disappearance of intact HMOs and characterized the glycan digestion products in the gut that are produced by the action of microbial enzymes on HMOs and glycoconjugates from breast milk. Oligosaccharides from fecal samples of exclusively breast-fed infants were extracted and profiled using nanoLC-MS. Intact HMOs were found in the fecal samples, additionally, other oligosaccharides were found corresponding to degraded HMOs and non-HMO based compounds. The latter compounds were fragments of N-glycans released through the cleavage of the linkage to the asparagine residue and through cleavage of the chitobiose core of the N-glycan. Marker gene sequencing of the fecal samples revealed bifidobacteria as the dominant inhabitants of the infant gastrointestinal tracts. A glycosidase from Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum was then expressed to digest HMOs in vitro, which showed that the digested oligosaccharides in feces corresponded to the action of glycosidases on HMOs. Similar expression of endoglycosidases also showed that N-glycans were released by bacterial enzymes. Although bifidobacteria may dominate the gut, it is possible that specific minority species are also responsible for the major products observed in feces. Nonetheless, the enzymatic activity correlated well with the known glycosidases in the respective bacteria, suggesting a direct relationship between microbial abundances and catabolic activity.",

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)\n1 and glycoproteins are vital components of breast milk and protect the infant from bacterial infection (5). HMOs play a role in deflecting pathogen binding to gut epithelial cells via molecular mimicry (6). With over 200 identified structures, HMOs are a diverse group of oligosaccharides (7\u201310). There are five common monosaccharides that make up HMOs: glucose (Glc), galactose (Gal), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), fucose (Fuc), and sialic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). Most HMOs contain a lactose core (Gal(\u03b21\u20134)Glc) and are extended by glycosyltransferases that add GlcNAc residues in \u03b2(1\u20133/6) linkages and Gal in \u03b2(1\u20133/4) linkages (5). These chains can then be decorated by Fuc in various linkages, depending on the specific enzymes of the mother. Fuc added in \u03b1(1\u20133/4) linkages are controlled by the Lewis gene to both Glc and GlcNAc residues, and the secretor gene (FUT2) codes for the \u03b1(1\u20132) fucosyltransferase, which adds Fuc in an \u03b1(1\u20132) linkage on a terminal Gal residue (11). Neu5Ac can also be added via \u03b1(2\u20133/6) linkages to GlcNAc or terminal Gal residues (1, 12, 13).",

HMOs are not catabolized directly by the infant, but instead pass undigested through the upper digestive tract to the large intestine where they function as prebiotics for the distal gut microbiota (4, 14\u201316). HMOs help promote a healthy infant gastrointestinal tract in a number of ways: as anti-adhesives preventing viruses from binding to epithelial cell surface glycans, as antimicrobials acting as decoy receptors to pathogenic bacteria, and as energy sources for beneficial bacteria which in turn produce short-chain fatty acids for the infant (4, 6, 17, 18). Commensal bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides are equipped with a suite of enzymes capable of breaking down HMOs (19\u201321). For this reason, bifidobacteria can make up to 90% of the microbial community in the gut of breast-fed infants (5, 22). Select bifidobacterial species grow well on HMOs in vitro (21, 23). Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis has been shown to be particularly good at utilizing HMOs, displaying preferential consumption of smaller and fucosylated HMOs (21, 23, 24). Different microbial species and strains in the infant gastrointestinal tract have their own mechanisms for HMO catabolism leading to potentially diverse digested products in the feces. These digestion products are generally unknown, but characterizing these glycan species may reveal information regarding the repertoire of specific bacterial enzymes at work and indicate the active members in the communities inhabiting the infant gastrointestinal tract.",

Along with the degraded HMO, intact HMOs have also been discovered in the feces of breast-fed infants (15, 16, 25, 26). Computational, genomic, and in vitro methods have been combined to study bacterial consumption of HMOs and other carbohydrates. Eilam et al. created a computational program using genomic data of microbial enzymes in order to predict degraded glycan products (27). Asakuma et al. grew several bifidobacteria strains on select HMO-enriched media and discovered various mechanisms for producing digestion products from the in vitro bacterial growth (28). Further studies found important distinctions for the feeding habits among specific bacterial species. B. longum subsp. infantis catabolizes the entire HMO internally, whereas B. bifidum secretes extracellular glycosidases for cleaving HMOs, leading to digested HMO products in the intestinal lumen (29, 30). These studies show that degraded glycans are created through the activity of key glycosyl hydrolases and can link relevant glycosidases with specific bacteria, thus providing insight into possible gut microbiota degradation pathways witnessed in feces.",

Neutral losses of 223.10 or a peak at m/z 224.11 would have been indicative of a reduced HexNAc and evidence of the N-glycan core, however these were not observed.

For this reason, glycosidases from bifidobacterial strains were expressed to determine whether the enzymes can act on HMOs and produce the structures present in the infant feces. For this work, we selected an exogalactosidase and endoglycosidase from bifidobacteria to determine whether these acted on milk glycoconjugates. An example is illustrated in Fig. 4 with a \u03b2-galactosidase from B. longum subsp. longum SC596, BLNG_00015. For these experiments, pooled HMOs were treated with the enzyme (a galactosidase, pH 6.0 at 55 \u00b0C for 1 h). The abundances of HMOs in the digested pool were compared with those in an undigested HMO pool. The chromatograms in Fig. 4A show digestion of select structures with m/z 611.24 (4Hex:2HexNAc:1Fuc). Two isomers - monofucosyllacto-N-hexaose I (MFLNH I, retention time 14.5 min, inset structure 4) and isomer 3 fucosyl-paralacto-N-hexaose (IFLNH III, retention time 15.2 min, inset structure 5) - were noticeably lower in abundances in the digested HMO pool compared with the undigested HMO pool (Fig. 4A). Isomer 1 fucosyl-paralacto-N-hexaose (IFLNH I, retention time 18.3 min, inset structure 6), however, has no terminal Gal residue and therefore the exogalactosidase was unable to digest this structure as shown by the overlapping chromatograms (Fig. 4A). The exogalactosidase was also able to degrade select undecorated intact HMOs with m/z 1075.41 (4Hex:2HexNAc) (Fig. 4B). Lacto-N-hexaose (LNH, retention time 15.6 min, inset structure 7) and lacto-N-neohexaose (LNnH, retention time 16.2 min, inset structure 8) decreased in abundance, but para-lacto-N-hexaose (p-LNH, retention time 19.5 min, inset structure 9) went undigested (Fig. 4B).",

Instead of degrading HMOs, this enzyme (EndoBI-1) was active on N-glycans, demonstrating preferential cleavage between the two GlcNAcs of the chitobiose core (44). These types of degraded N-glycans were observed in feces. For example, the m/z 1034.37 peak detected in feces corresponds to an oligosaccharide with composition 5Hex:1HexNAc (fragmentation shown in Fig. 5). This composition is not consistent with an intact or digested HMO for several reasons. Large HMO structures have repeating lactosamine units, and this compound only has one HexNAc. The tandem MS yields a peak at m/z 224.11, consistent with a reduced HexNAc, which is a rare occurrence in HMOs (Fig. 5). All the neutral mass losses that led up to that peak were 162, indicative of Hex losses, most likely mannose residues (Fig. 5). Because of the reduced GlcNAc and the five successive Hex, we deduced that this oligosaccharide is indeed a high mannose type N-glycan cleaved by an endoglycosidase. Both intact and digested N-glycans, their masses, and corresponding compositions were also added to the Fecal Glycan Library (supplemental Table S2).",

Fecal samples for three of the infants from the Davis Lactation Study were analyzed at several postnatal time points. For all three infants, there was a drastic decrease in the abundance of intact HMO from the first week of life (days 6 and 7) to week 17 (day 120) (Fig. 6). The absolute abundance dropped 75.3% on average, also observed was an opposite trend for digested HMO over lactation, which increased 124.0% at week 17 (Fig. 6). The bacterial profiling revealed that bifidobacteria, known to consume HMOs comprised on average 68.0% of all bacteria in the infant gut at week 17 (Supplemental Fig. 3) (20, 21). For two of the infants, (1004 and 1054) the abundance of digested N-glycans also increased from week 1 to week 17 (Fig. 6). B. longum subsp. longum comprised 9.8% of all bacteria in the infant 1054 fecal microbiota at week 17 (supplemental Table S3). Schell et al. showed that B. longum contains a genomic cluster with an endoglycosidase for cleaving GlcNAcs which explains our observance of digested N-glycans (45). B. longum subsp. infantis, known to catabolize the entire HMO internally, was found to comprise 6.7% and 4.2% of all bacteria in infant 1040 at weeks 3 and 17, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3) (29, 30). This correlated with lower amounts of digested HMOs at those time points (Fig. 6). This trend is consistent with the gut microbiota becoming established, niches being filled, and more of the oligosaccharides being degraded later in lactation.",

                    "text": "Human breast milk contains both free and bound oligosaccharides. As the infant consumes breast milk, the contents pass through the digestive tract through the intestine, where they encounter the gut microbiota. The bacteria are equipped with glycosidases that cleave HMOs and other glycoconjugates, potentially leaving digestion products and free oligosaccharides to pass through the gut and exit as feces. Glycoconjugates such as N-glycans may be degraded while still linked to proteins, but they can also be enzymatically released from glycoproteins to form new free oligosaccharides. After their release, free N-glycans can be further degraded by exoglycosidases to form additional digestion products. Our oligosaccharide enrichment method may also extract O-glycans. In vitro studies have shown bacterial growth on, binding to, and degradation of mucus O-glycans, yet no glycosidases have been characterized that can release large O-glycans (larger than disaccharides) from glycoproteins (46\u201349). Furthermore, O-glycans are in much lower abundances in milk compared with HMOs and N-glycans and are therefore not expected to be present in appreciable abundances (50, 51). Free oligosaccharides may also be released from glycolipids (52), yet much like O-glycans, glycolipids are far less abundant compared with HMOs and N-glycosylated proteins and are not likely to be observed. In order to identify structures that are digestion products of HMOs, enzymatic in vitro experiments were performed. One involved the use of an exogalactosidase (BLNG_00015) from B. longum subsp. longum SC596, as this species was found in high abundance in the infant fecal samples. Digestion of intact HMOs showed that the enzyme was capable of degrading structures with a terminal galactose residue, but more interesting were the structures not degraded. The lack of digestion for p-LNH is explained by the preference for \u03b2(1\u20134)Gal linkages of this specific enzyme. Both LNH and LNnH have at least one terminal \u03b2(1\u20134)Gal so those isomers were digested, but because p-LNH only has a terminal \u03b2(1\u20133)Gal linkage, the hydrolase was unable to cleave the linkage leaving the structure intact. This specificity was also observed in the fucosylated structures MFLNH I and IFLNH III, which both contain a terminal \u03b2(1\u20134)Gal residue so the exogalactosidase was capable of degrading those structures. Having a Fuc present on the same GlcNAc as a \u03b2(1\u20134)Gal appeared to hinder the enzyme from hydrolyzing that linkage. This type of analysis reveals the specificity of microbial enzymes. Observance of certain isomers, along with the absence of others, can indicate the preferences of those enzymes present. These experiments also confirmed that degraded oligosaccharides obtained in infant feces can be produced under in vitro conditions with the appropriate enzymes.",

                    "text": "It was not surprising to find intact N-glycans in the infant feces at all sampled time points, as these molecules have been described in breast milk. The observation of degraded N-glycans in vivo in infant feces is, however, a novel finding. Degradation of N-glycans has been predicted before by enzymatic studies of individual microbes. For example, Bacteroides is known to inhabit breast-fed infant digestive tracts, was found in the feces of the infants in this study, and is known to have an enzyme capable of cleaving intact N-glycans from glycoproteins (19, 31, 53). Another enzyme, Peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), is known to cleave N-glycans at the glycosylamine linkage, but this enzyme was discovered in the pathogenic bacterium Flavobacterium meningosepticum (54, 55). Experiments were not performed in this study using this specific enzyme because of its widely established activity on glycoproteins. Although F. meningosepticum was not specifically detected in the feces of the infants, it is a potential glycoprotein degrader and contributor to intact N-glycans in feces. Other N-glycans observed were hydrolyzed at the chitobiose core. We previously discovered an endoglycosidase, EndoBI-1, in B. longum subsp. infantis that was able to release all types of N-glycans from lactoferrin and immunoglobulins A and G by cleaving the oligosaccharide between the two core GlcNAcs, which is consistent with the product found in feces and may explain other similar digested N-glycan products (44). B. longum was found in all infants (B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. longum), and one strain of B. longum was also found to contain genes for an endoglycosidase (45). Endoglycosidases have also been found in other bifidobacteria species, along with Streptomyces plicatus, and pathogenic Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (44, 56\u201359). These studies employed genetic analysis and in vitro experiments to determine the enzyme's activity, but did not test their in vivo implications.",

                    "text": "Fecal glycan profile changes were observed for infants postnatally. There was an initial increase in total oligosaccharide abundance for infants 1004 and 1054, but not for infant 1040. This initial increase with a later decrease has been observed previously (60), and has been attributed to the initial lack of saccharolytic bacteria. The HMOs accumulate until the establishment of HMO-consuming microbiota in the infant's gut. This process of maturation occurs at different rates for infants, however, the general trend is that the HMOs decrease. There is a drastic decrease in intact HMOs from week 1 to week 17 postpartum for all three infants, as well as an increase in digested HMOs. It has been shown that the abundance of HMOs in breast milk decrease over the course of lactation, which could explain the diminished abundance of observed intact HMOs in infant feces (61). However, infants consume more volume and feed more frequently as they age before solid foods are introduced. Although the mother may be producing milk with a lower concentration of oligosaccharides, the infant could still be consuming the same amount of HMOs because of the increased milk intake. We also observed an increase in bifidobacterial abundance in the infants' gastrointestinal tracts, and bifidobacteria are known to consume HMOs (20, 21). This suggests that the decrease in intact HMOs and increase in digested HMOs is because of bacterial metabolism. An interesting correlation was observed, however, in infant 1040, whose feces contained decreased amounts of digested HMOs during weeks 3 and 17, but also a presence of B. longum subsp. infantis at those same time points. B. longum subsp. infantis is unique among saccharolytic bacteria in that it imports the entire HMO structure for complete internal catabolism. This process could explain the low amounts of HMO digestion products in feces during later weeks (29, 30). Even though the microbiota community becomes dominated by bifidobacteria over the postnatal period leading to fewer intact HMOs and more digested HMOs in infant feces, it appears that specific strains can have an impact as to the types of fecal oligosaccharides observed. Analysis of fecal oligosaccharides has the potential of becoming a noninvasive method of assaying biomarkers likely relevant to the health of an infant (62).",

We observed HMO and bacterial interaction by directly comparing a mother's HMO composition to the oligosaccharide profile of her infant's feces. Many of the HMOs passed through intact in the feces, but in significantly depleted amounts. The two most abundant structures in breast milk, LNT and LNnT, were completely lacking from the feces, showing preferential consumption of those structures. Some HMOs were found in larger abundance in feces compared with milk, would could be attributed to large HMOs being digested to form smaller HMOs, adding to their abundance. These types of observations can allude to the interactions between microbiota and oligosaccharides. Large-scale functional characterization of the different types of bacteria in the infant's gastrointestinal tract is typically performed via metagenomic, proteomic, or metabolomic experiments. Here, we propose that fecal glycans are suggestive of the bacterial enzymes present in an infant's gut. This information allows greater understanding of how bacteria interact with HMOs and other glycoconjugates in the gut. Interestingly, a small number of select enzymes can account for the vast majority of the products, although the glycosidases may come from different strains and still represent different catabolic activities. Although additional work is still needed to describe all the relevant microbial enzymes and their specificities, we have shown that a glycan-centered analysis can provide information about the active glycosidases operating on human milk.",
