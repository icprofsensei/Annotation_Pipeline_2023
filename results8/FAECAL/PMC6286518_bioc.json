Patients admitted in an intensive care unit (ICU) are at higher risk of developing bacteraemia and septicaemia [1] due to invasive procedures such as peripheral cannulation, central venous catheter placement, tracheal incubation and ventilation [2]. In addition, longer duration of stay in the hospital increases the risk of acquiring HAIs [3, 4]. The endogenous flora of the patient\u2019s mucous membranes or hollow viscera can be the source of pathogens causing infection. Incisions made near the perineum or groin, may result in contamination with faecal flora like Escherichia coli (E.coli). Being a harmless commensal as well as a pathogen, E.coli exhibits great genetic diversity. It causes a wide array of disease and is responsible for around 17\u201337% of both community and hospital acquired clinically significant blood stream infections (BSIs) [5] and a major cause of mortality from these infections [5\u20138].",

Pathogenic E.coli developed resistance to every class of antibiotics introduced to treat human and animal infections. Resistance to the commonly used oral antibiotics like trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, amoxicillin increased steadily over time. Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E.coli have enormously increased in the past two decades. The ESBL genes are frequently encoded on transferable plasmids that encode resistance genes. Acquisition of such resistant genes by commensal or fecal isolates leads to multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. This increase in resistance is linked to a specific clone E.coli sequence type 131 (ST131) that had spread worldwide since 2008 [10\u201315].",

The gel images were captured using a Gel-documentation system. All the bands obtained were normalized using ImageLab software. Depending upon the molecular weight of the reference marker, a weighted matrix was generated. Using the PyELph v1.4 software, each band in each lane was analysed to obtain the band size with reference to the marker bands. All the band sizes so obtained were treated as an input for further analysis. A binary code of 1 or 0 was introduced to each band subjected to the presence and/or absence of the band respectively. On the basis of such generated binary matrix file, a phylogenetic tree and principle component analysis was constructed through NTSYS-pc 2.02\u2009J software. Band intensity is an important characteristic for this analysis. The bands with very low resolutions were ignored by the ImageLab software as background noise after manually checking each band. The band profiles of the DNA fragments obtained after PCR amplification using specific primers for ERIC sequences were determined. The fingerprints obtained consisted of 5 to 15 bands ranging in size from 100\u2009bp to 1\u2009kb.",

Entero pathogenic E.coli (EPEC) is a major etiological agent of infant diarrhea predominantly in developing countries [28\u201330]. ETEC defined by their production of the plasmid-encoded heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (STIa/STIb) toxins is the leading cause of traveler\u2019s diarrhea [31]. ETEC & EAEC are the most commonly identified pathogens in our study. It was found that the proportion of ETEC was significantly higher among the blood isolates as compared to fecal E.coli isolates (p\u2009=\u20090.029). However, we did not find any significant difference in the proportion of EAEC between blood and fecal E.coli isolates. Our data showed a large proportion of the isolates with localized adherence, which is a known characteristic of EPEC however none of the isolates were found positive for EPEC by PCR.",

Resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed in concurrence with cephalosporin resistance. ESBLs degrade the \u03b2-lactam moiety of penicillin derivatives, cephalosporins, monobactams, and Carbapenems. The ESBL genes are frequently encoded on transferable plasmids that encode resistance genes. Acquisition of such resistant genes by commensal or fecal isolates leads to MDR pathogens. The three major groups of ESBL enzymes are TEM, SHV and CTX-M. Among the CTX-M-type ESBLs, CTX-M-15 is widely distributed worldwide [32], and are the most prevalent in India [33]. In our study, we found that 83% of the blood E.coli isolates whereas 90% of the fecal isolates showed CTX-M15; CTXM-15 producing isolates were reported to have reduced susceptibility to Cefepime [34]. Our results are in line with the observation since 91 and 79% of the blood and fecal isolates respectively are resistant to Cefepime. Therefore, Cefepime which is a fourth generation cephalosporin is administered intravenously and used primarily for treatment of pneumonia, UTIs, and intra-abdominal infections, can no longer be a choice of drug.",

There is a significant increase in the prevalence of CTX-M enzyme producing E.coli worldwide. We report the detection of CTX-M group 9 genes and the CTX-M15 as a predominant ESBL gene among fecal isolates.

E.coli ST131 clone is well known affiliated with the worldwide spread of CTX-M15 enzyme. ST131 isolates were associated with extra-intestinal infections, frequently in UTI and bacteraemia. Initially detected in a community, later ST131 isolates were also obtained from health care settings [13]. ST131 strains are MDR and patients with such infections are at high risk of having constrained treatment choices with a prolonged duration of disease. We observed that 80% of the fecal isolates and 92% of the blood isolates belonged to ST131 clone, a sub-clonal lineage of E.coli ST131 that contains the type 1 fimbriae fimH30 (H30) allele and is termed as FimH 30 sub group. Isolates of this sub group were reported resistant to fluoro-quinolones (FQ) with only <\u20091% of FQ-susceptible isolates. The abrupt expansion and genetic similarity among the H30 strains clue that the emergence of FQ-resistant ST131 strains was driven by clonal expansion and dissemination. Isolates of H30 ST131 sub-clone were found to be resistant for more than 3 antibiotic classes and with CTX-M1. Within the H30 lineage, Price et al., identified a close distinct sub lineage with more extensive antimicrobial resistance profile called H30-Rx. This sub lineage was formed from H30 strains that carried CTX-M15 distinguished from ESBL-negative H30 strains by 3 core genome SNPs [26]. Interestingly, in association with the high resistance to Ciprofloxacin (85% fecal and 91% blood isolates), we found 83% of the fecal and 91.5% of the blood E.coli isolates belonged to FimH 30 and FimH 30-Rx sub groups.",

Especially, its application for investigating the MDR clone for clinical diagnosis is not possible. ST131 clone rapid detection assays were previously reported [23, 39]. Even though those methods may validate ST131, the results usually vary and need a confirmation by MLST.
