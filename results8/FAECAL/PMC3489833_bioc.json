In recent years, high-throughput sequencing has been the catalyst for analyzing microbial population diversity and functions. While bacterial 16S rRNA gene survey can answer the question \u201cwhich species are there\u201d [1], functional metagenomics can also address \u201cwhat are they doing\u201d by examining the sequences of genomic fragments and by exploiting, for instance, gene expression analysis by metatranscriptomics [2-4].

Strong biases can be introduced in each of these steps. Sample storage conditions, one of the first steps, is critical for downstream analyses. Previous studies had indicated that storing conditions of stool samples only modestly affect the structure of their microbial community [5-8]. However, little is known about the influence of storing conditions on more deep structural and functional analyses, which require maximal integrity of genomic DNA and RNA. Intact DNA fragments are critical for metagenomic library construction [9-11] and to characterizing intact genetic pathways either by sequence-based or function screening-based approaches [12,13]. Moreover, excessive degradation of DNA reduces the efficiency of shotgun sequencing [2]. The recovery of total RNA with high integrity is necessary for proper cDNA synthesis and absolutely essential for describing the gene expression in a community sample [4,14-16].",

As illustrated in figure \u200bfigure11 microcapillary electrophoresis revealed that genomic DNA was mostly preserved as high-molecular weight fragments when samples were stored immediately after collection at \u221220\u00b0C in a home freezer or left up to 3\u2009h at room temperature. However, DNA became fragmented when samples were allowed to unfreeze during 1\u2009h (subjects #2 and #3) or stored at room temperature over 24\u2009h (subjects #1 and #2). DNA degradation further increased and nearly all high-molecular weight fragments disappeared when samples had been kept over 2\u2009weeks at room temperature (#1, #2 and #3). In order to provide a semi-quantitative comparison, we extracted the signal intensity from the gel using the ImageJ software. This signal is converted into a number that is proportional to the DNA quantity. As shown in figure \u200bfigure1,1, we used the upper size-range (rectangle A) of the frozen sample as a proxy for \u201cno degraded DNA\u201d and the lower size-range (rectangle B) for \u201cdegraded DNA\u201d (figure \u200b(figure1).1). The threshold of 1.5\u2009kb was used to discriminate the 2 size-ranges, since it is recommended for shotgun sequencing in the 454 protocol from Roche Applied Science. Proportion of degraded DNA for each sample was then calculated by the ratio between the lower size-range intensity and the total intensity. Our results, displayed in Table \u200bTable1,1, showed a significant degradation (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Poisson regression analysis) for all storage conditions compared to frozen samples except those kept at room temperature for 3\u2009h. Therefore, storing fecal samples at room temperature over 3\u2009h after collection or allowing them to thaw and refreeze is not recommended for shotgun metagenomic sequencing, since DNA extracted from these samples can be significantly fragmented.

However, the storage conditions had a large impact on the taxonomic composition of the samples at the genus and species level for all subjects (figure \u200b(figure2B).2B). Variations were found depending on both the storage condition and the individual. In Table \u200bTable2,2, we showed the effect of storage conditions on the proportion of 3 main bacterial taxa. As shown in this table, the abundance comparison between frozen and unfrozen samples was affected by thawing samples for 1\u2009h and 3\u2009h as exemplified by the significant decrease of a dominant unknown taxon from the Bacteroides genus (from an average of 19% (F) to 13% (UF1h; p\u2009=\u20090.044, Poisson regression model) and to 9% (UF3h; p\u2009<\u20090.0001, Poisson regression model)).

Decrease of the RIN numbers was significant after thawing samples for 1\u2009h (p\u2009=\u20090.006, Wilcoxon paired test) and 3\u2009h (p\u2009=\u20090.004, Wilcoxon paired test) compared to frozen samples.

Alternatively, if bringing the samples during this period is not possible, samples should be stored immediately at \u221220\u00b0C in a home freezer.

The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Vall d\u00b4Hebron University Hospital and all participants gave informed consent.",
