In contrast to humans, where IAVs infect the respiratory tract and cause significant morbidity and mortality, IAVs infect the gastrointestinal tract of waterfowl and cause little or no pathology and are spread by fecal-oral transmission. For this reason, we examined whether IAV infection is associated with differences in the cloacal microbiome of mallards (Anas platyrhyncos), an important host of IAVs in North America and Eurasia. We characterized bacterial community composition by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes. IAV-positive mallards had lower species diversity, richness, and evenness than IAV-negative mallards. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cooccurrence patterns were also distinct depending on infection status. Network analysis showed that IAV-positive mallards had fewer significant cooccurring OTUs and exhibited fewer coassociation patterns among those OTUs than IAV-negative mallards. These results suggest that healthy mallards have a more robust and complex cloacal microbiome. By combining analytical approaches, we identified 41 bacterial OTUs, primarily representatives of Streptococcus spp., Veillonella dispar, and Rothia mucilaginosa, contributing to the observed differences. This study found that IAV-infected wild mallards exhibited strong differences in microbiome composition relative to noninfected mallards and identified a concise set of putative biomarker OTUs. Using Random Forest, a supervised machine learning method, we verified that these 41 bacterial OTUs are highly predictive of infection status.",

While pandemic influenza viruses emerge only periodically, they can be devastating\u2014for example, the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus killed more than 20 million people. IAVs infect the respiratory tract and cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans. In contrast, IAVs infect the gastrointestinal tract of waterfowl, producing little pathology. Recent studies indicated that viruses can alter the microbiome at the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa, but there are no reports of how the microbiota of the natural host of influenza is affected by infection. Here we find that the mallard microbiome is altered during IAV infection. Our results suggest that detailed examination of humans and animals infected with IAVs may reveal individualized microbiome profiles that correspond to health and disease. Moreover, future studies should explore whether the altered microbiome facilitates maintenance and transmission of IAVs in waterfowl populations.",

In humans and domestic animals (poultry, swine, horses, dogs, etc.), IAVs contain gene segments that trace back to a wild avian origin (3, 4). Recent concern over the emergence of new pandemic IAVs led to intensive IAV surveillance in waterfowl, especially of dabbling ducks in the genus Anas, which revealed that IAV prevalence may reach 40%, especially in young (hatch year) birds (58,\u201361, 65).

(7) as a characteristic microbial community (including bacteria, archaea, fungi, the various single-celled eukaryotes generally referred to as protists, and viruses) occupying a distinct habitat. For a variety of reasons, most microbiome research to date has focused on the bacterial portion of these communities. The application of contemporary sequencing methods to characterize diversity in the microbiome has revolutionized the study of interactions between microbial inhabitants of the microbiome in general as well as the study of interactions between members of the microbiome and particular pathogens (see, e.g., references 8,\u201312). Identification of potential effects of IAV infection on the microbiome of mallards (a natural reservoir) should contribute to a greater understanding of how these viruses are maintained and transmitted in nature.",

In birds and mammals, mucus is composed primarily of mucins produced by underlying epithelial cells and is divided into two layers: an outer layer that typically contains a diverse community of resident microbes and an inner \u201cprotected\u201d layer that has a low density of microbes except during pathogen invasion (15). In some cases, the microbiome of the mucus layer may affect pathogen attachment to host cells; for example, glycan structures on the surface of the bacterium Enterobacter cloacae in the human gut microbiome may facilitate the attachment of human norovirus to host cells (16). In addition, some orally transmitted viruses, including poliovirus and reovirus, may manipulate the bacterial microbiome to promote their transmission across the mucosal interface (reviewed in reference 10). Along with its associated microbiota and any potential pathogens trapped in the mucus layer, mucus is continuously expelled from the body. Once IAVs have crossed the mucosal barrier in the intestinal tract of waterfowl, they amplify inside host epithelial cells and are then shed into the environment and transmitted to new hosts. Free-ranging mallards typically shed IAVs in feces for about 6\u00a0days after infection (5, 17).",

We hypothesized that IAV infection would be associated with an altered microbiome. To investigate this, we identified members of the microbiome that contribute to the observed associations. We compared bacterial community composition characteristics using standard approaches (alpha and beta diversity; see Materials and Methods), and, to assess the relationships between groups of taxa, we analyzed bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cooccurrence patterns. Given that groups of bacterial taxa are often both functionally and phylogenetically related, it is useful to assess how infection might affect interdependencies between bacterial OTUs. In order to investigate potential interactions and relationships among different microbial taxa, we analyzed their cooccurrence relationships using a network. Network analysis of significant cooccurrence structures of microbial taxa has helped decipher complex microbial dynamics such as groups of taxa that are metabolically linked or are genetically related (18).",

We then characterized OTU cooccurrence networks across the 674 OTUs in the IAV+ and IAV\u2212 mallards and compared the IAV+ and IAV\u2212 networks to generate difference networks (D+ and D\u2212; see Materials and Methods). Briefly, the cooccurrences that were at higher levels in IAV+ were assigned to D+, and the cooccurrences that were at higher levels in IAV\u2212 were assigned to D\u2212. The assumption is that the clusters of OTUs highly cooccurring in one group (D+ or D\u2212) but not the other were infection dependent. The resulting difference networks both consisted of 674 nodes (OTUs) with 344 edges in D+ and 6,702 edges in D\u2212 networks with average node connections of 1.02 and 19.8, respectively. We found that the network of D+ mallards had fewer edges and thus lower network density than the network of D\u2212 mallards. The density values were 0.002 in D+ and 0.03 in D\u2212, showing proportionally larger numbers of existing connections in D. In order to identify core communities of bacteria that were associated with IAV infection, we set a threshold for edge weights (see Materials and Methods) to exclude weak connections and then decomposed our D+ and D\u2212 networks into modules (i.e., groups of nodes that were more densely connected to one another than to the rest of the network) (26) to find significant community differences in cooccurrence patterns between IAV+ and IAV\u2212 mallards. Both D+ and D\u2212 resulted in the formation of one cluster by the use of the Chinese whispers clustering method (27) and Markov cluster algorithm (MCL) clustering (28) with 27 and 80 nodes, respectively. A visualization of these clusters is shown in Fig.\u00a02. Twenty of these OTUs were mutual (shared) between the two groups (mutual 20). The mutual 20 exhibited similar abundance patterns across all the samples regardless of the infection group (Fig.\u00a03) and may be part of the core microbiome of the mallard. In addition to the mutual 20 OTUs, we found 7 OTUs that were uniquely identified by the D+ cluster and we found 60 OTUs that were uniquely identified by the D\u2212 cluster. The set of OTUs that were uniquely identified in D+ may be indicative of a community of bacteria that are activated in the presence of infection. This approach allows us to identify those OTUs that were uniquely identified in the D\u2212 cluster (and therefore absent in the D+ cluster) and may reflect bacteria that are diminished in population during infection. The obtained cluster from D\u2212 was bigger and more densely connected, whereas the D+ cluster had fewer OTUs and weaker connections. Therefore, the cluster from D\u2212 may represent stronger patterns of coassociation between OTUs.",

Thus, we assume that the microbiome effects were caused by the IAV and were not due to lower fitness in infected birds. All mallards were in their hatch year (likely <6\u00a0months of age) and were sampled on their breeding grounds prior to migration. Thus, our findings almost certainly reflect their first exposure to the particular virus strain isolated from their feces and may reflect their first exposure to any IAV. In an experimental infection study of IAV in mallards, Jourdain et al. (5) found that most viral shedding occurs during the first 7\u00a0days of infection. Despite the apparent lack of clinical disease or detectable pathology, some authors have suggested that infection may cause reduced fitness, perhaps due to IAV-induced decreases in nutrient uptake. For example, Latorre-Margalef et al. (17) found that body mass was significantly lower in free-ranging infected mallards than in uninfected mallards; however, prior infection status did not affect the speed or distance of subsequent migration. Importantly, we found that IAV+ mallards exhibited large differences in the composition of their cloacal microbiome, suggesting that IAV infection, and associated changes in the host microbiome, may have effects on the normal function of the gastrointestinal tract and perhaps of other organ systems and physiological responses (i.e., immune system responses) as well (4, 62, 63, 64). Although our study focused on a single species and a single anatomic location, our results indicate that future studies of host-IAV interactions may be incomplete if they do not include members of the microbiome as key players in the progress and outcome of infection.",

Although we assume that our IAV\u2212 and IAV+ mallards had similar microbiomes prior to IAV infection, additional studies are needed to follow the microbiome composition before, during, and after infection. If IAV infection caused our observed differences in microbiome composition, an interesting future direction would be to verify that cloacal diversity returns to preinfection (IAV\u2212) levels after recovery. Alternatively, mallards with more-diverse cloacal bacterial communities may be less susceptible to infection by IAVs, and the observed differences in bacterial community structure may instead reflect variations in the host susceptibility to infection rather than being a consequence of infection. Furthermore, if reduced diversity in the cloacal microbiome persists following infection, mallards exposed to IAVs may be more vulnerable to opportunistic infections. However, no studies have suggested that prior exposure, reflected by the presence of anti-IAV antibodies, is associated with decreased fitness or enhanced susceptibility to opportunistic infections.",

                    "text": "More-diverse ecological communities are often more stable in response to perturbations because decreases in the abundances of some species are counterbalanced by increases in the abundances of others (34). Studies of macroorganisms (see, e.g., references 35 and 36) have found that greater species diversity is correlated with greater surface cover, which may help prevent the establishment of invasive species. Interactions between taxa may occur on surfaces in animal microbiomes, and, in some cases, low diversity may make hosts vulnerable to invasion. Still, it is important to recognize that diversity is not a panacea and that the consequences of diversity depend on complex interactions between host susceptibility and traits associated with invading species (37). In the human microbiome, diseases that incite a strong inflammatory response are known to cause changes (both decreases and increases) in bacterial OTU richness and diversity (reviewed in reference 38). For example, bacterial diversity in the lung is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (39) and in patients with bacterial vaginosis (40). High microbial diversity is expected to occur in a healthy gut microbiome and in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease (41), and patients with inflammatory bowel disease tend to have reduced bacterial diversity in their gastrointestinal tracts (42). However, it is unclear whether reduced diversity is a symptom or a cause of these conditions.",

Difference networks for the two IAV conditions revealed that D\u2212 was a denser network, which was consistent with the observation that the IAV\u2212 mallards had greater OTU diversity, richness, and evenness. Combining all three approaches revealed that a relatively small number of OTUs were significantly different across both the abundance and presence/absence patterns and that these OTUs contributed to differences associated with infection status, including infections by representatives of Streptococcus spp., Veillonella dispar, Rothia mucilaginosa, and Prevotella, among others.",

The only exception was a single OTU in the family Micrococcaceae (phylum Actinobacteria) that was enriched in IAV+ mallards (new reference OTU 462). In contrast, enrichment of specific bacterial taxa is associated with various medical conditions in humans and other animals. For example, enrichment by Streptococcus spp. was detected in human patients with irritable bowel disease (IBD) (reviewed in reference 43) and in chickens infected with pathogenic Campylobacter jejuni (44).",

OTUs identified as significant by all three methods did not fully overlap (Fig.\u00a05a). This is because these methods detect different contributions of variance to the data. The network analysis identifies clusters based on the frequency of OTU cooccurrence within group, whereas the G-test and DIROM identify OTUs based on differential levels of enrichment between groups. Enrichment level and cooccurrence may be independent effects of IAV infection, in which case we would not expect to see a full overlap of the two analyses. However, both enrichment and cooccurrence contribute to intersample variance; thus, it was not unexpected for the OTUs identified by G-test and OTUs from the network analysis to overlap the highly variant OTUs without overlapping each other. However, the overlapping 41 OTUs were identified as significant in the three different approaches (Fig.\u00a05 and Table\u00a01). The intersection of the three methods contained OTU representatives of Streptococcus, Rothia mucilaginosa, Veillonella dispar, Prevotella, Haemophilus, and Mycoplasma and an unidentified OTU from the Lactobacillales order. These OTUs were assigned to these taxonomic classifications in QIIME, and these assignments were verified using BLAST. Interestingly, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Veillonella form consortia in the human oral microbiome and Rothia and Prevotella are common members as well (45). It would be interesting to investigate whether these taxa facilitate transmission of avian influenza virus to humans.",

Furthermore, we identified a set of significantly enriched, differentially occurring, and highly cooccurring OTUs that may be potential biomarker candidates for predicting infection status. Intersection of our analysis methods identified a concise subset of OTUs that best described the effect of IAV in mallards. This subset of OTUs provides specific targets for more-detailed studies addressing functional validation of in-depth interactions between individual taxa and IAVs. Experimental studies, with appropriate infected and noninfected controls sampled before, during, and after infection, are needed to confirm our findings and demonstrate causal relationships. Those studies should be performed with different IAV subtypes to explore the observed significant effect that different surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) have on bacterial diversity. Finally, such studies are also essential for assessing the relevance and ubiquity of our putative biomarker OTUs.",

When possible, 1.0 to 5.0\u00a0\u03bcl of template DNA was used for PCR. However, due to low DNA concentrations for some samples, bacterial DNA was amplified by a two-step PCR enrichment using primers 27F-YM+3 and 1492R to target V1 to V4 of the 16S rRNA gene (47). The 7-fold-degenerate primer 27f-YM+3 is composed of four parts 27f-YM (AGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG) plus one part each of primers specific for the amplification of Bifidobacteriaceae, Borrelia, and Chlamydiales sequences (47). For the second PCR, the primers used were the bacterial/archaeal primers 515F/806R (46) modified by addition of an Illumina adaptor and an in-house barcode system (described in reference 48). After amplification, magnetic beads (Agencourt AMPure XP; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were used to clean the PCRs. Amplicons were quantified and characterized using Qubit fluorometic quantitation, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) prior to sequencing. Libraries were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq system, generating 250-bp paired-end amplicon reads. The amplicon data were multiplexed using dual-barcode combinations for each sample.",

Each sample was characterized for taxonomic composition (number and abundance) using QIIME. For presence/absence analyses, representative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered at the >97% identity level and an OTU table was constructed using QIIME\u2019s pick_otus_through_otu_table.py script.

The first and simplest method involved simply computing the difference in the relative occurrence metric (DIROM) results for each OTU in the IAV\u2212 and IAV+ groups. For example, if an OTU was found in 40 of the 44 (0.91) IAV\u2212 birds and 7 of the 71 (0.09) IAV+ birds, then that OTU had a DIROM value of 0.82 (the absolute difference between 0.91 and 0.09). We then sorted the OTUs in descending DIROM order, causing the most differentially occurring OTUs to be highest on the list. Next, we used the G-test to identify differences in OTU abundance between the different sample groups using the group_significance.py script in QIIME and the Bonferroni method to correct for multiple comparisons. We used Venny 2.1 (53) to examine the intersection of the results from the methods described above with the results of the network analysis described below. Finally, we used the Random Forest classifier (available in Python\u2019s scikit-learn package; 29) with 3-fold cross-validation to learn the linear and nonlinear relationships among the features (here, relative OTU abundances) in order to find the set of the OTUs that are the most predictive of infection status.",

Here, we built a network of the OTUs based on the presence/absence patterns across all samples. The goal was to see if there are clusters of OTUs that are more likely to cooccur in (only) one of the infection groups. We compared every pair of OTUs in one group to the same pair of OTUs in the other infection group, determining the cooccurrence patterns between them. If the cooccurrence patterns of a pair of OTUs differed by only a little between the infection groups, we ignored that pair of OTUs. Alternatively, if the patterns were very different, we studied that pair in more detail. We assumed that clusters of OTUs highly cooccurring in one group but not the other were infection dependent.
