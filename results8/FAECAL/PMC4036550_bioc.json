Identifying and cataloguing the viruses of bats is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential zoonoses of bat origin. We characterized the fecal pathogen microbiome of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats, incorporating 281 individual bats comprising 20 common species, which were sampled in three locations of Yunnan province, by combining reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and next-generation sequencing. Seven individual bats were paramyxovirus-positive by RT-PCR using degenerate primers, and these paramyxoviruses were mainly classified into three genera (Rubulavirus, Henipavirus and Jeilongvirus). Various additional novel pathogens were detected in the paramyxovirus-positive bats using Illumina sequencing. A total of 7066 assembled contigs (\u2265200 bp) were constructed, and 105 contigs matched eukaryotic viruses (of them 103 belong to 2 vertebrate virus families, 1 insect virus, and 1 mycovirus), 17 were parasites, and 4913 were homologous to prokaryotic microorganisms. Among the 103 vertebrate viral contigs, 79 displayed low identity (<70%) to known viruses including human viruses at the amino acid level, suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses. Overall, the most frequently identified viruses, particularly in bats from the family Hipposideridae, were retroviruses. The present study expands our understanding of the bat virome in species commonly found in Yunnan, China, and provides insight into the overall diversity of viruses that may be capable of directly or indirectly crossing over into humans.",

Numerous bat species have been implicated as natural reservoirs for significant zoonotic viruses, including Ebola and, Marburg viruses; Nipah and Hendra viruses; SARS coronavirus; and most recently [2,3,4,5]. Collectively, bats harbor a broad diversity of viruses, and it has been proposed that entire viral families and genera, such as pararmyxoviruses, hepaciviruses, and pegiviruses, may have originated from bats [6,7]. More than 170 viruses have been detected in bats, and many of these viruses are highly pathogenic to humans [8], including, Nipah and Hendra viruses [9], rabies virus [10], Australian Bat Lyssavirus [11], Marburg virus [12], and the SARS-like coronavirus [13]. Notably, the outbreak of SARS coronavirus in 2002, which originated in horseshoe bats in China and infected more than 8000 people globally, has spurred increased efforts from the international research community to characterize the diversity and distribution of bat viruses around the world [4,14].",

These more ubiquitous bat species, which are in the genera of Rousettus, Myotis, Miniopterus and Hipposideros, naturally reside in close proximity to humans, thus increasing the potential of transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans. Highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses have been identified in a variety of vertebrates, including humans, and phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds [6], and often cause serious outbreaks of diseases [16,17]. Thus, assessing the variety of paramyxoviruses circulating in bats in China could provide important guidance for the control and prevention of future epidemics.",

These retroviral sequences related to all three canonical genes of retrovirus, including 28 Gag proteins, 66 protease/polymerase (Pol) and 6 envelope glycoproteins (Env), and some of them are highly closed to known bat tretroviruses [38,39,40]. Three retrovirual contigs, which code Pol, Gag and Env of gammaretrovirus respectively and have the longest CDS, were used for phylogenetic analysis. Due to the amplification of the short retroviruses sequences, we have adjusted the tree according to the published bat retrovirus trees [39,40] by removing some of the reference sequences. The phylogenetic trees indicated that Pol (KF547868) and Gag (KF547870) showed high homologous with bat gammaretroviruses, whereas Env (KF547869) couldn\u2019t clade with those of bat gammaretroviruses indicating the possibility of new viruses (Figure 3B\u2013D).

The close contact between humans and bats expands the opportunity for cross-species transmission of new zoonotic viruses to humans [41]. In the current study, we identified seven bats [including three insectivorous bats (Hipposideros cineraceus, H. armiger and Taphozous melanopogon) and two frugivorous bats (Eonycteris spelaea and Rousettus leschenaultii)] positive for paramyxovirus by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that paramyxoviruses carried by insectivorous bats were distinct from those found in frugivorous bats (Figure 1). Virus sequences from insectivorous bats could not be definitely assigned to any existing paramyxovirus genus, however, they appeared to cluster within the relatively new genus of the Jeilongvirus [37]. Moreover, we found that KC599257 (E. spelaea) and KC599259 (R. leschenaulti) from fruit bats belonged to henipavirus-related paramyxovirus and Rubulavirus genus, respectively. The finding of a henipavirus-related agent in E. spelaea provides further evidence that there is a large spectrum of henipa-like viruses among bats, including insectivorous species. Li et al. [42] previously found serological evidence of henipa-like viruses in bats, including Rousettus spp., Myotis spp., Hipposideros spp., and Miniopterus spp. in China. Henipaviruses have thus far overwhelmingly been identified in Pteropus and Eidolon species, though this may, in part, be due to a lack of surveillance in non-pteropodid bats [2,17,43]. The phylogenetic distance of species may constrain both cross-species transmission and host shifts and thus result in the separation of viruses [44]. Previous studies demonstrate that humans can be infected by paramyxoviruses through a secondary host species, such as horses and pigs, or directly from bats [9,45,46,47]. Although it is currently unknown whether paramyxoviruses, such as Jeilongvirus, are capable of infecting people, the potential risks of bat borne paramyxoviruses to human health should be considered and surveys of human populations highly exposed to bats for evidence of spillover of bat paramyxoviruses would help establish the public health risk.",

                    "text": "High-throughput sequencing-based viral metagenomics is a powerful tool to explore known and unknown viruses existing in host animals. Recently, it has been successfully used to detect viruses in bats in North America, Africa and Asia [22,23,26,27,28], where the viromes of one frugivorous bat species, E. helvum in Africa, and several insectivorous bats were described. From our metagenomic study of paramyxovirus-positive bat samples, full-length viral genomic sequences were unable to be assembled from the clean reads. This result is similar with that of previous studies and may be due to the low quantity of the virus within samples, the short reads, and the lack of known reference sequences [22,23,26]. Previous studies demonstrated that protein-based comparisons are more effective than those based on nucleotides, and thus BLASTx usually identifies more suspect-viral sequences than BLASTn [28,48]. Among the viral contigs, most of the bacterioviruses detected in this study are enterobacterial phages, suggesting the similarity between the intestinal bacterial population of bats and that of humans. Five contigs are highly similar to Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV), which may have resulted from contamination of RT reagents and also have been detected in previous virome analysis of insectivorous bats in China [26]. Many contigs are closed to bat retrovirues, which were identified by previous studies [38,39,40]. Furthermore, we found that many viral contigs showed equivalent or higher identity with Fowlpox virus (FPV) more than Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). As a prototypical member of Avipoxvirus, FPV only infects non-mammalian hosts [49], and there is no previous data available to indicate that bats are natural reservoirs or vectors of FPV. Previous studies show that REVs derive directly from mammalian retroviruses and integrate into FPV genomes, which become endogenous in the genome of larger and more complex DNA viruses [50,51,52]. Thus, these FPV-like contigs were deemed as REVs and classified into unknown gammaretroviruses temporarily, and the source of FPV-like contigs in this study should be explored further.",

The novel viruses identified were classified into two viral families, Retroviridae and Polyomaviridae, which were also detected in previous studies [26,27,28]. Retroviruses have both endogenous and exogenous forms in nature, comparing the results from this study with previous studies, metagenomic virome analysis indicated that retroviruses are the most common viral sequences found in bats, especially in Hipposideridae [26,29]. This finding may be due to the frequent integration of retroviral genomic material into host genomes, rather than an indication of viral infection. Interestingly, the Illumina screening did not detect paramyxovirus nucleic acid, which had been detected by RT-PCR, suggesting that these viruses may be present in samples in relatively small amounts and below the sensitivity of Illumina detection. These findings highlight an important limitation of high throughput sequencing as a tool for virome characterization. Furthermore, the limited size or number of contigs generated by Illumina sequencing may necessitate follow-up with conventional PCR assays in order to obtain enough sequence to perform meaningful phylogenetic analyses [6,28]. The sensitivity of high-throughput sequencing to detect viral nucleic acid is also limited if samples are not properly filtered and treated to remove host genome and other non-target nucleic acid and enrich for viral sequences. Host nucleic acid are typically present in significantly higher abundance relative to viral nucleic acid and can create background noise in the results [26]. As the cost of high-throughput sequencing decreases and methods of sample preparation improve to optimize results, Illumina sequencing can be an effective tool for characterizing virus diversity in host organisms. Bats represent a massively diverse group of mammals, and as a group they have been increasingly identified as natural reservoirs for virus families such as paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, and retroviruses, that contain zoonotic members. Emerging zoonotic bat-borne viruses, such as SARS coronavirus; Nipah and Hendra virus; and Marburg and Ebola virus; illustrate that bat viruses are capable of infecting people through various routes of transmission and in various contexts such as through domestic animals, food-borne routes, or the wildlife trade. Understanding the underlying diversity of viruses within common bat species and the types of interactions they have with people, wildlife and livestock in China may provide further insight into the risk of viral spillover, and may ultimately allow for interventions that reduce the risk of outbreaks.",
