The exclusion criteria were: (1) use of antibiotics within the past 3\u2005months; (2) on a vegetarian diet; (3) had a surgery or an invasive procedure within the past 3\u2005months; (4) had an IBD; or (5) a past history of any cancer. These predefined exclusion criteria were important because they might independently alter the microbiota. After the written informed consent, we asked patients scheduled for colonoscopy to provide a stool sample before bowel preparation. After stool collection by the patients, samples were delivered to the hospital within 24\u2005hours (mean 8.6\u2005hours, SD 6.3\u2005hours, range 0.4\u201323.3\u2005hours) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C immediately until further analysis.

To get a robust result of the model fitness, we used the 10-fold cross validation and calculated the corresponding validated AUCs to compare the models. We repeated the entire procedure 1000 times to obtain the mean and CIs of the AUCs. We used the regression results fitted in the discovery cohort to compare the cross validation results of other models. For the external testing, we quantitated FIT and the marker Fn in an independent validation cohort (testing set).

These markers were selected from three bacteria that were among the most significantly associated, and formed a co-occurrence network in the CRC microbiota.9\n10 We observed consistent associations in all three markers, and identified Fn as a key marker that outperformed the other two. This is consistent with the increasing evidence for the bacterium's functional role in colorectal carcinogenesis,14\u201316 and extends the potential utility of this marker from patient prognosis22 to cancer diagnosis.",

Although faecal quantification of Fusobacterium alone had a comparable performance with that of FIT (AUC=0.83 vs 0.86, p>0.05), the most prominent gain was observed when the marker Fn was added to the FIT, resulting in a detection leap from 73.1% to 92.3% without significantly sacrificing its specificity. This translated into an additional detection of 20 cases which would have been missed by FIT alone, with a false positive rate of 7% (ie, specificity of 93.0%) comparable to most reported values for FIT.6 This combinational approach can lead to better diagnostic performance,23 and has been used in the multitarget stool DNA test which combines FIT with several molecular assays.24 Biologically, as some CRC or advanced adenoma may bleed minimally or intermittently, supplementing FIT with another molecular marker appears to be a logical approach to enhance the detection rate.",

Adding the microbial marker Fn can increase the sensitivity of FIT for detecting advanced adenoma. This is supported by previous metagenomic studies, showing evidence of microbial dysbiosis with a higher Fusobacterium abundance in colorectal adenoma.10\n25 Nevertheless, such microbial change in adenoma appears to be less prominent compared with CRC. This has resulted in a modest increase in Fusobacterium abundance and its diagnostic performance in the advanced adenoma group. Although we have used a statically robust method for both internal and external validations, further studies are required to test its performance across different populations.",

First, we used a threshold of 20\u2005\u03bcg Hb/g (FIT100) instead of a lower value. Although this may have led to a lower sensitivity (73.1%) with a higher specificity (98%), we kept this value as recommended by the manufacturer. If we were to use lower cut-off values, the sensitivities for CRC and advanced adenoma would be 83.7% and 20.4% for a threshold of 10\u2005\u03bcg Hb/g (FIT50), or 91.3% and 27.2% for a threshold of 5\u2005\u03bcg Hb/g (FIT25). Importantly, addition of the marker Fn to FIT at these lower thresholds still outperformed than stand-alone FIT in classifying CRC (p<0.001 at both thresholds) and advanced adenoma (p=0.002 and p=0.008, respectively). Second, in the meta-analysis by Lee et al, studies using colonoscopy as the reference standard had a lower sensitivity (71%) compared with studies using longitudinal follow-up (87%). Our observed sensitivity of FIT (73.1%) is similar to the pooled estimate of 71% the meta-analysis of studies in which colonoscopy was the reference standard.",

These markers should have contributed most to the classification model, although further increment in performance is still possible with combination of other microbial markers. Furthermore, the high sensitivities of the combined test for early stage and proximal CRCs (86.4% and 92.9%, respectively) support its potential utility as a screening test, especially in the Asian populations where there is an increasing proportion of proximal lesions.27\n29\n",
