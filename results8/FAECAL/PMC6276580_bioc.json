DADA2 uses an Illumina\nsequence error correction algorithm to derive an abundance distribution of distinct SVs,\nwhich can differ by only a single nucleotide. On the basis of the quality scores, the\nforward reads were truncated at position 220 using the q2-dada2-denoise script. Taxonomy\nwas assigned using a pretrained naive Bayes classifier [Greengenes 13_8 99% operational\ntaxonomic units (OTUs)], and the q2-feature-classifier plug-in (20). Singletons and SVs present in <10% of samples were removed to\nminimize the effect of spurious, low abundance sequences using the q2-feature-table\nfilter-features script. The resulting SVs were then aligned using MAFFT (21), and a phylogenetic tree was built using FastTree\n(22). Taxonomic distributions of the samples were\ncalculated using the q2-taxa-barplot script. The rectal swabs contained bacteria\nrepresentative of fecal samples, and there was no evidence of contamination with oral,\nskin, or vaginal bacteria.",

If hyperandrogenism drives the microbial composition\nof the gut, it would be interesting to determine if treatment of PCOS with androgen\nantagonists or oral contraceptives results in recovery of the gut microbiome and improvement\nof the PCOS metabolic phenotype. Moreover, it would be informative to determine whether the\ngut microbiome of women diagnosed with PCOS using the criteria of oligomenorrhea and\npolycystic ovaries is distinct from that of women diagnosed with the other subtypes of PCOS\nthat include hyperandrogenism.",
