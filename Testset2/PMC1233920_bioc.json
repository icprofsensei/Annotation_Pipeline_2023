          "text": "Most studies of the bacterial etiology of periodontitis have used either culture-based or targeted DNA approaches, and so it is likely that pathogens remain undiscovered. The purpose of this study was to use culture-independent, quantitative analysis of biofilms associated with chronic periodontitis and periodontal health to identify pathogens and beneficial species. Samples from subjects with periodontitis and controls were analyzed using ribosomal 16S cloning and sequencing. Several genera, many of them uncultivated, were associated with periodontitis, the most numerous of which were gram positive, including Peptostreptococcus and Filifactor. The genera Megasphaera and Desulfobulbus were elevated in periodontitis, and the levels of several species or phylotypes of Campylobacter, Selenomonas, Deferribacteres, Dialister, Catonella, Tannerella, Streptococcus, Atopobium, Eubacterium, and Treponema were elevated in disease. Streptococcus and Veillonella spp. were found in high numbers in all samples and accounted for a significantly greater fraction of the microbial community in healthy subjects than in those with periodontitis. The microbial profile of periodontal health also included the less-abundant genera Campylobacter, Abiotrophia, Gemella, Capnocytophaga, and Neisseria. These newly identified candidates outnumbered Porphyromonas gingivalis and other species previously implicated as periodontopathogens, and it is not clear if newly identified and more numerous species may play a more important role in pathogenesis. Finally, more differences were found in the bacterial profile between subjects with periodontitis and healthy subjects than between deep and shallow sites within the same subject. This suggests that chronic periodontitis is the result of a global perturbation of the oral bacterial ecology rather than a disease-site specific microbial shift.",

          "text": "There is considerable evidence to show that bacterial plaque is the etiologic agent in chronic periodontitis. No single species has been implicated as a primary pathogen, and the available evidence is consistent with a polymicrobial disease etiology. Nearly all studies on the bacterial etiology of periodontitis have used either culture-based or directed DNA approaches, targeting known species. The prevailing paradigm that implicates minor constituents of the subgingival community, the gram-negative bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tanerella forsythensis, and Treponema denticola (24), as periodontopathogens is based on such approaches. However, culturing is not representative of the composition of a microbial community, since it is often too selective, especially for fastidious and as-yet-uncultivable species. Even culture-independent targeted approaches are limited to detecting the presence and levels of known species. Obviously cultivation will not detect uncultivated species, but the limitations of closed-ended molecular approaches such as PCR or hybridization assays such as checkerboard and microarrays are not as widely appreciated. Using these approaches it is possible to detect uncultivated species, but only if they have been previously characterized to allow specific primers or probes to be constructed. Perhaps more importantly, quantitative information is incomplete with these methods since the total number of bacteria is not easily determined with a closed-ended approach. Thus, it is possible that pathogens remain undiscovered with such approaches. To advance our understanding of oral biofilm communities and disease processes, it is necessary to more comprehensively identify the microbiota in periodontal health and disease.",

Recently, cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes have been used to investigate the composition of environmental samples, as well as samples from the human oral cavity. This culture-independent approach has revealed vastly greater diversity than was apparent with culturing (10, 28). Investigations of oral bacteria using these tools have used enrichment primers for rare taxa, e.g., Spirochaetaceae and Bacteroidetes, or subtraction systems to eliminate predominant taxa such as Streptococcus, enabling selective amplification and identification of rare species. Using this approach, more than 700 orally derived 16S sequences have been deposited in GenBank, less than half of which are from species that have been cultivated and characterized. To identify which of these many oral inhabitants are important in health and disease-associated biofilm communities, an adequately powered clinical study design and a quantitative, representational approach to ribosomal 16S cloning and sequencing that maintains the relative proportions of individual bacterial species is needed.",

Samples were placed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and frozen until further analysis. DNA was isolated by using a previously described methodology (20). Briefly, bacteria was removed from the paper points by adding 750 μl of sampling buffer, followed by vortexing for 1 min.

Both were rare in the present study. The greater sensitivity of cultivation compared to molecular analyses for the detection of actinobacteria has been previously reported (22). To investigate this, the DNA isolation and amplification method was tested on Actinomyces viscosus in a mixture with other species, and A. viscosus was detected with comparable sensitivity (data not shown), suggesting that the bias might be attributed to over-representation with cultivation.",

Centrifugation, freezing, and long storage times before isolation of DNA have been suspected of contributing to loss of delicate, easily lysed organisms such as Spirochetes. However, the DNA isolation method was tested, both with and without centrifugation on both fresh and frozen samples, for recovery of DNA from Spirochetes, and no differences were detected (data not shown). The methodology used for DNA isolation in the present study may have been slightly biased toward gram-negative species, since the protocol did not include disruption of cell wall by vigorous agitation. Nevertheless, large numbers of gram-positive bacteria were detected. Undoubtedly some bias is present with 16S cloning and sequencing of bacterial populations due to differences in isolation of DNA from structurally varied bacteria, varied affinities for universal primers, and differences in the copy numbers of ribosomal genes. For the present study, efforts were made to minimize bias and, compared to cultivation, with less than half of species detectable and many inaccuracies inherent in phenotypic identification, molecular analysis offers a more comprehensive and accurate approach.",

Most infections involving GPAC are polymicrobial and appear to involve synergistic interactions with other bacteria (23). Previous epidemiologic evidence has linked peptostreptococci with dental infections, although investigations have been limited to Peptostreptococcus micros, a rare species in the current study (and not associated with disease). P. micros has been associated with odontogenic infections (4, 16) and is significantly higher in smokers, a population that has more extensive and severe periodontitis than nonsmokers (36). It is also more common around mobile teeth (7) and has been found at higher levels in epithelium-associated plaque compared to unattached plaque in the gingival sulcus (5). Targeted DNA approaches have also found P. micros to be elevated in advanced chronic periodontitis (26) and more common in subjects with periodontitis (15). Evidence regarding the mechanism of pathogenesis for GPAC-associated infections is limited. Peptostreptococci isolated from chronic skin ulcers have been shown to inhibit keratinocyte and fibroblast proliferation and wound repopulation in a tissue culture model system (33). P. micros demonstrates both adhesion to epithelium and coaggregation with other species such as P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum mediated by extracellular polysaccharides (11, 12). These data suggest that peptostreptococci may play a role in preventing wound healing in chronic disease and may be important in the physical structure of a disease-associated biofilm. Further exploration of the role these bacteria play in periodontitis is needed.",

We have little knowledge of the genetic heterogeneity in these communities beyond that occurring in ribosomal genes, so it is not clear whether explorations should be conducted at the level of genus, species, or even virulence genes. Polymicrobial bacterial communities are complex and undergo interactions within the community that could be critical determinants. Bacterial profiles also vary among individual hosts, suggesting that periodontitis has a heterogeneous etiology.
