Unstimulated saliva was obtained with informed consent from a 32-year male smoker without obvious signs of oral disease. The sample was collected by spitting in a sterile plastic 50-mL tube at 10:30 a.m., 1.5 hours after eating. Six hundred \u03bcL saliva was mixed with the same volume of 2x lysis buffer [Tris 20 mM, EDTA 2 mM (pH 8), Tween 1%] and Proteinase K (Eurobio) 200 \u03bcg/mL. After a 2.5 hour incubation at 55\u00b0C, proteinase K was inactivated by a 10-min heating at 95\u00b0C. The saliva lysate was divided in six 200-\u03bcL aliquots to which RnaseA (Roche) 40 \u03bcg/mL was added. Samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. From that point, the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) was used following the manufacturer's Spin-Column Protocol for Purification of Total DNA from Animal Blood or Cells (DNeasy Blood & Tissue Handbook 07/2006). DNA was eluted using 110 \u03bcL of supplied AE Buffer, then the pooled eluate (metagenomic DNA) was concentrated to 80 ng/\u03bcL. Total DNA quantity was assessed using a NanoDrop ND-8000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).",

To investigate how taxonomic composition of the same sample differed depending on the number of PCR cycles, we analyzed forward and reverse reads from V1 and V3 16S-HTS datasets obtained after 20, 25 and 30 cycles. The taxonomic assignment was performed using RDP Classifier (Additional file 1). The changes in proportions were relatively consistent for the different taxa within the same phylum (Figure \u200b(Figure1):1): the relative abundance of sequence reads assigned to taxa belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes generally decreased with more PCR cycles, whereas the proportion of sequences representing other phyla and their corresponding lower-level taxa generally increased. Instances in which the same direction of change (decrease or increase) occurred across all 8 subsets were found in 63 of the 109 taxa (Figure \u200b(Figure1).1). Moreover, in 95% of cases where a > 25% change in taxa abundance was found in 30- vs 20- cycle-samples, the value obtained after 25 cycles was intermediate relatively to those obtained after 20 and 30 cycles. It seems likely that, for some taxa, more PCR cycles will further increase the bias. We found that the average Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, which may be an indicator of obesity in intestinal microbiota [15], was on average 3.6 (range 3.4-3.9), 2.3 (range 2.2-2.4) and 2.0 (range 1.9-2.2) in 20-, 25- and 30-cycle 16S-HTS datasets, respectively.",

These simulated Illumina reads were assigned taxonomy using the RDP Classifier with a recommended 50% bootstrap cutoff. The proportion of V1 and V3 sequences correctly assigned at the genus level reached 68% and 76%, respectively (Additional File 2). For both, V1 and V3 regions, the accuracy of taxonomic assignment at the phylum level was greater than 95%.",

This approach confirmed the trend observed when taxonomy was assigned to each sequence read (see above); the relative abundance of the majority of OTUs from the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes was decreased whereas the proportion of most OTUs from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Spirochaetes was enhanced by increasing the number of PCR cycles (Additional file 3).",

The relevant data were then included in the construction of the similarity matrix as described above (not presented). We found that the average similarity between the V3 dataset determined in the current study and the five published microbiomes was comparable to the average similarity observed among these five microbiomes (Table \u200b(Table3).3). Relative to these values, our V3 16S-HTS datasets showed higher degrees of similarity when compared to our V1 16S-HTS and 16S-WGS datasets (Table \u200b(Table3)3) i.e. the interindividual differences may outweigh to some extent the methodological differences. Still, differences in the genera distribution inferred from 16S-WGS, 16S-HTS and WGS datasets (Table \u200b(Table3)3) are too great to allow for reliable comparisons of the results generated using different methodologies.

BLASTN similarity search against fungal genomes of the NCBI database did not yield any significant hits. The reasons for this may be: (i) an inefficient disruption of fungal cells by the enzymatic procedure used to release DNA from bacteria; (ii) the presence of fungi in saliva under the detection level; (iii) the absence of the relevant fungal genomes in the database.

Most human adults are infected with HHVs but the prevalence of some HHV is significantly higher in HIV-seropositive persons. In subjects with recurrent oral Herpes simplex virus 1 infections, two other HHVs, HHV-6 and HHV-7 were simultaneously present with a frequency of over 93% [31]. HHvs possibly contribute to periodontitis which, in turn, facilitates virus shed into saliva [32]. Recently, using a metagenomic approach Willner et al.

Using relatively stringent BLASTN parameters about 19% and 35% of sequence reads remained taxonomically unassigned in the forward- and reverse-run WGS subsets, respectively. Nevertheless, the advantage of the WGS approach is that it allows assessment of not only bacterial but also viral (human viruses and phages) and possibly fungal and archaeal communities which undoubtedly play an important role in oral health or disease. In addition, an in-depth sequencing of a salivary metagenome may provide insights into gene functions and allow for reconstruction of the functional potential of a microbial population [36]. Functional assignments of sequences may be made for instance using CAMERA, CARMA3 [37] or MG-RAST [38], as it was recently shown for the supragingival dental plaque microbome [39]. The obtained sequences may be assigned to known functions and classified to major categories including, among others, virulence and resistance to antibiotics.",
