Alterations in the oral microbiota may be associated with disorders such as gingivitis, periodontitis, childhood caries, alveolar osteitis, oral candidiasis and endodontic infections. In the immunosuppressed population, the spectrum of potential oral disease is even broader, encompassing candidiasis, necrotizing gingivitis, parotid gland enlargement, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, oral warts and other diseases. Here, we used 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to examine the oral microbiome of saliva, mucosal and tooth samples from HIV-positive and negative children. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from a cross-section of patients undergoing routine dental care. Multiple specimens from different sampling sites in the mouth were collected for each patient. The goal of the study was to observe the potential diversity of the oral microbiota among individual patients, sample locations, HIV status and various dental characteristics. We found that there were significant differences in the microbiome among the enrolled patients, and between sampling locations. The analysis was complicated by uneven enrollment in the patient cohorts, with only five HIV-negative patients enrolled in the study and by the rapid improvement in the health of HIV-infected children between the time the study was conceived and completed. The generally good oral health of the HIV-negative patients limited the number of dental plaque samples that could be collected. We did not identify significant differences between well-controlled HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative controls, suggesting that well-controlled HIV-positive patients essentially harbor similar oral flora compared to patients without HIV. Nor were significant differences in the oral microbiota identified between different teeth or with different dental characteristics. Additional studies are needed to better characterize the oral microbiome in children and those with poorly-controlled HIV infections.",

As children grow and mature, additional changes in the oral microbial community accompany the eruption of the primary teeth, and the oral microbial community develops into the community that exists in association with mixed and finally adult dentition. The differences in the oral microbial communities that accompany dental development are clearly reflected in clinically appreciated changes. For example, the prevalence of plaque and the quality of plaque differs significantly in children with primary and permanent dentition [1], with for example, some species associated with periodontal disease rarely observed in children with only primary dentition [2]. The prevalence of caries also changes substantially during development. Some factors that potentially influence the oral microbiota include the hormonal changes associated with puberty which can affect host responses and the oral microbiota, and are thought to play a role in the increase in periodontal disease seen in adolescents and adults [3].",

Studies using both conventional and molecular techniques have shown that there are substantial differences in the microbial communities that inhabit these different microenvironments. Culture-independent approaches using next-generation sequencing have also demonstrated variety in the microbiota between different sites within the oral cavity, particularly between mucosal and dental samples [4\u20137].",

Resources such as the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) project have arisen to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive repository of genomic, phylogenetic, phenotypic, clinical, and bibliographic information of the prokaryote species identified in the human oral cavity. As next-generation sequencing technology has become more accessible, small-scale studies have been conducted to evaluate the oral microbiota of healthy adult individuals [4, 5]. These studies have found a certain degree of overlap between bacterial species in healthy adult volunteers, leading to the proposal of a common \u2018core\u2019 oral microbiota [4, 7, 15].

In some pediatric studies, culture-independent studies using 16S rRNA gene sequences have been employed, but many of these have used older sequencing approaches that have difficulty providing sufficient depth of coverage to identify potentially low abundance species [11, 20]. These studies, however, showed clear development-dependent changes in different components of the oral microbial community. For example, one study found that in plaque, Prevotella nigrescens was found more frequently and its prevalence increases with increasing age; Eikenella corrodens and Campylobacter rectus were detected in plaque and sometimes in saliva, and Tannerella forsythensis was sometimes seen in saliva. Some species, like Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and P. nigrescens, showed age-related prevalence changes; the number of subjects with no detectable target species dropped from 40% at 3 y to 0% at 11 y, demonstrating strong age-dependent changes in oral microbiota [22].",

While increasing interest has focused on characterizing and understanding the oral microbiota [16], less work has been done to study the microbiota in a developmental context. We conducted a cross-sectional study of normal children, seen for routine dental care, including children with primary, mixed, and adult dentition, and including periodontal, lingual, buccal, and saliva samples. Only five HIV-negative patients consented to enroll in the study. However, we found significant changes in the composition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), a measure of bacterial species, between primary and adult dentition. It should be noted that HIV-negative patients had generally good dentition which limited the number of dental plaque samples that could be attained. Additionally, limited enrollment and a substantial decrease in the population of highly immunosuppressed pediatric HIV patients as the study got underway precluded a comparison of immunocompromised HIV-positive patients to HIV-negative or well-controlled HIV-positive patients.",

Specific exclusion criteria included a patient with a disease for which the American Heart Association guidelines recommended antibiotic prophylaxis.

A comprehensive medical history was also obtained, including any history of immunosuppressive conditions and medications, particularly those such as antibiotics that could potentially affect the oral flora. Data concerning race and ethnicity (Table 1), and other factors that could potentially affect the oral flora, such as chewing gum use were also collected.

The clinical impression of the oral exam was recorded and abstracted in a structured format for inclusion with the clinical metadata for each patient, which was entered into a database. Periodontal examination included assessments of clinical signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, or bleeding on probing (BOP)), and of the presence or absence and extent of gingivitis or periodontitis. When in the full permanent dentition, probing depths (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL) measurements were recorded on 4 sites/tooth (MB, B, DB, L) of all teeth except third molars using a calibrated North Carolina periodontal probe. Sites were considered periodontally healthy if there was no BOP or other signs of clinical inflammation combined with shallow PD (\u2264 4 mm) and minimal CAL (\u2264 2 mm). Subjects were considered periodontally healthy if on a full-mouth basis there is little or no BOP (\u2264 2% of sites), the average PD is \u2264 3 mm, and mean CAL is \u2264 0.6 mm. Details of the periodontal data from sites were recorded and abstracted as clinical metadata. From each individual in the full permanent dentition, up to 26 oral specimens could have been collected. Separate dental plaque specimens were taken with sterile curettes from supragingival and subgingival surfaces of 7 target teeth (#3, 9, 12, 19, 25, 28, and 30). In the primary or mixed dentition, 10 oral specimens were collected. In many cases, there was no plaque on the target tooth. Separate dental plaque specimens were taken with sterile curettes from supragingival surfaces of 5 target teeth (#A, T, E, P, I) if present. Although the protocol allowed for collection of subgingival samples, all samples were supragingival due to the generally good dental health of the enrolled patients. In cases where a target tooth is missing or otherwise not suitable for sampling, a nearby tooth was used as a substitute. However, many nearby teeth also lacked plaque or were otherwise unsuitable and could not be sampled. Sterile plastic spatulas were used to collect soft tissue scrapings from the keratinized buccal gingiva adjacent to each of the target teeth, dorsal and ventral surfaces of the tongue, and buccal mucosa. The dental protocol contained provisions to obtain hard palate plaque samples, but none were observed during enrollment. The final sample consisted of whole saliva that was expectorated into a test tube. Specimens were suspended in 200 \u03bcl of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in screw-cap vials. Specimens were frozen immediately, and kept at -80\u00b0C before further processing. The study was approved by the Children\u2019s National Medical Center Institutional Review Board and patients were enrolled in the study following signed informed consent by the parent/guardian and assent where appropriate.",

The total number of samples obtained for each patient was affected by their underlying plaque quantities. Some samples could not be obtained due to low plaque quantity. HIV patients averaged 10.5 samples per patient, while healthy patients averaged 5 samples per patient. Individual patients had variable proportions of different phyla, but it is unclear if differences in relative abundance are due to true inter-individual variability in the oral microbiota or sampling bias (Fig 2A). Generally, samples from saliva or mucosal surfaces appeared to have a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes phyla. Samples from teeth had a greater variety of different phyla, with phylum TM7 and Spirochaetes appearing in some samples (Fig 2B). The relative abundances of the phyla from tooth samples also appear more evenly proportioned, particularly when compared to the Firmicutes dominance of the mucosal surfaces. Between all HIV infected patients and all healthy patients, no statistically significant differences between the relative abundances of different phyla were appreciated.

Patient 12 was the youngest subject enrolled and presented with only primary dentition at the time of sampling.

Additional dental characteristics, including plaque score, flossing frequency, mouthwash use and probiotic use, were examined for their effects upon the relative abundance of OTUs, but were not found to be significantly different. However, significant differences were identified between the Shannon diversity scores of all samples, which included both tooth samples and mucosal samples. No particular sample type could be identified as the source of the difference. The sampling size differences were particularly marked between tooth and mucosal samples, which made comparison challenging. Although differences between plaques scores were not statistically significant, they were used as a marker of dental health to compare changes in the bacterial populations. The relative abundances of each unique OTU between the plaque scores were compared to identify changes in the bacterial population (Fig 3B). The genera Actinomyces, Prevotella, Rothia, Streptococcus, Leptotrichia and Veillonella were represented in all samples. The two patients who received a \u2018Good\u2019 plaque score had increased relative abundance of Actinobaculum and Fusobacterium. The patients with \u2018Fair\u2019 or \u2018Poor\u2019 plaque scores contained the genera Gemella, Neisseria and Porphyromonas.",

Samples taken from teeth tended to have higher diversity scores, but teeth had fewer samples compared to saliva and mucosa (Fig 1A). Diversity between the HIV and healthy cohorts did not vary significantly (Fig 1B) with a p-value of 0.9898. Individual patients were also compared, as shown in Fig 1C, and discussed above. NMDS and Principle Coordinate plots were generated using OTU abundance data (Fig 4). No significant groupings were identified between sample location, HIV status or primary versus permanent teeth. Samples taken from the same patient did seem to cluster together, however there was significant overlap between patients. Principal coordinate plots were also generated from both Bray-Curtis scores and weighted and unweighted UniFrac scores, but no grouping differences were identified between individual patients, HIV status or sample location including primary versus permanent teeth (Fig 5).",

Fluctuations in relative OTU abundance were observed between sampling sites. In particular, the relative abundance of Firmicutes appeared to increase in mucosal samples, while samples from teeth had a greater diversity of different phyla. Prior studies have also found that mucosal or saliva samples are dominated by the Firmicutes phyla, with much lower concentrations of TM7 or the Spirochaetes phylum [4]. It is unclear if properties inherent to Firmicutes contribute to its increased relative abundance in saliva and mucosal samples. Wessel et al. examined the characteristics of planktonic and biofilm-forming bacteria in tooth and saliva samples, and concluded that bacteria observed in saliva samples had lower adhesion forces compared to biofilm bacteria [35]. It is also possible that the greater diversity of highly abundant genera observed in our tooth samples are secondary to biofilm formation, which may provide a matrix permitting the adherence of a richer community of bacteria relative to mucosa samples. Like other studies, we did find a significant change in the microbial diversity between teeth samples and mucosal samples, although differences between individual teeth were not significant, and no clustering was identified between sample locations noted using NMDS analysis [5, 36]. There are also differences within the existing literature regarding bacterial abundance at different oral sites, with some studies observing differences in diversity between mucosal or saliva samples, while others have found greater diversity from plaque or tooth samples [5, 36].",

                    "text": "Low enrollment confounded the analysis of dental characteristics, and no significant differences were appreciated in bacterial diversity associated with these dental characteristics. Periodontal disease was minimal in enrolled subjects, regardless of plaque score. The average DMFT (Decayed, Missing or Filled Teeth) score for permanent dentition was 3, for mixed dentition 0.714 and for primary dentition 3.5. The prevalence of caries was generally low; no permanent teeth had untreated caries, while 29% of mixed teeth and 50% of primary teeth had untreated caries. Previous studies have found shifts in the oral microbiota that are associated with caries formation in children, and dental plaques may progress to caries [36, 37]. Certain genera and species have been associated with the formation or avoidance of caries, but we did not observe similar results. Like other studies, our tooth samples were dominated by the genera Actinomyces, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Leptotrichia, Corynebacterium, Veillonella, and Rothia, which are all well-known oral flora and have been identified as core genera in other studies of dental plaque [5, 38]. Gemella and Abiotrophia have been found to be more abundant in dental plaques from children without caries, yet our patients with a poor plaque score had an increased abundance of Gemella while Abiotrophia was found in children with both poor and good plaque scores. (Fig 2B) [39]. Other studies have linked Fusobacterium to periodontal disease, which does not correlate with our finding of increased Fusobacterium abundance in patients with a good plaque score without evidence of periodontal disease [40]. Given the small sample collected from dental plaques and small number of patients with a poor plaque score, these differences in findings may be a sampling error. However, it emphasizes the difficulty of identifying significant changes in plaque microbiota that may be predictive of disease. For instance, changes in oral microbiota have been associated with tooth surface location, which was not examined in this dataset [5, 41] and many studies strictly control for any possible factor that may influence the oral microbiome, such as recent tooth brushing or recent meals. If next-generation sequencing technology is to be applied to the diagnosis of periodontal disease, it must be easily performed and reproducible between different healthcare providers and patients. Further investigation into fluctuations between biofilms and planktonic bacteria associated with periodontal disease is needed to determine what factors may impact on the abundance or diversity of different bacterial species and how they may relate to disease pathogenesis.",

No single patient responsible for the variation could be identified, indicating more generalized differences existed between the study subjects. Although only one patient under five years of age was enrolled, her sample had a markedly lower Shannon diversity score compared to the other samples. If additional children under five years of age had been enrolled, it is possible that a more robust difference could have been observed. These differences support previous observations of the evolution of the oral microbiome with age and dental health. It is likely additional changes would be apparent with increased enrollment of young children and a greater diversity of oral habits and dental health status.",

The ten most abundant genera responsible for 70\u201380% of total abundance were examined. Most common genera were shared between primary and permanent teeth samples. Primary teeth were found to have increased abundance of Rothia and Actinobacillus, while the permanent teeth had increased abundance of Actinomyces, which has been previously observed as part of the natural evolution of oral flora [36, 41]. However, unlike other studies, we did not observe changes in the abundance of Porphyromonas, or Tannerella with age. Nor did we find an increased prevalence of Lactobacillus in our samples, as was identified in a study of plaque samples from pre-school aged children[36]. The relatively small number of primary teeth enrolled into our study may account for the lack of power to identify these changes. However, the variability observed in the literature is also likely a function of the many factors impacting observations of oral microbiota, including transient changes in flora that may be observed with sampling limited to a single point in time.",

The enrolled HIV-positive patients were generally very well-controlled with high CD4 counts and low viral loads, reflective of the current high standard of care for patients living in the United States with HIV infection. Perinatal HIV transmission declined substantially between the time the study was conceived and implemented. The proportion of pediatric HIV patients with poorly controlled disease and substantial degrees of immunosuppression likewise declined substantially, making comparison of highly immunosuppressed patients with well controlled patients more problematic than originally planned. Only three patients had a CD4+ T-cell count less than 500 cells/mm3 at the time of sampling, but significant changes in diversity were not observed in these patients. For example, it is well-known that some oral opportunistic infections are rarely seen in well-controlled HIV-positive patients, and we found that the oral flora of well-controlled HIV patients is essentially the same as HIV-negative patients. As the standard of clinical care for HIV has improved, identifying patients with low CD4+ T-cell counts for enrollment into studies has become challenging. Many patients with low CD4+ T-cell counts may present to medical care only when seriously ill, adding another layer of complexity into evaluation of their microbiota. Additionally, some studies have suggested that the administration of anti-retroviral medications (ARV) themselves may alter the oral microbiota, and have found that lingual samples from HIV+ patients on ARVs have decreased abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Neisseria [24, 42]. We did not observe a change in the abundance of Neisseria between our patient cohorts, although Lachnospiraceae did appear to decrease. It should be noted that Lachnospiraceae was a relatively low abundance species in both patient groups. It does appear that in untreated HIV positive patients, changes occur in the oral microbiota, particularly as HIV viral load increases [24]. Although our study was limited by low-enrollment of poorly controlled HIV positive subjects, a larger study examining a greater cross-section of the HIV-infected community is likely to identify significant changes in the oral microbiome.",

Significant challenges must be addressed before this technology can be applied to clinical medicine. In particular, the oral microbiome appears to be a fluid and variable environment, in which a standardized measurement technique has yet to be established. Changes in the oral microbiome are readily observed in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and caries formation, and a link to HIV oral disease such as candidiasis, necrotizing gingivitis or Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma also exists. Ultimately, it may be possible to generate a diagnostic test predictive of a patient\u2019s risk of oral disease to guide clinical monitoring and management. Larger and more inclusive studies with fewer sampling limitations will be needed to define the natural changes that occur as primary dentition evolves into permanent dentition, and to standardize the measurement of oral microbiome samples.",
