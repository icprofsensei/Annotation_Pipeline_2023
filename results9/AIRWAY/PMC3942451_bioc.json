Here we have developed a functional gene-based microarray for profiling human microbiomes (HuMiChip) with 36,802 probes targeting 50,007 protein coding sequences for 139 key functional gene families. Computational evaluation suggested all probes included are highly specific to their target sequences. HuMiChip was used to analyze human oral and gut microbiomes, showing significantly different functional gene profiles between oral and gut microbiome. Obvious shifts of microbial functional structure and composition were observed for both patients with dental caries and periodontitis from moderate to advanced stages, suggesting a progressive change of microbial communities in response to the diseases. Consistent gene family profiles were observed by both HuMiChip and next generation sequencing technologies. Additionally, HuMiChip was able to detect gene families at as low as 0.001% relative abundance. The results indicate that the developed HuMiChip is a useful and effective tool for functional profiling of human microbiomes.",

Many human disorders, such as dental caries, periodontitis, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, are closely related with changed microbial communities in the human body [3], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Thus understanding the diversity, composition, structure, function, and dynamics of human microbiomes in individual human hosts is crucial to reveal human-microbial interactions, especially for patients with microbially mediated disorders, but challenging due to the high diversity of the human microbiome. For example, the number of microbial cells is at least ten times more than human cells in the individual human body [13], [14], and the number of microbial genes is 100 times more than their host. Although thousands of microbial species from the human body have been isolated and sequenced, especially by the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) [15], characterizing and linking the function of microbial communities to their host\u2019s health status (e.g., obesity, liver diseases, periodontitis) is still challenging.",

So far, a variety of microarrays, such as GeoChip, PhyloChip, HITChip, HuGChip, as well as a series of other 16S rRNA based microarrays have been developed and widely used for functional and phylogenetic profiling of microbial communities from different habitats [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. However, these microbial ecological microarrays mainly target functional genes that play important roles in biogeochemical processes in the natural environment or 16S rRNA genes, but not functional genes specifically important to the human body. Intriguingly, recent metagenomic studies suggested that a functional rather than a taxonomic core might be present within a given niche of the human microbiome, and that changes in these cores might lead to different physiological states [5], [11], [24], [25].",

In total, 14,460 probes were detected in at least three out of 12 or 13 samples in each group, with an average of 6,699 probes detected per sample.

An obvious shift of most functional gene categories was observed between moderate and advanced periodontitis patients with most gene families having decreased abundances in advanced periodontitis (Figure 3A and 3B). For example, the abundance of lipid metabolism genes was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in moderate periodontitis patients compared to healthy individuals (Figure 3A), but became insignificant with decreased abundance in advanced periodontitis patients (Figure 3B). Also, no significant changes were found for gene categories such as carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and energy metabolism in moderate periodontitis patients (Figure 3A), while significantly decreased abundances were observed in advanced periodontitis patients (Figure 3B). In addition, other gene categories, such as glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, metabolism of other amino acids, amino acid metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and translation, remained significantly decreased in both moderate and advanced periodontitis patients, but further decreased levels were observed in advanced patients (Figure 3A and 3B).

In addition, extensive evaluations for functional gene arrays designed with the same criteria were carried out using pure culture DNA, mock community DNA, and environmental samples, suggesting high specificity and sensitivity for those microarrays [26], [36], [54], [60], [61], [62], [63]. Since the same criteria were used in the HuMiChip development, it is expected that the HuMiChip should have as high specificity and sensitivity as these functional gene arrays. Moreover, specificity for all probes were computationally checked and evaluated against the whole MotherDB, which included both full genomes and metagenomes. Finally, comparative evaluation of functional gene profiles revealed by HuMiChip and NGS technologies suggested significant correlations between these two approaches, and HuMiChip was able to detect functional gene families at as low as 0.001% relative abundance.

Significantly different overall functional structures of oral microbial communities were also observed between healthy individuals and patients with periodontitis, indicating that periodontitis might be a disorder of the whole microbial community, which is generally consistent with previous studies [7], [8], [66], [67], [68]. Interestingly, significant differences were not observed between the oral microbiome from healthy individuals and patients with moderate dental caries, but observed between patients with severe dental caries and individuals who were healthy or with moderate dental caries. Such results suggested that the overall investigated functional gene profiles of microbial communities associated with moderate dental caries, which might be caused primarily by a few bacterial species such as Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli\n[9], were less affected. However, when dental caries develop to a severe stage, the whole microbial community was affected. Similar results were also observed between healthy individuals and patients with dental caries in a previous metagenomic study [6].

                    "text": "Currently, most functional profiling studies for human microbiomes were carried out by next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, which should be used as gold standard for comprehensive analysis in exploratory studies of microbial communities. The HuMiChip developed in this study provides an alternative way for functional analysis of human microbiomes. Compared with NGS technologies, the main disadvantage for HuMiChip as well as other functional gene arrays is that the probes/genes covered by the chip are always limited, thus is not suitable for finding new genes/populations to define the extensive diversity of microbial communities in the environment. In addition, the limited coverage of probes/genes also restricts the accurate estimation of (relative) abundance in the community, making it more suitable for comparative studies but not exploratory studies. However, functional gene arrays still feature several advantages, especially for fast and cost-effective routine analysis of interested gene families. First, although sequencing technology is becoming cheaper and generates huge amounts of data, data analysis (e.g., assembly, function and taxonomy assignment) and interpretation is still extremely challenging and costly [76], [77], especially for complex microbial communities. In contrast, microarray data analysis methods are rapid, mature, and cost-effective. Second, NGS generates huge amounts of sequences (for both genes of interest or not), which is more suitable for discovery studies of both known and unknown gene content in the environment, while microarrays contain only genes of interest and can be used by researchers\u2019 for routine studies of interested genes across many samples within a short time. In addition, due to the nature of NGS technologies, highly abundant gene families such as house-keeping genes are repeatedly sequenced, while low abundant, but functionally important genes are hardly sequenced, resulting in limited observations of these gene families. In contrast, gene families included on functional gene arrays are specifically selected according to researchers\u2019 interests, and low abundant genes can be well captured. Thus, we recommend a complementary use of functional gene arrays for routine studies of interested gene families, and NGS for exploratory discovery studies of microbial communities. Novel gene sequences captured by NGS can be used for developing more comprehensive microarrays (e.g., functional gene arrays).",

A total of 36,802 probes targeting 139 gene families involved in key microbial functional processes in human microbiomes were included on HuMiChip, covering 50,007 CDS from 322 sequenced genomes as well as 31 shotgun metagenomes. Computational evaluation indicates that all HuMiChip probes are highly specific to their targets. Our analysis of the human oral and gut microbiomes suggests that the HuMiChip is a useful and high throughput tool to analyze the functional diversity, composition, structure, metabolic potential and dynamics of human microbiomes. The gene family profiles identified by HuMiChip were consistent with those obtained by NGS technologies. Further development of HuMiChip will target more sequenced genomes, as well as metagenomes, and develop strain/species-specific probes for strain/species identification[78].",
