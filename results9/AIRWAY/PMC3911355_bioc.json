Here, we provide a proof of principle for disease monitoring using personal metagenomic sequencing and traditional clinical microbiology by focusing on three adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). The CF lung is a dynamic environment that hosts a complex ecosystem composed of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that can vary in space and time. Not surprisingly, the microbiome data from the induced sputum samples we collected revealed a significant amount of species diversity not seen in routine clinical laboratory cultures. The relative abundances of several species changed as clinical treatment was altered, enabling the identification of the climax and attack communities that were proposed in an earlier work. All patient microbiomes encoded a diversity of mechanisms to resist antibiotics, consistent with the characteristics of multidrug-resistant microbial communities that are commonly observed in CF patients. The metabolic potentials of these communities differed by the health status and recovery route of each patient. Thus, this pilot study provides an example of how metagenomic data might be used with clinical assessments for the development of treatments tailored to individual patients.",

Pathogens can be rapidly characterized during outbreaks (1, 2), and cancer patients can receive personalized diagnoses and treatments (3, 4). Despite these significant advances, newer technologies have yet to be used in routine clinical microbiology practice. Treating polymicrobial infections will also require a personalized approach, because the taxonomic identities and functional characteristics of microbial communities are often patient specific (5). Here, we moved toward this goal by using metagenomics to monitor complex pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).",

These mutations result in altered transepithelial ion transport, leading to a dysfunctional mucus layer overlying epithelial cells in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (7). In the lungs, the mucociliary clearance mechanism is impaired, resulting in chronic polymicrobial infections of the airway. The associated acute inflammatory and adaptive immune responses lead to a breakdown in the integrity of the airway wall, progressive gas exchange abnormalities, and respiratory failure in many patients. Early in life, culture-based assessments indicate that patients are usually infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the more advanced stages of disease, P. aeruginosa dominates, along with Staphylococcus spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., and Achromobacter spp. Current treatments focus on controlling inflammation, the frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and physically clearing the airway biofilm by augmenting airway clearance.",

Climax communities are typically bacterial and fungal populations that are stable over time and are inherently resistant to antibiotic therapy. They elicit prolonged innate and adaptive immune responses and are adapted to particular niches. The attack communities are predominantly newly acquired bacterial and viral populations that elicit strong innate immune responses and frequently trigger acute pulmonary exacerbations and are thus targets of therapy. Attack communities dominate earlier in CF airway disease, when airway remodeling and damage are minimal (8). In the advanced stages of disease, the predominant climax populations are thought to persist, while the attack communities fluctuate in accordance with exacerbation and treatment events. The climax and attack communities need not differ taxonomically, because it is the functional capabilities of a community that determine how it affects the health of a patient. We hypothesize that community metabolic functions respond to perturbations and that these responses can be used to identify the attack and climax communities within each patient.",

It differs from community analyses that sequence only the 16S rRNA gene because all genes are sequenced, not just those used for making a taxonomic identification. Thus, information on community function is typically only obtainable with metagenomic sequencing, although some functions can be predicted based on taxonomy alone (e.g., methanogenesis). Neither approach requires culturing bacteria, and when applied to CF patients, both methods have revealed the microbial diversity and community complexity in airways to be unexpectedly high (5, 9). Furthermore, these sequence-based technologies have demonstrated that bacterial diversity decreases during treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and as the disease advances over longer periods of time (10, 11). Although microbial communities can differ across the regions of the lung and between simultaneous samplings, even one finding of a gene encoding antibiotic resistance can have important implications for treatment.",

As DNA sequencing becomes more affordable and sequence analysis becomes more efficient, this approach can be further developed to assist clinical decision making and formulation of personalized therapies.

The first sample (CF7-A-Ex) was collected before the administration of therapy. Sample CF7-B-Tr was collected 20 days after the beginning of treatment with tobramycin and ceftazidime, and sample CF7-C-Tr was collected 7 days after stopping ceftazidime and prior to the initiation of piperacillin-tazobactam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy due to the lack of clinical and physiological response. The fourth sample (CF7-D-Pt) was taken 10 days later upon the completion of treatment. However, the patient had not completely improved physiologically, as he showed no resolution of the initial respiratory symptoms and a worsening of shortness of breath (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). The FEV1 improved to 0.92 liter (22% predicted) but remained >20% lower than the baseline FEV1 value. The respiratory domain on the CFQR improved by a value greater than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 5 (see Table S2 in the supplemental material), suggesting that the patient might have improved slightly.

S. maltophilia and mucoid P. aeruginosa were also cultured, and all had various patterns of antibiotic susceptibility (Table 2 and Fig. 5). Metagenomic analysis at all time points showed an overall high relative abundance of S. maltophilia that ranged from 41% to 90%, whereas P. aeruginosa was relatively rare (<1%). R. mucilaginosa, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus spp., and Prevotella melaninogenica were highly abundant during the onset of symptom exacerbation and following the first round of unresponsive therapy. However, 1 month following the onset of symptom exacerbation, during which the patient underwent intense treatment with a combination of antibiotics, S. maltophilia repopulated the lung community, and the overall bacterial diversity decreased. S. maltophilia was the key player within the microbial community in this patient, and clinical testing indicated that it was highly resistant to all major groups of antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, macrolides, \u03b2-lactamases, and fluoroquinolones (Fig. 3A and \u200band5;5; see also Table S3 in the supplemental material). The metagenome data suggest that the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in this microbial community were multidrug resistance efflux pumps, a protein that prevents tetracycline from inhibiting the ribosome, and various enzymes and transporters that confer resistance (Fig. 3). As seen in patient CF6, even though macrolides were not reported in his recent medical history, various macrolide-specific resistance mechanisms were found (Fig. 3A; see also Table S3 in the supplemental material). Further comparison of the data with aminoglycoside and macrolide resistance genes in UncovAR revealed that S. maltophilia likely relies on efflux pumps (e.g., gene acr) to purge antibiotics from the cell (Fig. 3B).",

This limited change in the patient's microbial taxonomical and functional profiles was consistent with the patient's unresponsive clinical status. These data also suggest that a particular set of metabolic functions (Fig. 3) may have been responsible for the persistence of his unresponsive climax microbial community. These metabolic functions include the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies (ko00072), carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes (ko00720), drug metabolism pathways (ko00983), and riboflavin metabolism (ko00740). Further examination within the drug metabolism pathway revealed the presence of the arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) gene involved in isoniazid metabolism, which is known to occur in E. coli (20, 21). Isoniazid is commonly used to treat tuberculosis, but it was not used in this patient, according to his medical history. It is not known whether NAT is capable of metabolizing any drugs that were prescribed to patient CF7.",

However, the metagenomic data predicted resistance to several groups of antibiotics (Fig. 3A and \u200band6;6; see also Table S3 in the supplemental material), including aminoglycosides, \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides. The antibiotic resistance mechanisms detected in the microbiome data included \u03b2-lactamases, multidrug efflux pumps, the same ribosomal protection protein identified in patient CF7, and various enzymes that confer resistance (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). A high abundance of genes that confer resistance to tetracycline and macrolides were detected in the exacerbation sample (CF8-A-Ex), but their abundances decreased upon treatment with meropenem and tobramycin. However, the abundances of the \u03b2-lactamase genes (conferring resistance to \u03b2-lactams) and those encoding multidrug resistance efflux pumps increased posttreatment (Fig. 3C).",

Interestingly, the exacerbation sample was closer to the disease state sample from patient CF7, whereas the posttreatment sample was similar to the posttreatment sample from patient CF6, who was an intermediate responder. This posttreatment community was characterized by C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, protein export, and selenocompound metabolism (Fig. 2). The C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism belongs to the carbohydrate metabolism superclass and is known to provide an alternative source of carbon and energy. A comparison of the top 20 representative metabolic pathways that differed between the two samples from patient CF8 (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) indicated that folate biosynthesis, glycan degradation, and naphthalene and dioxin degradation were responsible for distinguishing the metagenomes from these samples.",

The microbiome of patient CF6 was represented mainly by E. coli, R. mucilaginosa, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that of patient CF7 was represented by S. maltophilia, R. mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus spp., and that of patient CF8 was represented by P. aeruginosa and R. mucilaginosa. A previous study showed that lung bacteria are most likely acquired from a patient's living environment and that the microbial community fluctuates in respond to therapeutic perturbations (5). The results presented here are consistent with these previous findings and extend the list of microbes known to be associated with the CF lung. For example, patient CF8 had a high abundance of Lactobacillus spp., which are commonly found in the oral and gastrointestinal (GI) tract; its presence in the lung of immunocompromised individuals has been associated with life-threatening pulmonary cases (22). Lactobacillus rhamnosus can be introduced into the GI tract through the consumption of yogurt and other dairy products (23). Even though it is beneficial in most cases, it has also been associated with endocarditis (24), pulmonary abscess, and pleuritis (25). Lactobacillus casei was found to have a protective role in the lung of a mouse model during Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (26). In patient CF8, the presence of Lactobacillus spp. and the significant reduction of Streptococcus spp. following treatment may indicate a protective role for Lactobacillus spp. in Streptococcus infection. This is not surprising, as a small study by Bruzzese et al. (27) found that treatment with the probiotic L. rhamnosus strain GG decreased the level of intestinal inflammation markers and rectal nitric oxide production in children with CF compared to those in a placebo-controlled group. A separate study further showed that children with CF treated with L. rhamnosus GG showed a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations (28).",

The PCA of the top 20 most variable functions provided a preliminary view on the metabolic potentials associated with attack communities (Fig. 2, quadrants 1 and 3) and the metabolic potentials associated with climax communities that render them resistant to treatment and enable persistence through perturbations (Fig. 2, quadrants 2, 3, and 4). It is important to note that the groupings of these samples are not mutually exclusive. The positive loadings of the first and second principal components may represent metabolic potentials that are important for both recovery and response to treatment. The taxonomical and functional profiles of patient CF7 did not considerably change over time, which is consistent with this patient's unresponsiveness to treatment and his unchanged health status. This suggests the metabolic functions of the climax community were associated with persistence and that changes in the attack community were associated with exacerbation and decline in lung function.",

                    "text": "Of the many challenges facing the CF community, the evolution of antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing concerns. The presence of antibiotic resistance genes that encode resistance against major groups of antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, macrolides, \u03b2-lactamases, and fluoroquinolones) suggests these microbial communities may be capable of rapid genetic adaptation to resist perturbations and stresses imposed by treatment. This rapid adaptation is at least partially fueled by horizontal gene transfer via phages and plasmids. Active multidrug efflux mechanisms are known to be one of the major determinants of antibiotic resistance in many CF pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, and S. maltophilia (32,\u201334). Our data (Fig. 3A) support this observation, as >50% of the antibiotic resistance genes identified were predicted to encode efflux-mediated resistance mechanisms. \u03b2-Lactamase genes were the most abundant genes identified. Their high abundance in the viromes also suggested that phage-mediated spread of \u03b2-lactamases might occur within the community (Fig. 3C). Similar to P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia is highly resistant to antibiotics due to the presence of various intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms that include \u03b2-lactamases, penicillinase, cephalosporinase, aminoglycoside acetyl-transferase (aac), efflux pumps, and biofilm formation (35,\u201337). An up-to-date database containing comprehensive annotations for aminoglycoside and macrolide resistance mechanisms facilitated the detection of resistance genes present in the metagenomic data, especially across the S. maltophilia-rich microbiomes in patient CF7. With this manually curated database and data analysis framework, we have demonstrated the potential uses of metagenomics for identifying and monitoring of antibiotic resistance in clinical microbiology (17, 38).",

In several cases, microbial community members appeared to lose resistance to particular antibiotics, which was reflected in both clinical and metagenomic measurements. In the case of patient CF6, E. coli appeared to lose its resistance to tobramycin, and Streptococcus and Rothia were predicted to be less resistant to aminoglycosides and macrolides, respectively (Fig. 4). It remains to be determined whether these \u201closses\u201d are due to fluctuations in the number of cells sampled or that are truly present or to the transfer of these resistance genes between members of the microbial community. For example, a decrease in the number of Streptococcus cells sampled might explain the predicted loss in the presence of Streptococcus-associated antibiotic resistance genes in the later stable sample (time point D). But such a direct relationship does not explain the decrease in Rothia-associated macrolide resistance genes cooccurring with an increase in Rothia abundance. In this case, it is possible that these genes are monitoring a separate non-Rothia community member.",

Therefore, having information on the predicted resistance of the whole microbial community is perhaps one of the most useful pieces of information extracted from metagenome sequencing. If the lung metagenome of a patient suggests resistance to macrolides, despite his not having been prescribed such antibiotics, this can prove to be vital information for clinicians to prescribe the appropriate antibiotic therapy. Our data provide a minimal estimate of the resistance potential for the community, and additional sequence coverage can be used to identify resistance genes present at lower abundances. Such rare genes are also important because they might dominate as the community composition is altered by antibiotic treatment.",

Because this metagenomic approach is at an early stage of development, the numbers of patients (n = 3) and samples (10 sputum samples) presented in this study are relatively small due to the amount of effort required for each sample. This limited sampling restricts our ability to determine whether the observed fluctuations in community composition, metabolism, and antibiotic resistance truly occur over time or whether they are due to variability associated with sputum sampling, which may not consistently originate from the same region of the lung but from different regions that harbor their own persistent microbial communities. Although larger studies will be needed to sort out these matters, this study highlights some of the most important issues to be solved prior to the introduction of personalized metagenomics into the clinic setting.",

Washing and rinsing of the oral cavity using a sterile saline solution prior to sputum induction is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-recommended standard protocol for obtaining a minimally contaminated sputum sample (39). Previous studies showed significant evidence that induced CF sputum samples are strongly indicative of the lung environment and are only minimally contaminated with mouth microbes (40,\u201342). Although we cannot rule out that some of our sputum samples were contaminated with oral microbes, the presence of such microbes in the oral cavity suggests they too might colonize CF lungs and should therefore be considered members of the community. This is particularly important for tracking antibiotic resistance genes, because even if an oral microbe has little chance of surviving in the lung environment, its genes may be transferred to those microbes that thrive in the lung environment.",

This shotgun metagenomics approach not only provides accurate species-level (sometimes strain-level) taxonomic assignments, it also provides functional information at the gene level, e.g., the presence of potential antibiotic resistance genes and mutation-induced resistance mechanisms (38). In addition, the reconstruction of whole genomes is possible (43), and this can potentially provide important molecular information that is necessary for infection control (44). Validation and normalization of the metagenomic data also improves the quantification of microbes and the downstream clinical interpretation and therapeutic strategies. Other concerns and specific examples were reviewed in Dunne et al. (44). Sample preparation, methodology, and bioinformatics will continue to improve these efforts, eventually leading to real-time monitoring of microbial communities in CF patients.",

Nowadays, it is increasingly possible to complement this information with sequencing data. Real-time pathogen sequencing has been suggested as a way to help control pathogen outbreaks, as current methods are slow and offer limited resolutions (44). As a proof of principle, this study presents the value of coupling metagenomics with clinical findings, helping to move us closer to molecular diagnoses. Diagrams, such as those in Fig. 4 to \u200bto6,6, are instrumental in condensing vast amounts of data into clinically useful tools for tracking patient disease progression, corresponding treatments, and microbial community responses to those treatments.",

Such timely information will affect clinical management of CF patients. Of course, the quality of the data is very dependent on the choice of sequencing technology and the data analysis pipeline. However, the optimization of upstream robotics, the further development of bioinformatics tools, and increasing computing power will continually move the field toward this goal. Although the implementation of metagenomic analysis as a clinical diagnostic tool would be accompanied by the challenges of data interpretation by health care professionals, the consistency and accuracy of the technologies, and navigation of the complexities of administrative policy, we see invaluable therapeutic potential in the real-time monitoring of microbial communities and their capabilities to resist treatment efforts.",
