Periodontitis, a disease affecting about half of American adults, is associated with alterations in the subgingival microbiome of individual tooth sites. Although it can be treated, the disease can reoccur and may progress without symptoms. Without prognostic markers, follow-up examinations are required to assess reoccurrence and disease progression and to determine the need for additional treatments. To better identify and predict the disease progression, we aim to determine whether the subgingival microbiome can serve as a diagnosis and prognosis indicator. Using metagenomic shotgun sequencing, we characterized the dynamic changes in the subgingival microbiome in periodontitis patients before and after treatment at the same tooth sites. At the taxonomic composition level, the periodontitis-associated microorganisms were significantly shifted from highly correlated in the diseased state to poorly correlated after treatment, suggesting that coordinated interactions among the pathogenic microorganisms are essential to disease pathogenesis. At the functional level, we identified disease-associated pathways that were significantly altered in relative abundance in the two states. Furthermore, using the subgingival microbiome profile, we were able to classify the samples to their clinical states with an accuracy of 81.1%. Follow-up clinical examination of the sampled sites supported the predictive power of the microbiome profile on disease progression. Our study revealed the dynamic changes in the subgingival microbiome contributing to periodontitis and suggested potential clinical applications of monitoring the subgingival microbiome as an indicator in disease diagnosis and prognosis.",

This significant oral disease affects approximately 47% of American adults and more than 740 million people in the world with an increasing prevalence as people age (6, 7). Although not fatal, it can result in tooth loss and significantly reduce the quality of life. During disease onset and progression, pathogenic bacteria colonize the periodontal sulcus/pocket to form subgingival oral biofilms, which adhere primarily to the tooth root surface causing inflammation in the periodontal tissues (8). In the severe forms of the disease, destruction of periodontal tissues leads to progressive attachment loss, bone loss, and ultimately, tooth loss. Chronic periodontal disease infection elicits the host immune system to mount an inflammatory response, and the inflammatory response is associated with a number of systemic and chronic diseases (9). Although the disease can be treated, periodontal health needs to be continuously monitored after initial treatment and resolution of disease, because the disease may reoccur and progress without obvious symptoms in some individuals (10). Risk factors and clinical indicators for tooth loss, a surrogate marker of periodontal disease, have been suggested for prognostication (11, 12). The authors found that commonly used clinical parameters for predicting tooth loss were useful but did not adequately predict the relationship between initial findings and disease progression. With no reliable prognostic markers available to predict disease progression, identification of patients with treatment needs occurs only after tissue destruction is evident. Hence, development of effective prognostic tools is essential to identify those patients in need of close follow-up and treatment.",

The classic study by Socransky et al. revealed disease associations of specific bacterial organisms, including Porphyromonas, Treponema, and Tannerella, which were classified as the red complex organisms (13). Recent studies using 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis provided a more comprehensive view of the subgingival community in health and disease. By analyzing samples pooled from different tooth sites and/or individuals, several case-control studies revealed distinct differences in the taxonomic composition for healthy and diseased states (14,\u201317). Additionally, two longitudinal studies compared the taxonomic composition of the subgingival microbiome before and after treatment (18, 19). These two studies, albeit limited to two and four subjects, respectively, suggested an altered microbiome following treatment. Since periodontitis is a disease of individual subgingival pockets, the use of pooled samples in these previous studies provided an incomplete overall assessment that did not distinguish between the individual microbiomes represented by each affected site. Detailed knowledge of the dynamic changes in the microbiome within each pocket for different clinical states will be extremely useful in diagnosis and prognosis of individual tooth sites in clinical practice.",

Using a method similar to that of Schloissnig et al. (24), instead of analyzing only the 16S rRNA reads, we mapped all metagenomic shotgun sequence reads against our reference genome set. The taxonomic composition of the microbiome was determined based on the mapped reference genomes with a breadth of greater than 0.4. Additionally, as confirmation, we constructed full-length 16S rRNA clone libraries for 8 of the 48 samples and sequenced by the Sanger method (Text\u00a0S1\u00a0in the supplemental material). The taxonomic compositions determined by the three methods were highly consistent with each other (see Fig.\u00a0S2 in the supplemental material).",

We found that the microbial community evenness and richness (alpha diversity) significantly decreased after treatment (P < 0.029 [see Fig.\u00a0S3 in the supplemental material]). This is in agreement with the hypothesis that periodontal disease is associated with alterations of the complex microbial community rather than dominance of a single pathogen. This observation of decreased diversity in the resolved state is consistent with previous case-control studies where the microbiome in the naive healthy state had lower diversity than in the diseased state (14,\u201316).",

However, this trend is not observed for the resolved state (P = 0.17; Fig.\u00a02b), suggesting that health-associated subgingival microbiomes can be highly variable in composition even within the same individual. Diseased samples were more similar to each other than resolved samples in both intrapersonal comparison (P < 0.0002) and interpersonal comparison (P < 10\u221218; Fig.\u00a02b).

The subgingival microbiome was dominated by anaerobes in the diseased state and by facultatively anaerobic or aerobic organisms in the resolved state. Among the 38 bacterial genera, 8 were significantly more abundant in the diseased state (see Table\u00a0S1\u00a0in the supplemental material), including Porphyromonas, Treponema, and Tannerella, which are the major Gram-negative periodontal pathogens designated as the red complex by Socransky et al. (13). Additionally, Peptostreptococcus, Synergistes, Filifactor, Mycoplasma, and Olsenella were significantly more abundant in the diseased state. Peptostreptococcus is a member of the orange complex and is known as a potential pathogen associated with periodontitis (13). While Synergistes, Filifactor, Mycoplasma, and Olsenella were not part of the complexes classified by Socransky and coworkers (13), they were found to be associated with periodontitis in previous studies (14,\u201316). On the other hand, four genera were significantly more abundant in the resolved state, including representatives of the purple complex, Actinomyces, and the yellow complex, Streptococcus (13), as well as Rothia and Bergeyella. These four genera were previously found to be more abundant in healthy subgingival pockets than in diseased pockets in case-control studies (14,\u201316). Our longitudinal comparison between diseased and resolved states confirmed the previous findings in microbiome differences in healthy and diseased individuals, suggesting that the microbiome in the resolved state resembles the healthy state to a large extent. Consistent with previous studies, we showed that disease is associated with shifts of the complex microbial community rather than by a single pathogen.",

This is essential to understand the polymicrobial pathogenesis mechanism of the disease and to better predict disease progression based on the microbiome profile. Socransky et al. previously studied the cooccurrence of subgingival microorganisms in the diseased state based on the presence/absence patterns of a selected group of organisms in the plaque samples collected from periodontitis patients (13). Bik et al. reported the cooccurrence of subgingival microorganisms in healthy periodontium based on pooled samples from multiple tooth sites of 10 individuals (25).",

Using a method similar to Qin et al. (26), we constructed cooccurrence networks of the microorganisms in the diseased or resolved state based on the relative abundances of the major genera found in the samples. We found that the strength of the microbial cooccurrence was significantly greater for the diseased state than for the resolved state (P < 0.029 [see Fig.\u00a0S4 in the supplemental material]). In the diseased state, both disease- and health-associated organisms cooccur more often within each subnetwork than in the resolved state (Fig.\u00a04). This suggests that coordinated microbial interactions in early and late colonization are essential to disease pathogenesis (8). Six disease-associated genera, including the red complex organisms Porphyromonas, Treponema, and Tannerella (13), as well as Synergistes, Filifactor, and Mycoplasma, had higher relative abundances and were all highly correlated with each other in the diseased state, forming a subnetwork with fully connected topology. This result suggests that Synergistes, Filifactor, and Mycoplasma should be considered expanded members of the red complex. In the resolved state, the topology of the cooccurrence network was altered, and the number of connections among the organisms was significantly reduced. Not only were the relative abundances of red complex members reduced, they no longer correlated with each other. This suggests that the connections between these pathogenic organisms are disrupted after treatment. On the other hand, the relative abundances of health-associated organisms were increased than those in the diseased state. In both diseased and resolved states, the relative abundances of disease-associated organisms (red and orange complexes) did not correlate with health-associated organisms (yellow, green, and purple complexes), confirming the previous findings that an antagonistic relationship exists between the two groups of organisms regardless of the clinical state (27, 28).",

Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologous group annotation, we identified significant differences in the diseased and resolved states at the functional pathway level. Among the 90 bacterial pathways found in the microbiome, 24 were significantly overrepresented and 22 were significantly underrepresented in the diseased state (Fig.\u00a05). We observed that genes encoding components involved in flagellar assembly and bacterial chemotaxis, which are virulence factors in periodontitis (30, 31), were significantly more abundant in the diseased state. This is consistent with previous observations that flagellated motile species in the oral cavity, including Treponema, Selenomonas, and Campylobacter (32), were found associated with periodontitis. Chemotaxis-guided motility enhances the nutrient intake of pathogens favoring their growth and plays an important role in the colonization of pathogens by facilitating them to penetrate oral epithelial cells (30,\u201333). Additionally, we found that the disease-associated subgingival microbiome encodes more metabolic degradation processes than biosynthesis processes. For example, lysine degradation was significantly overrepresented in the diseased state, while lysine biosynthesis was significantly underrepresented. In the diseased state, disruptions of host tissues provide a different pool of nutrients than that of the healthy state, and thus, a microbial community with enhanced abilities to employ metabolic degradation processes may be selected. Taken together, our analysis suggests that the subgingival microorganisms change their relative abundances with altered functional potentials to adapt to the changes in the host environment.",

We applied a supervised classification method on our 48 longitudinal samples using a weighted gene-voting algorithm and leave-one-out cross-validation (34, 35). With the use of the clinically defined grouping, the classifier based on the microbiome profile correctly classified 33 of 39 assigned samples with a prediction strength of >0.3 (Fig.\u00a06b). Nine samples could not be assigned due to lower prediction strength. The number of correctly assigned samples based on the clinical grouping was significantly higher than those in 1,000 randomly permutated groupings (P = 0.022 [Fig.\u00a06a]). The clinical grouping had a significantly higher prediction accuracy (84.6%) among all permutated groupings (P = 0.04).

Three of the 12 patients recruited in our longitudinal study had a third visit to the clinic for routine periodontal maintenance. The previously sampled tooth sites in these three subjects (2 sites per patient) were examined again. This allowed us to determine whether our predictions of the clinical progression based on the microbiome profile at the resolved state (the second visit) were consistent with the clinical observations at the third visit. Compared to the clinical parameters obtained at the second and third visits, three of the six tooth sites remained healthy with no increases in pocket depth, two tooth sites progressed toward the diseased state with increased pocket depths (from 3\u00a0mm to 4\u00a0mm) but still were defined as resolved, and one tooth site became diseased with a pocket depth of 5\u00a0mm (Fig.\u00a06c). On the basis of the preceding microbiome profile at the second clinic visit, we were able to correctly predict the direction of the clinical progressions of all six sites. The three tooth sites that remained resolved at the third visit were predicted to be resolved (shown in green [Fig.\u00a06b]), and the tooth sites that progressed toward or became diseased were predicted to be between resolved and diseased states (shown in orange [Fig.\u00a06b]). This suggests that these three tooth sites had already shifted away from the resolved state at the second visit and moved toward the diseased state. This also suggests that the microbiome had already reflected the changes before clinical manifestation. Furthermore, we observed that individual sites from the same subject (subject 27) progressed in different directions (Fig.\u00a06c), further supporting the idea that periodontitis is a disease of individual sites and thus has strong associations with alterations of the microbiome in each distinct subgingival pocket. Although more samples need to be tested to confirm the predictive power, our ability to assess the risk of future disease progression of individual tooth sites based on the microbiome profile in these three cases (six sites) suggests that monitoring the microbiome of individual periodontal pockets could be useful for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and early intervention.",

However, the dynamic changes in the subgingival microbiome of individual tooth sites during disease development have not been well characterized. Most of the previous subgingival microbiota studies were performed using pooled plaque samples from multiple individuals or from multiple tooth sites of the same individuals. Intrapersonal variations of the subgingival microbiome were unknown and thus were not considered in evaluating the disease associations of the subgingival microbial community. Because individual tooth sites are likely to have independent clinical states and unique microbial communities in subgingival pockets, longitudinal examination of the microbiome at each individual tooth site during disease development is essential to understand the role of the oral microorganisms in disease pathogenesis.",

Such tools would allow early identification and early intervention, minimizing not only disease destruction but also the extent of treatment required while increasing predictability as well. In this study, we demonstrated that the functional composition of the subgingival microbiome shifted significantly from the diseased state to the resolved state (Fig.\u00a05). On the basis of the functional profile of the microbiome, we built a classifier, with which we were able to assign the clinical states of the sampled tooth sites with high accuracy (Fig.\u00a06). Furthermore, using the classifier, we were able to predict the disease progression of individual tooth sites. For the first time, we demonstrated potential applications of the subgingival microbiome analysis in periodontitis diagnosis and prognosis. This can give rise to potential future development of useful diagnostic and prognostic tools that enable more specific, individualized therapies, with better follow-up strategies, more effective treatment, and reduced cost for periodontal care.",

Subjects with a history of antibiotic treatment in the past 6\u00a0months, history of smoking, or diabetes were excluded from the study. For each patient, clinical parameters of the gingival index, recession of gums, attachment level, pocket depth, and bleeding on probing were measured for all sampled sites to assess the state of periodontal disease. Following a 24-h period of no oral hygiene, subgingival plaques were collected from two affected tooth sites per subject on average. The area to be sampled was isolated and dried, and the supragingival plaque was removed. The subgingival plaque samples were then collected using sterile curettes (Hu-Friedy Mfg. Co., Inc., Chicago, IL). The sampled plaques were suspended directly in ATL buffer (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) containing 0.1-mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) and immediately transported to the laboratory for further processing. Conventional initial periodontal therapy was subsequently conducted, including scaling and root planing (SRP), and oral hygiene instructions were given to the patients. The patients had a second clinic visit 4 to 19\u00a0weeks (on average 60\u00a0days) after completion of initial therapy. The same tooth sites were examined and resampled if the sites had resolved (presenting with a probing depth of \u22644\u00a0mm and without gingival inflammation). On average, the probing depth of sampled sites decreased from 6\u00a0mm prior to treatment to 3\u00a0mm at the second visit.

UBLAST in the USEARCH package was used (48). On average, 14.9% of the metagenomic shotgun sequencing reads can be assigned to KOs, and 99.8% of the assigned reads had the best hit on a unique KO. Read counts were normalized within each sample to represent the relative abundance of functional genes. The relative abundance of each functional pathway was calculated by summing all the functional genes involved in the functional pathway. Pathways with a relative abundance of >0.1% in samples from at least two subjects were chosen. To avoid overrepresentation, pathways with two or fewer KO genes identified were not counted.",
