Traditional culture based screening methods are often unable to identify bacteria from bronchoalveolar lavage samples. The advancement of next-generation sequencing technologies allows for a culture-independent molecular based analysis to determine the microbial composition in the lung of this patient population. For this study, the Ion Torrent PGM system was used to assess the microbial complexity of culture negative bronchoalveolar lavage samples. A group of samples were identified that all displayed high diversity and similar relative abundance of bacteria. This group consisted of Hydrogenophaga, unclassified Bacteroidetes, Pedobacter, Thauera, and Acinetobacter. These bacteria may be representative of a common non-pathogenic pulmonary microbiome associated within this population of patients.",

Bacteria found in the lungs can be classified into two categories: potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PMMs) and non-potentially pathogenic microorganisms (non-PMMs) which are sometimes referred to as \u201cnormal respiratory tract flora\u201d and are not typically associated with infections in non-immunocompromised individuals. Well-known pulmonary PMMs include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, Moraxella catarrhalis, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae. A few examples of non-PMMs include: Streptococcus viridans group, Candida spp., Corynebacterium spp., and Neisseria spp. [1].",

These studies have demonstrated that the lung microbiome varies between and within different stages of disease. For example, different microorganisms and levels of diversity are found in a patient whose asthma or COPD is stable versus those undergoing an acute exacerbation of the disease. This also holds true in patients with cystic fibrosis and HIV [3, 4]. For example, an increase in Proteobacteria within the pulmonary microbiome was found in HIV and asthma patients as compared to their respective controls [5, 6]. Several recent studies have examined the microbiome in patients that are intubated [7, 8]. Kelly et al. noted that microbial diversity was initially lower than healthy controls shortly after intubation. Additionally, microbial diversity decreased over the length of intubation [8].",

Subsequent investigations have shown that while microaspiration is normal in healthy individuals, bacteria do reside within the lungs [10, 11]. However, studies have also shown that there is overlap between the bacteria residing in the upper and lower respiratory tracts [11, 12]. Prevotella and Veillonella are two of the most common genera that reside in the lungs and nasopharynx [13]. Other common genera found within the lung microbiome include Haemophilus and Streptococcus [11].",

This is still the primary method of pathogen identification for pneumonia diagnosis in the clinical pathology lab. However, bacterial cultivation in a lab setting is sometimes difficult [14, 15]. This is especially true for pathogens such as Mycobacterium spp. or Mycoplasma spp. that display slow rates of growth or grow poorly on traditional differential media [16, 17]. One study reported that an etiologic agent could not be identified in approximately 46% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia [18], highlighting the inadequacy of current culture-based techniques in the diagnosis of pneumonia. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are particularly at increased risk for developing pneumonia [19]. Consequently, as part of the standard of care for ventilated patients, some hospitals screen bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples for infectious microbes. In this study, we utilize MPS to examine culture negative BAL samples from mechanically ventilated surgical patients. We report that a number of patients in this study with diverse underlying medical conditions were found to share a common lung microbial community composition. The results shed light on the composition of the lung microbiome in this patient cohort and highlight the potential for molecular based diagnostics for determining lung infections.",

BALs were collected using an unprotected BAL catheter in accordance with standard operating procedures developed by the large-scale collaborative project, \u201cInflammation and the Host Response to Injury\u201d [20]. As part of the standard of care, BALs are performed on patients that remain ventilated for over 36 hours (screening) or those with a Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) greater than or equal to 6 [21]. As part of a de-escalation antibiotic management clinical protocol, administration of antibiotics is stopped if the BAL culture results are negative. Subsequently, based upon this protocol culture negative BAL patients are clinically classified as patients with Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and not pneumonia. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and University of North Texas Health Science Center. Written consent for the BAL procedure was obtained by the practicing physician and documented in the patient\u2019s medical record.

The 25\u03bcl total volume reaction mix consisted of: 2.5\u03bcl 10x AccuPrime\u2122 PCR Buffer II, 1\u03bcl each of 10\u03bcM Ion Torrent specific barcoded Forward and Reverse Primer, 1\u03bcl 50mM MgSO4, 0.1\u03bcl AccuPrime\u2122 Taq Polymerase High Fidelity, with molecular grade water and template DNA making up the remaining 17.8\u03bcl. The reaction was amplified on a Bio-Rad C1000 thermocycler under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15s, 52\u00b0 C for 15s and 68\u00b0C for 20s before a final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5 min. The resulting ~350 bp fragments were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel with Ethidium Bromide. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample.",

The aligned sequences were further denoised using a precluster algorithm and screened for chimeras using UCHIME [23]. Sequences were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a cutoff of 97% similarity. Shannon diversity and Chao1 richness were calculated at the 97% similarity level. The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) was used to perform a taxonomic classification of sequences with a minimum 80% confidence [24]. The microbial communities among the BAL samples were compared using UniFrac analysis [25]. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean algorithm) based on both unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances were also conducted to display the relationship among the BAL samples. The UniFrac, PCoA and hierarchical cluster analysis were performed with the mothur pipeline [26].",

Fifteen unique patient samples previously determined to be culture negative were sequenced. Of the fifteen samples, fourteen did not grow bacteria by standard plating techniques at Parkland Hospital and results of the other sample was reported as normal \u201crespiratory tract flora\u201d (BAL133) (Table 1). A total of 1,227,232 sequences were used for taxonomic classification with a range of 29,880 to 143,487 sequences per sample (Table 3). Sequences were classified to the lowest taxonomic designation possible; most at the genus level. The relative abundance of bacteria by taxonomic classification level is detailed in Fig 1. Culture negative BAL samples were dominated by three phyla: Proteobacteria (46.98%), Firmicutes (19.14%), and Bacteroidetes (18.51%), In addition, Actinobacteria comprised a majority of BAL133 and smaller proportions of BALs 189, and 201(Fig 1A). Differences between individual samples were more apparent at genus level classification where Streptococcus, Hydrogenophaga, and Haemophilus were among the most common genera present in samples (Fig 1B). Most noteworthy was the observation that seven BAL samples (BALs 42, 69, 70, 186, 196, 197, and 209) were comprised of highly similar mixtures of bacterial genera including Hydrogenaphaga, unclassified Sphingobacteriales, unclassified Betaproteobacteria, unclassified Bacteroidetes, Pedobacter, Thauera, Haemophilus, and Actinobacter among others. These samples differed from the other eight samples in that they appeared to be less dominated by one or more potential pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs). Additionally, several of the BAL samples (BALs 69, 186 and 196) of this group received no antibiotics prior to collection of BAL fluid (Table 2).",

This common group exhibited higher diversity and contained many of the same microorganisms in similar proportions as indicated by UniFrac distance analysis. This group also had a reduced bacterial abundance as measured by 16S rRNA gene copies in each sample. Although some of the patients in this cohort were exhibiting signs of pneumonia at time of BAL, many of the samples in the common group were screening BALs (i.e. patients were not necessarily experiencing signs and symptoms of pneumonia at the time the BAL was performed) (Table 2). During the time of this study, screening BALs were performed as part of the standard of care at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Any patient who was on mechanical ventilation for over 72 hours received one every few days to preemptively screen for possible infection. Currently there are few published studies on the pulmonary microbiome in healthy individuals, and while the finding of Streptococcus spp. is consistent with other groups\u2019 findings, a majority of results reported here are unique [8, 9, 27, 28]. For example, some of the genera identified in large proportions by others are observed here at much lower levels. Additionally, Hydrogenophaga, Pedobacter and Thauera were identified, which have not been previously reported [28]. Differences in bacterial identification can be attributed to many factors including differences in DNA extraction techniques, sequencing platforms, primer/target selection, or potentially related to geographic location of patients (i.e. region of the U.S.). Further analysis will be required to determine the commonality of these bacterial groups among patients in other regions.",

The mean copy number of approximately 65,000 copies/\u03bcl measured here could indicate how many bacteria may be present in the core pulmonary microbiome. BALs 70 and 209 did, however, exhibit approximately ten times more 16S copies per microliter compared to the other 5 samples.

Several of the patients received no antibiotics prior to collection of the BAL (BAL 69, 186, and 196). These BAL samples were part of the common microbiome profile cluster identified in this study. Of these three, one patient (BAL69) had a subsequent BAL three days later which had 10,000 CFU of Staphylococcus aureus growth and some chest opacity (based upon chest X-ray) at the time of follow-up BAL. The other patients that did not receive antibiotics prior to BAL sampling showed no signs of pneumonia over their intubation. Patient BAL186 was intubated for over 2 weeks without a pneumonia ventilator event and patient BAL197 was extubated two days after initial BAL sampling. Other patient\u2019s samples that exhibited the common microbiome profile received varying doses of antibiotics prior to BAL. The group of patients with the common lung microbiome profile cluster had higher levels of diversity relative to samples that were not a part of this cluster.",

Different bacterial species possess varying numbers of 16S rRNA gene copies per genome (e.g. E. coli contains seven copies in its genome, while Streptococcus pneumoniae contains four, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae has only one copy) [29, 30]. However, with knowledge of the relative abundance and total 16S rRNA gene copy number, it is theoretically possible to calculate the true number of pathogens present within a sample, provided variability in sampling efficiency can be addressed. One possible means to address this would be to quantify the pathogen DNA using a target-specific gene marker, and normalize those data to results derived from a secondary control targeting a frequently occurring commensal microbe. However, much more research would be required to determine what commensal microbe(s) would serve as a suitable benchmark and how the abundance of these differ across patients and over time. Additionally, PCR-based techniques are generally limited in their ability to discriminate live bacterial cells from dead DNA fragments [31], although recent advances may allow for selective PCR amplification of viable cells[32].",

However, since the need for ventilation in this cohort was attributed primarily to traumatic injuries, it is reasonable to assume that the common microbiome identified here may be similar to that of a healthy individual. Given the sample size and diverse array of samples in the current study, we were unable to draw a conclusion regarding effects of antibiotics on the microbiome profile of the lung. The identification of a non-pathogenic pulmonary microbiome profile may assist in the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and allow clinicians to distinguish patients with a microbiome that would lead to the development of pneumonia versus those patients that do not require immediate treatment.",
