We sequenced the V3-V5 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in DNA derived from 631 sputum specimens collected from 111 CF patients over 10 years. We describe fluctuations in the relative abundances of typical CF pathogens, as well as anaerobic species, in relation to changes in patients\u2019 clinical state and lung disease stage. Both bacterial community diversity and the relative abundance of anaerobes increased during exacerbation of symptoms (prior to antibiotic treatment), although this trend was not observed uniformly across disease stages. Community diversity and the relative abundance of anaerobic species decreased during antibiotic treatment. These results support current hypotheses regarding the role of anaerobes in CF pulmonary exacerbations and lung disease progression.",

We recently described the bacterial communities found in a large set of CF sputum specimens by DNA sequencing, and compared these to the taxa reported in these same samples based on conventional CF sputum culture [5]. Not surprisingly, DNA sequencing analysis revealed diverse segments of these communities that were not reported by routine culture. The unreported fraction varied widely from sample to sample, both in terms of richness (the number of different taxa observed) and the relative abundances of the species present. How these variations in bacterial community structure relate to changes in patient clinical condition was not described in that report.",

Although these communities are not defined taxonomically per se, network analyses have shown that climax communities are comprised primarily of typical CF pathogens, while attack communities are associated with anaerobic species such as Prevotella, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, and microaerophilic Streptococcus spp. [7]. With the framework of the climax-attack model in mind, we investigated our data set with regard to the prevalence and relative abundances of typical CF pathogens and anaerobic genera in relation to patient clinical state. We also assessed bacterial community structures relative to patient lung disease stage and disease aggressiveness phenotype.",

These observations are consistent with recent CF airway community network analyses and support the climax-attack model of CF lung infection, which describes functionally distinct airway bacterial communities during periods of clinical stability and exacerbation [6]. The attack community consists of transient bacterial populations that induce strong host immune responses, while the climax community is more stable and relatively resistant to chronic host defenses and perturbation, such as that produced by antimicrobial therapy. This model predicts that with advancing disease, climax communities, composed primarily of typical CF pathogens, become increasingly prevalent. Their resistance to antibiotic perturbation is reflected in the less pronounced shifts in community structure we observed during advanced disease stage. Our data further support a model in which advanced stage climax communities are less susceptible to influence by an attack community at exacerbation, as evidenced by the relatively minor changes in anaerobe relative abundance we observed between baseline and exacerbation states during the advanced disease stage.",

During the course of CF lung disease, diversity decreases both in the short term with episodic antibiotic treatment, as well as in the longer-term with progressively declining lung function. This latter decline in diversity likely results from the accumulation of intensive antibiotic exposure associated with advancing lung disease [8,14]. Examining the relative abundance of anaerobes in the context of patient clinical state and disease stage in the current study, we similarly found that both antibiotic treatment of exacerbation (in the short term) and advancing lung disease (in the long term) drive the relationship between diversity and the proportion of the community comprised of anaerobes. That is, across the large sample set included in this study, anaerobic bacteria accounted for a smaller fraction of the community during antibiotic treatment and during the advanced stage of lung disease, contributing to the decrease in community diversity observed in both conditions.",

Based on a comparison of only intermediate stage samples, lung communities in patients with moderate or severe disease aggressiveness appear to lose the relative proportion of anaerobes earlier compared to communities of patients with a mild disease phenotype. Generalized estimating equation analysis highlighted the importance of the interaction between disease aggressiveness and age, wherein the decline in the proportion of anaerobes with advancing age was more pronounced for patients with a moderate or severe disease aggressiveness phenotype than for patients with a mild phenotype. In other words, while the FEV1 term included in the generalized estimating equation model represents lung function decline independent of age, the disease aggressiveness term adds another dimension by taking into account the age during which this decline occurred. These data expand observations made in our previous work [8], where patients with a progressive disease phenotype showed decreased diversity over time and eventual dominance by a typical CF pathogen, compared to patients with a mild disease phenotype, who maintained relatively diverse airway communities. That result was found to be driven primarily by antibiotic use, rather than age or lung function. We hypothesize a similar relationship exists for the data presented here, although we did not quantify antibiotic use in this study.",

We were unable to control for the distribution of clinical states among the available long-term samples, and as a result some patients\u2019 samples were strongly biased with regard to clinical state (B,E,T,R) categories. For example, all samples from two patients with mild disease aggressiveness were collected at baseline, while one patient with moderate disease aggressiveness had no samples collected at baseline. The makeup of samples also changed over time for some patients. As patients with more aggressive disease phenotypes are likely receiving more frequent antibiotic therapy (i.e., more treatment courses for pulmonary exacerbations), this suggests a greater impact of antibiotic treatment on bacterial communities in airways of these patients, although the influence of antibiotic type, route, and duration was not specifically assessed. Prospectively collected, high-resolution longitudinal sample sets will be needed to examine these factors in greater detail. and to determine if and how these features of lung communities can translate to patient care.",

These changes include an increase in the relative abundance of anaerobic bacteria at the time of exacerbation. It is important to note, however, that fluctuations in community structure and function occur both in the short-term, coincident with changes in patients\u2019 clinical state, as well as in the long-term, relative to advancing lung disease stage. Additionally, the nature of the short-term fluctuations in community structure occurring with changes in patients\u2019 clinical state differ by lung disease stage. That is, the fluctuation in community structure that occurs between baseline and exacerbation at early lung disease stage differs from that occurring between baseline and exacerbation at intermediate or advanced lung disease stage. Consequently, patient clinical state and disease stage must be taken into account in interpreting results of studies assessing CF airway communities. Our results also highlight the importance of disease aggressiveness and the utility of a long-term perspective. A better appreciation of community dynamics in the context of patients\u2019 health status is an important step in advancing our understanding of the role airway microbiota play in pulmonary exacerbations and disease progression in CF.",
