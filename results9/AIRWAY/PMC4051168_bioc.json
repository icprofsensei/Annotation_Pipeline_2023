The indigenous KhoeSan peoples of southern Africa are a collection of\nhunter-gatherer and pastoralist groups who speak \u201cclick languages\u201d,\nclassified into three distinct language families. The genetic diversity of these,\nand related populations, remains under-ascertained. The genome of one Tuu-speaking\nSan (\u201c!Gubi\u201d) has been fully sequenced and found to contain over 700,000\nnovel polymorphisms [15]. Gronau et al. showed that this San genome was highly divergent among\nknown genomes, even compared to other African individuals [16]. They estimated the population divergence between western African\nindividuals and the San to be about 110,000-130,000\u00a0years ago, over twice as\nold as the divergence between western Africans and Eurasians. Additionally, single\nnucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data demonstrated that the \u2260Khomani San\npopulation had the lowest levels of linkage disequilbrium (LD) of any population\nsurveyed and thus the largest effective population size [2].

[15]. We chose three populations of African ancestry for comparison: ASW,\nAfrican-Americans from the Southwestern United States; LWK, Luhya from Kenya;\nYRI, Yoruba from Nigeria; and GBR, from Great Britain to represent European\nancestry. Since the 1000G dataset contained many more individuals than our\nKhoeSan dataset, these populations were randomly down-sampled to 13 individuals\nfor comparison. We note that these disparate datasets were processed using\ndifferent pipelines, in some cases involving multiple-sample calling and\nimputation with a large number of other exomes, with varying degrees of coverage\nand sample relatedness. Between 28,000-29,000 variants appear to be common to\nall 5 populations (i.e. between 38%-53% are shared in each three-way comparison)\n(Figure\u00a03). The South African \u2260Khomani San\nappear comparable to the Yoruba and Luhya populations in terms of the number of\nprivate SNPs yet share slightly more variants with GBR than either other\nsub-Saharan African population. This reflects the degree of recent European\nadmixture in the \u2260Khomani. In order to compare two KhoeSan populations, we\nused 6 Namibian HGDP San exomes sequenced on the same Agilent Platform to\n>70x coverage [Martin et al, in preparation] and included African-Americans\nin an attempt to control for recent gene flow from Bantu-speaking and European\ngroups (Figure\u00a03C). The Namibian and South African\npopulations share only 4,692 unique variants that are not also found in the ASW.\nThis may reflect the small sample size, or that the KhoeSan populations in the\nnorth vs. south Kalahari remain highly differentiated [26,27]. Given the high concordance between our exome sequence data and the\nIllumina SNP array, we believe that the high genetic diversity of the South\nAfrican exomes is not an artifact caused by high false positive rates.",

We analyzed the three highly polymorphic HLA class\nI genes, HLA-A, -B and -C (6p21), and the\nKIR locus (19q13.4), which has variable content of four to thirteen\npolymorphic genes. Despite using a highly conservative strategy to remove\nread-pairs that did not map exclusively to one of the targeted loci, genotypes\nwere obtained for 4,070 HLA class I and KIR SNPs for the\nfifteen individuals studied (Tables\u00a02 and \u200band3,3, Additional file 1: Table S2,\nAdditional file 1: Table S3).

Moreover, all 39 discordant SNP genotypes from the two\nlow-coverage individuals (SA006 and SA0035) occurred in clusters of low read\ndepth where only one or neither allele was represented. Thus, following\nstringent filtering there were no false positive genotypes for any of the\nHLA class I or KIR SNPs.

To assess whether population\nstructure based on saliva microbiome diversity exists among the KhoeSan, we\nclustered individuals based on their phylum-, genus-, or species-level relative\nabundances. We find only moderate support for the existence of discrete clusters\namong the KhoeSan, with a maximum average silhouette width of 0.46 (genus-level\nclustering). Following [40], this suggests that saliva microbiome diversity varies among the\nKhoeSan along a gradient. We subjected the microbiome abundances of the KhoeSan\nsamples to Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to identify those taxonomic\ngroups that most strongly differentiate the samples along this gradient (i.e.,\nmaximum PCA loadings). At the phylum-level, KhoeSan saliva samples are\nprincipally separated by their relative composition of Proteobacteria,\nFirmicutes and Bacteroidetes (Additional file 1:\nFigure S9). The relative abundance of Neisseria,\nStreptococcus, Prevotella, and Veillonella primarily\ndifferentiate samples at the genus-level (Figure\u00a06A),\nwhile Rothia mucilaginosa, Neisseria subflava,\nVeillonella spp., and Streptococcus mitis are some of the\nmost variable species amongst the KhoeSan (Figure\u00a06B).",

This prior HMP work was conducted through analysis of small subunit\nribosomal RNA (i.e., 16S rRNA) gene sequences that were taxonomically annotated\nto the genus level. We used these sequences to calculate genus-level, genome\nlength-normalized relative abundances for each North American microbiome. We\nused the taxonomy associated with each genome in our fragment recruitment\ndatabase to calculate genus-level, length-normalized relative abundances for\neach KhoeSan microbiome. Comparing each population\u2019s median relative\nabundance for each genus, we find that most taxa exist at similar abundance\nlevels in the two populations (Spearman\u2019s rho\u2009=\u20090.91,\np-value\u2009<\u20092.2e-16). However, there are five genera that are\npresent in relatively high abundance (Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon rank sum\ntest p\u2009<\u20090.01) in the KhoeSan and effectively undetected among\nthe North Americans given the level of discovery in the HMP (Figure\u00a06C): Rothia, Granulicatella,\nHaemophilus, Eubacterium, and Filifactor. Most\nnotable among these is Rothia, which is the third most abundant genus\nin the KhoeSan and contains Rothia mucilaginosa, a known oral\nopportunistic pathogen that has been linked to systemic diseases [42,43].",

Comparatively few genomic sequences are publicly available (6\nindividuals total) from the KhoeSan, and ascertainment bias on many of the\nstandard SNP arrays may strongly skew estimates of genetic diversity in these\npopulations. We have generated 15 exomes and 2 genomes from the South African\n\u2260Khomani San greatly expanding the number of genomic sequences available.\nEstimates of genetic diversity from these South African individuals are\ncomparable to genetic diversity from the Yoruba from Nigeria or Luhya from Kenya\n(Figure\u00a03). While we do not find a higher number\nof private SNPs in the KhoeSan, this may be biased due to endogamy among the\n\u2260Khomani San and differences in coverage or SNP calling/imputation\npipelines between 1000 Genomes and our procedure (Figure\u00a01). Heterozygosity and singleton identification remain highly\nsensitive to coverage and calling pipelines thus making direct cross-study\ncomparisons difficult. However, for common SNPs, we show that the KhoeSan\nstrongly differentiate from all other human populations in structure analyses;\nthe KhoeSan and Europeans fall at opposite ends of the 1st principal\ncomponent, while western and eastern Africans fall at intermediate points on\nthis axis. Furthermore, we find substantial sub-structure among the South\nAfrican and Namibian KhoeSan, despite recent gene flow from Bantu-speaking\ngroups and Europeans into the \u2260Khomani, !Kung and Tuu populations.",

These differences in microbiome structure may be\ndue to differences in (1) the evolutionary history of the populations, (2)\ndemographics, or (3) host environment or lifestyle, including diet and access to\nhealth care. Given that we find many known pathogens among the most abundant\nmembers of the KhoeSan microbiome and that many of the differentially detected\ngenera contain known oral pathogens (e.g., Rothia,\nGranulicatella, Filifactor), we speculate that the\nrelatively limited access to dental care, antibiotics and/or absence of water\nfluoridation among the KhoeSan is driving most of the observed differences\nbetween populations. However, the biology of several of the differentially\nabundant genera is not well understood, especially in the context of the\ncommensal oral microbiome (e.g., Mobiluncus), or is principally limited\nto the pathogenic members of the genus; such genera may contain species that\nplayed an important role in the coevolution between the KhoeSan and their\nsalivary microbiome. This may include pathogenic organisms, such as\nAggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the causative agent of\nadolescent periodontal disease, which is common in those of African descent [50] and a member of a relatively abundant genus in the KhoeSan. Further\nstudy of the microbiomes associated with the KhoeSan and other diverse human\npopulations (e.g., [51]), the microbiomic differences between these populations (e.g., [52,53]), especially across a variety of host physiological conditions, and\nthe biology of commensal microbiota that are underrepresented in Western\npopulations is needed to comprehensively differentiate the sources of variations\nobserved between populations and to understand the coevolution between humans\nand their microbiome.",

Read-pairs\nhaving more than five bases of quality score \u22643 were removed (FASTX\nToolkit 0.0.13 [http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/]). The\nanalysis pipeline was designed to detect all known and any novel HLA class\nI and KIR SNP variants. Using Bowtie (version 0.12.7) [60] read-pairs were harvested by mapping with low-stringency to a given\nHLA or KIR gene (positive filter). To ensure specificity,\npairs that mapped to any homologous gene or pseudogene were removed (negative\nfilter). The remaining reads were then aligned to a final reference sequence and\nthe SNP variants ascertained using SAMtools/bcf. Data used to generate filters\nand reference sequences was obtained from the ImmunoPolymorphism Database and a\nset of fully-sequenced KIR haplotypes [61-63]. To accommodate the high divergence of HLA exons 2 and 3,\nthe final alignments were made to reference sequences matching individual\nHLA-A, -B and -C genotypes. HLA-A,\n-B and -C reference alleles were determined using\nbead-based sequence specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization and were\ndescribed in [2]. The \u201c-phase\u201d function of SAMtools was used to attribute\nphase for local alignments where possible due to the close proximity of exons\nand/or presence of highly heterozygous sequence (e.g. exons 2 and 3 of HLA\nclass I). Post-filtered read depth was used to determine presence or\nabsence of the variable-content KIR genes. The KIR genes\npresent and their alleles were determined for comparison of eight of the\nindividuals using pyrosequencing methods as previously described [64]. Individual SNP genotypes were confirmed visually from independent\nalignments of the filtered reads, which were created using MIRA 3 [65,66]. All newly-discovered variants were confirmed for sequence and phase\nusing standard Sanger sequencing plus one or more of pyrosequencing, DNA cloning\nor segregation in families.",

We then compared the remaining high-quality reads that did not map\nto the human genome to 1,285 genomes (Additional file 2: Table S4) obtained from the Joint Genomes Institute\u2019s\nIntegrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database [44]. In the case of species that have multiple genome-sequenced\nindividuals, we randomly selected a single individual genome to represent the\nspecies group. Each read was aligned to each genome using blast (blastall -p\nblastn -z 16300000000 -e 0.01 -m 8) and the resulting alignment summary\nstatistics were used to infer each read\u2019s taxonomy [45]. We explored several classification thresholds, including alignment\ne-value, alignment percent identity, and the ratio between the alignment length\nand the read length (i.e., coverage). We adopted several levels of threshold\nstringency to recruit reads to genomes for the purposes of inferring taxonomic\ndiversity. Our thresholds were similar to those used in Rusch et al.
