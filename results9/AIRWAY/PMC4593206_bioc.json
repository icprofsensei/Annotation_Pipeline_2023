This recent enthusiasm on dissecting the microbiome has been triggered by important technological advances, and findings supporting that dysbiosis of host-microbe interactions can affect a multitude of human physiological processes [1\u20133] with some of these interactions being causal [2, 4, 5]. However, our ability to taxonomically characterize the microbiota using sequencing data is still restricted by the lack of universally accepted similarity thresholds [6] and the differential discriminatory power of the nine 16S rRNA hypervariable regions (V1\u2013V9) [7] with no universally accepted region(s) [8]. A number of reports consistently support that amplification of non-representative genomic targets can heavily bias microbiome phylogenetic and diversity studies leading to inconclusive or inaccurate results [7, 9, 10]. Thus, evaluation of the diagnostic power of the targeted genetic markers is essential for accurate identification of specific microbiota.",

In addition, the clustering density and % PhiX used have an effect on the amount and quality of data generated. We have observed that with the MiSeq 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009300 v3 chemistry, lowering the final concentration of 16S sequencing libraries while maintaining a 20\u00a0% PhiX decreases the overall data output but increases the percentage of reverse reads with acceptable quality metrics (Q30>70\u00a0%, intensities \u2265200) and improves the paired-end merging rate. Thus, the final amount of merged paired-end data with acceptable quality is a composite of the number of samples multiplexed, final concentration of sequencing library, and % PhiX control used. The target depth of coverage depends highly on the specific goal of the microbial study. Deeper sequencing is normally required to capture rare taxa in bacterial consortia or to differentiate between similar environmental niches, whereas increasing the depth of coverage does not seem to benefit \u03b2-diversity analyses, and efforts should be focused on increasing the number of analyzed samples in these cases [16, 17].",

For the latter samples, we also recommend increasing the volume of \u201camplicon synthesis\u201d reactions to 100\u00a0\u03bcl (by quadrupling the volumes of required reagents for the first PCR amplification and bead-cleanup) to accurately capture the bacterial composition of these challenging samples.",

In our study, we used high-proofreading Taq polymerase, stringent quality filtering criteria, and operational taxonomic units (OTU) clustering at 97\u00a0% all shown to mitigate overestimation of microbial diversity [25, 26]. In addition, sequencing was based on Illumina chemistry accepted to have lower sequence errors than pyrosequencing, in which homopolymers are the major source of inaccuracy [27, 28]. To further alleviate concerns of PCR bias and sequencing error artificially inflating our diversity estimates and affecting disproportionally one of the tested hypervariable regions, we analyzed a total of eight technical replicates of the 16S V1\u2013V3 and V3\u2013V4 regions from a mock community with known species composition and abundances. Our evaluation was an analysis of qualitative and quantitative taxonomic composition to test if our method accurately measures true community composition while avoiding spurious additional OTUs. Given no experimental error, the observed proportion of OTUs per known bacterial species should align with the expected proportion of the mock community. Our results revealed that our experimental protocol accurately measures the bacterial diversity present in the mock community used (Table\u00a02) with the V1\u2013V3 offering the shortest distance from the expected relative species proportions (Fig.\u00a01).",

We first assigned OTUs to each of the 11 samples, using the closed-reference u-clust OTU picking protocol against the Greengenes and Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) core databases. OTUs were also picked with the de novo protocol using two different chimera-removal approaches. In all approaches, OTU picking was done at the species level using a 97\u00a0% sequence similarity level cutoff, after applying strict sequence quality filtering to improve taxonomic accuracy. All employed quality-filtering steps were intended to mitigate the negative effects of PCR-based artifacts and sequencing error on the estimation of population diversity and are integral for accurate dissection of microbial communities [29]. The final number of filtered OTUs obtained with the taxonomy-dependent Greengenes and HOMD approaches, and the de novo with uchime or ChimeraSlayer for the V1\u2013V3/V3\u2013V4 amplicons were 770/654, 543/469, 554/372, and 605/361, respectively. The alpha rarefaction plots generated with the filtered OTU tables from the above picking workflows are shown in Fig.\u00a02. For all OTU picking methods, the V1\u2013V3 tested amplicon captured greater phylotype richness than the V3\u2013V4 region, with V1\u2013V3 detecting 20 to 56\u00a0% more OTUs than V3\u2013V4 at the species level.",

Species evenness is the measure of biodiversity that quantifies how equal a community is numerically [31]. J takes values between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 representing more even quantities of the different species within a community. Overall, for all four OTU picking methods, V1\u2013V3 showed lower phylotype evenness than V3\u2013V4 although none of the pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. The t test P values for comparisons based on closed-reference against Greengenes, closed-reference against HOMD, de novo with uchime, and de novo with ChimeraSlayer OTU picking methods were 0.60, 0.36, 0.93, and 0.86, respectively. Although the relationship between species richness and evenness can vary in different ecological contexts and has been controversial in the field of ecology [32], more recent empirical studies have shown a significant negative relationship between these two components of diversity [33-35] in agreement with our findings.",

V1\u2013V3 data generated with this protocol was compared to V3\u2013V4 sequences generated from the same 11 subgingival plaque samples. Our results demonstrate that our experimental protocol accurately captures true community composition and that both tested amplicons provide an overall similar profiling of the human oral microbiota. However, V1\u2013V3 provides with greater phylotype richness and evenness than V3\u2013V4 and thus supports a more representative assessment of population diversity and community ecology for oral bacterial genera. This study provides researchers with valuable experimental insight for the selection of appropriate 16S rRNA amplicons for future human oral microbiome studies and underlines the key experimental and bioinformatics steps necessary for mitigating the effects of bacterial contamination, PCR-based artifacts, and Illumina sequencing error on sequenced-based microbiome analyses. We foresee that the developed workflow will be widely useful to the microbiome community for the high-throughput and accurate and efficient profiling of samples at a reasonable cost. This technology should prove especially useful for time-sensitive microbiome studies involving critical monitoring of environmental or clinical samples at single or multiple timepoints or for pilot microbial studies that could father larger investigations.",

The benefit of this de novo OTU picking method is that all reads are clustered and thus novel diversity can be detected. Cutoff thresholds were set to 97\u00a0% sequence similarity for species level assignment. Two different chimera identification methods were applied using QIIME version 1.8.0, namely uchime [50] as integrated in the usearch 6.1 [46] pipeline and ChimeraSlayer [51], to identify artifactual amplified sequences originating from multiple parental sequences. PyNAST [52] was used to align representative sequences as input for ChimeraSlayer. The latter uses BLAST [53] to identify potential chimera parents and computes the optimal branching alignment of the query against these two parents. Representative OTUs picked with the de novo protocols were assigned taxonomy using BLAST [53] against the Greengenes (version 13_8) core database and taxonomy. Following, OTU tables representing sample by observation matrices were generated and spurious OTUs (represented by less than 10 sequences) were discarded as a second level of quality filtering. OTUs from clinical samples were aligned using PyNAST [52] against the Greengenes (version 13_8) core database [47], and multiple sequence alignments were used for phylogenetic reconstruction using FastTree [54].",

Sequence sampling was repeated 10 times for each sample size. Results were plotted as alpha rarefaction plots in QIIME version 1.8.0 using the \u201cobserved number of OTUs\u201d metric, to compare true species richness of bacterial communities associated with the two amplicons. Species richness is the measure of \u03b1-diversity that is concerned only with the number of species present in a community and not their relative abundance. Taxa summaries were generated for OTUs picked with the closed-reference and de novo protocols using QIIME version 1.8.0 to obtain the relative sample taxonomic abundance at multiple taxonomic levels. Pielou\u2019s index J [30] was estimated independently for all generated taxa summaries at the species level using the \u201cevenness\u201d [31] R package to evaluate species evenness detected by the V1\u2013V3 and V3\u2013V4 regions.

Three dimensional principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) [58] plots were generated using the \u03b2-diversity distance matrices by running the principal_coordinates.py script in QIIME. Procrustes transformations (using the script transform_coordinate_matrices.py) [38] were applied in QIIME to compare the compositional structure across the eleven clinical samples with two PCoA plots as input; one built from 16S rRNA V1\u2013V3 sequence data and the other from V3\u2013V4 data. P values for Procrustes transformations were generated using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations by comparing the measure of fit, M2, between matched-sample PCoA plots and the empirically determined distribution of M2 values. Because M2 values depend on sample size and data structure, only the generated P values were used to compare the Procrustes plots [59]. Results were visualized using Emperor [60] in QIIME (make_emperor.py, \u2212c/ --compare_plots option). Both sets of coordinates were plotted in the same figure, with corresponding points from each tested amplicon connected with red (V1\u2013V3) and blue (V3\u2013V4) lines.",
