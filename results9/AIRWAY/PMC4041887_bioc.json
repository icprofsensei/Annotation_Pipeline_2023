To investigate changes in the microbiome associated with oral cancers, we profiled cancers and anatomically matched contralateral normal tissue from the same patient by sequencing 16S rDNA hypervariable region amplicons. In cancer samples from both a discovery and a subsequent confirmation cohort, abundance of Firmicutes (especially Streptococcus) and Actinobacteria (especially Rothia) was significantly decreased relative to contralateral normal samples from the same patient. Significant decreases in abundance of these phyla were observed for pre-cancers, but not when comparing samples from contralateral sites (tongue and floor of mouth) from healthy individuals. Weighted UniFrac principal coordinates analysis based on 12 taxa separated most cancers from other samples with greatest separation of node positive cases. These studies begin to develop a framework for exploiting the oral microbiome for monitoring oral cancer development, progression and recurrence.",

The five-year survival, at 40% has not improved in the past 40 years, and it is one of the lowest of the major cancer sites, resulting in more people dying from oral cancer than melanoma, cervical or ovarian cancer in the USA. Worldwide there are 350,000\u2013400,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Unlike most other anatomic sites, which have decreased in cancer incidence, the incidence of oral cancer is increasing, particularly among young people and women [1], [2]. The major risk factors, tobacco and alcohol use, cannot explain the changes in incidence, because oral cancer also commonly occurs in patients without a history of tobacco or alcohol exposure [3]. Recently, human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as an etiologic agent for oropharyngeal cancer, but HPV infection is not a significant contributor to oral cancer, as the virus is rarely found in these cancers (2\u20134% of cases) [4]. Thus, contributions from other, possibly environmental factors remain to be found.",

It is reasonable to ask, therefore, if shifts in the composition of the normal oral cavity microbiome, comprised of more than 600 different bacterial species [9] and/or chronic bacterial infection could be promoters or causes of oral cancer. Indeed, changes in the microbial community are commonly associated with dental diseases such as periodontal disease, which is most likely a polymicrobial disease characterized by outgrowth of certain pathologic organisms [10], and chronic periodontitis has been reported to be a risk factor for oral premalignant lesions and cancers [11]. Elevated levels and changes in the composition of bacterial and fungal microbiota of the oral cavity have been reported in association with oral pre-cancers and cancers [12]. There is, however, no consensus amongst reports regarding cancer-associated changes in the oral microbiome. This confusion may have arisen because early studies were limited to analysis of the relatively small numbers of known and cultivable oral bacterial species [13], [14], and later studies using molecular methods focused on particular phyla [15] or cloned and sequenced small numbers of clones per sample [16], [17].",

Such studies of the oral microbiome [16], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28] reveal, on the one hand, that the healthy oral microbiome is characterized by a relatively small number of bacterial phyla (9\u201313), the most commonly reported abundant phyla being Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria\n[16], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. On the other hand, the majority of inter-individual variation has been attributed to diversity at the species or strain level [24]. Streptococcus is most often observed to be the dominant genus in the healthy oral microbiome, and less frequently Prevotella, Veillonella, Neisseria, and Haemophilus dominate an individual's oral microbiome [19], [24]. Variation is also observed in the microbial community composition of biofilms at each intraoral habitat (e.g., tooth surface, lateral and dorsal tongue, etc.), most likely reflecting the different surface properties and microenvironments [21], [24].",

In addition, high recurrence rates and prevalence of second primary oral cancers support the proposal that these cancers develop out of a field of genetically altered cells, the concept of \u201cfield cancerization\u201d [29]. Such fields have been reported to extend as much as 7 cm from a tumor and to appear clinically normal [30]. For these reasons, we investigated the oral cancer associated microbiome by non-invasively sampling the cancer lesion and an anatomically matched contralateral region of normal tissue from each individual. We subjected DNA isolated from these samples to 16S ribosomal subunit amplification and sequencing. The aim of these studies was to begin to lay a foundation that would allow exploitation of the oral microbiome for treatment and monitoring of oral cancer initiation, progression and recurrence.",

Using the Roche GS Junior instrument to perform pyrosequencing, we obtained, in a single run, a total of 104,380 sequences from amplicons that spanned the V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S small ribosomal subunit (Table S7). The number of raw sequence reads varied by >10-fold across samples, ranging from 1,231 to a maximum of 17,682 raw reads. Quality filtered sequences were searched against the Greengenes reference database of 16S sequences, clustered at 97%, and Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were assigned taxonomic classification using mothur's Bayesian classifier. Of the 92,987 sequences that passed quality filtering, 81,308 were similar to known bacteria and most could be classified to the genus level (65,037) with fewer classified at the species level (17,115). Sequence coverage was variable across samples; the number of reads per sample assigned to OTUs (excluding those filtered due to poor quality or lack of a related sequence in the Greengenes reference database) ranged from 1,038 to a maximum of 14,359, and comprised 76\u201385% of raw sequences (Table S7). A total of 276 OTUs were identified (per sample range, 37\u2013161, (Table S8). Rarefaction analysis performed at the family level demonstrated a fairly wide range of \u03b1 diversity with the number of detected families ranging from \u223c15\u201328 (Figure S1a). Three patient samples, normal and cancer from patient 117 and the normal sample from patient 142, plateaued at fewer families than the other samples, indicating somewhat reduced diversity in these samples. All samples plateaued to some extent, though not entirely; further sequencing would likely reveal additional families. On the other hand, pyrosequencing noise and PCR errors could erroneously increase OTU numbers [31]. A similar effect was seen at the genus level (Figure S1b).",

The majority belonged to one of five phyla (99.2%, normal, 98.0% cancers) with the more abundant phyla being Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria (Table 7, Figure 1). Although the distribution in cancer and clinically normal samples of these five common phyla varied amongst individuals (Figure 1), in all patients, we observed a significant reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in cancer compared to the anatomically matched contralateral clinically normal patient sample, (p\u200a=\u200a0.004, FDR adjusted p\u200a=\u200a0.02 and p\u200a=\u200a0.028, FDR adjusted p\u200a=\u200a0.07, respectively). We also observed that the proportion of Fusobacteria was increased in all patients, but the change in abundance did not reach statistical significance (p\u200a=\u200a0.074, Figure 2). We note, however, that to observe consistent changes in abundance of the three phyla in this small cohort is highly significant. Ignoring interactions among the relative abundances of different phyla, a binomial test yields p\u200a=\u200a0.0022 as the probability (under the null hypothesis) of having three or more phyla where (all five patients share an increase) or (all five share a decrease).",

As before, we swabbed both the lesion (cancer or pre-cancer) and a contralateral anatomically clinically normal matched site. We swabbed the left and right sides of the lateral tongue and floor of mouth of the healthy individuals. Using the Illumina MiSeq instrument, we sequenced amplicons spanning the 16S rDNA V4 hypervariable region. We obtained 4,486,196 raw sequence reads with a range of 31,109 to 125,847 reads per sample after excluding two samples that failed in sequencing (Tables S9 \u2013 S13). We assigned taxonomic classification to the OTUs as before. Of the sequences that passed quality filtering, 4,444,432 were similar to known bacteria and most could be classified to the genus level (4,148,785) with fewer classified at the species level (1,650,037). We identified a total of 2,107 OTUs (per sample range, 90\u2013482, Tables S9 \u2013 S13). Rarefaction analysis demonstrated a fairly wide range of \u03b1 diversity with almost all samples plateauing to some extent (Figure S2). As discussed above, sequencing noise and PCR errors may increase OTU numbers [32].",

We then considered the Confirmation Cohort comprised only of samples from cancer patients not included in the Discovery Cohort, i.e., we excluded the nine Discovery cohort samples (Table 2, Table S9). We again found that the majority of OTUs (61\u2013100%) belonged to one of the five more abundant phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria) (Figure 3a, Table S14). We then asked if there were significant reductions in the abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in cancer compared to the anatomically matched contralateral clinically normal patient sample. Indeed, as we had observed in the Discovery cohort (Study 1), there was a significant reduction in abundance of these two phyla in cancers compared to the anatomically matched contralateral clinically normal patient samples (p\u200a=\u200a0.042 and p\u200a=\u200a0.004, respectively), confirming our initial observations (Figure 3b, Figure S4).",

We again asked if significant reductions in abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria might also be present when comparing pre-cancers and anatomically matched contralateral clinically normal patient samples. We did find that abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria was reduced (p\u200a=\u200a0.048 and p\u200a=\u200a0.037, respectively), suggesting that changes in abundance of these two phyla may occur early (Figure 3b). By contrast, we did not find significant differences in abundance of these two phyla or any of the five more abundant phyla when comparing the left and right sides of the lateral tongue and floor of mouth of healthy normal individuals (Figure 3b).",

We normalized the number of OTUs to one million counts, (Table S15) and for each phylum, we determined changes in abundance of the genera that represented >10% of OTUs in more than 20% of samples (Figure S5 and S6). Significant reduction in abundance was observed for Streptococcus (p\u200a=\u200a0.003) and Rothia (p\u200a=\u200a0.021) in cancers relative to anatomically matched clinically normal samples (Table S16). By contrast, we observed increased abundance of Fusobacterium (p\u200a=\u200a0.044) relative to matched clinically normal samples from the cancer patients. In pre-cancers, we observed significantly reduced abundance of Streptococcus (p\u200a=\u200a0.042) (Table S16). We found no significant differences in abundance of these more common genera when comparing abundance in samples taken from the left and right sides of the lateral tongue and floor of mouth of healthy individuals (Table S16).",

Prevotella species, in particular, differed and included, for example, OTUs corresponding to P. intermedia, P. melaninogenica, P. nanceiensis, P. oris, P. tannerae and unclassified species (Figure S5, Table S15). Elevated levels of P. melaninogenica have been reported previously as a potential salivary biomarker of oral cancer [33] and P. intermedia is a periodontal pathogen [34]. Further studies will be required to understand the contributions of general (Bacteroidetes) and lesion-specific changes (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) in the microbiome of oral cancer and pre-cancer patients.",

Considering cancer/normal paired samples, we identified 11 OTUs from the phyla Actinobacteria (Actinomyces and Rothia, 2 OTUs from each genus) and Firmicutes (Streptococcus, 7 OTUs) that were significantly decreased in cancers and one OTU from the phylum Fusobacteria (Fusobacterium) that was increased in cancers compared to anatomically matched contralateral normal patient samples (Table S17). Weighted UniFrac principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on this set of OTUs separated most cancers from normal and pre-cancer samples with five of the seven lymph node positive cases forming a tight cluster in the lower right corner of the plot (Figure 4). Metastasis to the cervical (neck) lymph nodes is a major determinant of oral cancer patient survival [35]. The current lack of reliable methods to assess risk of metastasis results in patients being routinely subjected to additional surgery to remove the lymph nodes, even though the majority will not benefit from the procedure. The tight clustering of samples from node positive patients in Figure 4 suggests that shifts in the composition of the oral cancer microbiome may also hold promise as a tumor associated biomarker of risk of metastasis.",

When considering the three sample groups (Cancers, Healthy Normals, and Pre-cancers), we observed significant microbiome differences for patient identity based on both weighted UniFrac (abundance) and Unweighted UniFrac (presence/absence) metrics (Table S19, Figures S7 and S8). No other comparisons, such as left vs. right, number of sequences or lesion (cancer or pre-cancer) vs. control normal sites revealed significant differences. These observations are consistent with other studies that have highlighted the inter-individual differences in the oral microbiome [24]. Further, they support our study design, which measures changes in the microbiome within individuals, i.e., using each patient as his or her own control.",

Comparison of the composition of the microbial communities within patients identified changes in abundance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. We confirmed these observations in a second Confirmation Cohort (Study 2) and further found significant changes in the abundance of the Actinobacteria genus Rothia and the Firmicutes genus Streptococcus when considering all cancers in Study 2 (Table S16). Although we did not see a significant change in abundance of the phylum Fusobacteria in either the Discovery or Confirmation Cohorts, we did find a significant increase in abundance of the Fusobacteria genus, Fusobacterium when considering all cancer patients in Study 2. We note that while the cohorts of patients studied here are small and heterogeneous, our findings regarding abundance of phyla are similar to published studies, which focused on comprehensive analysis of the oral microbiome. Moreover, the use of different sequencing technologies to measure the abundance of 16S rDNA amplicons in Studies 1 and 2 supports the robustness of our observations. Nevertheless, further larger studies should help to better define the oral cancer associated changes in abundance of these phyla and genera. Moreover, we observed changes in abundance of Firmicutes (Streptococcus) in association with oral pre-cancers, suggesting that oral lesion associated shifts in the composition of the microbial community may occur early in oral cancer development and/or herald cancer progression.",

Studies have established that smoking impacts the composition of the bacterial communities in the oral cavity, including, for example, the salivary microbiome of healthy smokers and non-smokers [36] and the subgingival microbiomes of patients with periodontal disease [37], as well as the formation of plaque biofilms [38]. In our study, we found no evidence of overall differences in the microbiomes that could be attributed to smoking, but with only three current smokers and four non-smokers in our cancer patient cohorts for example, we cannot draw any conclusions at this time. On the one hand, because we used each patient as his/her own control, we would not expect to see smoking associated differences in abundance of microbiota associated with cancer, since smoking would affect both the control site and the cancer. On the other hand, in smokers, cells at the clinically normal sites and the cancers my respond differently to smoking induced changes in biofilm formation, for example, raising the possibility that while cancer associated changes in the abundance of microbiota in smokers and non-smokers appear similar, the formation and functional consequences of the altered microbiomes may differ in these patient groups. Similar considerations could apply to immunosuppressed individuals.",

It is, however, difficult to make comparisons even amongst two recent studies reporting abundance of bacteria [16], [17] and this study, because of differences in (a) sample type (swab, this study vs. tissue sample [16], [17]), (b) oral cavity site, (c) source of patient matched normal control samples (anatomically matched contralateral clinically normal, this study, upper aerodigestive tract mucosae [16], adjacent normal [17]), (d) amplified region of the 16S ribosomal gene (V4, this study, V4-V5 [16] or V1-V4 [17]), (e) methodology (Sanger [16], [17] vs. pyrosequencing or MiSeq, this study), and (f) number of clones or sequence reads assigned to OTUs per sample (average 8000 and 55,000 reads per sample, Study 1 and 2, respectively, compared to \u223c90 or \u223c250 clones per sample [16], [17]). For example, Pushalkar and colleagues [16] reporting on 10 patients found that 75 and 80% of clones (normal and cancer, respectively) were assigned to the phylum Firmicutes. This proportion is not only higher than the 40\u20130% reported in other studies of the oral cavity of healthy or cancer patients, but since only \u223c90 clones were sequenced per sample, there are too few clones to reliably determine relative abundance of other phyla for comparisons. A phylum level analysis of only the 16 tongue, floor of mouth and oral cavity cancers reported by Bebek and colleagues [17], however, revealed cancer associated increase in abundance of the phylum Fusobacteria, consistent with our observations, but decreased abundance of Streptococcus could not be seen, as few clones were assigned to this genus.",

Further, it is unclear how to weigh the potential contributions from changes in abundant genera such as Streptococcus compared to the less abundant Actinobacteria genera. Potential roles for bacteria and fungi in cancer promotion include generation of carcinogenic substances, such as nitrosamine or other pro-carcinogenic chemicals, chronic inflammation and direct effects on signaling in epithelial cells resulting in enhanced proliferation or suppression of apoptosis [6], [7], [12], [39]. Only a minority of the oral microbial community can adhere to hard and soft oral tissues, and assembly of the complex oral biofilm is accomplished by subsequent adherence of secondary colonizers. Streptococcus is an early colonizer and Fusobacterium (e.g., F. nucleatum) has a propensity for co-aggregation with many genera, forming a bridge between early and late colonizers in the oral biofilm [40]. Thus, on the one hand, the observed decrease in prevalence of Streptococcus and increased abundance of Fusobacterium genera in pre-cancers could reflect the altered surface properties of the cancer cells and stroma, which might no longer support adhesion of streptococci. On the other hand, we can hypothesize that shifts in abundance of these two genera could result in an enhanced pro-inflammatory environment, since Streptococcus species have been reported to attenuate Fusobacterium nucleatum induced pro-inflammatory responses of oral epithelial cells [41], [42]. We also note that Fusobacterium nucleatum grown as a biofilm is capable of invading organotypic cultures [43], and secondly, that the organism has recently been reported in colon cancers [44], [45], further supporting a potential role in oral cancer.",

                    "text": "The oral cavity offers a relatively unique opportunity to screen at risk individuals for (oral) cancer, because the lesions can be seen, and as we report here, the shift in the microbiome of the cancer and pre-cancer lesions compared to anatomically matched clinically normal tissue from the same individual can be detected in non-invasively collected swab samples. Saliva is another non-invasively collected oral sample composed largely of bacterial cells, but also shed epithelial and immune cells. A variety of \u201comics\u201d biomarkers in saliva have been proposed for use in diagnosis of oral cancer, including metabolites, proteins, transcribed genes, miRNAs, genome alterations and epigenomic changes, as well as the microbiome [16], [46], [47], [48], [49]. For the microbiome, however, saliva may not be optimal. Saliva bathes the entire oral cavity, resulting in a loss of information on the subsite specific composition of bacterial communities. Moreover, with saliva, there is no possibility to use each individual as his or her own control, and so account for the substantial variation in the oral microbiome amongst individuals.",

                    "text": "Non-invasively sampling the microbiome of oral lesions and corresponding normal tissue opens the possibility to not only detect cancer-associated changes at one time point, but the relative stability of the adult oral microbiome [25], [28], [50] also offers the opportunity to monitor shifts in bacterial communities over time. Here we observed changes in the microbiome, which, in future larger studies, may be confirmed as a potential biomarker of oral cancers or pre-cancers, and may even have utility to discriminate patients with lymph node metastases (Figure 4). In addition, there are other challenges in clinical management of oral cancers and pre-cancers that would benefit from better diagnostic tools. Most oral cancers are preceded by oral epithelial dysplasia (pre-cancer), a lesion, which unpredictably transforms to cancer. Oral cancer patients are also at risk of second primary cancers and recurrences. The microbiome may provide signatures that can be used as a biomarker for (a) progression of pre-cancers to cancer, (b) distinguishing oral cancer subtypes, (c) monitoring field changes associated with the high rate of second primary oral cancers and recurrences, and (d) predicting clinical behavior such as metastasis (Figure 4). We also highlight the possibility of medically modulating the oral microbiome for treatment of oral pre-cancers and damaged fields (field cancerization).",

To obtain a summary statistic representing the overall dissimilarity between any two microbial communities in this study, we used the phylogenetically aware dissimilarity measures Unweighted UniFrac [57] and Weighted UniFrac [58]. Because some OTUs are closely related, while others are more distantly related, these two community-wide dissimilarity measures provide a more informative assessment of community resemblance than a more naive approach of e.g., counting shared OTUs between communities. Unweighted UniFrac considers only presence/absence of taxa and counts the fraction of the branch length unique to either community. In weighted UniFrac, the branch distance is weighted by difference in abundance. In both cases, the result is a scalar measure of dissimilarity between each pair of communities in this study, and is based on the information contained in the OTU table as well as the phylogeny relating the OTUs. We used the supplied Greengenes phylogeny (which is a curated version of a FastTree constructed phylogeny built from full length Greengenes 16S/SSU sequences). Because these measures are sensitive to differences in sequencing depth amongst samples, we randomly selected 1,038 (Study 1) or 31,109 (Study 2) sequences from each sample (subsampled dataset), and generated the distance matrix by a pair-wise inter-comparison of the profiles in the subsampled dataset. We used PCoA to compare samples based on the Unweighted and Weighted UniFrac distances.
