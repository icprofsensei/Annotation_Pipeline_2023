This is in part because longitudinal study of the airway microbiota in children is challenging due to the difficulties in obtaining repeated lower airway samples. Most children cannot spontaneously expectorate and obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) frequently is neither ethical nor feasible. In the only two longitudinal studies of the infant lower airway microbiota reported to date, BALF was collected infrequently (at most every 6 months)[5,6] thus limiting the utility of BALF to track concurrent changes in the microbiota with symptoms. Nasopharyngeal sampling has also been used to track monthly changes in the airway microbiota in infants[7\u20139], but this has been shown to be a poor surrogate for the lower airway microbiota[10]. Thus, there is a need to identify a reliable surrogate for lower airway sampling which can be collected frequently and is well tolerated by children.",

Block designs were used for paired comparisons between samples from the same patient. The Bray-Curtis index measures dissimilarity between two samples by estimating the number of shared organisms from the total number of organisms present in both samples; the higher the Bray Curtis dissimilarity score, the greater the difference between two samples. The UniFrac score is a qualitative measure of the phylogenetic distance between two communities, with the weighted UniFrac score additionally accounting for the relative abundance of organisms within these samples. Quantitative measures of beta diversity, such as Bray Curtis dissimilarity and weighted UniFrac scores, provide information on community differences due to the relative abundance of species. The UniFrac score provides information on community differences driven by selective pressures on the community[17].",

Other significant variables, but similarly of more minor influence, included the use of prophylactic antibiotics and nebulized antibiotics. Patient age was not a significant influence on community structure.",

This could suggest overgrowth of an organism in an individual sample, or low biomass in that sample allowing artificial dominance of an organism. Quantitative PCR was not performed as part of this study and may have helped determine whether low biomass contributed to this observation. Therefore, where samples are dominated by an individual genus, the results should be treated with caution and repeat upper airway sampling paired with culture dependent microbiology is wise. Upper airway samples may therefore fail to detect dominant pathogens in the lower airways and vice versa, limiting clinical use in an individual child but also a consideration for the design of research studies.",

Similarly, Marsh et al.[25] compared upper airway samples (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) with BALF sampled from a single lobe and found upper airway samples were a reliable surrogate in 69% of children with either idiopathic bronchiectasis, protracted bacterial bronchitis or healthy airways. Our current study we believe is the first to compare the microbiota using both TS and CS and lower airways samples in young children with CSLD (CF or PCD) and non-CSLD controls (mainly recurrent LRTI), which is representative of the pathologies frequently encountered in Paediatric Respiratory Medicine.
