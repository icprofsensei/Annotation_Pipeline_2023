Although the high-throughput nature of such methods enables the detection of low-frequency bacteria, these advances come at the cost of sequencing read length, limiting the phylogenetic resolution possible by current methods. Here, we present a generic approach for integrating short reads from large genomic regions, thus enabling phylogenetic resolution far exceeding current methods. The approach is based on a mapping to a statistical model that is later solved as a constrained optimization problem. We demonstrate the utility of this method by analyzing human saliva and Drosophila samples, using Illumina single-end sequencing of a 750 bp amplicon of the 16S rRNA gene. Phylogenetic resolution is significantly extended while reducing the number of falsely detected bacteria, as compared with standard single-region Roche 454 Pyrosequencing. Our approach can be seamlessly applied to simultaneous sequencing of multiple genes providing a higher resolution view of the composition and activity of complex microbial communities.",

                    "text": "Several methods have been recently suggested for addressing the limitation of phylogenetic resolution (18\u201320). Fan et al. showed that stringent de novo assembly of 16S derived reads from Roche 454 metagenomic sequencing overcomes PCR amplification bias and detects bacteria up to the genus level while maintaining a low level of chimera formation. Alternatively, Miller et al. suggested EMIRGE, an iterative read mapping approach for short paired-end Illumina reads. By probabilistic mapping of short reads to a candidate set of 16S sequences and applying an expectation maximization algorithm, EMIRGE has been shown to identify sequences present in mixtures containing tens of species with genus level resolution. However, both methods are currently limited to analyzing a contiguous region of DNA. In (20), both EMIRGE and an alternative approach, modQIIME, were applied to analyze a 16S region of length 700\u20131000 bp. The modQIIME approach uses the taxonomical assignment of each paired-end short fragment read to identify bacteria present in a mixture up to the species level. Recall and precision values of EMIRGE and modQIIME varied both across tested data sets and also depending on whether genus or sequence level profiling was required. An alternative approach for integrating whole genome metagenomic reads is applied by PhylOTU (21) that maps reads into a phylogenetic tree and estimates pairwise distances between OTUs. While this approach enables downstream sample analysis such as unifrac (22), it does not provide direct classification of bacteria in the sample.",

Unlike de novo assembly methods, we rely on a database of bacterial sequences and assume that sequences of most bacteria in the mixture are represented in this database. Our general formulation of microbial profiling as a linear optimization problem (Figure 2) enables us to expand the analyzed region without the need of longer reads. Each of the millions of reads measured by MPS, together with all \u2018absent\u2019 reads that were not found, set constraints that enable \u2018zooming in\u2019 on the correct species present in the mixture. Theoretical analysis of COMPASS provides sufficient conditions on performance in the limit of infinite number of reads, and bounds on reconstruction error in case of finite reads (23). By design, COMPASS is completely agnostic to chimeric reads, and is robust to read errors. Analyzing a long region reduces the number of false positive sequences since differences among sequences become more significant, hence the probability that read errors would cause false-positive detection is decreased. In addition, while this article presents an application of COMPASS to the 16S case, it can be seamlessly extended to simultaneous sequencing of multiple and not necessarily overlapping regions of a number of genomic regions, provided a rich enough database of known sequences is available.\n",

These may be multiple (consecutive or nonconsecutive) regions of the 16S or multiple regions from several genes. Since COMPASS can only detect bacterial sequences present in this ad hoc database, the leading principle in choosing the regions is the wealth of the databases and high sequence diversity at these regions. More specifically, since step (ii) involves PCR amplification of the predefined regions it should maximize the number of unique sequences over the amplicon. For this reason, the current application of COMPASS to the 16S used highly universal primers predicted to amplify \u223c330 000 sequences from the original 16S database used (72% of sequences in the original database, described in a following section), corresponding to \u223c231 000 unique sequences of \u223c750 bp (covering four variable regions V3\u2013V6, see Figure 1A). In comparison, primer pairs that amplify the V3 region (24) would amplify \u223c380 000 sequences from the same database, but would result in only 95 000 unique sequences. Also, on the other length extreme, although a single primer pair designed to amplify the whole 16S gene would generate a longer amplicon, it may suffer from the limitation of potentially amplifying a smaller fraction of bacteria (e.g. the primers E8-E1492 (25) amplify <10% of the sequences in the database), and hence, we preferred the >750 bp long region.",

We then collect all sequences whose frequencies were found to be above a threshold of 0.1% in all blocks (hence promoting a sparse solution); these form a reduced problem S', for which we repeat the procedure. These iterations, which keep reducing the database size, are performed until the number of sequences in the reduced database falls below the block size.

Second, in the more probable scenario, errors cause reads not to be mapped to any row in A at all, resulting in loss of information. The former case cannot be recovered since such reads appear errorless. However, since the total number of reads is large, read errors that happen to create \u2018legitimate' k-mers are negligible.

This, however, greatly increases (the already huge) size of A, hence further increasing COMPASS\u2019s computational complexity. We therefore applied the following approximation: whenever a read is not mapped to any k-mer we map it to its nearest possible rows in A, namely all k-mers with Hamming distance 1, and modify the vector y accordingly. This approximation effectively uses the information obtained from reads with up to a single base substitution error, which would otherwise be lost. The effect of applying this procedure is shown in Supplementary Figure S8.

Several measures of similarity between microbial profiles based on species similarity (22) or combined species similarity and frequency (27,28) have been previously suggested. However, we opted for an alternative measure that provides a more intuitive score while combing sequence and frequency similarities. We defined \u2018weighted recall\u2019 and \u2018weighted precision\u2019, which quantify false-positive and false-negative predictions, respectively. Intuitively, \u2018weighted recall\u2019 corresponds to the probability of correctly reconstructing a randomly selected sequence from the original mixture, with respect to both sequence and frequency. Similarly \u2018weighted precision\u2019 corresponds to the probability that a randomly selected sequence from the reconstructed set is correct in its sequence and frequency.",

The average region length was 292 bp, and we truncated all sequences to a length of 280 bp (deleting the 98 sequences whose length was shorter). The 16S-V4 method was compared with COMPASS in our toy mixture example and in our wide scale in silico simulations. In the toy mixture example, we provided the phylogenetic resolution given by the 16S-V4, namely the number of 16S sequences that share the same 280 bp of the 16S-V4. In our in silico simulations, we estimated weighted precision and recall of 16S-V4 results in the following way. For each bacterium in the simulated mixture, we located the group of bacteria that share the same sequence over V4 (the group can be of size 1 in cases the V4 region uniquely identifies the original bacterium). We then chose the \u2018reconstructed' sequence by randomly selecting a bacterium from each group of each of the \u2018true' bacteria. We calculated weighted precision and recall based on the sequence similarity criterion [criterion (i)] described above for COMPASS, while ignoring the frequency criterion [criterion (ii)].

Increasing read length to 200 nt or increasing the number of bacteria to 1000 increased running time to 24 and 35 h, respectively. Given the limited effect of read errors, the correction procedure for unmapped reads may be ignored, without significant loss in performance (see Supplementary Figure S8).

However, in case sequencing results contain a large number of read errors and correction is required, one can simply use a larger number of CPUs to reduce run time.",

The reduced number of unique sequences with respect to the full 16S database results from the fact that not all sequences have the primers' binding region and, more importantly, that many potentially amplified sequences share the same sequence over the specific amplicon (i.e. phylogenetic resolution is limited). The primers selected for Illumina sequencing produce an amplicon of \u223c750 bp (covering variable regions V3\u2013V6) and correspond to 231 299 unique sequences. The primers used for the Roche 454 sequencing produce an amplicon of \u223c450 bp (covering variable regions V3\u2013V4) and correspond to 176 674 unique sequences. We used the same forward primer for Illumina and Roche 454 to allow further comparison between SRF and COMPASS. We refer to the Illumina case as the \u2018750 database', while the Roche 454 database is termed \u2018350 database' since analysis of the Roche 454 data used only the first 350 bp to decrease the effect of read errors.",

In the second analysis method, we applied MG-RAST (32). Apart from strain-level classification, which is too coarse and does not allow for direct comparison with COMPASS, MG-RAST provides for each read the best hit in the database according on its internal pipeline (MG-RAST also enables selecting Greengenes as its baseline database). Hence, bacterial abundance was estimated by the fraction of reads that were mapped to the best hit. There were cases in which MG-RAST similarity search provided multiple same-scoring hits to the same read.

Different coverage is observed at different positions along the sequence due to nonuniform fractionation of the 16S DNA and systematic Illumina biases in amplifying different DNA regions, even when sequencing a single bacterium. For example, for reads originating from both the forward and reverse strands in Drosophila sample L1, Supplementary Figure S11A shows high coverage variability as a function of position along the 16S sequence (the mean per-nucleotide coverage varies \u223c1.8-fold across the sequenced region). We refer to this as \u2018global' coverage-variability pattern. In addition, high \u2018local' variability is observed, namely coverage varies significantly even between adjacent locations. This contradicts the COMPASS implicit assumption that the number of reads of each k-mer of a specific bacterium linearly depend on its frequency. Violation of this assumption results in increased noise and potential degradation in performance. To deal with unequal coverage, we performed both preprocessing and postprocessing steps described below.",

In case of low-coverage, L2 norm tends to \u2018divide' the reads among several low-frequency sequences (i.e. database entries), rather than keeping a single high-frequency sequence.

A larger number of such sequences and low similarity values correspond to lower phylogenetic resolution. For 10 out of 11 bacteria, 16S-V4 displays lower phylogenetic resolution than COMPASS. Namely, while COMPASS identified the exact full 16S gene sequence of each of these bacteria, the 16S-V4 can only provide a larger \u2018group' of equally likely sequences whose similarity to the correct sequence ranges between 0.71 and 0.95 even when using an infinite number of errorless reads. For example, E. coli str. K-12 sub strain MG1655 belongs to a \u2018group' of 1539 bacteria having an identical V4 region. The median (minimal) sequence similarity along the 16S gene between the correct sequence and the other 1538 sequences in the group is \u223c0.88 (0.71) displaying reduced phylogenetic resolution. Therefore, e.g. 16S-V4 can not differentiate between E. coli str. K-12 substrain MG1655 and E. coli NMU-ST2 although their similarity is only \u223c79%.",

We aimed at providing a biologically relevant measure that would combine sequence and frequency predictions in an intuitive way. We defined \u2018weighted recall\u2019 and \u2018weighted precision\u2019, which quantify false-positive and false-negative predictions, respectively. Briefly, \u2018weighted recall\u2019 of 95% means that there is 0.95 probability that a bacterium randomly selected from the simulated mixture is identified by COMPASS with zero mismatches and also its inferred frequency is close enough to its simulated frequency (weighted precision quantifies false negatives in a similar way, see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section). To allow for less stringent criterion, we also display performance in case that up to 2% (i.e. \u223c30 nt of the \u223c1500 bases of the 16S) mismatch in sequence is allowed and refer to this as the \u2018MM 2%\u2019 case, as opposed to the former \u2018MM 0%\u2019 case. Each point in the results presents the average and standard deviation based on simulating 100 realizations of bacterial mixtures. For example, the default setting displays a level of 93% in both weighted recall and precision for \u2018MM 0%\u2019, while for \u2018MM 2%\u2019 weighted recall is 95% and weighted precision is 98%.",

Reconstruction error rate was almost constant for up to n = 800 bacteria, but increased substantially for larger numbers due to the predefined threshold in COMPASS for the frequency of \u2018interesting' bacteria (0.1%, see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section). The error at a level for 1000 bacteria increased mainly due to increase in weighted recall, while weighted precision retains a level of 80%. This indicates that even in this case, COMPASS still almost exclusively finds correct bacteria, although the number of missed bacteria grows. The minimal frequency threshold (0.1%) was chosen to enable faster running times, and can be changed in case detection of low frequencies is required.",

The EMIRGE results, with and without enforcing the frequencies criterion, appear in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, respectively (A comparison with 16S-V4 is less relevant since we consider an infinite number of reads and assume that read length covers the whole region). The lower performance of EMIRGE, with respect to COMPASS probably corresponds to the fact that EMIRGE was optimized for other purposes, for example, using paired-end reads. Additionally, COMPASS and 16S-V4 have an inherent advantage over EMIRGE under the conditions mentioned above, since all simulated sequences were drawn from the Greengenes database later used by the algorithms. EMIRGE, which does not directly rely on a specific database, tends to find novel species and therefore performance deteriorates.

Following DNA extraction, we PCR amplified and sequenced a 450 bp region by Roche 454 Pyrosequencing as an example of SRF. COMPASS was based on a 750 bp region that was PCR amplified and subjected to sonication before sequencing by an Illumina HiSeq2000 using 100 nt single-end reads. The 750 bp amplicon included the 450 bp region (aligned with the start of the sequence), thus supporting comparison of the two methods. Sequencing results were analyzed using COMPASS for Illumina sequencing, with several modifications applied to the basic COMPASS algorithm to overcome experimental biases as described in the \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section. For the SRF method, the Roche 454 reads were truncated to the first 350 nt to reduce the effect of read errors, and then analyzed by two methods. The first method mapped each to the database using BLAST, and thus we refer to its results as \u2018454-BLAST'. In the second method, reads were analyzed by MG-RAST (32).",

Phylogenetic trees of the sequences found by each method are shown on the top and left parts of the figure, for 454-BLAST and COMPASS, respectively. Each tree leaf is termed a \u2018group' as it may represent several 16S sequences that share the same sequence over the 350 bp or 750 bp amplicon. The central matrix compares the results of the two methods, showing the Hamming distance between pairs of sequences (calculated over the overlapping region). The comparison shows a high agreement between the two methods, as evident from the matrix, detecting the same four main clusters of bacteria (Wolbachia, Lactobacillus, Acetobacter and \u2018Other' which comprised mostly Pseudomonas). A closer look into the matrix shows that 22 out of the 23 sequences found by COMPASS had counterparts found by 454-BLAST: 14 out of 23 sequences found by COMPASS had identical counterparts in the 454-BLAST method (namely the overlapping 350 bp region matches completely), while the other eight sequences differed by up to 4 nt. The COMPASS sequence that was not found by 454-BLAST was, however, found by MG-RAST together with all other COMPASS sequences; 454-BLAST found 39 bacteria, many of which are false positives, as shown in the next section. A single bacterium found by 454-BLAST, which had frequency of \u223c0.1%, was later validated and not found by COMPASS.",

Following PCR amplification using each of these primers, the resulting product was sequenced using Sanger sequencing, thus allowing efficient detection of low abundance bacteria in these genera (as opposed to the more labor-intensive cloning and sequencing approach). Since different bacteria are present in the mixture, each chromatogram is expected to display more than a single peak at some locations, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figure S6 (the primers were designed to amplify highly similar bacteria, and therefore the number of such locations is limited). Therefore, we collected all possible base calls for each location along the Sanger sequence and compared it with sequences found by 454-BLAST, MG-RAST and COMPASS. A predicted sequence was termed \u2018Sanger validated' if its sequence matched the base calls along the Sanger sequence. A prediction is termed a false positive in case a sequence's nucleotide differs from the Sanger base calls in at least one location. For completeness, we used in silico PCR to check all sequences, which were neither detected by COMPASS nor by 454-BLAST/MG-RAST, but may have potentially been amplified by the relevant primer pair. None of these sequences were \u2018Sanger-validated', and hence no \u2018false negatives' occurred for both Acetobacter and Wolbachia. A cartoon of the procedure appears in Supplementary Figure S6.",

This demonstrates the correctness of COMPASS predictions together with its improved phylogenetic resolution, namely instead of 11 indistinguishable bacteria in the 454-BLAST case, COMPASS correctly ruled out 8 bacteria. The chromatogram showed that mismatches between these 8 bacterial sequences and the Sanger sequence occurred outside the Roche 454 amplicon (See Supplementary Figure S7), indicating that lower resolution of 454-BLAST is an inherent result of its short amplicon.",

The 454-BLAST predicted the existence of five groups, W3\u2013W7 (total frequency of 1.3%), in addition to group W1, which were all false positives. In both cases, these incorrect predictions are probably due to read errors that were mapped to bacterial sequences in the database, since mismatches were found within the Illumina/Roche 454\u2013amplified regions (See Supplementary Figure S7). However, 454-BLAST found 17 incorrect bacteria, with much higher relative abundance, compared with the single false positive in COMPASS, suggesting that 454-BLAST is more prone to such read errors than COMPASS.",

Since ribosomal RNAs constitute a large fraction of total RNA produced, in many experimental cases a large fraction of the reads originate from the 16S gene, even without prior PCR amplification. Since 16S RNA-seq reads originate from random locations along the 16S, typical SRF methods can only use a small fraction of the reads originating from a single region. In contrast, COMPASS integrates all available reads and produces a coherent snapshot of bacterial metabolic activity. Unlike de novo assembly based methods, COMPASS can also seamlessly integrate reads from noncontiguous regions or multiple genes, thus can also be applied to databases such as MLST (36) or Ribosomal MLST (37) to further increase phylogenetic resolution. Such multigene integration of information will remain important also in case the future MPS read length would be larger. An application of COMPASS to whole-genome sequencing is in principle possible, and would become increasingly beneficial as more and more bacteria are sequenced.",
