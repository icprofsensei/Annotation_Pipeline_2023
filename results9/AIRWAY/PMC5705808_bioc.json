Therefore, the purpose of this observational study was to evaluate simultaneous longitudinal changes in the oral microbiome and cytokine production in the developing peri-implant sulcus compared to control natural teeth. Four and 12 weeks after implant placement and abutment connection, a dental implant and a natural tooth were sampled in 25 patients for subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF [around teeth] and peri-implant crevicular fluid [PICF] around implants). DNA from plaque samples was extracted and sequenced using Illumina-based 16S rRNA sequencing. GCF and PICF samples were analyzed using a customized Milliplex human cytokine and chemokine magnetic bead panel. Beta diversity analysis revealed that natural teeth and implants had similar subgingival microbiomes, while teeth had greater alpha diversity than implants. At the genus level, however, few differences were noted between teeth and dental implants over 12 weeks. Specifically, Actinomyces and Selenomonas were significantly elevated around teeth versus dental implants at both 4 weeks and 12 weeks, while Corynebacterium and Campylobacter were significantly elevated only at 4 weeks around teeth. The only difference between PICF and GCF biomarkers was significantly elevated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels around teeth versus dental implants at the 4-week visit. The subgingival microbiome and cytokine production were similar between teeth and implants during early healing, suggesting that these profiles are driven by the patient following dental implant placement and are not determined by anatomical niche.",

However, little is known regarding initial colonization of the subgingival microbiome and simultaneous longitudinal cytokine production in humans during the early healing phase following implant placement. We report findings from an in vivo study that assessed initial colonization of the subgingival microbiome and concomitant early cytokine production in a newly formed anatomical space, namely, an implant sulcus. This approach may be useful in future interventional studies to influence dental implant success. Our data showed that the subgingival microbiome and cytokine profile were similar for control natural teeth and dental implants at both 4 and 12 weeks after implant placement. These data suggest that these profiles are driven by the patient and not by anatomical location (i.e., tooth versus dental implant).",

It is estimated that two to four million implants will be placed into individuals annually in the United States by 2020 (1). Due to the rising trend of implant placement for the management of partially edentulous patients, complications associated with bone loss surrounding dental implants have become more prevalent (1). However, little is known about the initial development and longitudinal progression of the peri-implant subgingival microbiome (2). Past studies examining the initial subgingival colonization patterns following dental implant placement have utilized DNA-DNA hybridization (2, 3) to investigate the differences in select bacterial species in periodontal and peri-implant pockets. Hybridization methods, as well as traditional methods for microbial detection, including bacterial culturing techniques, are hindered by the limited number of bacterial species that can be sampled for testing (4).",

Specifically, the new sulcus that forms is initially free of bacteria or, as described by Quirynen et al. (2), a \u201cpristine\u201d pocket is formed. As such, recently placed dental implants provide a unique opportunity to study initial subgingival colonization. Using Illumina-based 16S rRNA sequencing, the current study compared the composition of the subgingival microbiome around newly placed dental implants with that from nearby control teeth. The results showed that the microbiomes in both locations were similar as early as 4 weeks after implant placement. However, two indicators of microbiome diversity, richness and evenness, were decreased around dental implants compared to control teeth. Likewise, cytokine production was generally comparable around newly placed dental implants and control teeth, suggesting that the host responses to the subgingival microbiota were similar at these two sites.",

Furthermore, Prevotella and Neisseria were also among the most common taxa observed both around implants and control teeth. These OTUs were likewise dominant in implant samples, as previously described by Zheng et al. (9) using similar sequencing methods. In contrast, Schaumann et al. (10) reported that Rothia, Streptococcus, and Porphyromonas were the most abundant taxa in the implant subgingival microbiome, while Prevotella, Streptococcus, and TG5 were the predominant subgingival microbiota around teeth. However, direct comparisons between dental implant microbiome studies are very difficult due to the different microbial analysis methods used, nonstandardized study designs, various patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, and unspecified implant history with respect to when implants were placed prior to the beginning of the study (11).",

It is possible that the lower microbial diversity around dental implants in our observational study was due to the short-term follow-up after implant placement. However, in each of the above-referenced publications, although the number of years since implant placement was unknown, the implants were not newly placed and the microbial diversity was significantly lower in the subgingival environment around implants than around teeth. Comparing specific taxa between implants and teeth in our study, there were few differences in genera between implants and teeth at either 4 or 12 weeks. At 4 weeks, Corynebacterium, Actinomyces, Selenomonas, and Campylobacter were elevated around teeth versus implants. At 12 weeks, only Actinomyces and Selenomonas were more abundant around teeth. It is possible that, with further maturation of the subgingival microbiota, even these remaining differences would dissipate over time, resulting in further convergence of the microbiomes.",

However, saliva is a likely reservoir and conduit to transport microorganisms from the rest of the dentition and from nondental sites such as the tongue, buccal mucosa, and tonsils. It is interesting to note that all study participants rinsed with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate twice daily for 1 week following implant surgery. Chlorhexidine gluconate has been shown to significantly reduce supragingival dental plaque formation, even in the absence of brushing (15). However, rinsing with chlorhexidine likely does not result in this medicament reaching the subgingival environment. Furthermore, chlorhexidine gluconate rinsing does not eliminate supragingival plaque formation (15). Therefore, this postoperative regimen does not prevent transfer of microorganisms from other oral and dental sites.",

However, we noted elevated GM-CSF levels in the crevicular fluid around teeth versus dental implants at 4 weeks. GM-CSF is known to recruit circulating neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes (16). In the current study, control teeth sites were scaled subgingivally at the baseline dental implant placement appointment. The patients in our study refrained from brushing the newly placed dental implants and control teeth for 1 week, although the participants used, as mentioned above, a plaque-reducing mouth rinse during that time frame. It is quite likely that recolonization of the subgingival microbiota at these control tooth sites triggered a localized host response, resulting in elevated GM-CSF to recruit inflammatory cells.",

At day 21, IL-1\u03b2, GM-CSF, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) were significantly higher in GCF than PICF. Although in our study, we did not observe differences in IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 between GCF and PICF samples, the patient populations and study designs were different in the studies, as noted above. It is possible that no other cytokine or chemokine differences were observed for dental implants and control teeth in our study due to the timing or frequency of crevicular fluid sample collection, as our sampling may have missed transient increases or decreases in cytokine levels.",

The study duration was only 12 weeks because the plan was for patients to proceed with implant restoration shortly thereafter, which would have likely influenced the subgingival microenvironment. However, regarding fluctuations in the oral microbiome over time, recent evidence indicates that 83% of oral microbial samples taken a year after initial sampling could be confidently traced back to the source subject; indeed, phylogenetic diversity remained relatively stable over time within individuals over 1 year compared to interindividual variation (26). However, strengths of our study include evaluation of the entire subgingival microbiome rather than targeted organisms and simultaneous evaluation of a panel of cytokines. Indeed, to our knowledge, this is the first study to examine both the subgingival microbiota and host response during early dental implant healing. In addition, we propose that this novel experimental approach can be used as a human in vivo model for other investigations of initial subgingival colonization and early cytokine production in a newly formed anatomical space, namely, an implant sulcus.",

Next, 750 \u03bcl of lysis buffer and 20 mg/ml of lysozyme were added to the tubes, and the samples were then transferred into bead beating tubes containing 300 mg of disruption beads (0.1 mm; Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL).

Five hundred microliters of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added to each tube, and the samples were homogenized using a mini-bead beater (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) for 2 min at high speed. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min, and the top aqueous layer was extracted.

Overnight ethanol precipitation was used to recover DNA, and the DNA pellets were dissolved in 100-\u03bcl portions of Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM; pH 8.0).

Barcodes were attached to the 806R primers, and 2 \u00d7 250 reads were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq system. Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) was used to analyze the microbial community (36). Briefly, sequences were demultiplexed, and barcodes were removed prior to analysis. The sequences were checked for quality using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and sequences with a phred score of less than 20 were trimmed with TrimGalore (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/). Sequences with a maximum length of 255 bp were merged using PANDAseq (37) with a threshold score of 0.9. Reads with ambiguous nucleotides were removed during the merge. Using subsampled open reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking in QIIME (38), the sequences were first referenced at a 97% similarity against the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD 16S rRNA RefSeq V13.2). Sequences that did not hit the database were clustered into OTUs at a 97% sequence similarity using Uclust, followed by PyNAST alignment. Taxonomy was assigned using QIIME\u2019s Uclust-based Consensus Taxonomy Assigner. In QIIME, ChimeraSlayer was used to check for chimeric sequences after OTU picking. QIIME was subsequently used to analyze both alpha and beta diversities of the oral microbial community. Specifically, Shannon index, Simpson index, Chao1 richness estimator, and the number of observed OTUs were used to determine alpha diversity, while beta diversity was visualized using principal-component analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis distance (36).",
