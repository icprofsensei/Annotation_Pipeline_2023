To assess TLR2 function, epithelia pre-treated with cytokines \u00b1 dex were exposed to the TLR2/TLR1 ligand Pam3CSK4 for 24 hours. While cells pre-treated with cytokines alone exhibited significantly enhanced IL-8 and CCL20 secretion following Pam3CSK4, mean IL-8 and CCL20 release decreased in Pam3CSK4 stimulated cells following cytokines + dex pre-treatment. This marked increase in inflammatory gene expression seen after treatment with cytokines followed by the TLR2 ligand did not correlate well with NF-\u03baB, Stat1, or p38 MAP kinase pathway activation. Cytokines also enhanced TLR2 agonist-induced beta-defensin 2 mRNA expression and increased the antimicrobial activity of airway surface liquid. Dex blocked these effects.",

This mucosal surface is a site of first contact with the environment and has evolved many mechanisms to recognize and respond to inhaled or aspirated microorganisms. Epithelial responses to microbes are initiated via pattern recognition receptors including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [1]. TLRs are a family of 10 receptors in humans that recognize a variety of microbial molecular patterns and regulate immune responses. Airway epithelial cell responses to a number of TLRs, including TLR2 [2-4], TLR3 [5], TLR4 [6], TLR5 [7,8], and TLRs 6 through 9 [9,10] have been investigated in human cells and animal models. TLR activation initiates signaling that culminates in a number of host defense responses including the secretion of antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, and chemokines by epithelial cells [11,12].",

TLR2 forms heterodimers with either TLR6 or TLR1; these heterodimers recognize diacyl and triacyl lipopeptides, respectively [21,22]. TLR2 signaling occurs via a MyD88-dependent pathway leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB [14], and induction of various inflammatory cytokines, including IL-8, and antimicrobial peptides, such as human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) [4,23].",

Airway surface liquid (ASL) was obtained by adding 100 \u03bcl of sterile 1\u00d7 PBS to the apical surface and immediately pipetting off the fluid. We used a modified radial diffusion assay to quantify ASL antimicrobial activity as described previously [30]. Briefly, 4 \u00d7 106 bacteria in mid-log phase were suspended in an underlay gel. 2.5 mm diameter wells were punched into the gel and filled with 0.04-5 \u03bcl of ASL, with 0.02% acetic acid with 0.1% human serum albumin (Sigma) to equal 5 \u03bcl, or control antibiotic (gentamicin, 0.4-50 \u03bcg/ml). The plates were then incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C. Nutrient rich gels were then overlaid, and the plates incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. Zones of clearance were manually measured and plotted on a semi-log graph where the X-intercept represents the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) [31]. Test organisms included Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01, and a clinical strain of Listeria monocytogenes.",

The TLRs were differentially expressed, with TLRs 1 through 5 being most abundant in both resting and cytokine-stimulated airway epithelia. Compared to other TLRs expressed in epithelia, TLR2 expression was markedly (over 8-fold) induced by cytokine stimulation (P < 10-6) and TLR3 increased ~3-fold. Other genes with notable induction included MD-2 and NOD2, which exhibited over 3-fold and nearly 6-fold increases, respectively.

Glucocorticoids synergistically enhanced nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae-induced TLR2 expression via induction of MAPK phosphatase-1, leading to inhibition of p38 MAPK [38].

We initially assumed that cytokine augmentation of TLR2-mediated responses would coincide with increased nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway activation because this transcription factor is critical for regulation of the expression of many host defense genes [35,39]. Under basal conditions, epithelial and other cells sequester NF-\u03baB family members in the cytoplasm bound to inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB) proteins [40]. A variety of stimuli, including bacterial molecules and host mediators, induce serine phosphorylation of I\u03baB proteins, thereby targeting them for ubiquitination. These modifications of I\u03baB lead to 26S proteasome degradation, resulting in NF-\u03baB release and translocation to the cell nucleus where it mediates defense gene activation [41]. To assess NF-\u03baB pathway activation, we initially used immunoblot analyses to identify I\u03baB degradation. As expected, the combination of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 for 30 minutes decreased I\u03baB\u03b1 in epithelia (Figure \u200b(Figure4A),4A), but this effect did not appear to persist after 24 hours of exposure followed by 30 minutes without treatment (Figure \u200b(Figure4B).4B). In addition, pretreatment with the cytokine mixture did not clearly affect I\u03baB\u03b1 levels in epithelia after TLR2 receptor stimulation (Figure \u200b(Figure4C).4C). Assessment of NF-\u03baB-dependent gene activation using an adenoviral vector expressing a luciferase gene driven by four tandem NF-\u03baB sites revealed no cytokine augmentation of TLR2-mediated NF-\u03baB activation that correlated with the observed increased inflammatory gene expression, although there was significant variability between samples (Figure \u200b(Figure4D).4D). Increased NF-\u03baB activity was observed after cytokine treatment of epithelia. Thus, augmentation of NF-\u03baB does not seem to account for cytokine pretreatment effects on TLR2-induced gene expression.",

IFN-\u03b3-induced effects in epithelial and other cells requires activation of the transcription factor Stat1 by phosphorylation of tyrosine-701, with subsequent nuclear translocation and binding to gamma interferon activation sites in IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes [42,43]. The combination of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 for 30 minutes induced Stat1 phosphorylation (Figure \u200b(Figure5A),5A), but this effect did not persist after 24 hours of exposure followed by 30 minutes without or with treatment with the TLR2 agonist (Figure \u200b(Figure5B).5B). Another pathway that modifies inflammatory gene expression in epithelial and other cells is the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway [33]. Activation of p38 also occurs through phosphorylation, and the combination of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 for 30 minutes increased the level of phosphorylated p38 in epithelia (Figure \u200b(Figure6A).6A). This effect was more pronounced in epithelia treated with the TLR2 agonist, but no difference was noted without or with pretreatment with the cytokine mixture (Figures \u200b(Figures6B6B and \u200band6C).6C). Based on these results, augmentation of TLR2-induced host defense gene expression with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 pretreatment does not appear to be due to modulation of these three pathways (at least at the time points investigated), but likely is through other mechanisms, or combinatorial effects not assessed by these assays.",

Enhanced functional TLR2 expression following TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 exposure may serve as a dynamic means to amplify innate immune responses during infectious or inflammatory pulmonary diseases. Under conditions where first response cytokines are present, enhanced TLR2 signaling allows for further amplification of mucosal immunity. This increase in signalling does not correlate well with NF-\u03baB, Stat1, or p38 MAP kinase pathway activation. The importance of lipopeptide recognition in airway defense is further demonstrated by the upregulation of several host defense proteins/peptides following receptor engagement. Our finding that glucocorticoids can act as a negative regulator of functional TLR2 expression in well-differentiated human airway epithelia has clinical implications in settings of systemic or inhaled corticosteroid use. Since TLR2-mediated responses may occur early in the host response to infection, any factors that negatively impact TLR2 expression or signaling might influence disease outcomes.",
