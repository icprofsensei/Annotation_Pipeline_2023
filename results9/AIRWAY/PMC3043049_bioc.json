We used pyrosequencing of 16S amplicons to analyze the lung microbiome in two ways: first, using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to sample the distal bronchi and air-spaces; and second, by examining multiple discrete tissue sites in the lungs of six subjects removed at the time of transplantation. We performed BAL on three never-smokers (NS) with normal spirometry, seven smokers with normal spirometry (\u201cheathy smokers\u201d, HS), and four subjects with COPD (CS). Bacterial 16 s sequences were found in all subjects, without significant quantitative differences between groups. Both taxonomy-based and taxonomy-independent approaches disclosed heterogeneity in the bacterial communities between HS subjects that was similar to that seen in healthy NS and two mild COPD patients. The moderate and severe COPD patients had very limited community diversity, which was also noted in 28% of the healthy subjects. Both approaches revealed extensive membership overlap between the bacterial communities of the three study groups. No genera were common within a group but unique across groups. Our data suggests the existence of a core pulmonary bacterial microbiome that includes Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Veillonella, and Porphyromonas. Most strikingly, there were significant micro-anatomic differences in bacterial communities within the same lung of subjects with advanced COPD. These studies are further demonstration of the pulmonary microbiome and highlight global and micro-anatomic changes in these bacterial communities in severe COPD patients.",

COPD is characterized by largely irreversible airflow limitation, mucus hypersecretion, small airway fibrosis, and destruction of the alveolar space (emphysema) [3]. In developed nations, the leading cause of COPD is tobacco smoke exposure, predominately direct, whereas in developing nations indoor air pollution from combustion of biomass fuel also contributes significantly [4]. Not all smokers develop COPD, but why some do is not currently known. Because no current treatments halt COPD progression, new insights into its pathogenesis are urgently needed.",

This is the case both for its prolonged early asymptomatic phase and, until recently, for the acute exacerbations that punctuate its later stages [6], which can induce accelerated and sustained loss of lung function [7]. In part, this controversy arose because classical, culture-based studies suggested that the lungs of healthy individuals were sterile [8], [9], [10], while the lungs of COPD patients were believed to be colonized. More recently, culture-independent microbiological techniques demonstrated that the lungs are not sterile during health and documented changes in the lung microbiome in several lung diseases [11], [12], [13], [14], [15].

There were no significant differences between the three study groups (Log 16S copy #/ml BAL: HS, 8.25\u00b10.25; CS, 8.12\u00b10.40; NS 8.24\u00b10.66 mean \u00b1 SEM; p>0.05). Altogether, the levels of bacteria detected in the BAL fluid of our 14 subjects were consistent with previous estimates based on sterile brushings of the airways [12]. Thus, there were significant levels of bacteria in all subjects, without significant differences between never-smokers and those with end-stage lung disease.",

Following quality control filtering of the sequences we used RDP-Classifier [25] to assign taxonomic classifications to the sequences for ecological analysis. In agreement with our qPCR analysis (\nFigure 1\n), a community of lung-resident bacteria was readily identifiable in each BAL sample (\n\nFigure 2\n\n & \n\nTable 3\n). Virtually all of the filtered reads (91%\u00b11.5% mean \u00b1SEM) could be classified down to the genus level, irrespective of subject cohort. The dominant phyla in the lungs of our subjects were the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes (\nFigure 2A\n). At the phylum-level, there was heterogeneity in the bacterial communities between most of the HS group that was similar to that seen in healthy never-smokers (NS) and our two mild COPD patients (CS#1 & CS#2). By contrast, the moderate and severe COPD patients (CS#3 & CS#4) lacked bacterial community diversity, which was also noted in two healthy subjects (HS#4 and HS#7) and one never-smoker (NS#2).",

For a point of reference, a 3% difference between two full-length 16S sequences is roughly equivalent to a species level difference at the genomic level [28]. We used this level of similarity to generate OTUs and calculated diversity indices using the non-parametric form of the Shannon Diversity index. Consistent with the taxonomic analysis (\nFigure 2B\n), OTU-based analysis (\nTable 4\n) confirmed that there were diverse bacterial communities (higher np Shannon values indicate higher diversity) in the healthy smokers (HS), which was similar to that seen in the healthy never-smokers (NS) and our two mild COPD patients (CS#1 & CS#2). This analysis again identified that the pulmonary microbiome was much less diverse in the moderate and severe COPD patients (CS#3 & CS#4) (\nTable 4\n).",

We limited our analyses to the number of genera that were present at >1% and the number of OTU present at >1%, respectively. Importantly, this analysis demonstrated that species-level diversity within the human lungs is very limited: approximately two OTU per genera in each subject, with the notable exception of CS#3 which had 10 (\nTable 4\n). Overall, both OTU and classifier-based approaches demonstrated that the lungs of all subjects contain a diverse resident bacterial microbiome that displays only limited richness at the sub-genus level.",

All tissues sampled from the explanted lungs contained readily identifiable bacterial communities (\nFigure 4\n). Because BAL samples multiple airways and alveoli distal to a segmental or subsegmental bronchus, we first combined all of the individual sequencing reads in silico from all of the tissue samples of single lobe of the surgical specimens, and performed a separate analysis. The bacterial community profile of each of the three lobes were dominated in all three samples by the genus Pseudomonas (\nFigure 4A\n\n, Tissue), which was very similar to that of the BAL sample from our severe COPD subject (CS#4) and a number of others (\nFigure 2\n). Thus, direct sampling of explant tissue demonstrated that the bacterial communities in the BAL samples were lung-resident microbes and not the result of bronchoscope contamination.",

Each lobe had four to eight distinct tissue sites sampled, for a total of 44 tissue sites. No bronchiectatic changes were evident in the pre-operative CT images for any of the tissue sites sampled in these subjects. Figure 4b demonstrates illustrative CT images of two patients; similar results were seen in the other four patients (data not shown). However, despite normal structure, there were sites of significant differences in bacterial community composition within the same lung. This was particularly evident in the left upper lobe from subject CS#6. Haemophilus dominated the community in the segmental bronchus of the LUL. Stentrophomonas dominated in the distal bronchus of the LUL. In sharp contrast, Pseudomonas dominated the community in the middle upper bronchus and many others within the same lung. The additional explanted lobes also displayed micro-anatomic heterogeneity. The most striking differences were observed between tissue sites in CS#7RL, while all the tissue sites in CS#8RL were dominated almost entirely by Pseudomonas (\nFigure 5\n). These data demonstrate for the first time that marked regional differences in the bacterial microbiome can exist within an individual subject.",

However, the CS#6 LUL Segmental and CS#6 LUL Distal samples cluster apart from the main group and from each other with high Bray-Curtis values, indicating a high degree of dissimilarity. We again used PCA ordination to identify which elements were responsible for driving the differences between individual samples (\nFigure 6B\n).

Second, the diversity of the lung bacterial microbiome is often lower in subjects with decreased lung function, most commonly associated with dominance by Pseudomonas spp. Third, this is the first study to describe that the numerous microanatomic sites within the lung can give rise to significant differences in bacterial community structure.",

Our results are consistent with findings at another mucosal site, the gastrointestinal tract, where decreases in the diversity of the microbiota are associated with increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease [30], [31]. Lung community dysbiosis could provide the constant inflammatory stimulus that has long been observed in COPD [32]. Thus, in the lungs, as with other sites on the mucosa, a diverse microbiota may be important for health, including colonization resistance, epithelial integrity, and immunoregulation [33], [34].",

This result was most pronounced in the airways of the left upper lobe in one transplant recipient (\nFigure 4\n) where the bacterial community was dominated by a bacterial genera (Haemophilus) that was not detected at high levels in the other airways. A previous study [12] found a significant correlation between COPD and the presence of Haemophilus spp. in sterile brushings of the left upper lobes. At first pass, this finding appears to conflict with the domination by Pseudomonas spp. of BAL samples in our study and of endotracheal aspirates in a study of severe acute exacerbations of COPD [13]. However, since COPD pathology may be anatomically heterogeneous, our observation that the lung microarchitecture allows for the development of distinct localized microbial communities during disease provides a unifying hypothesis for all the culture-based and -independent studies on the role of bacteria in COPD progression.",

For example, regions of skin prone to dermatitis have been shown to have different microbial communities when compared to adjacent areas that remain disease-free [37]. Similarly, differences between teeth in the structure of the microbial community predisposes to disease within the same mouth [38]. Mechanistically, the microbial communities in teeth with periodontal disease are locally enriched for methanogenic Archea when compared to those that are disease-free [38]. Although these organisms are not disease-causing, the evidence suggests that they alter the local environment such that bacteria known to cause disease can thrive. It is possible that similar pathogenic syntropic interactions also exist in the lungs. We observed the most striking microanatomic community differences in the upper lobes of the lung, which is consistent with clinical observations that emphysema in COPD most commonly begins in the upper lobes.",

While the latter is a matter for future studies, the former will be dealt with here. The oropharyngeal sample as a control for microbiologic studies of the lung is rooted in the belief that the lungs should be sterile; thus, the purpose of the oropharyngeal sample is to rule out contamination. However, despite the lack of this sample, we can demonstrate that the lung microbiota that we have identified is not the result of contamination. First, the levels of 16S detected in subject BAL are too high to be consistent with contamination (Figure 1), but high enough to be consistent with a low level colonization. Second, the domination of Proteobacteria, in particular Pseudomonas spp., in BAL samples is radically different from the nasal cavity, which is dominated by the phylum Actinobacteria [26], and the oropharynx, which is dominated by Firmicutes [26]. In some subjects, Proteobacteria have been shown to have a larger presence in the oropharynx, but Pseudomonads were never encountered [26]. Finally, when the airways from explanted lungs were sampled directly, the bacteria identified were the same as those identified in BAL samples. However, all of our advanced COPD explants lacked the diversity observed in the \u201chealthy smoker\u201d controls. Collectively, these data argue strongly that the airways of the lungs are an independent microbial habitat, and that our results are not simply a result of contamination.",

We believe that CT imaging will be central to this endeavor. By demonstrating that one person's lungs can harbor both generalized areas of \u201chealthy\u201d microbiome and a single site containing a \u201cpathogenic\u201d community, our results suggest a mechanism by which the interaction of lung pathogens and host immunity might contribute to localized disease progression, even in the absence of overt exacerbation.",
