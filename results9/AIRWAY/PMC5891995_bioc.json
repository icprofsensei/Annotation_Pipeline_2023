Bacterial acquisition in the oral microbiome is influenced by the maternal microbiome. Personalization begins with the eruption of primary teeth; however, this is limited to phylogeny; functionally, individuals exhibit few differences, suggesting that microbial assembly may follow a defined schematic that is driven by the functional requirements of the ecosystem. This early microbiome forms the foundation upon which newer communities develop as more colonization niches emerge, and expansion of biodiversity is attributable to both introduction of new species and increase in abundance of predentate organisms.",

The eruption of primary teeth creates two more niches for bacterial colonization, a supragingival habitat consisting of a non-shedding enamel tooth surface and a subgingival habitat composed of an abiotic tooth surface, the junctional epithelium and the epithelial lining of the gingival sulcus. Nearly 6\u00a0years following the establishment of this stable dentate environment, the primary dentition begins to exfoliate, giving way to the permanent dentition. This approximately 6-year phase when an individual has a mixture of teeth from both the primary and permanent dentitions is termed the mixed dentition, following which an adult permanent dentition is established. In order to understand the role of the microbiome in the predisposition to, or in prevention of, disease, it is essential to define the development of microbial assemblages in this ecosystem and the partitioning that occurs with the introduction of new colonization niches.",

Therefore, we used predictive metagenomic analysis (PICRUSt [32]) to estimate the functional roles of predentate bacteria. Eight hundred seventy-eight genes contributing to 26 functional pathways were identified. Importantly, 78% of the predicted functional potential (684 genes encoding for 22 functions) was shared by \u2265\u200975% of the infants. The predicted core functional endowments in this early microbiome related to membrane transport, carbohydrate metabolism, replication and repair, amino acid metabolism, translation, nucleotide metabolism, and energy metabolism, in decreasing order of abundance (Fig.\u00a01d). Together, genes encoding for these functions accounted for 70% of the metagenome.",

This higher diversity was attributable to both community membership and structure, with 138 additional s-OTUs observed in the primary dentition (when compared to predentate infants), and successive additions of 32 species in the mixed dentition and 56 in the permanent, as well as increases in levels of species belonging to Streptococcus, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Veillonella (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2). Predentate infants demonstrated significantly higher levels of gram-positive facultatives and lower levels of gram-negative facultatives than all dentate individuals (Fig.\u00a02d). With the eruption of teeth, the similarity between the mother and child significantly decreased, and this divergence persisted through all dentition states (Fig.\u00a02e). The introduction of primary teeth in the oral environment was accompanied by the largest expansion of functionality (1135 KEGG orthologs) between two dentition states (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S1A and b and Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S2). Of these 1135 KEGG orthologs, 4% (43 genes) were different between primary and mixed dentition states, and 1% was different in both the permanent (7 genes) and adult (14 genes) metagenomes. Thus, the expanded functional potential with the introduction of teeth into the oral cavity was also observed in a mature dentition. This was attributable to a 19% increase in genes encoding for membrane transport, 12% in carbohydrate metabolism genes, and 10% in amino acid metabolism (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S1C). Cell motility and energy metabolism represented 7 and 6% of the increase respectively. In the permanent and adult dentitions, by contrast, 16% of the significantly enriched functional pathways belonged to membrane transport, with xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism representing 13%, and cell motility and carbohydrate metabolism functions each representing 12% of the significant change (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S1D).",

In children with primary dentition, 28 additional s-OTUs (notably those belonging to the genera Rothia, Fusobacterium, Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, and Capnocytophaga) were identified in the salivary core, of which at least 11 s-OTUs (range 11\u201325) were also seen in the core of children with mixed and permanent dentition states. The mixed dentition core comprised of the largest number of s-OTUs (73), of which 55 were shared with the primary dentition. The permanent salivary core contained 42 total s-OTUs, 39 of which were shared with the mixed dentition. Thus, the data suggests that certain species acquired in the predentate and primary dentitions stably colonize the oral microbiome throughout life and may be the principal contributors of the core adult microbiome, a finding that warrants further evaluation using longitudinal studies.",

One hundred forty-eight of these 309 s-OTUs were also present in the predentate mucosal community. Three hundred eight s-OTUs (143\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026 in each child) were identified in this habitat in the mixed dentition, of which 74 were part of the core, and 326\u00a0s-OTUs were identified in the permanent dentition (153\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033 in each child), of which 77 formed the permanent core. Twenty-four out of the 75 species in the core primary community were also found in the core predentate mucosal flora, and 62 of these 75 species were identified in subsequent dentitions (Fig.\u00a03b). Thus, approximately 50% of the s-OTUs identified in the supragingival habitat of any individual were shared by most individuals with the same dentition type, and 40% shared by all individuals irrespective of dentition state. The levels of anaerobic species (both gram positive and gram negative) were higher in permanent when compared to primary dentition (Fig.\u00a03c). The primary dentition had significantly higher alpha diversity and equitability when compared to the predentate stage, with no differences between dentitions (Fig.\u00a03d, \u200b,e).e). The mixed dentition was compositionally intermediate between primary and permanent dentitions, but more similar to the primary dentition. The eruption of teeth was accompanied by a large functional increase (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Figure S2A), with acquisition of 2209 KEGG orthologs, representing 23 metabolic pathways (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Figure S2B and Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Table S3). Only 33 additional genes were identified in the mixed dentition and 64 more in the permanent dentition. The higher functional potential with the emergence of teeth was primarily related to signal transduction, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, cofactors and vitamins, replication and repair, cell motility, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and membrane transport (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Figure S2C and D).",

One hundred sixty-seven of these 365 s-OTUs were also present in the predentate mucosal environment. Similarly, 378 s-OTUs (164\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041 in each child) were identified in this habitat in the mixed dentition, of which 70 were part of the core; and 394\u00a0s-OTUs were identified in the permanent dentition (184\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040 in each child) of which 47 formed the permanent core. Twenty-two out of the 64 species in the core primary subgingival community were also identified in the core predentate flora, and 50 of these 64 species in subsequent dentitions. Species present in all dentitions belonged to the genera Streptococcus, Veillonella, Gemella, Granulicatella, Fusobacterium, Corynebacterium, Kingella, Prevotella, Terrahaemophilus, Capnocytophaga, Porphyromonas, Campylobacter, Actinomyces, and Haemophilus. Thus, the subgingival biofilm demonstrated greater species richness as well as greater personalization in successive dentitions.",

While it is not within the scope of this study to definitively identify if this transmission is horizontal (shared utensils or saliva) or vertical, some elements of our data suggests that vertical (genetic) transmission might be a possible route of bacterial acquisition. One indication is that although all mothers carried F. nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus, only children of smokers carried these pathogens. We have previously identified high levels of these pathogens in the subgingival microbiomes of pregnant smokers [33], while other investigations have shown that these pathogens are capable of translocating to the placenta [34]. Emerging evidence also suggests that translocation of maternal oral bacteria to the placenta induces fetal immune tolerance, thereby promoting colonization with \u201cfamiliar\u201d species in the infant [35]. When we examine our data in this context, it brings up a scenario where high levels of these pathogens in the subgingival crevice might lead to placental translocation and subsequent fetal tolerance. Longitudinal investigations extending from pregnancy to post-partum are required to further investigate the hypothesis that the oral microbiome may be another \u201cheritable\u201d component of the human metagenome that is transferred from mother to offspring. Moreover, the majority of species shared by the infant and mother were also identified in all dentition states. Together, these two findings point to the powerful role the maternal oral microbiome and pre-natal environmental factors play in shaping the microbiome in the next generation.",

In the present investigation, no differences could be discerned in the oral microbiomes of infants based on mode of delivery or feeding.

While this could be attributed to either change in diet or increased colonization niches, our data provide strong evidence that change in habitat plays a major role.

The microbiome did not cluster based on \u201cadult\u201d versus \u201cinfant\u201d food. The second line of evidence comes from the metagenomic inferences. The functionalities acquired with the introduction of teeth into the oral cavity relate to adhesion, cellular multiplication, and biofilm formation, notably, membrane transport, cell motility, type IV secretion, oxidative phosphorylation, chemotaxis, and flagella assembly, indicating that the functional requirements of the new habitat drive the types of species that colonize this niche.

This personalization is limited to phylogeny; functionally, individuals exhibit few differences, indicating that microbial assembly follows a defined schematic that is driven by the functional requirements of the ecosystem. This early microbiome forms the foundation upon which newer communities develop as more colonization niches emerge, and expansion of biodiversity is attributable to both introduction of new species and abundance of predentate organisms. Further inquiry utilizing longitudinal prospective cohorts will serve to\u00a0establish the role that initial microbial colonization plays in long-term microbiome development.",
