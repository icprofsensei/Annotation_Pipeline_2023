The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Health Sciences Research at the University of Virginia. Informed consent was obtained from all ten participants prior to enrollment. The rhinovirus immunotype 39 inoculum pool has been safety tested and approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (IND12934). This study was conducted with all sample collection during the fall. Subjects were exposed to a total of 100 to 300 TCID50 of rhinovirus in 250 \u03bcL by self-inoculation by touching the medial cantus and conjunctiva of one eye or the septum in the nasal vestibulum on one side of the nose and repeated once after a 5- to 15-minute period. NLF was obtained by installation of 5 mL of 0.9% saline into each nasal cavity which was recovered into a waxed paper cup. The saline is able to reach throughout the nasopharynx due to the position of the participant\u2019s head (tilted backwards). Ten nasal washes were obtained from each volunteer: three during the week prior to HRV inoculation, one on each of five days immediately following inoculation, and on days 10 and 21 following inoculation (Figure\u00a01). An aliquot of 1 mL of each of the NLF sample was placed in tubes containing an equal volume of viral collection broth, kept on ice, and transported to the laboratory within one hour for rhinovirus isolation in tissue cultures. The remaining NLF was transferred to 2-mL cryo-tubes and stored frozen at -80\u00b0C.",

The top aqueous layer was transferred to a new Phase-Lock-Gel tube (VWR, Radnor, PA) with an equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) (Acros Organics, Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 minutes. This step was repeated twice to ensure removal of phenol. The sample was then ethanol precipitated, and the DNA pellet was resuspended in 50 \u03bcL 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Each set of extractions was accompanied by a negative control to ensure no contaminants in the extracted DNA.",

Briefly, the V1-V2 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified from extracted DNA samples using two primers containing the universal sequences 27 F (5\u2032-AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3\u2032) and 534R (5\u2032-TTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3\u2032). Each sample was tagged with a unique barcode (10 bp) added to the 5\u2032 end of the forward primer. Conditions for amplification were 94\u02daC for 3 minutes, then 30 cycles of 94\u02daC for 30 seconds, 57\u02daC for 45 seconds, and 72\u02daC for 60 seconds with a final extension step of 72\u02daC for 5 minutes. Each set of samples was amplified with a negative control to ensure no contaminants from reagents. PCR products were then run on a gel to verify amplification of the correct size. Amplicons from all samples were quantified using the Qubit\u00ae 2.0 Fluorometer and then pooled in equal molar ratios with 49 samples in pool 1 and 48 samples in pool 2. To achieve a final pool of 20 \u03bcL of sample with a 10 ng/\u03bcL concentration, 40.8 ng of each sample were added to pool 1 and 41.67 ng were added from each sample to pool 2. The pooled samples were then gel-purified and the concentration of each sample was measured using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer to ensure the minimum of 20 \u03bcL of 10 ng/\u03bcL sample for sequencing. Each pooled sample was sequenced using titanium chemistry on a 454 Life Science Genome Sequencer FLX platform at the University of Virginia Department of Biology Genome Core Facility using the standard protocol for sequencing. The samples were run on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer High-Sensitivity chip to determine the size distribution of the library samples. Then, a KAPA Biosystems qPCR assay was run to determine the effective concentration of the samples.",

In order to compare diversity of OTUs in the nasopharynx to that of other body sites, we also performed a combined beta diversity analysis of our nasopharyngeal samples with samples from several different body sites (gut, oral cavity, external auditory canal, nostril, and hair) from Costello et al.[34], as well as adenoid samples from Ren et al.[24].",

Significant differences were found in two subjects: subject number 5, in which Proteobacteria abundance was significantly different before inoculation than during or after inoculation (P = 0.039), and subject number 9, in which Actinobacteria abundance was significantly different between the before, during, and after time points (P = 0.0001) (Additional file 5).

The rarefaction plot curves indicate that the nasopharynx, sampled by NLF, is a very complex microbial environment. Deeper sequencing could reveal even more diversity in this very complex microbiota.

The microbiota of the nasopharynx is most similar to the external auditory canal, nostril, hair, and adenoid. The gut and oral cavity are distinct from the rest of the samples. When we used PCoA to compare the NLF samples before, during, and after infection; infected versus not infected; ill versus not ill; and by route of infection, we saw no distinct differences in the samples (Additional files 11 and 12). When looking at the PCoA to compare NLF samples between each subject (Additional file 11), there was no distinct clustering by subject. When comparing NLF samples within each subject (Additional file 12), there was also no distinct clustering.

The Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test was used to compare the relative abundances between infected and not infected samples of all genera comprising 1% or more of the total abundance across samples.

We can only compare the number of mismatches in those genera that the microarray was able to detect (n = 8). Out of the total 96 samples, the percent of samples which were detected in one study but not the other ranged from 4% to 53% in each genus. These results can be due to two aliquots from the same NLF sample extracted using two different methods. It could also be due to the microarray detecting species in very low abundance because of enrichment due to PCR.",

Some large changes in relative abundances of phyla within individuals at close time points were observed. It will be important to investigate whether these reflect true biological fluctuations in this dynamic ecological niche or low microbial density via greater sequencing depth. Additionally, using true shotgun metagenomics and taxonomic classification [36] to distinguish bacteria at the species level may allow significant changes in pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria during infection to be discovered. Information on the species level is especially important because, in numerous cases, there are pathogenic and commensal bacteria within the same genus, for example, Haemophilius influenzae, a known pathogen, and its closest phylogenetic relative Haemophilus haemolyticus, a commensal bacterium [37, 38].",

While this cluster was distinct from the separate clusters formed by the gut and oral samples, there was not a clear differentiation between the other body sites. Bacterial niches in close proximity have some sharing of bacteria due to physiological events like sneezing and nose blowing [39\u201341], which could help to explain the overlap between the microbiota of the nasopharynx and other proximal body habitats. Differences in age and health status of subjects along with season of sample collection may impact results. Participants in the Costello, et al. study included healthy adults, with two samples collected during June and two during the following September [34]. Adenoids in the Ren, et al. study were from children undergoing adenoidectomy, collected year round [24]. Demographic data was not accessible because these were discarded surgical specimens. NLF samples in our study were collected during the fall season in healthy adults. Future studies will need to sample complementary niches in the URT to understand coordinated changes of bacterial communities in response to viral infection.",

                    "text": "In our study, we surveyed the microbiota of the healthy nasopharynx during viral infection and cataloged a highly diverse population of microbes. The nine dominant phyla of the adenoid microbiota [24] contained the dominant phyla found in our study including Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. We found the same dominant phyla as a study of nasopharyngeal microbiota of healthy Chinese adults [5]. We did not observe an effect of viral infection on microbial composition, which is likely due to a small population, insufficient sequencing depth to detect the full complexity of the microbiota, and the inability to classify OTUs to the species level. In addition to deeper sequencing to achieve species level information, shotgun metatranscriptomics could be used as a complementary approach, to characterize the changes in gene expression that the invasion of a virus can elicit in a microbial community [42]. This information would help us to address the open question of the functional role that the microbiota plays in viral infections. It is uncertain, for instance, whether the microbiota can help to protect the host from viral infection by providing a barrier or by initiating an immune response. Alternatively, it is also possible that the microbiota can aid a virus in invading the host mucosa. One metagenomic study of the airway DNA virome of cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF individuals showed that the metabolic profiles of CF and non-CF individuals were distinctly different [43]. This study used the approach of finding target pathways that have altered expression levels in the diseased state, rather than taxonomic composition differences of the microbiota to discover novel therapeutic strategies. Our study has highlighted the highly diverse microbial composition of the adult nasopharynx in both healthy individuals and during viral infection.",

Most prior studies have looked at a population of individuals with a specific URTI or complication (that is, sinusitis) and sampled each individual for specific pathogens. From the findings of such studies, conclusions may be drawn as to which pathogens are likely involved and targeted treatments may be created. However, with a new understanding of the complexity of the NP microbiota at the individual level, we can apply this understanding by recognizing that future studies need to sample patients with URTIs or complications at baseline comprehensively, and then during acute disease to determine which bacteria respond, expand, disappear. This approach is anticipated to lead to improved understanding of disease and more tailored approaches to treatments of these diseases.",

This microbiota is highly diverse and varies greatly between individuals. The microbiota of each individual differs between time points throughout the viral challenge, though variability within individuals was less than between individuals. No significant changes in bacterial presence or relative abundance between time points were found due to viral infection. Further studies are needed to further characterize this microbiota and the response of the microbiota to viral infection down to the species level using deeper sequencing. Additionally, metagenomic sequencing will give us insight into transcriptional changes of the host and microbiota during viral infection. With this knowledge, we will better understand the pathogenesis of URT infections.",
