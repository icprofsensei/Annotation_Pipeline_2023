Bioinformatic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing was performed to assess the diversity and variation of oral microbiota of irradiated patients. Eight patients with head and neck cancers were involved in this study. For each patient, supragingival plaque samples were collected at seven time points before and during radiotherapy. A total of 147 232 qualified sequences were obtained through pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis, representing 3 460 species level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 140 genus level taxa. Temporal variations were observed across different time points and supported by cluster analysis based on weighted UniFrac metrics. Moreover, the low evenness of oral microbial communities in relative abundance was revealed by Lorenz curves. This study contributed to a better understanding of the detailed characterization of oral bacterial diversity of irradiated patients.",

A few decades ago, most of our knowledge on the composition of the oral microbiota was based mainly on culture techniques.7 With the advent of molecular techniques such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), it has been found that culture-dependent methods appear to underestimate oral microbiota diversity. To date, more than 700 taxa have been identified from the oral microbiota based on information derived from culture and molecular approaches.8,9 Culture-independent molecular techniques are capable of surveying entire bacterial communities and characterizing an enormous diversity of oral microbiota, bypassing the need to culture bacteria. To avoid inefficiency and underestimation caused by cultivation techniques, molecular fingerprinting and high-throughput sequencing have already been used to explore changes of oral microflora in healthy individuals,10,11,12 but have not so far been applied to assess radiation-induced shifts of the oral ecosystem.",

Plaque samples were obtained from the maxillary first molar according to the above mentioned protocols. Briefly, after the sampling site had been isolated with cotton rolls and dried with a gentle stream of air from an air-water syringe, a sterile Gracey curette was used to remove all of the supragingival plaque from the buccogingival surfaces of the maxillary first molar with as many strokes as necessary.

A total of 3 460 OTUs were identified from all samples based on 3% sequence dissimilarity. The average number of sequences at each time point was 21 033 (2 629 per sample, s.d.=392.9). Good's coverage was around 98% for the all sequences at seven time points, indicating that about two additional phylotypes would be expected for every 100 additional sequences obtained (Table 1). This level of coverage indicated that the 16S rRNA sequences identified at these time points represented most of the bacterial sequences present in the plaque samples.16 The richness of bacterial communities of plaque before and during radiotherapy was estimated by rarefaction curves. For instance, the rarefaction curves of control group (PT, Figure 1) presented different slope at three dissimilarity levels (3%, 5% and 10%), which reveals the relationship between OTUs and sampling depth. Generally, the cutoff of 3% dissimilarity was used in species level analyses. However, the steep slope on the rarefaction curve at 3% cutoff suggested that the number of OTUs or the bacterial richness of the plaque samples was not yet completely revealed by the current number of sequences. How many sequences are sufficient or what sampling depth is needed depends on the goal of the study. As few as 100 sequences per sample were sufficient to detect the major patterns of variation among the microbial communities in the guts of diverse mammals.17 Depth of coverage of about 1 000 sequences per sample seems to provide a good balance between number of samples and depth of sampling.18 The number of sequences analyzed in our study (2 629 per sample) was well above that recommended and can be considered reasonable. Compared with the oral microbial communities determined by cultivation or traditional cloning and sequencing, these results from pyrosequencing analysis showed much higher diversity. However, if the goal is complete characterization of all phylotypes in a sample or group, additional sequences will be required to determine the detailed diversity of oral microflora, especially when many species are rare or the diversity is high.",

The top three genera in the control group (PT) included, in order of prevalence at the time point PT, Neisseria (16.19% of the sequences taxonomically assigned at the genus level), Streptococcus (15.58%) and Capnocytophaga (15.04%). By contrast, the top three genera varied significantly across different time points during radiotherapy (Figure 2). Among all genera, 11 genera (Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Veillonella, Capnocytophaga, Derxia, Neisseria, Rothia, Prevotella, Granulicatella, Luteococcus and Gemella), which were found in all subjects, varied in relative abundance during the course of radiotherapy (illustrated in detail in Figure 2). Although from our data, it is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding their pathogenicity, pathogenic taxa are suspected from previous studies. Streptococcus and other caries-related bacteria such as Veillonella and Actinomyces fluctuated significantly and accounted for a large proportion of the bacterial communities. These top three genera interact with each other in the oral cavity, and they may play an important role in the development of dental caries.20,21,22 It is known that Granulicatella is very fastidious and difficult to cultivate. In our study, this genus was dramatically reduced in dental plaque following radiation. It is therefore tempting to speculate that Granulicatella is unlikely to contribute to the pathogenesis of post-radiation diseases such as radiation caries. Derxia, which has also been found in tropical soils,23 and Luteococcus, which was also isolated from human blood and the peritoneum,24,25 fluctuated differently, but little information about its pathogenicity in oral cavity is available so far. Other predominant genera, such as Rothia, Prevotella, Capnocytophaga and Neisseria, might be involved in the susceptibility of an individual to periodontal disease.16",

There were multiple possible sources of bias including the method of DNA extraction, PCR amplification, target region selection, sequence screening, etc. For example, the genus Prevotella may be predominant when the hypervariable V1\u2013V3 region is targeted.26 However, this region can provide results similar to Sanger sequencing and obtain representational characterization of microbial communities. In addition, most of the pyrosequencing contain none or only a few errors which are caused by homopolymers (repeated nucleotides). These errors may be interpreted as a rare OTU, inflating richness estimates.19 In consideration of the complexity of Next Generation Sequencing platform, more effort should be made to reduce the biases of current technology.",

Moreover, the top 10 and top 30 genera constituted roughly 80% and 90% of the total sequences in relative abundance, respectively. Therefore, it was reasonable to speculate that the overall sequence distribution was unequal. When dealing with the issue of evenness, the Lorenz curve developed by Max O. Lorenz was originally used to assess inequality of social wealth distribution, and has been recently introduced to studies of biodiversity.27 In this research, the sequence distribution of communities before and during radiotherapy was represented by Lorenz curves (Figure 3). Ideally, a perfectly equal sequence distribution would be one in which every genus has the same number of sequences (line of perfect equality in Figure 3). However, the shapes of Lorenz curves in our study were far away from the perfect evenness line, indicating that the microbial communities were dominated by several major taxa and the genera evenness was low, even though the diversity was high.",

Comparing the cluster analysis with the phylogenetic tree generated by the R program showed similar results for the distances based on genus composition (Figure 2).",

The detailed richness and relative abundance of 140 genera were found and the temporal fluctuations of the microbial communities were also observed across seven time points before and during radiotherapy. Moreover, the low evenness of genera in relative abundance was revealed by Lorenz curves. The present study demonstrated that high-throughput pyrosequencing facilitated the evaluation of microbiome in the diseased condition. This technique provided valuable information about the profiles of oral microbial communities and potential pathogens during radiotherapy, and may help guide the clinical medication and microbial intervention during the course of treatment.",
