Recent studies using culture-independent microbial detection have revealed that CF airway bacterial communities are more diverse than previously appreciated (1\u20135) and vary across short- and long-term scales (5, 6). It is not clear, however, how changes in the airway microbiota relate to lung disease progression. More specifically, it is not known whether significant changes in airway bacterial communities occur around the time of pulmonary exacerbations, events that are well known to be associated with a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function, increased hospitalization and antibiotic use, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality rates (7\u201312). Studies addressing this important question have provided valuable insight but have been limited by cross-sectional design, small numbers of paired baseline\u2013exacerbation samples from the same individual, and a focus on relatively narrow measures of bacterial community change (e.g., total bacterial density or community diversity) (5, 6, 13\u201315).",

The abundance of specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was calculated by multiplying the total 16S copy number by the OTU\u2019s relative abundance.",

The mothur (v.1.24) software package was used to process sequences as described elsewhere (17, 18). A total of 278,811 sequences (average per sample, 4,100; range, 726\u20139,948) were obtained from 68 sputum samples. The total number of reads for each community was randomly subsampled or rarefied to 726, the smallest number of reads obtained in the sample set, to control for differences in sequencing depth before \u03b1 (nonparametric Shannon index [19]), and \u03b2 diversity measures were calculated. Subsampling was performed by randomly sampling 726 sequences from each sample 1,000 times and calculating the mean value. Bray-Curtis (BC) dissimilarity was used to measure the difference in community structures between paired samples (20).",

For single comparisons, a P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For analyses with multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni-adjusted \u03b1 value (0.05/number of comparisons) was used. Analysis of molecular variance was used to compare community structures by clinical state and dominant OTU (21). Random Forest analysis was performed using the randomForest package in R with 500 trees and default settings (22).",

Relative to baseline, bacterial load increased at exacerbation in 18 pairs and decreased in 16 pairs. To investigate whether specific variables might predict an increase or decrease in bacterial density, we used a multivariate linear mixed model with the difference between log10 total 16S rRNA copies at baseline and exacerbation as the outcome variable. We included demographic variables (patient age and sex) that have been used previously for predicting exacerbation or survival in CF (8, 23, 24), variables that describe baseline microbial community composition (Shannon diversity and dominant OTU), and variables that we have previously reported to affect bacterial communities, including disease stage and maintenance antibiotic use (5). We also included the number of days between corresponding baseline and exacerbation samples to control for the unbalanced sampling interval. A dominant OTU was defined as the most abundant OTU having at least twice the relative abundance of the next most abundant OTU in a sample; 23 of 34 baseline samples had a dominant OTU. Pseudomonas was the dominant genus in 13 samples, with relative abundances ranging from 0.449 to 0.975. Burkholderia, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus were dominant in two samples each, whereas Achromobacter and Staphylococcus were each dominant in a single sample. The relative abundance of the dominant OTU among these samples ranged from 0.403 to 0.859. Given this uneven distribution of dominant genera, samples were categorized as Pseudomonas dominant (n = 13), as non\u2013Pseudomonas dominant (n = 10), or as having no dominant OTU (n = 11). Patients were considered to be receiving maintenance antibiotics if thrice weekly azithromycin, inhaled tobramycin, and/or inhaled colistimethate were part of the patient\u2019s routine care. None of these factors was found to have a significant influence on change in bacterial density at exacerbation (Table E2).",

Although the average BC distance between the 34 baseline\u2013exacerbation pairs was 0.351, the range was quite large (0.025\u20130.897) (Figure 2C), suggesting that although community structures changed little in some patients, considerable changes occurred in others.",

We again used a multivariate linear mixed model, which included the same variables used in the analysis of changes in bacterial density, to determine the influence of these variables on BC distance between baseline and exacerbation samples. Baseline diversity and baseline dominant OTU were the strongest predictors of community dissimilarity (BC distance) between paired baseline\u2013exacerbation samples (P < 0.05) (Table 2). More specifically, there was a significant positive correlation between baseline Shannon diversity and BC distance; greater baseline community diversity was associated with greater dissimilarity between baseline and exacerbation samples (P = 0.029). Furthermore, Pseudomonas-dominant samples were more dissimilar between baseline and exacerbation compared with pairs of samples with no dominant OTU (P = 0.031). The model also revealed a significant interaction between baseline diversity and dominant OTU (P < 0.05), which we investigated further by examining subsets of sample pairs differentiated by baseline-dominant OTUs. In communities dominated by a non-Pseudomonas OTU or with no dominant OTU, we still observed significant positive correlations between baseline diversity and BC distance between baseline and exacerbation samples. In contrast, this correlation was not observed in Pseudomonas-dominant communities (Figure 3). That is, Pseudomonas-dominant samples changed at exacerbation regardless of degree of baseline diversity. Baseline diversity was not significantly different between Pseudomonas-dominant and non\u2013Pseudomonas-dominant communities (P > 0.10; ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test). In Pseudomonas-dominant samples, bacterial community diversities were significantly higher in exacerbation samples compared with baseline samples (P < 0.05; paired t test). In contrast, in samples with a non\u2013Pseudomonas-dominant OTU or with no dominant OTU, no significant differences in community diversity between baseline and exacerbation samples were found (P > 0.10).",

Gemella average relative abundance was also higher at exacerbation than at baseline, although this result failed to reach statistical significance with multiple testing correction (P = 0.008; Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni adjustment) (Figure 4A). The Random Forest machine-learning algorithm also identified Gemella relative abundance as the most predictive among the top OTUs to differentiate baseline from exacerbation samples (Figure 4B).

These changes were analyzed using principal coordinates analysis, a method that reduces the dimensions of a complex data set so that relationships within the data can be visualized (Figure 5). At exacerbation, these communities shifted right along the first principal coordinate (PCo1) in the principal coordinates analysis plot. Correlation coefficients between each of the top OTUs and the two axes were calculated and plotted as vectors to visualize the impact of individual genera on the movement of samples in the ordination space. Pseudomonas shifted communities to the left along PCo1, whereas multiple genera shifted communities to the right along PCo1. No significant distinction between clinical states was found for communities with a non\u2013Pseudomonas-dominant OTU or with no dominant OTU.",

When we assessed community structures to describe the degree of change occurring in the airway microbiota at exacerbation, we found that pairs of baseline and exacerbation samples varied widely in their levels of dissimilarity, as reflected in the large range of BC distances found between these pairs. In other words, although some communities appeared to change little between baseline and exacerbation, others showed considerable movement, suggesting different \u201ctypes\u201d of exacerbations, only some of which involve substantial changes in bacterial community structures.",

Stratification of samples by baseline-dominant OTU, however, revealed that this trend was not significant for Pseudomonas-dominant communities, which showed greater overall dissimilarity between baseline and exacerbation samples compared with communities with no dominant OTU and fairly high degrees of dissimilarity regardless of baseline diversity. That is, although greater dissimilarity was found between baseline and exacerbation samples in Pseudomonas-dominant samples, there was no correlation between the level of baseline diversity and the degree of community movement at exacerbation in these samples.",

In these sets, diversity increased at exacerbation, a reflection of increasing community evenness due to a decrease in the absolute and relative abundance of Pseudomonas at exacerbation, with an increase in the relative abundance of a group of other species. These results suggest that fluxes in the density of Pseudomonas may play an important role in shaping community structures around the time of exacerbation in those communities wherein this genus dominates. In non\u2013Pseudomonas-dominant communities, global changes in community structures at exacerbation appear to be much more modest. In a recent longitudinal study, Fodor and colleagues (25) compared CF airway microbiota when patients were stable and experiencing an exacerbation. They observed Pseudomonas trending toward higher sequence abundance at stable compared with exacerbation time points, although this result failed to reach statistical significance.",

This suggests that Pseudomonas-rich communities were more resilient, returning to a community structure closely resembling the preexacerbation state, or more resistant to change in structure with exacerbation and antibiotic perturbation.",

In other studies, additional facultative or obligate anaerobic species have been detected in CF respiratory specimens at densities comparable to those of aerobic species (26, 27). However, the role these species play in disease progression remains uncertain. In our study, an OTU representing Gemella was the most discriminative OTU between baseline and exacerbation samples, increasing in 83% of pairs when present at baseline and/or exacerbation (n = 29). We did not identify any distinctive patient-or community-specific factors among the five pairs of samples where Gemella decreased at exacerbation. Although the relative abundance of Gemella was generally low (1.6% overall and 2.4% when present), its prevalence in all samples included in this study was high (67.6%). Recently, the keystone-pathogen hypothesis has been supported by multiple reports (28, 29). This hypothesis underscores the important role of low-abundance pathogens in orchestrating inflammatory disease by remodeling normally benign microbiota into a dysbiotic community (29). Our data are consistent with this model, suggesting that the low abundant facultative anaerobe Gemella may be involved in triggering pulmonary exacerbation, possibly by remodeling the airway microbiota.",

This presumption is supported by our analysis of community structure changes between paired exacerbation\u2013treatment samples (see online supplement). In this analysis, community diversity at exacerbation (before antibiotic therapy) was the most important predictor of community structure changes with antibiotic therapy (Figure E2). Recently, Fodor and colleagues (25) similarly showed that low-diversity communities were generally resistant to change during antibiotic treatment. In our study, this was true even when the antibiotic load was relatively high, suggesting that communities lose the ability to respond to disturbance as diversity declines (Figure E2).",

Artifacts due to DNA preparation, amplification, and sequencing methods, as well as the choice of data analytic methods, present important limitations (18, 30, 31). The approach that has been used for deep-sequencing in most human microbiomic studies does not differentiate DNA derived from live versus dead bacteria. Although the exclusion of DNA from nonviable bacterial cells with the use of reagents such as propidium monoazide has been proposed (32\u201334), there is no clear consensus among Human Microbiome Project investigators as to the best approach to deal with this issue. There are reasonable concerns that essentially any step in DNA processing presents an opportunity for introducing bias (e.g., propidium reagents do not interact with all cell types in the same way). One could also argue that bacterial DNA is not biologically inert and should not be excluded. In previous work we have shown that antibiotic treatment significantly reduces bacterial community diversity in CF sputum (5). In an ongoing study, we found that some species present in relatively high abundance in sputum become undetectable with deep sequencing immediately after antibiotic therapy, suggesting that DNA from lysed bacteria does not contribute significantly to pyrosequencing measures of community structure (unpublished data). Most studies of microbial community dynamics in CF lung by other groups have not attempted to inhibit the sequencing of DNA from lysed bacteria (2\u20134, 14, 26, 35).",
