Standard approaches for analyzing time-series data of the microbiota involve computation of measures of ecological community diversity at each time-point, or measures of dissimilarity between pairs of time-points. Although these approaches, which treat data as static snapshots of microbial communities, can identify shifts in overall community structure, they fail to capture the dynamic properties of individual members of the microbiota and their contributions to the underlying time-varying behavior of host ecosystems. To address the limitations of current methods, we present a computational framework that uses continuous-time dynamical models coupled with Bayesian dimensionality adaptation methods to identify time-dependent signatures of individual microbial taxa within a host as well as across multiple hosts. We apply our framework to a publicly available dataset of 16S rRNA gene sequences from stool samples collected over ten months from multiple human subjects, each of whom received repeated courses of oral antibiotics. Using new diversity measures enabled by our framework, we discover groups of both phylogenetically close and distant bacterial taxa that exhibit consensus responses to antibiotic exposure across multiple human subjects. These consensus responses reveal a timeline for equilibration of sub-communities of micro-organisms with distinct physiologies, yielding insights into the successive changes that occur in microbial populations in the human gut after antibiotic treatments. Additionally, our framework leverages microbial signatures shared among human subjects to automatically design optimal experiments to interrogate dynamic properties of the microbiota in new studies. Overall, our approach provides a powerful, general-purpose framework for understanding the dynamic behaviors of complex microbial ecosystems, which we believe will prove instrumental for future studies in this field.",

Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies make possible comprehensive studies of the time-dependent behavior of microbes throughout the body. Sophisticated computer-based methods are essential for the analysis and interpretation of these complex datasets. We present a computational method that models how human microbial ecosystems respond over time to perturbations, such as when subjects in a study are treated with a drug. When applied to a large publicly available dataset, our method yields new insights into the diversity of dynamic responses to antibiotics among microbes in the human body. We find that within an individual, sub-populations of microbes that share certain physiological roles also share coordinated responses. Moreover, we find that these responses are similar across different people. We use this information to improve the experimental design of the previously conducted study, and to develop strategies for optimal design of future studies. Our work provides an integrated computer-based method for automatically discovering patterns of change over time in the microbiota, and for designing future experiments to identify changes that impact human health and disease.",

Additionally, interventional studies have been performed, in which subjects were intentionally exposed to agents that perturb the microflora, with subsequent evaluation of changes in host ecosystems over time [12], [13].

Our framework models time-varying counts of microbial taxausing exponential relaxation processes. Each relaxation process is characterized by a transient effect level (the amplitude of the process immediately after a perturbation), an equilibrium level (the amplitude of the process approached as time tends to infinity), and a relaxation time constant (the time required for the amplitude of the process to reach 33% of the transient effect level plus 67% of the equilibrium level, as measured on a logarithmic scale).Observed abundances of taxa are assumed to arise from an infinite mixture of prototype signatures. Each prototype signature is composed of a set of relaxation processes that model a response to multiple perturbations. Each reference operational taxonomic unit (refOTU) in the ecosystem(s) analyzed is probabilistically assigned to a prototype signature. Adaptive Bayesian techniques are used to model the dimensionality of prototype signatures and the extent of sharing of prototype signatures among refOTUs within and across ecosystem(s).The time-series of observed counts for a particular refOTU in an ecosystem is modeled through a generative process, in which the prototype signature to which the refOTU has been assigned is customized to an individual signature by addition of refOTU and time-point specific offset terms. Data is then generated from a discrete-valued noise model parameterized by the individual signature.",

SD utilizes time-varying information, and is thus distinct from traditional static measures of ecological diversity [17], which characterize the complexity of a microbial community in terms of its constituent members at a single point in time. The second type, Relaxation Time Distribution (RTD) analysis, estimates the distribution of times required for members of the host ecosystem(s) to equilibrate after a perturbation event. This analysis summarizes the kinetics of responses, which is useful for understanding the phasing of changes within microbial ecosystems. The third type, Consensus Signature Group (CSG) analysis, identifies sub-communities of microbes within the larger ecosystem(s) that exhibit coordinated responses to a set of perturbations. This latter analysis provides information about which microbes may form functional sub-populations that affect the host or other microbial populations over time. Finally, MC-TIMME enables automated design of longitudinal studies of the microbiota. Our method couples information theoretic and Bayesian approaches to estimate from prior data the optimal sets of time-points to be sampled in future experiments. In this manner, data from a pilot study can be leveraged to develop optimized experimental designs for larger studies.",

Several studies have employed continuous-time models [18]\u2013[21] or infinite mixture models [22], [23]to analyze time-series microarray data. Methods for optimal experimental design for time-series microarray data have also been described [24]. However, methods designed for analyzing gene expression data do not model dynamics inherent in complex microbial ecosystems, such as equilibrium reverting behavior. Further, these methods generally assume observed data are continuously valued and normally distributed, which is reasonable for microarray data, but not sequencing data, which consist of counts. Extensive statistical literature has documented that, for data consisting of discrete counts, direct modeling of the data yields superior results as compared to transforming data to continuous values (see e.g., [25]\u2013[27]). This issue has been recognized for RNA Seq data, and several methods have been developed that use discrete-valued noise models [28]\u2013[30]. Recently, Holmes et al.\n[31]presented a method for modeling microbial metagenomics counts data that also uses discrete-valued distributions.

Further, it remains poorly understood how antibiotic-induced changes in the microbiota affect underlying host physiology, including enhanced susceptibilities to other pathogens [32], disease states such as allergic and auto-immune responses [33], [34], and acute or chronic effects on host diet and metabolism [35].To date, the Dethlefsen et al. study provides the longest time-series systematically monitoring the effects of antibiotics on human gut commensals.

During the study, each subject received two separate 5 day courses of oral ciprofloxacin.

Dethlefsen et al. combined the sequencing reads from all subjects to produce 2,582 reference operational taxonomic units (refOTUs). However, they found that only a few hundred refOTUs were present at consistently detectable levels in at least one sample per subject. In order to focus our analysis on refOTUs above the threshold of detection of the sequencing assay, we required that refOTUs have \u22655 counts for \u226510 time-points.

Second, when the ecosystem is perturbed, individual members exhibit varied responses. These responses are characterized by transient components that eventually decay toward an equilibrium state. Of note, this equilibrium state may differ from the pre-perturbation state. Third, the responses of micro-organisms within the ecosystem are dependent on one another. These dependencies may be multifactorial, including factors such as competition for nutrients and other essential resources, as well as common reactions to phases of the host immune response.",

Because an equivalent gold standard experimental dataset does not exist, we generated simulated data for use in testing. For these simulations, we used all prototype signatures estimated by MC-TIMME from the full Dethlefsen et al. dataset as our gold standard, and then generated test datasets with varying amounts of added noise. When the amount of noise equaled that in the original dataset (coefficient of variation of \u224860% for counts), MC-TIMME recovered Signature Diversity scores with <\u224810% error, and relaxation time constant estimates with \u224825% error for the first post-antibiotic exposure interval, and \u224840% error for the second interval; measures of consistency of assignment of refOTUs to prototype signatures showed \u224820% reduction in quality. Third and finally, we tested the sensitivity of our results to exclusion of each experimental subject. These tests showed error rates comparable to those from our simulations when noise levels were equal to those in the original dataset. See Protocol S1 for complete details.

The intra-ecosystem signature diversity (SD2) score was \u22488\u201320 expected equivalent signatures per 100 refOTUs (Figure 3C), indicating that many micro-organisms within each host ecosystem exhibited similar responses to the antibiotic treatments.

That is, subject E had significantly lower intra-signature and intra-ecosystem Signature Diversity scores, with an SD1\u03bcscore of 50% and SD2 score of 10, as compared with the other two subjects with SD1\u03bc scores >70% and SD2 scores \u224820. This differential behavior of subject E's microbiota was not discernible in the original analysis performed by Dethlefsen et al., as they did not use techniques that quantified diversity of temporal responses. Our Signature Diversity analysis thus provides additional information about the functional diversity of subject E's microbiota, suggesting that this subject may have harbored a more ciprofloxacin-resistant flora prior to the experiments. Of note, subjects in the study had not received antibiotics in the past year before the experiments, but their antibiotic exposure history prior to this point was unknown.",

As shown in Figure 3D, the SD3 score is a ratio of two SD2 scores: (1) SD2D, which is computed on a hypothetical combined ecosystem, in which refOTUs from different subjects probabilistically share prototype signatures, and (2) SD2I, which is a weighted average of independent SD2 scores computed separately on each subject. The SD3 score of 48% indicates that approximately as many prototype signatures were shared among the subjects as were unique to each subject. Thus, although subjects' microbiota did exhibit varied responses to the antibiotic treatments, as reported in the Dethlefsen et al. study, our findings indicate that there were substantial commonalities among responses. These commonalities could not have been found using the analysis techniques of the original study, which relied on calculations at individual time-points, in part because different sampling times for each subject made point-wise comparisons impossible. In contrast, MC-TIMME uses a continuous-time model of dynamics that leverages information from multiple time-points to estimate key dynamical properties, allowing comparisons across subjects on a common time-scale.",

These plots depict estimated smoothed probability distributions of relaxation time constants, in units of days, for all refOTUs across all subjects. As shown in Figure 4, the Relaxation Time Distribution for the first post-antibiotic exposure interval is multi-modal. A large peak in the distribution at \u22481\u20133 days indicates that many refOTUs quickly reached equilibrium levels, while a subsequent broader peak suggests waves of microbial succession events among subpopulations that took longer to equilibrate. Interestingly, after the second antibiotic exposure, the relaxation time distribution became simpler and more concentrated, with more refOTUs exhibiting relaxation times around \u22481\u20133 days. This finding suggests that the first antibiotic treatment shifted gut ecosystems toward more rapidly equilibrating states, possibly by selecting for more antibiotic resistant organisms or for sub-communities that more quickly and stably established themselves in relevant niches.",

Combining data from all subjects, MC-TIMME identified 125 CSGs. Interestingly, many of the CSGs contained refOTUs that are phylogenetically related or are common to all subjects. To assess the phylogentic relationships among refOTUs within each CSG, we calculated an enrichment p-value for taxonomic labels at the order, family and genus levels, based on a hypergeometric distribution null hypothesis. Approximately 61% of refOTUs belonged to CSGs significantly enriched for at least one taxonomic label at these levels, with most such CSGs shared across subjects. These results provide evidence that MC-TIMME detected biologically relevant sub-communities of organisms based only on evaluation of time-varying behaviors of refOTUs. MC-TIMME additionally discovered refOTUs that exhibited consistent behavior across all subjects: 88refOTUs were present in all 3 subjects, and of these 88 refOTUs, \u224825% were assigned to common CSGs. These sets of refOTUs, which consistently covary across all subjects, could serve as candidate biomarkers in future studies of antibiotic treatments or other perturbations to the gut flora.",

These groups of refOTUs had relaxation times <\u22482 weeks, and returned to the same or higher relative abundances as compared to those prior to the first antibiotic pulse. The Bacteroides\n[51]are obligate anaerobes. Members of this genus, in particular B. fragilis, are known to have greater resistance to ciprofloxacin, mediated in part by several bacterial factors, coupled with reduced activity of the antibiotic under anaerobic conditions [40], [52]. The Bacteroides can also be opportunistic pathogens and are capable of developing resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics after repeated exposures [53], [54]. These characteristics may explain why the Bacteroides were among the first genera found by MC-TIMME to recover post-antibiotic treatment. Interestingly, another CSG significantly enriched for refOTUs of genus Bacteroides (Figure 5M) exhibited an increase in relative abundance during antibiotic treatment, with a very slow return to equilibrium levels (relaxation time \u224842 days). This finding suggests that subjects consistently harbored antibiotic resistant Bacteroides, echoing concerns that members of this genus could serve as reservoirs of resistance genes for more frankly pathogenic bacteria [53], [54].",

                    "text": "MC-TIMME also identified another quickly equilibrating sub-community that contained refOTUs belonging to acetate [55] and butyrate [56] producing genera (Figure 5I). This sub-community showed increases in relative abundance during antibiotic treatments and was significantly enriched for refOTUs belonging to the genera Blautia, Faecalibacterium, or Roseburia. Many Blautia species are acetogens, producing acetate from H2 and CO2 through the acetyl-CoA pathway [55]. Acetate has known downstream effects on the microbial production of butyrate [57]. Butyrate, a 4-carbon short chain fatty acid, has important roles in maintaining colonic health of the host, providing a luminal source of energy to the epithelial barrier [57], while limiting the degree of autophagy in host colonocytes and reducing the host's susceptibility to agents that might otherwise promote damage to the colonic mucosa [58]. Members of the genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia are prominent butyrate producers in the human gut [56]. Our CSG analysis suggests that the identified Blautia, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia refOTUs may operate as a functional multi-species community in the gut, one demonstrating relative resilience tociprofloxacin's effects. This finding highlights MC-TIMME's ability to identify and track over time and across multiple subjects, bacterial sub-communities with potential benefits to the host. Interestingly, MC-TIMME discovered a second CSG containing Blautia refOTUs, but not the butyrate producing genera (Figure 5B),and that exhibited a different response pattern, with a decrease in relative abundance during the first antibiotic pulse, and relatively rapid return to pre-antibiotic relative abundances. Of note, certain Blautia species, such as B. hydrogenotrophica, use a broader range of substrates for acetogenesis than other species in the genus [55].The presence of such Blautia species with greater metabolic flexibility in the CSG depicted in Figure 5B could explain the lack of butyrate producers in this consensus signature group.",

The Ruminococcaceae are overall obligately anaerobic, fastidious organisms that may require substrates produced as by-products of metabolism by earlier colonizers in gut luminal food-webs [57]\u2013[59].

The majority of these CSGs showed increases during the antibiotic pulses, with fairly long relaxation times to pre-antibiotic relative abundance levels. The Lachnospiraceae are a large family of difficult to cultivate organisms, some of which have been found in close association with the mucous layer over the distal colonic epithelium [60]. Although little is known about the antibiotic susceptibilities of these organisms, it has been hypothesized that they may have evolved special mechanisms to survive the higher concentrations of endogenously produced host anti-microbial peptides present in this niche [60]. Our CSG analysis identified distinct groups of refOTUs from the Lachnospiraceae family that exhibited prolonged increases in relative abundance after ciprofloxacin exposure. These findings provide new information about this poorly understood bacterial family, which could be used to guide future studies to evaluate potential mechanisms of innate antibiotic resistance among Lachnospiraceae sub-communities.",

On the pre-antibiotic interval, the optimized design required more uniform sampling, reflecting the modeling assumption that host ecosystems were at equilibrium prior to antibiotic exposure. For the period immediately after the first antibiotic exposure, the optimized design required additional frequent sampling beyond the one week of the original design. This increased sampling requirement is consistent with the relaxation time distribution on the first post-antibiotic treatment interval shown in Figure 4, which indicates the presence of transient effects beyond one week for many refOTUs. However, the optimal design required fewer subsequent samples on the first post-antibiotic treatment interval, suggesting that MC-TIMME can effectively leverage earlier time-points obtained while the ecosystem is still equilibrating to estimate later behavior near steady-state. During the period immediately after the second antibiotic exposure, the optimal design generally required less frequent sampling than did the original design. This reduced sampling requirement reflected the shorter relaxation time distribution on the second post-antibiotic interval as shown in Figure 4. Finally, the optimal design required considerably more sampling at the end of the time-series; the original experiments clearly under-sampled after the second antibiotic exposure, as is evident from high variability in model parameter estimates on this interval (see Figure 5 and Figure S2).",

We used root mean square error (RMSE) to measure predictive accuracy. RMSE is the square root of the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted sequencing counts, averaged over refOTUs and time-points. Evaluation of predictive accuracy is important to assess the degree to which a probabilistic model generalizes to new data, without over-fitting features particular to one dataset. To perform this evaluation, we estimated optimal experimental designs for each subject, using three design strategies. For the first strategy, a sequential design, we gave the experimental design algorithm data for all refOTUs observed at a subset of time-points, and asked the algorithm to estimate additional time-points to sample in the same subject. For the second strategy, a cross-subject design, we gave the experimental design algorithm all observed data from one subject, and asked the algorithm to estimate time-points to sample for a different subject. In the third strategy, a dispersed design, we did not use the experimental design algorithm, and simply chose time-points to sample that were as evenly spaced on the study interval as possible. The dispersed design uses no information from observed data, and thus served as a baseline with which to compare the other two design strategies.",

Of the two informative strategies, neither consistently dominated the other. However, the cross-subject strategy did substantially outperform the sequential strategy for subject D. This subject exhibited the highest Signature Diversity equilibrium level (SD1\u03bc) score, meaning that many refOTUs in this subject changed equilibrium levels subsequent to one or both antibiotic exposures. Consequently, equilibrium levels for refOTUs in subject D were harder to predict from prior equilibrium levels. Thus, the sequential design strategy, which uses only partial time-series data as input to the design algorithm, suffered in performance. In contrast, the cross-subject strategy that uses complete data from another subject, performed particularly well for subject D, because it leveraged prototype signatures predicted from subject E or F that were substantially similar to those in subject D.",

Our work represents both biologically and computationally significant advances. From the biological perspective, our study provides new insights into the differential and dynamic effects of antibiotic treatments on commensal bacteria in the human gut. Antibiotics disrupt the commensal flora, which can contribute to overgrowth and pathogenic effects of organisms such as Clostridium difficile, the cause of pseudomembranous colitis [61]. However, antibiotic effects have primarily been studied in pathogens; the range of effects on complex commensal populations remains largely unknown. Our results provide evidence, consistent across multiple human subjects, that sub-groups of commensals exhibit distinct temporal responses to treatment with a broad spectrum antibiotic. These results illustrate the staged dynamics of responses among sub-populations of commensals, and will enable future experimental studies to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms behind these differential responses. From the computational standpoint, our study provides a robust, general-purpose framework for extracting fundamental information on ecosystem dynamics from massive sequencing datasets. Our framework may be applied to types of data other than 16S phylotypes, such as metagenomics or RNA Seq data, as well as model systems in animal or plant hosts, or studies in soil or marine environments. MC-TIMME employs probabilistic models of dynamics and associated measures of their properties, which yield important functional information that standard techniques for analyzing microbial communities cannot. Our use of adaptive Bayesian methods not only increases the strength of statistical inferences, but also provides signatures of microbial responses that are robust across multiple experimental subjects. Additionally, MC-TIMME enables optimal design of new time-series experiments, which will provide a strong foundation for future longitudinal studies of the microbiota.",

An automated cross-subject design strategy generally performed comparably to or better than a sequential design strategy. A cross-subject design strategy uses all data from one subject to predict a future experimental design for a second subject. In contrast, a sequential design strategy uses limited samples from one subject to predict a future experimental design for the same subject. In the past, when the costs of experimentally interrogating samples were high, strategies using automated design were advocated in which samples would be over-collected, frozen, and then sequential design methods would be used to select the next samples to interrogate [24]. Our findings suggest that, in an era of plummeting sequencing costs, automated experimental designs based on pilot studies with small cohorts may prove more effective, particularly for clinical trials in which sample collection costs and logistics can be the limiting factors. However, confirmation of this hypothesis will require larger numbers of subjects and more detailed information about the heterogeneity of cohorts, with respect to factors such as demographics and environmental exposures. Additionally, we used a general-purpose, information theoretic utility function as a basis for selecting optimal experimental designs. This utility function has proven useful in many prior studies (see e.g., [46]), and performed well in our analyses. However, our framework for experimental design could readily be extended, by using utility functions that explicitly include financial or other costs involved in performing experiments.",

Sequencing based methods suffer from various biases, due to factors such as the DNA extraction method and sequencing platform utilized [62]. Additionally, from 16S phylotyping data, it is only possible to infer abundances of taxa relative to other members of the microbial ecosystem detected with sequencing, and not the actual biomasses of individual taxa relative to the input mass of material analyzed. Thus, from our relaxation time analysis, one cannot infer the time required for taxa to equilibrate in terms of their absolute biomasses in vivo. Nonetheless, many studies have shown that relative abundances of organisms serve as important ecological indicators [2]. Relative abundances reflect differential abilities of organisms to compete for and effectively use limited resources, and thus provide insights into the roles of sub-communities within larger host ecosystems. However, the most profound limitation to 16S phylotyping data is that it is only useful for identifying which bacteria are present, not what they are doing. Ultimately, targeted or high-throughput functional studies [63] are essential for following up hypotheses generated based on 16S phylotyping.",

The key components of the model, including the infinite mixture model for prototype signatures and the noise model for counts data, employ general-purpose inference techniques that would not need to be modified to accommodate different models of dynamics. However, the Reversible Jump MCMC techniques we used for inference of intra-signature dimensionality changes require model-specific moves; in future work, more general techniques such as sparse priors [64], [65]could be employed for inference of this portion of the model. For the experimental system we modeled, with defined antibiotic administrations, we assumed that perturbations to the microbiota start at known time-points. This model of dynamics could be extended for analyzing observational studies, in which naturally occurring perturbations may occur, by adding latent variables that automatically determine switch-points in dynamics. Another direction for extension would be building more elaborate relaxation time models. We used a relaxation time model based on ordinary differential equations, which assumes instantaneous transitions to different dynamic regimes and monotonic exponential decay to equilibrium levels. A more detailed model could allow smooth transitions between regimes, and richer kinetics of decay to equilibrium, to capture more subtle or chronic responses to perturbations. Additionally, more complex temporal correlations could be captured using a stochastic differential equation model such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [66]. Finally, longitudinal covariates, such as subject diet, could be added to the model of dynamics to capture exogenous factors that may affect the microbiota. Such extensions to MC-TIMME will enable increasingly sophisticated longitudinal studies, to expand our knowledge of the role of the microbiota in human health or disease.",
