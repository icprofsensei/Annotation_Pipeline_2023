                    "text": "Analyses of metagenome data (MG) and metatranscriptome data (MT) are often challenged by a paucity of complete reference genome sequences and the uneven/low sequencing depth of the constituent organisms in the microbial community, which respectively limit the power of reference-based alignment and de novo sequence assembly. These limitations make accurate protein family classification and abundance estimation challenging, which in turn hamper downstream analyses such as abundance profiling of metabolic pathways, identification of differentially encoded/expressed genes, and de novo reconstruction of complete gene and protein sequences from the protein family of interest. The profile hidden Markov model (HMM) framework enables the construction of very useful probabilistic models for protein families that allow for accurate modeling of position specific matches, insertions, and deletions. We present a novel homology detection algorithm that integrates banded Viterbi algorithm for profile HMM parsing with an iterative simultaneous alignment and assembly computational framework. The algorithm searches a given profile HMM of a protein family against a database of fragmentary MG/MT sequencing data and simultaneously assembles complete or near-complete gene and protein sequences of the protein family. The resulting program, HMM-GRASPx, demonstrates superior performance in aligning and assembling homologs when benchmarked on both simulated marine MG and real human saliva MG datasets. On real supragingival plaque and stool MG datasets that were generated from healthy individuals, HMM-GRASPx accurately estimates the abundances of the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene families and enables accurate characterization of the resistome profiles of these microbial communities. For real human oral microbiome MT datasets, using the HMM-GRASPx estimated transcript abundances significantly improves detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes. Finally, HMM-GRASPx was used to reconstruct comprehensive sets of complete or near-complete protein and nucleotide sequences for the query protein families.

The task is routinely being done through alignment of the individual reads against the profile hidden Markov Models (HMM) of protein families in the reference database. This strategy, however, is hindered by the fact that the reads usually only represent partial protein sequences, which contain insufficient information for their accurate classification. To tackle this problem, we present a targeted assembly algorithm that, based on the sequence overlap information, simultaneously reconstructs complete or near-complete protein sequences and estimates their homology given the HMMs of the protein families of interest. The reconstructed protein sequences contain more complete information regarding the function of the corresponding protein, thus facilitating accurate annotation of themselves as well as the constituent sequencing reads. The resulting program, HMM-GRASPx, has been shown to have significantly improved performance (>40% higher recall rate with a similar level of precision rate) over other state-of-the-art counterparts such as RPS-BLAST and HMMER3.",

Given the reference sequence, individual NGS reads can be aligned against it using alignment programs such as Bowtie [11], BWA [12], BLAST [13], FASTM [14], RAPSearch [15,16], and DIAMOND [17]. Alternatively, the individual reads can be assembled into longer contig sequences using de novo assembly tools prior to the alignment [18,19]. Long contigs contain more complete structural features of the corresponding protein product and thus facilitate correct annotations. However, de novo assembly can be challenging due to uneven and/or low-coverage of the constituent organisms, leading to fragmentary assembly for many data sets. These issues have been partly alleviated through the de novo short peptide assembly approach [20,21] that aims at reconstructing complete protein sequences, and is not hampered by synonymous DNA mutations.",

This framework, referred to as the simultaneous alignment and assembly (SAA) approach for short peptides, uses iterative alignment and assembly steps to improve homology detection, and integrates both the reference-based alignment and the targeted fragment assembly as a unified component [24,25]. It computes sequence similarity at each stage of contig extension, thus providing auxiliary sequence similarity information for guiding the graph traversal. Meanwhile, the alignments computed between the reference and the assembled contigs also more accurately reflect the true homology. Given the reference protein sequence, the algorithm attempts to recruit all of its homologous short peptide reads and assemble them into full-length proteins. This approach allows integration of the sequence overlapping information (i.e. between reads) with the sequence alignment information (i.e. between the read and the reference) while assessing homology. Intuitively, if a peptide read overlaps significantly with a second peptide read that aligns well with the reference protein sequence, it is more likely that the first read is also a homolog of the reference. The resulting program called GRASP (Guided Reference-based Assembly of Short Peptides) [24] and its computationally efficient version GRASPx [25] was shown to significantly improve sensitivity of homology search when compared to programs such as BLASTP and FASTM, and subsequently provide more accurate abundance estimation from MG/MT data. Currently, the SAA algorithm has only been implemented to accept a single sequence as the query. Motivated by improved homology detection capabilities of profile hidden Markov models (HMM), here we extend the SAA approach to enable the use of a profile HMM as a query.",

HMMER3 [26\u201329] and RPS-BLAST [30,31] directly operate on individual reads and demonstrate low sensitivity [32,33]. To improve sensitivity, the Sensitive and Accurate protein domain cLassification Tool (SALT) [32] attempts to excessively recruit candidate homologous reads of the reference through a loose cutoff; then it applies de novo assembly on these recruited reads. Excessive recruitment of candidate homologs can have an impact on the running time of the program; the program is therefore only designed for analyzing single-genome data instead of large and complex MG/MT community data. SALT was later redesigned and extended to Xander [34], which was built on the spectrum alignment algorithm that was originally used for guided homology search on microarray data [35]. Xander also requires relatively large amount of computational resources to analyze tens or hundreds of protein families. On the other hand, the Ultrafast Protein Classification (UProC) toolbox [33] implements a computationally efficient approach to compare the MG/MT reads to the sequences of all members in the querying protein family (using the Pfam FULL alignment database), which makes it reference database-dependent. In summary, an accurate, efficient, and reference database-independent profile-based homology search program would greatly improve current MG/MT data analysis.",

In this case, the analysis of such MG/MT data sets involves homology search with available reference sequences that may be evolutionarily distant to some of the taxa in the sampled community. Computationally, the search for the remote homologs of a given query protein sequence is confounded by the combination of homologous and non-homologous protein sequences in the low sequence similarity alignment space [37]. The problem is further compounded by the current high-throughput sequencing technologies that generate short reads, which usually leads to short alignments that only contain partial information regarding the structural features of the protein. GRASP was designed to address these limitations by evaluating the sequence similarity between the query sequence and the reconstructed protein contigs, which resulted in longer alignments and improved accuracy [24].

The current implementation of HMM-GRASPx outputs all possible traversals of its overlap graph as long as the corresponding contigs align well with the query, which may be redundant. Therefore, we recommend using other de novo assembly programs to further refine the set of output contigs (e.g. SPAdes [18] for nucleotide assembly and SFA-SPA [21] for protein assembly). In summary, the HMM-GRASPx based MG/MT analysis pipeline allows for estimation of gene/transcript abundances and targeted reconstruction of both protein and nucleotide sequences.",

The relative abundances of these bacteria were simulated according to their natural composition (coverages of each genome range from 1.25X to 10X with an average of 4X, see S1 Table). Three hundred and three Pfam protein families that are involved in important metabolic pathways were selected as the queries (S2 Table). Ground-truth homologous reads were defined by searching these protein families against the complete genomes and recruiting reads onto the identified homologous regions (see Methods). Given the ground-truth homologous reads, the recall rate, precision rate, and F-measure of the programs were calculated and compared (see Methods).",

For example, a clear difference between body sites was revealed by both programs for several genes involved in vancomycin resistance (i.e. D-Ala-D-Ala ligase genes vanA, vanB, vanC, and vanD) (Fig 2A and 2B, see Glycopeptide_Resistance category), which could only be identified in MG libraries obtained from oral supragingival plaque and not from the stool samples. This difference may be due to that vancomycin targets Gram-positive bacteria (the outer membrane of most Gram-negative bacteria is impermeable to large glycopeptide molecules such as vancomycin), which are highly abundant in the oral plaque and less abundant in stool. On the other hand, while the biological environment does show a stronger impact in shaping the resistome, personalized difference can indeed be observed for several AMR protein families. For example, both programs predicted high abundance of ErmA, ErmB, and ErmC genes specifically in the stool sample SRX877102 (Fig 2A and 2B, see rRNA_Methyltransferace category). The observation of personalized resistome profile may be explained by the antibiotics exposure history of the specific individual [43], and can be referred to when designing personalized treatment plans.",

It is clear that HMM-GRASPx generated more biological meaningful predictions, because RND gene families are unique for Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Bacteroides, which is abundant in healthy stool samples) and should be in low abundance in the Gram-positive rich healthy supragingival plaque samples. In addition, differences in abundance predictions further affect clustering of gene families based on the abundance profiles. Further gene family-wise WPGMA clustering algorithm clustered 7 out of the 10 RND gene families together using HMM-GRASPx predictions (S2 Fig), compared to only 2 out of 10 using HMMER3 predictions (S3 Fig).

Such information can be used to investigate which genes and metabolic pathways are critical in responding to environmental disturbances and how microbial communities adapt to environmental changes. The majority of the MT annotation analysis workflows rely heavily on available reference genomes, which serve as templates for read mapping. Other transcriptome assembly approaches are hampered by a similar issue of low/uneven coverage of the expressed transcripts by the microbial community. MT analysis of unexplored environments with high microbial-community complexity and very few genome sequence representatives is still an open problem.",

These data sets were generated to study health-associated molecular processes, which contribute to protection from caries diseases (tooth enamel mineralization). Gene transcription responses were monitored in a temporal manner while the oral in vitro biofilm community metabolized sugar which resulted in a classic pH drop of the growth media followed by a health-associated pH recovery [7]. The MT data sets (SRA: SRP049210) contain replicate libraries obtained from biofilm samples collected at 0 hour (pH 7.0, three replicates), 6 hours (pH 4.2, two replicates), and 9 hours (pH 5.2, three replicates) after glucose amendment (S11 Table). Since very little knowledge exists on the role of bacterial interactions and cell-to-cell signaling (i.e. antagonist or cooperative interactions) in human oral health, we focused on the identification of biosynthetic protein families that potentially synthesize signaling molecules. The biosynthetic protein families were selected from the antiSMASH2.0 database [38] (S12 Table). HMM-GRASPx and HMMER3 were applied individually to search all MT libraries (see Methods).",

The reference sequences of these 14 strains were used to construct the ground-truth set for benchmarking purpose (see Methods). Benchmark results are summarized in Table 3, which shows that HMM-GRASPx has a higher recall rate (~80% compared to ~15%) but a lower precision rate (~80% compared to ~90%) than HMMER3. The results are consistent with the previous benchmark results on the simulated marine data set. Overall, HMM-GRASPx showed >50% higher F-measure. Spearman\u2019s correlation between the predicted and the ground-truth abundance was calculated for both HMM-GRASPx (Fig 3A) and HMMER3 (Fig 3B). The abundances predicted by HMM-GRASPx were more consistent (Spearman\u2019s correlation 0.714) to the ground-truth abundances than HMMER3 (Spearman\u2019s correlation 0.333). Linear regression analysis also showed that HMM-GRASPx over-predicted the abundance by 18% (slope 1.18), while HMMER3 underestimated the true abundances by 79% (slope 0.21).",

On the other hand, HMMER3-based DE gene detection only showed a Jaccard similarity of 0.23. The majority (89.7%) of the HMMER3-based DE genes were contained in the set of HMM-GRASPx-based DE genes.

A potential solution to this problem is to first assemble the recruited homologous reads (Fig 1, \u201cPeptide assembly\u201d and \u201cNucleotide assembly\u201d) followed by taxonomic binning of the resulting contigs [46,47].

The program was also shown to improve DE detection in MT data sets, which will lead to improved identification of metabolic pathways and coverage of genes within these pathways that are under differential regulation. Finally, HMM-GRASPx can also be used for targeted assembly, which can subsequently enable a more in-depth analysis of taxonomy and protein family function.

Define the maximum seed score for the k-grams in the reference as the highest log odds-ratio for any sequence that can be emitted from the k-grams. A score scale (between 0 and 1) can be applied to the maximum seed score to define a position-specific cutoff for seeding.

The ground-truth homolog reads for a given protein family was defined by searching the protein family profile against the complete genomes. Concretely, the protein family profile HMM was searched against all proteins encoded (coding regions were extracted from KEGG) by the 23 genomes listed in S1 Table using HMMER3 with default parameters. All identified regions that are passing the HMMER3 (version 3.1b2) trusted-cutoff (i.e. E-value 0.01) were selected as homologous regions. Such a setting was applied to all HMMER3 runs referred in this work. Note that one protein sequence may contain multiple homolog regions with each of them assigned to different Pfam families; this is because one protein sequence may contain multiple domains. However, each region can be assigned to only one protein family; if the region was able to be aligned to multiple protein families, it would be assigned to the protein family that generates the most significant E-value. The simulated peptide reads were then mapped against these homologous regions using an in-house short-peptide mapper \u2018graspx-map\u2019 (with parameters \u2018\u2014num_errors = 3\u2014portion_mapped = 0.6\u2019, which requires that a short peptide be mapped to the reference for >60% of its sequence with less than three substitution errors).

Because the majority of the reads can be mapped onto these 14 strains (64\u201375%, see S11 Table), the benchmark data set will largely reflect the actual performance of the programs on these human oral MT data sets.",
