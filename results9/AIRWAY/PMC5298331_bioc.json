Aerobic growth on various media yielded >108 colonies mL-1. Full-length 16S rDNA sequencing and fatty acid profiling from morphologically distinct colonies revealed \u226513 distinct genera. Full-length 16S rDNA library sequencing, by either Sanger or long-read PacBio technology, suggested that up to 21% of the MBP was composed of Arcobacter. Other high abundance microbial constituents (>6%) included the genera Proteus, Enterococcus, Dysgonomonas and several genera in the order Bacteroidales. The MBP was most susceptible to ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, gentamicin, and meropenam. MBP exposure of human HT29 and A549 cells caused significant cytotoxicity, and bacterial growth and adherence. An acellular MBP filtrate was also cytotoxic to HT29, but not A549. Both MBP and filtrate exposures elevated the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8. In endotracheal murine exposures, bacterial pulmonary clearance was complete after one-week. Elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, and chemokines KC and MCP-1 occurred between 2h and 48h post-exposure, followed by restoration to baseline levels at 96h. Cytokine/chemokine signalling was accompanied by elevated blood neutrophils and monocytes at 4h and 48h, respectively. Peripheral acute phase response markers were maximal at 24h. All indicators examined returned to baseline values by 168h. In contrast to HT29, but similar to A549 observations, MBP filtrate did not induce significant murine effects with the indicators examined. The results demonstrated the potentially complex nature of MBPs and transient immunological effects during exposure. Products containing microbes should be scrutinized for pathogenic components and subjected to characterisation and quality validation prior to commercial release.",

One such application is the in situ degradation of environmental contaminants that accumulate over time from pollution or as a result of accidental spills [1\u20137]. One approach for these applications is in situ degradation with microbial bioremediation products (MBPs), which involves the dissemination of microorganisms into contaminated soil or water ecosystems. The degradation of the contaminant can occur directly by one or more microorganisms or through the synergism of a mixture of microbes, whether deliberately formulated or naturally occurring (i.e., a consortium). Dominant species then emerge as a result of nutrient selection that are capable of metabolizing the contaminant into a less harmful state.",

For the latter, occupational exposure through ingestion or inhalation during the manufacture and application of the product may be most significant. Currently, there is some information on the toxicity associated with microorganisms used in biotechnology applications [8\u201311], but none for MBPs. Besides a lack of empirical data on the toxicity of MBPs, several other factors confound assessing their potential hazards. The final formulation may consist of non-biological components that enhance their efficacy and possibly their toxicity. In products containing combinations of living microorganisms, the contents may continually change over time as some species out-compete others under different conditions encountered during manufacturing, storage, transportation and in situ bioremediation. Furthermore, MBPs may vary from lot to lot, and may contain unintended living and non-living constituents or contaminants that could contribute to toxicity that may also vary between lots. As such, the hazard evaluation of the microbial product will depend on the stability and lot-to-lot variation of the preparations.",

Cells were exposed to bacteria as described previously [9\u201311]. HT29 and A549 cells (~80% confluent) were exposed to dilutions of MBP for various times in 96-well plates. Following exposure, the supernatant was removed and retained for multiplex measurement of IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, GM-SCF, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 using an antibody-based bead array system (Bioplex\u2122, BioRad, Mississauga, ON). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Pseudomonas or Escherichia (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control for HT29 cytokine measurements. Cytotoxicity was initially measured with the MTT assay (Sigma-Aldrich). For this, fresh media with one mg mL-1 MTT was added to the wells and the plates were incubated for two hours at 37\u00b0C. Wells were rinsed twice with PBS to remove non-adherent cells and bacteria. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well and the resultant solubilized-formazan was measured at OD505. The capacity of cells to reduce MTT to formazan was expressed as a percentage Bioreduction Activity compared to that of PBS-treated HT29 or A549. Alternatively, cell viability was measured with a Trypan blue dye exclusion method by using the Countess\u2122 automated cell analyzer (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada).",

Initial examination revealed that it was highly complex (Fig 1A, Manual lane). To clarify microbial diversity further, a large scale analysis involving long-read sequencing of a 16S rDNA amplicon was performed. A total of 135,856 Circular Consensus (CCS) reads were obtained using PacBio SMRTAnalysis (version 2.2.0) software. After removal of low quality reads and scanning for chimeras, a total of 110,985 CCS were kept and clustered at 97% ID (DNAclust version 3),which gave a total of 94,418 reads representing 44,919 clusters. Representative sequence clusters were classified with the RDP classifier (version 2.5) [16] with an in\u2014house training set containing the Greengenes database [17]. Fig 1A shows relative taxon abundance with different proportions of the major constituents (version 1.8.0) [14]. By the PacBio methodology, the MBP appears to contain particular microbial constituents at relatively high abundance: Arcobacter cryaerophilus (21,3%), Proteus sp.

Results presented in Fig 4B demonstrated that a dose-responsive reduction in viability (cytolysis) was observed with all MBP dilutions at 24h, but only with the 1/10 dilution at 2h exposure. Furthermore, unlike HT29 cells, A549 were not sensitive to filtrates, as viability following filtrate exposure was comparable to that of control cells.",

Using selective and non-selective growth media, the MBP was observed to contain at least 31 culturable species of aerobic bacteria that could be identified using two separate 16S rDNA databases and a FAME library.

The 16S rDNA library consisted of full length clones of 16S rDNA amplified from the MBP using one primer annealing condition. The high throughput analysis was carried out using a pool of PCR products that were amplified using a temperature gradient, which should have allowed for the improved efficiency of amplification of different targets of rDNA sequences in a sample of metagenomic DNA.",

For this, two different methods were examined. Commercial agar plates containing selected antibiotics provided some information. However, the limited availability of commercial tests for a large number of antibiotics limited broad screening. Therefore, a broth dilution method was employed to identify the most useful antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, gentamicin, meropenem), and those that were not particularly effective (amoxicillin, aztreonam, ceftazidime, erythromycin, trimethoprim, vancomycin). This method has been used for several individual bacterial species [9,11,15]; however, these data demonstrated that it could also be used to assess the effectiveness of antibiotics against MBPs. For these studies, the MIC of antibiotic was interpreted as the concentration at which there was no microbial MTT formazan. Comparing the broth dilution results to the agar based data demonstrated similar results, except that the quadrant plates showed the appearance of some microorganism in the presence of gentamicin; this was not observed in the broth test. Differences in results between plating and broth dilution methods have been observed previously [21]. Several fungi were observed during selective media growth, so their overall contribution to MTT formazan was also determined by including a replicate plate with amphotericin B in all wells. This showed that under the conditions tested, fungi present in the MBP did not interfere with MIC measurements.",

Experiments done in the absence of antibiotic, 24h growth of microorganisms at all exposure concentrations contributed to MTT formazan production and confounded human cell viability measurements (Fig 3A). An attempt to eliminate this interference was done by including antibiotic during exposure. Low exposure concentrations of 1/320 to 1/80 caused up to a 50% drop in HT29 bioreduction activity, but exposures with \u22651/40 dilution again resulted in bacterial interference. Antibiotic resistance at high bacterial concentrations could have been a result of bacterial aggregation, which prevented contact with antibiotic. Another attempt to eliminate bacterial interference was done by using the trypan blue assay as an alternative to the MTT assay. These results clearly demonstrated a dose-responsive effect of the whole MBP product (Fig 4B). An interesting observation was that there was no A549 toxicity from the acellular filtrate of the MBP at 1/20, but HT29 cells were sensitive to filtrate effects. This material would be expected to contain microbial metabolites, such as hydrogen sulphide, secreted toxins and bacterial cell debris, including cell wall constituents such as LPS shed from bacteria, all of which may contribute to toxicity.",

In contrast, HT29 cells demonstrated only the induction of IL-8, but not other cytokines, with either whole MBP and filtrate (Fig 3D).

Although the composition of the MBP filtrate is unknown, it may contain carry-over from industrial scale-up culture, as well as microbial metabolites and dissociated structural components of microbial cells, such as LPS. It is possible that IL-8-inducing activity of the MBP filtrate was driven by these components, but were easily sequestered, cleared or inactivated from the mouse lung quickly after exposure.
