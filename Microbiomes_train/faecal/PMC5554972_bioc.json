In healthy individuals, the gut microbiota mostly consists of bacteria that have a commensal or mutualistic relationship with the human host. Critically ill patients, however, frequently have an extremely dysbiotic gut microbiota that is characterized by intestinal overgrowth with multi-drug resistant opportunistic pathogens of the phylum Proteobacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli) and the genus Enterococcus, while the abundance of commensal Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes is decreased [2\u20135].

SDD is used to eradicate opportunistic pathogens from the patients, while minimally impacting commensal bacteria [7]. In SDD, a paste containing the antibiotics colistin and tobramycin, and the antifungal amphotericin B, is applied to the oropharynx of ICU patients. The patients also receive a suspension of colistin, tobramycin, and amphotericin B via a nasogastric tube. These antimicrobials are applied from the day of ICU admission until ICU discharge. In addition, a third-generation cephalosporin (usually either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) is administered intravenously during the first four\u00a0days of ICU stay. SDD lowers patient mortality during ICU stay in settings with a low prevalence of antibiotic resistance and reduces the costs associated with ICU hospitalization [8, 9]. Selection of bacteria that are resistant to the antimicrobials used in SDD remains a major concern [10, 11], although this is not supported by the results of clinical trials in which conventional culture techniques were used to screen for antibiotic resistance among nosocomial pathogens [12].",

The use of antibiotics may favor the selection for antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) among members of the gut microbiota, thus increasing the likelihood of horizontal spread of ARGs between commensals and opportunistic pathogens co-residing in the gut [16]. During the administration of SDD, the gut resistome of patients is monitored by the cultivation of resistant bacteria from rectal swabs or feces, as part of routine diagnostics. However, methods that rely on microbial culture capture only a fraction of the gut resistome, since anaerobic commensals, which are the main reservoir of ARGs in the gut microbiota, are difficult to culture [18\u201320]. Thus, culture-independent methods are needed to comprehensively assess the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on the microbiota and resistome of ICU patients.",

It contains over 4800 oligonucleotides targeting the V1 and the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene from 1132 microbial phylotypes present in the human gut [22]. The full-length 16S rRNA gene was amplified from fecal DNA, and PCR products were further processed and hybridized to the microarrays as described previously [24]. Data analyses were performed using R (www.r-project.org), including the microbiome package (https://github.com/microbiome). Bacterial associations in the different patient groups and healthy subjects were assessed using principal component analysis (PCA) as implemented in CANOCO 5.0 [25]. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed as implemented in CANOCO 5.0 to determine the associations between microbiota composition (based on 130 genus-like groups included in the HITChip) and explanatory host-associated variables (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and sample source, i.e., ICU patient or healthy subject). Significance of the explanatory variables was assessed by Monte Carlo permutation testing (MCPT). Statistical testing for the differences in microbiota composition between ICU patients and healthy subjects was performed by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. All P values were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) by the Benjamini and Hochberg method [26], and corrected P values (q) below 0.05 were considered significant.",

Primer design was performed using Primer3 [29] with its standard settings with a product size of 80\u2013120\u00a0bp and a primer melting temperature of 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The universal primers for 16S rRNA genes were previously described by Gloor et al. [28]. Forward and reverse primers were evaluated in silico for cross hybridization using BLAST [30] and were cross-referenced against ResFinder [31] to ensure the correct identity of the targeted genes. All primers that aligned with more than ten nucleotides at their 3\u2032 end to another primer sequence were discarded and redesigned. Additionally, all primer sets were aligned to all resistance genes that were targeted in this PCR analysis to test for cross hybridization with genes other than the intended target resistance gene. Primers that aligned with more than ten nucleotides at their 3\u2032 end sequence with a non-target resistance gene were discarded and redesigned. A reference sample consisting of pooled fecal DNA from different patients was loaded in a series of fourfold dilutions and was used for the calculation of primer efficiency. All primers whose efficiency was experimentally determined to be between 80 and 120% were used to determine the normalized abundance of the target genes. The detection limit on the Biomark system was set to a CT value of 20, as recommended by the manufacturer. In addition, to assess primer specificity, we performed melt curve analysis using the Fluidigm melting curve analysis software (http://fluidigm-melting-curve-analysis.software.informer.com/). All PCRs were performed in triplicate, and sample-primer combinations were only included in the analysis when all triplicate reactions resulted in a CT value below the detection limit.",

The composition of the gut microbiota in patient samples collected during and after ICU hospitalization was markedly altered, with samples clustering away from the healthy controls. RDA showed that both sample source (i.e., whether samples were taken from ICU patients or healthy subjects) and, to a lesser extent, BMI significantly explained microbiota composition variance (sample source: q\u00a0=\u00a00.007; BMI: q\u00a0=\u00a00.048, Additional file 4).

These findings are in line with previous studies reporting selection for Gram-positive cocci [12, 20, 36, 37] and depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in ICU patients receiving SDD [33]. In addition, we were able to demonstrate that the abundance of E. coli was significantly lower in ICU patients than in healthy individuals. The suppression of E. coli in the SDD-treated ICU patients starkly contrasts with other studies in critically ill patients not receiving SDD, in which E. coli is present at higher levels than in healthy individuals [2, 3, 5]. This observation further supports previous studies which found that SDD is successful in suppressing outgrowth of E. coli in the gut microbiota of ICU patients [8, 9], corresponding to the original aim of SDD [7].",

In the only prospective evaluation on the post-ICU effects of SDD, the implementation of SDD was not associated with higher infection rates after ICU discharge [38], but further studies are warranted to better quantify the risks associated with recolonization of the gut by multi-drug resistant, opportunistic pathogens upon ICU discharge, and cessation of SDD.",

Four resistance genes (aac(6\u2032)-Ii, ermC, qacA, tetQ) were significantly more abundant among ICU patients than in healthy subjects. The aac(6\u2032)-Ii gene is a specific chromosomal marker for the nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecium and provides low-level resistance to aminoglycosides [39]. Its high abundance in ICU patients is in line with the increased levels of enterococci in the microbiota of the patients. The increased abundance of the macrolide resistance gene ermC may have been selected for by the use of low doses of the macrolide erythromycin, which was used as an agent to accelerate gastric emptying during ICU stay in six patients. The increased abundance of tetQ in the gut microbiota of ICU patients may reflect the higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in ICU patients versus healthy subjects, as tetQ is widely distributed on conjugative transposons in this phylum [40]. Finally, the qacA gene confers resistance to a number of disinfectants, including the biguanidine compound chlorhexidine and the quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride [41, 42]. Disinfectants are widely used in ICUs as cleaning and infection control agents [43], and their use could select for qacA in the gut microbiota of patients.",

                    "text": "Although SDD improves survival of ICU patients, its use remains controversial due to the risk for selection of antibiotic resistance among bacteria that populate the patient gut. In this observational study, we found little evidence for the selection of high-risk resistance determinants, like ESBLs, carbapenemases, or vancomycin resistance genes, in SDD-treated patients during their stay in the ICU. The increased abundance of the resistance genes aac(6\u2032)-Ii, ermC, qacA, and tetQ in SDD-treated ICU patients in our study could be interpreted as being of limited concern. The first three resistance genes contribute to resistance in enterococci, either to relatively low concentrations of antibiotics (aac(6\u2032)-Ii) or to classes of antimicrobials that are of limited relevance for the treatment of enterococcal infections (ermC and qacA). The tetQ gene provides resistance to tetracyclines in Bacteroidetes, but this class of antibiotics is scarcely used for the treatment of anaerobic infections [46]. The selection for enterococci occurring in this patient cohort may be of concern in settings where vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are endemic. VRE is still infrequent in The Netherlands, and the vanB resistance gene that was detected in both patients and healthy subjects is most likely associated with Gram-positive anaerobes [47]. It remains to be determined whether SDD leads to selection for VRE in countries where these bacteria are more prevalent.",

However, it is difficult to generalize these findings from a Dutch hospital to other countries, where resistant bacteria are more prevalent. Our study also illustrates the relative lack of data regarding recolonization of the gut upon ICU discharge and cessation of SDD. Future studies into the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes in ICU patients can benefit from the qPCR platform used here as it enables the rapid detection and quantification of antibiotic resistance genes in the gut microbiota. The detection of high-risk antibiotic resistance genes (encoding, e.g., ESBLs, carbapenemases or vancomycin resistance proteins) in the resistome of patients may lead to the implementation of targeted antibiotic therapy or infection control measures to minimize the risk for selection and spread of these resistance genes.",
