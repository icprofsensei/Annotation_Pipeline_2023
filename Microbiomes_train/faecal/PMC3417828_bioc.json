Abdominal pain ratings were made 3 times per day (awakening, after lunch, and evening) during the 2-week period, and pain ratings were recorded in a database linked to a dedicated telephone line. The child rated the pain using a 0 to 10 scale with 0 being \u201cno pain at all\u201d and 10 representing the \u201cworst pain you can imagine\u201d. This pain scale has been validated for measuring abdominal pain in children22. The maximum level of pain was defined as the greatest intensity of pain recorded during the 2-week period. Pain frequency was recorded during the same 2-week period and stratified into two groups to provide statistical power. The high-medium (HM) group reported > 3 pain episodes and the low (LO) group reported \u2264 3 pain episodes in the 2-week period. Stools were compared to the Bristol stool form chart by the children and their parents23. Stool type 1 or 2 (hard) was considered to be consistent with constipation, and stool type 6 or 7 (loose) was considered to be consistent with diarrhea8. Patients were subtyped as having IBS-C (hard \u226525% and loose <25% of the time), IBS-D (hard <25% and loose \u226525%), IBS-M (hard or loose \u226525%), or IBS-U (does not meet criteria for IBS-C, IBS-D, or IBS-M8. IBS-U refers to unsubtyped IBS or recurrent abdominal pain associated with specific changes in bowel habits, but lacking sufficient constipation or diarrhea (hard or loose stool <25% of the time).",

Notably, Proteobacteria represented more than 16.5% of the total bacteria in IBS patients compared to 14.5% in healthy subjects (Fig. 4). The class Gammaproteobacteria mostly accounted for the relative difference in abundance of Proteobacteria in these two groups (6.14% in IBS patients compared with 4.53% in healthy subjects). In other words, the majority of other taxa found to be more abundant in IBS by PhyloChip analysis belonged to the class Gammaproteobacteria. Interestingly, the genus Haemophilus and more specifically, H. parainfluenzae, are common taxa detected within the class Gammaproteobacteria. Comparisons between the IBS and healthy groups demonstrated that 44 taxa were more abundant (>2 fold) in the IBS group (Suppl. Table 1A). One taxon not detected by 454 pyrosequencing and exhibiting the greatest fold change in relative abundance between children with IBS and healthy subjects (>19-fold) belonged to the phylum Nitrospira (otu_0984; G2 taxonomy). This taxon was present in 10 of 28 IBS samples (9 of 17 IBS subjects), but only in 1 of 27 samples from healthy subjects. However, attempts to amplify Nitrospira DNA using several sets of primers based on the PhyloChip probes and previously validated primer sets failed to confirm the presence of Nitrospira. Instead these sequences appear to be novel taxa related to the genus Ruminococcus.",

The clinical metadata obtained by history with 2-week diaries was analyzed together with 16S metagenomic 454 sequencing data by supervised learning (randomForest). Patients were distinguished by history as having a high-medium (HM) or low (LO) pain phenotype. A HM pain phenotype was characterized by greater than 3 pain episodes per 2-week period, and a LO pain phenotype was described by \u22643 pain episodes per 2-week period. Children with a HM pain phenotype (increased pain frequency) contained a relatively greater abundance of four different taxa belonging to the genus Alistipes (Fig. 5A). Additionally, individual taxa belonging to the genera Akkermansia and Parabacteroides, and a member of the family Ruminococcaceae were found in children with an increased number of abdominal pain episodes (Fig. 5A). Children with a LO pain phenotype had a greater preponderance of commensal taxa including Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Haemophilus and Roseburia (Fig. 5B).",

The IBS-C and IBS-U microbiomes (IBS-D was omitted in this analysis as only one subject was included into this category) were well separated by OTU composition (Fig. 6; Suppl. Table 2).

Most of the OTUs that facilitated the classifications of these two IBS subtypes belong to the genera or groups such as Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Lachnospiraceae Incertae Sedis, Veillonella, and Erysipelotrichaceae species. However no trend (lower or greater abundance) was observed for any individual bacterial genus.

We identified specific microbial signatures associated with recurrent abdominal pain in children and, specifically, pediatric IBS. Children with IBS yielded greater proportions of the phylum Proteobacteria, the class Gammaproteobacteria, and genera such as Dorea (member of Firmicutes) and Haemophilus (member of Gammaproteobacteria). Species such as H. parainfluenzae and a novel Ruminococcus-like organism were enriched in children with IBS. By contrast, taxa such as the genus Eubacterium and the species Bacteroides vulgatus were enriched in healthy children. Supervised learning and feature selection algorithms in combination with 16S metagenomics resulted in the successful classification and stratification of children with IBS and specific IBS subtypes with accuracies exceeding 95 percent. Finally, several taxa of the genus Alistipes were associated with the phenotype of frequently recurrent abdominal pain. One example from this genus, Alistipes putredinis, resembles members of the Bacteroides fragilis group35, 36, and is considered to be a commonly found gut commensal microbe of the Bacteroidetes phylum37. This species has been isolated from inflamed and non-inflamed intestinal tissues in studies of the bacteriology of appendicitis in children35,38.",

                    "text": "Although conflicting results exist from studies in adults with IBS, enrichment in Proteobacteria has been described in adult studies39. In this study, the class Gammaproteobacteria accounted for most of this enrichment of the phylum Proteobacteria in children with IBS, and one prominent member of this class of organisms was H. parainfluenzae. H. parainfluenzae was cultured from the jejunal fluid of a substantial fraction of children in a prior Danish study40, suggesting that this bacterium is a gut commensal in children that may fluctuate quantitatively in disease states. In this study, increased abundance of the genus Veillonella was associated with pediatric IBS, although this genus was not enriched in a particular IBS subtype (data not shown). The gram-negative organism Veillonella (phylum Firmicutes) was more abundant in adults with IBS-C, and associated with increased quantities of fecal organic acids (acetic and propionic acids), and severity of pain41. A greater proportion of Haemophilus and acid-tolerant bacteria such as Veillonella, were also found to be more abundant in microbiomes associated with esophagitis42. Sequences amplified with Nitrospira primers were most similar to sequences of several unclassified Ruminococcus clones. Nonetheless, clones having 94% identity with Ruminococcus torques were present in greater abundance in IBS patients, and were correlated with greater pain severity43. Bacterial genera, such as Dorea, that were not previously linked with IBS were found to be associated with IBS in children. Dorea, a genus that includes species capable of formic acid production, has also been found in greater abundance in patients with ulcerative colitis44. In contrast, the PhyloChip could quantitatively examine different Bacteroides species, and B. vulgatus was found to be less abundant in children with IBS when compared to healthy subjects. These results corroborate previous data obtained in studies of adult patients with IBS-C45. Microbial community studies in other GI disorders may yield useful insights regarding the etiology and pathogenesis of IBS.",

In our study, 59.1% of children presented with IBS-C, and 31.8% of children presented with IBS-U. The IBS-C and IBS-U subtypes were associated with differences in gut microbial composition encompassing at least 50\u201375 different taxa. Due to the paucity of clinical data, it remains unclear if the IBS subtype distribution in our study is typical for this age group in the USA, and this distribution is different from that seen in adults with IBS. Using supervised machine learning, specific bacterial communities were postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS. Considerations regarding statistical power in this study (22 subjects per group) were addressed by retrospective power/sample size calculations and review of data at the level of bacterial genera. Given that the Bristol chart reflects GI transit time in adults, it implies that the IBS-C group had a longer transit time than the IBS-U group. Further investigations are required to determine if colorectal transit influences the gut microbiota or vice-versa, and previous studies clearly show that the composition of the gut microbiota (i.e., methane producers) can affect transit time1, 2.",

The role of generic bacterial overgrowth46,47, and more specifically small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), as a mechanism in the pathophysiology of IBS should be critically evaluated in light of these findings, detailed clinical assessment of SIBO48, and the recently published limitations of lactulose hydrogen breath testing49. In addition to SIBO, intestinal inflammation has been considered to contribute to disease in a subset of patients with IBS. Fecal calprotectin has been used as a biomarker of intestinal inflammation, and previous studies reported evidence of increased fecal calprotectin in some adults and children with IBS and FAP50. We speculate that abdominal pain in IBS may be associated with alterations in visceral sensitivity or pain perception induced by the composition of the gut microbiome, rather than immune activation5\u20137.",

This study also emphasizes the potential importance of microbial manipulation strategies in disease prevention and management. Rational manipulation of the microbiome by antibiotics or probiotics may ultimately result in the alleviation of symptoms. Treatment of IBS with the antibiotic rifaximin relieved symptom scores in patients51 and underscored the potential ability to manage IBS by eliminating \u201cbad actors\u201d in the gut microbiomes of some patients. In addition to antibiotics, probiotics including yet-to-be-defined beneficial microbes may yield beneficial effects in adults and children with IBS17, 52. Recent studies described the impact of diet on the human gut microbiome53, and the coupling of specific nutritional interventions with carefully selected antibiotics or probiotics may provide efficacious microbial manipulation strategies for the prevention and treatment of IBS.",

Our data suggest that gut microbiome studies may help clarify important associations between commensal microbes, microbe-derived molecular signals, and phenotypes of recurrent abdominal pain in children. Candidate bacterial genera have been identified that may serve as the basis for next-generation probiotics. Metagenomics data appear to be useful for stratification of patients with different IBS subtypes. We anticipate that compositional and functional discoveries related to the intestinal microbiome will translate into new biological therapeutics in neurogastroenterology.",
