These microbes have the potential to cause disease, yet their source remains controversial and clinical recommendations to reduce feeding tube colonization are lacking. This study aims to improve our understanding of the bacteria in neonatal feeding tubes and to evaluate factors that may affect these bacteria. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the bacteria present in pharyngeal, esophageal, and gastric portions of feeding tubes, residual fluid of the tubes, and infant stool using samples from 47 infants. Similar distributions of taxa were observed in all samples, although beta diversity differed by sample type. Feeding tube samples had lower alpha diversity than stool samples, and alpha diversity increased with gestational age, day of life, and tube dwell time. In a subset of samples from 6 infants analyzed by whole metagenome sequencing, there was greater overlap in transferable antimicrobial resistance genes between tube and fecal samples in breast milk fed infants than in formula fed infants. These findings develop our understanding of neonatal feeding tube colonization, laying a foundation for research into methods for minimizing NICU patients\u2019 exposure to antimicrobial resistant microbes.",

Currently, manufacturer guidelines for maximum feeding tube dwell time are based on the rate at which the tube material breaks down in the body, not the rate at which tubes become colonized by microbes (Patel et\u00a0al. 2014). However, recent interest in the human microbiome has brought greater attention to the issue of microbial feeding tube contamination.",

Scanning electron microscopy has also shown milk residue and thick biofilms present inside many components of neonatal enteral feeding systems (Hurrell et\u00a0al. 2009; Gomez et\u00a0al. 2016; Petersen, Greisen and Krogfelt 2016).

Bacterial strains growing in feeding tubes have been documented as the cause of infections in other infants in the NICU, even those without feeding tubes (Mehall et\u00a0al. 2002b). The potential for bacteria to spread from one patient's feeding tube to other patients is of particular concern as many of the strains isolated from feeding tubes are resistant to a wide array of antimicrobial agents (Hurrell et\u00a0al. 2009). Antimicrobial resistance is a particular problem in the NICU environment because of the high rates of antimicrobial use in premature infants and the enrichment of antimicrobial resistance in exposed individuals (Gasparrini et\u00a0al. 2016). In this way, feeding tubes may serve as reservoirs of pathogens that can be transmitted between patients by NICU healthcare providers (Mehall et\u00a0al. 2002b; Alkeskas et\u00a0al. 2015).",

However, the sharing of bacterial strains between infants in the NICU suggests that these bacteria are dispersed by healthcare workers and environmental fomites (Alkeskas et\u00a0al. 2015; Gomez et\u00a0al. 2016). The species of bacteria found in feeding tubes are also more commonly associated with nosocomial pathogens than gastric flora (Mehall et\u00a0al. 2002a). It is also possible that some contaminants originate in the breast milk and formula delivered through feeding tubes, as these sources of nutrition are generally not sterile (Gomez et\u00a0al. 2016).",

The biofilms found on neonatal enteral feeding tubes are known to be primarily Staphylococcus species and Enterobacteriaceae (Hurrell et\u00a0al. 2009). However, prior studies did not consider the biogeography of feeding tubes. The microbiome of the esophagus is known to differ from that of the stomach (Hunt and Yaghoobi 2017), creating the potential for the microbial composition of the biofilm found on feeding tubes to differ in the region that reaches the stomach from other sections of the feeding tube as a result of exposure to different microbiomes. The gastric portion of the feeding tube is known to carry the same strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterobacter hormaechei as is found in infant stool, and these strains are known to carry antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) (Ogrodzki et\u00a0al. 2017). Differences in biofilm composition between regions of neonatal feeding tubes have not been investigated and our understanding of the relationship between feeding tube biofilm composition and gut microbiota is limited. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial composition of biofilms in the gastric, esophageal, and pharyngeal regions of feeding tubes removed from NICU patients, as well as to characterize the bacteria transferred to liquid passing through these same tubes. Whole metagenomic sequencing (WGS) was used to characterize the ARGs present in a subset of gastric and esophageal regions of feeding tubes, and a subset of infant feces.",

To sample the tube contents, each tube was flushed with 1\u00a0mL sterile PBS followed by 0.5\u00a0mL of air, and the effluent was collected in a sterile container. The effluent was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10\u2009000 rcf and the supernatant was removed until \u223c0.2\u00a0mL of solution remained, which was used for the DNA extraction. To prepare each tube for DNA extraction, 3 cm segments were removed with sterile scalpels (a new scalpel for each section), split lengthwise and cut into approximately 2 mm pieces. The pharyngeal sample was the 3 cm section beginning 5 cm below the point where the tube exited the body (tube insertion depth). The esophageal sample was the 3 cm section beginning 8 cm above the tube end and ending 5 cm above the tube end. The gastric sample was the final 3 cm of the tube (Fig.\u00a01). The same tube was used to collect effluent and tube sections. There is a possibility that flushing the tube with PBS will disseminate bacteria along the tube; however, should this dissemination occur with PBS it would likely also occur with the breast milk or formula fed to infants. Therefore, flushing the tube with PBS is not expected to change the bacterial communities detected in a manner different from what occurs with routine infant feeding. In addition, the exterior of a subset of tubes was wiped thoroughly with ethanol before collecting the tube effluent and sectioning the tube. The tubes selected for wiping were collected from infants who provided the most total feeding tubes to allow comparison between wiped and unwiped tubes.",

Sequences were then rarefied to the read depth of the sample with the fewest reads using the vegan package (Dixon 2003; Oksanen et\u00a0al. 2017). Correlation between feeding tube sections and fecal samples in all phyla and all families that had a median relative abundance >0% were tested using Kendall's tau. This analysis excluded samples where a matching sample was not available, e.g. a correlation between stool samples and the pharyngeal tube section will exclude the pharyngeal tube section from an infant who did not have a stool sample collected on the day or just after the feeding tube was removed. Alpha diversity (the within sample diversity, e.g. the total number of different species detected in a sample and their evenness) was analyzed using the Shannon index by Generalized Estimating Equation models using the vegan (Oksanen et\u00a0al. 2017) and gee (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gee) R packages to test for associations between alpha diversity and clinical parameters using a backwards elimination approach. Included parameters were tube section, day of life at collection, milk type, tube in-dwelling duration, gestational age, infant given acid suppressors, infant history of sepsis, infant history of NEC, infant history of intestinal perforation and whether the infant received antibiotics at birth.

Samples with a sequencing depth of less than 1500 reads after excluding RSVs detected in the kit control samples were excluded from additional analysis, leaving 378 samples included in the study (73 pharyngeal tube sections, 66 esophageal tube sections, 69 gastric tube sections, 81 tube contents and 89 stool samples). Samples were rarefied to 1528 reads, which was the read depth of the lowest included sample after excluding kit contamination associated RSVs. There were 34 tube samples from 4 infants included in the wiped and unwiped tube comparison.",

In addition, some sequences were identified in tube sections and stool samples did not classify as any bacterial phylum. The phyla present were generally similar between stool samples and feeding tube sections (Fig.\u00a02). Only three phyla had a median relative abundance greater than zero: Actinobacteria (0.13% median relative abundance), Firmicutes (51% median relative abundance) and Proteobacteria (35% median relative abundance). After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison, only the correlation of phylum Actinobacteria between stool samples and pharyngeal tube sections was non-significant. All other phyla level correlations between stool samples and tube sections and between the different tube sections were significant (Table\u00a02). The correlation between different tube sections was generally stronger than the correlation between tube sections and stool samples. In the wiped and unwiped tube comparison subset, there were only four phyla detected: Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Thermi. Phylum Thermi was detected at low levels (\u223c1% relative abundance) in only a single wiped sample. The other three phyla were detected in all samples, suggesting that the phyla present in the wiped and unwiped tubes are generally similar.",

Of these, only four families had median relative abundance greater than zero: Enterococcaceae (median relative abundance of 0.26%), Streptococcaceae (2.8%), Staphylococcaceae (3.1%) and Enterobacteriaceae (18%). At the family level, only the correlation of family Staphylococcaceae between stool samples and esophageal tube sections was non-significant after Bonferroni correction. All other tested correlations at the family level were significant (Table\u00a02). In the wiped and unwiped tube comparison subset, there were 27 different families detected. Of these, 15 families were found in both the wiped and unwiped tubes, 8 families were found in only the wiped tubes and 4 families were found only in the unwiped tubes. Of these, 4 of the families in only the wiped tubes and 3 of the families in only the unwiped tubes were present in only a single sample at a relative abundance of less than 1%. Family Chromatiaceae was present in two wiped tube samples from two different infants at a relative abundance of less than 1%. Family Clostridiaceae was present in three samples from three different wiped feeding tubes collected from two infants at a relative abundance of less than 1%. Family Thermaceae was present at a relative abundance of 1.2% from a single wiped tube sample. Family Planococcaceae was present at a relative abundance of 1.9% from a single wiped tube sample. Finally, family Xanthomonadaceae was present at a relative abundance of 6.9% in a single unwiped tube sample. Overall, the bacteria detected in the wiped and unwiped tubes were generally similar at the family level.",

These phyla have been previously reported as the most abundant components of bacterial populations in NICU patient feeding tubes, enteral feeding system extension tubing and neonates\u2019 gastroesophageal microbiota (Mehall et\u00a0al. 2002a; Matlow et\u00a0al. 2003; Hurrell et\u00a0al. 2009; Milisavljevic et\u00a0al. 2013; Gomez et\u00a0al. 2016; Petersen Greisen and Krogfelt 2016). Similar to previous studies, staphylococci, enterococci and Enterobacteriaceae were identified as the most abundant types of bacteria in NICU enteral feeding systems and the neonatal gastroesophageal microbiome (Mehall et\u00a0al. 2002a; Milisavljevic et\u00a0al. 2013; Gomez et\u00a0al. 2016; Petersen, Greisen and Krogfelt 2016). In addition, this study found frequent colonization with streptococci. As NICUs may have very different background colonization of the preterm infant gut microbiome (Taft et\u00a0al. 2014), the streptococci found in feeding tubes in our study may reflect natural variation in colonization patterns between NICUs. In a previous bacterial surface colonization study in this NICU we found sporadically elevated relative abundances of streptococci on neonate-associated surfaces (Bokulich, Mills and Underwood 2013).",

This result suggests that the patient gut, rather than the hospital environment, is the main factor shaping feeding tube biofilm composition as skin is the dominant source of microbes in the NICU hospital environment (Brooks et\u00a0al. 2018), and the dominant taxa in the feeding tubes correlated with gut microbes. This supports the hypothesis that the bacteria in feeding tubes originate from the gut microbiome, possibly colonizing the tube when gastric content is aspirated by healthcare providers prior to feeding (Hurrell et\u00a0al. 2009; Petersen, Greisen and Krogfelt 2016). Previous studies have identified the same strains of bacteria in neonates\u2019 feeding tubes as in their stool and shown that these strains can carry the same resistance phenotype, further evidence of a close relationship between feeding tube and gut microbiota (Gomez et\u00a0al. 2016; Petersen, Greisen and Krogfelt 2016; Ogrodzki et\u00a0al. 2017). Furthermore, the microbes comprising the biofilm found on different tube sections and the microbes found in the tube contents were correlated with each other, suggesting that at least the major taxa found in feeding tubes remain at similar levels across the entire tube.",

Checking the gastric aspirate involves drawing fluid from the stomach all the way up the feeding tube, thereby exposing the entire length of the feeding tube to the gastric microbiota. This mechanism of tube inoculation could also explain why no differences in bacterial populations were observed between the gastric section and other sections of the tube, despite the reduced pH in the stomach. Alternatively, this apparent lack of effect due to stomach acid could be caused by neonates\u2019 often elevated gastric pH (Hurrell et\u00a0al. 2009). Further support for the conclusion that tube communities originate from infant microbes is that the alpha diversity of tube sections increased with infant age, even with tube dwell time included in the model. The alpha diversity of infant microbiomes increases with age as more species join the gut community (Hill et\u00a0al. 2017); however, the number of environmental species of bacteria to which a feeding tube is exposed would not necessarily be expected to change as infants grow older.",

                    "text": "In contrast with these results, PERMANOVA analysis based on unweighted UniFrac found significant differences in the communities by feeding tube section, and the results of the non-metric multidimensional ordination suggest that the detected differences may be driven primarily by the difference between stool samples and the feeding tube sections. As unweighted UniFrac distance is heavily influenced by rare taxa, this suggests that while the major taxa are similar between stool samples and feeding tube sections, the rarer taxa diverge between these sample sets. Whether this difference represents species present in the feeding tubes not present in the gut, species present in the gut not present in feeding tubes, differences in minor species in different sections of the feeding tubes or all of these factors remains unclear. Despite the correlation in taxa and the association of tube alpha diversity with infant age, the causal nature of the relationship between taxa in feeding tubes and taxa present in stool also remains unsettled. Even though the differences between the infant stool samples and the feeding tube samples may be driven by the presence of rare species, these differences may have important implications for infant health because the overlap in the resistome between infant stool samples and feeding tube sections is low. This lack of overlap suggests that feeding tubes are a source of exposure to ARGs that are not already a part of the infant gut microbiome. As biofilms are sites of increased horizontal gene transfer (Madsen et\u00a0al. 2012; Juma and Forsythe 2015), the presence of ARGs in feeding tubes not found in infant stool samples potentially increases the risk of additional infant gut carriage of resistant organisms. The carriage of antimicrobial resistance organisms is associated with increased risk of severe infection and death (Kluytmans, van Belkum and Verbrugh 1997; Lautenbach et\u00a0al. 2001; Molbak 2004), potentially exacerbating the already increased risk of infection experienced by preterm infants.",

As such, shorter dwell times for feeding tubes may reduce the number of taxa infants who are exposed through feeding tubes; and as tubes carried distinct resistomes from infant stool samples, this could reduce infant exposure to ARGs. However, feeding tube biofilms form in a matter of hours, replacing feeding tubes causes measurable pain and distress, and the tube insertion procedure comes with its own risks (Kristoffersen et al. 2011). Accordingly, the problem of feeding tube contamination likely cannot be entirely solved by more frequent feeding tube changes, and more research is needed to understand where the ARGs present in feeding tubes originate and under which circumstances those genes may incorporate into the infant resistome.",
