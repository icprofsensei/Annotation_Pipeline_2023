The Chao1 index summarizes microbial diversity (richness) per sample, accounting for rare species that might have been missed due to undersampling. The Shannon index is a measure of entropy, taking into account species richness and evenness in the sample. These indices were compared between patients and controls in linear regression models using age, sex, and geography as covariates. Moreover, to estimate the dissimilarity of microbial communities among groups, measures of \u03b2\u2010diversity were calculated on the entire OTU matrix by unweighted UniFrac 22 using the scripts \u201cbeta_diversity_through_plots.py\u201d and \u201ccompare_categories.py\u201d of the QIIME software 21. Beta\u2010diversity measures were compared across groups using principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). PCoA is a technique to visualize distances (dissimilarities) between samples in a lower\u2010dimensional space. PERMANOVA compares groups and assesses whether the centroids or dispersion of points are similar between 2 groups, basing its significance test on random permutation of the points in the groups. Measures of \u03b2\u2010diversity, as opposed to \u03b1\u2010diversity, take into account the distance of OTUs along the phylogenetic tree.",

Since microbiota data are expressed as relative abundances of the OTUs, the sum of which equals 100% for each sample, they cannot be analyzed using standard statistical techniques 17, 27, 28. Rather, the analysis should be based on log ratios of the individual parts with the geometric mean of the sample, according to the framework of compositional data analysis 27, 28. This analysis was performed using the package \u201ccompositions\u201d in R statistical software. Since it is impossible to take the logarithm of zero, zeros were imputed by means of robust imputation using the package \u201crobCompositions,\u201d as specified in the literature 29, 30. Next, the log ratio\u2013transformed OTU relative abundances were analyzed using principal components analysis (PCA), showing differences between Italian and Dutch patient samples, but not between Roman and Genovese patient samples (see Supplementary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40827/abstract). Therefore, samples from Italian and Dutch patients were analyzed separately. Likewise, baseline, inactive disease, and persistent activity samples were analyzed separately. A random forest classification model was utilized to classify Italian patient samples taken at baseline and control samples, using the microbiota composition, age, and sex as covariates. To this end, the data were split at random into 70% for model training and 30% for model testing. The best model was selected in the training set, using 10\u2010fold cross\u2010validation repeated 10 times. This model was then applied to the test set to assess its performance.

Figure\u00a04 shows the regression coefficients and false coverage rate\u2013corrected CIs in comparison with those obtained in the analysis of baseline samples. Erysipelotrichaceae and F prausnitzii were increased in both baseline and inactive disease samples compared to healthy controls, whereas Allobaculum and P acnes were decreased. Enterococcus, Gemellaceae, Parabacteroides, Ruminococcaceae, and Turicibacter showed differences at baseline, but not in inactive disease, whereas Bacteroides caccae, Barnesiellaceae, and Dorea showed differences in inactive disease samples, but not at baseline. A paired analysis of selected OTUs was performed in 24 Italian patients who contributed a sample at baseline and a follow\u2010up sample during inactive disease, showing no differences between baseline and inactive disease (see Supplementary Figure 2, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40827/abstract). However, \u0251\u2010diversity was lower in inactive disease in this subset of patients (P = 0.007 by Wilcoxon's signed rank test) (see Supplementary Figure 3, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40827/abstract). No evidence for differences between samples from Dutch patients with inactive disease and healthy controls was found (see Supplementary Table 7, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40827/abstract).",

Likewise, a sensitivity analysis was performed after excluding patients with a gastrointestinal disorder (sensitivity analysis B), and showed no substantial differences. To explore potential confounding even further, we selected all samples within the same age range from among Italian patients at baseline and healthy controls (age range 2\u201315 years), simultaneously excluding those who took antibiotics, prebiotics or probiotics, or who experienced gastrointestinal disorders (sensitivity analysis C), and this analysis showed no substantial differences (see Supplementary Tables 10\u201313, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40827/abstract). A further analysis was performed calculating log ratios using simple multiplicative replacement of zeros in the data 29 instead of robust imputation, without major differences (data not shown). Finally, for completeness, a comparison of all OTUs (including those present in <20% of samples) between Italian patients at baseline and healthy controls was performed; the results are reported in Supplementary Table 3 (available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40827/abstract).",

The results of our study support the hypothesis that the composition of microbiota is different in JIA patients compared to healthy children. In our study, evidence was found that microbiota richness, in terms of rare OTUs as measured by the Chao1 index, was reduced in JIA patients compared to healthy controls, at baseline, during inactive disease, and during persistent disease activity, especially in Italian subjects. Dutch female patients showed an increased richness compared to Dutch female healthy controls, who had a decreased richness compared to all other control groups (Figure\u00a01A). Measures of \u03b2\u2010diversity were different in all subgroups of patient samples compared to healthy controls, demonstrating the variability of microbial communities between groups. Differences in gut microbiota composition were observed between JIA patients at baseline and healthy children, both when classifying samples using the random forest algorithm (AUCs in test data >0.99 for Italian samples and 0.71 for Dutch samples, despite the Dutch samples not reaching traditional levels of significance in test data) and when analyzing the OTUs individually. Most notably, Erysipelotrichaceae and F prausnitzii were increased, while Allobaculum was decreased, in samples from Italian patients (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a04). Dutch patient samples were dissimilar to Italian patient samples, confirming the prior belief that the gut microbiota composition differs between these populations, due potentially to diet and other environmental factors. However, it could not be ruled out that the observed differences were due to different sample collection procedures used in the Italian and Dutch cohorts.",

This finding may indicate that the gut microbiota profile is specific to the individuals with JIA, rather than disease activity status. However, it should be taken into account that JIA is very heterogeneous clinically, and different diseases may be underlying the clinical symptoms. Therefore, this conclusion is still preliminary. Finally, the results also indicated a strong relationship of the microbiota composition with age, as found previously 32, 33.",

                    "text": "In light of these results, we ask whether the microbiota composition is involved in the pathogenesis of JIA. Observations compatible with a pathogenic role of microbiota include a reduced number of Th17\u2010 and FoxP3\u2010positive regulatory T cells in germ\u2010free mice 1, 2, 10, 11. Administration of stools from healthy mice to these germ\u2010free mice led to a reconstitution of Th17 numbers 34, suggesting that microbiota influence the development of the immune system. Conversely, inoculation of fecal samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients into mice led to an increase of Th17 cells and development of severe arthritis 3. These cell populations are of critical importance in immune homeostasis and play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including JIA 2, 35. Additionally, in a cohort of patients with the enthesitis\u2010related arthritis (ERA) subtype of JIA compared to healthy controls, differences in community structure were predicted to decrease metabolic functions. In the same cohort, a lower diversity of ions and underrepresentation of the tryptophan metabolic pathway was observed in patients 36. Tryptophan metabolites can lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, thus potentially linking the gut microbiota with inflammation 36. In another cohort of ERA patients, predicted functions of the gut microbiota were related to cell motility and chemotaxis 12. Furthermore, the risk of developing autoimmune disorders was increased following the use of antibiotics in early childhood. This risk was dependent on the number, dose, and timing of the antibiotic prescriptions 37, 38. Our finding of a weak association with uveitis is consistent with the previous finding in mouse models that activation of retina\u2010specific T cells was dependent on gut commensal microbiota 39.",

Erysipelotrichaceae appears to be highly immunogenic 45, 46 and can potentially overgrow in the gut after treatment with broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics 47. F prausnitzii was identified to have antiinflammatory properties, and a decreased abundance of this microorganism in the gut has been associated with Crohn's disease 48 and JIA 12, 14. Yet in our study it was increased in Italian patients at baseline. However, previous studies examined ERA only, whereas our cohort contained a majority of patients with oligoarticular and polyarticular disease. Furthermore, previous studies did not use compositional data analysis when comparing OTUs between groups. Finally, the balance among different subspecies of F prausnitzii can result in changes in short\u2010chain fatty acid production; therefore, a fine\u2010level characterization of F prausnitzii strains is important to better understand their real function in the microbiome 49. Such a fine\u2010level characterization was not available in our study. Another possibility is that F prausnitzii was increased as an effect, rather than a cause, of inflammation. Allobaculum is associated with obesity. Several studies have demonstrated that its abundance was lower in the gut of obese mice 50, 51 and increased in weight\u2010reduced mice 52. Furthermore, Allobaculum was positively correlated with plasma high\u2010density lipoprotein concentrations in hamsters 53 and negatively correlated with leptin concentration 52.",
