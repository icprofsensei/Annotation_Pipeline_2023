However, relatively little is known about the impact of environmental factors on the developing human gut microbiome. Here we report a longitudinal study of the gut microbiome based on DNA sequence analysis of monthly stool samples and clinical information from 39 children, approximately half of whom received multiple courses of antibiotics during the first three years of life. While the gut microbiome of most vaginally born children was dominated by Bacteroides species, we found that all four children born by Cesarean section and approximately 20% of vaginally born children lacked Bacteroides in the first six to eighteen months. Our longitudinal sampling, coupled with whole-genome shotgun sequencing, allowed us to detect strain-level variation as well as the abundance of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. The microbiota of antibiotic-treated children was less diverse at the level of both species and strains, with some species often dominated by single strains. In addition, we observed short-term composition changes between consecutive samples from children treated with antibiotics. AR genes carried on microbial chromosomes showed a strong peak in abundance after antibiotic treatment followed by a sharp decline, whereas some genes on mobile elements persisted longer after the end of antibiotic therapy. Our results highlight the value of dense longitudinal studies with high-resolution strain profiles in studying the establishment and response to perturbation of the infant gut microbiome.",

The majority of these studies have attempted to infer the natural history based on cross-sectional datasets comparing multiple children at a single time point. These cross-sectional observations have reported that birth mode (vaginal vs. Cesarean section) affects gut microbiome composition in the first six months of life (29-31) and that the gut microbiome of children matures by the age of three years (32). More recently, a longitudinal study analyzing four time points during the first year of life reported that birth mode and nutrition influence gut microbiome composition at the level of bacterial species (33). However, no longitudinal studies have analyzed the developing gut microbiome with dense sampling or detailed analysis at the level of strains within species. In addition, despite widespread use of antibiotics in children, the effect of antibiotic exposure on the developing infant gut microbiome remains unexplored. The high prevalence of antibiotic use and concurrent increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, coupled with our growing appreciation of the microbiota role in human health, highlights a critical need to understand the short and long-term effects of repeated antibiotic treatments on the gut microbiome.",

During this time period, 20 of the children received 9-15 antibiotic treatments, while the remaining 19 children never received antibiotics. We performed both 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome shotgun sequencing to analyze microbial diversity at all taxonomic levels, including genus, species, and strain. In addition to gaining insight on how the gut microbiome develops when unperturbed by antibiotics, metagenomic sequencing of samples before and after antibiotic exposure allowed us to explore changes in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes. We found decreased microbial diversity and increased short-term composition changes in the gut microbiomes of antibiotic-treated children. Furthermore, we observed an increased abundance of antibiotic resistance genes following treatment, along with concurrent increases in specific bacteria likely harboring these genes.",

We collected multiple clinical metadata variables per child (Materials and Methods) and focused on a subset of variables (mode of delivery, breastfeeding, infant diet) that have been reported in previous studies to affect the infant gut microbiome (29, 30, 33). Of the 39 children tested, 19 received no antibiotics (Abx\u2212 children) and the remaining 20 children received 9-15 antibiotic courses in their first three years of life (Abx+ children; Fig. 1A). All courses consisted of systemic antibiotics given orally, most commonly to treat otitis media (ear infections, 91% of courses) and respiratory infections (6%). To analyze the composition of the microbial communities in this cohort, we isolated DNA from stool samples and amplified and sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequences were sorted into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (Materials and Methods) and the results were integrated to construct genus-level composition maps for all 1,069 samples. We identified 142 genera across the samples, 36 of which were found at a relative abundance greater than 1% in at least 25 samples. We selected 240 samples for whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing (triangles in Fig. 1A) based on two criteria: (1) samples from all children at ages 2, 12, 24, and 36 months, and (2) at least four samples before and after selected antibiotic treatments (with minimal additional treatments in this time period). WGS sequencing allowed us to identify bacterial species within the genera (1\u201325 species per genus). In addition, we could often use the WGS data to infer the strain composition within those species (1\u201310 strains per species) by mapping the reads to the species reference sequences and analyzing the frequencies of multiple polymorphism sites across time for each child. Finally, we used the WGS data to determine the presence and quantify the abundance of specific genes, including antibiotic resistance genes.",

The microbial trajectory (namely, the succession of bacterial populations in the gut communities) showed multiple similarities across all infants, several of which have been observed in previous studies (21, 23). For example, at the family level, nearly all infants (87%) had significant levels of Enterobacteriaceae (average relative abundance 25%), Bifidobacteriaceae (average 15%), and Clostridiaceae (average 8%) at age two months, with each family steadily decreasing to an average relative abundance of 1%, 3%, and 2.5%, respectively, by the age of 18 months. In contrast, members of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families were barely present at two months (average relative abundance of 4% and 0%, respectively) and increased in the first 12 months before stabilizing at 12\u201320% of the microbial community (Fig. 1B). In family-level measurements, a single genus often accounted for most of their abundance (fig. S1). For example, members of the Bifidobacterium and Clostridium genera were present in most children in the first few months (average relative abundance of 16% and 7%, respectively) and decreased over time to nearly zero by 18 months of age (fig. S1). The opposite pattern was observed for two notable beneficial commensal bacteria (34, 35). Akkermansia muciniphila (a mucin-degrading bacterium) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were absent at age two months but appeared in most children by months 24 and 12, stabilizing at 2% and 3% abundance, respectively (fig. S1).",

Cross-sectional comparisons of breastfed and formula-fed children have reported a positive association between the total abundance of various Bifidobacterium species and the length of breastfeeding (29). All of the children in our study were breastfed for some period of time. On average, the breastfeeding period correlated with higher abundance of Bifidobacterium species (fig. S2); however, this longitudinal cohort of Finnish children did include some infants who had low abundance of these species even during the breastfeeding period (fig. S2). In addition, previous studies by Ley and others (36) (reviewed in (37)) have reported that the Bacteroides genus is absent prior to the introduction of solid food. However, many individuals in our cohort showed a significant Bacteroides species presence at the earliest time points, prior to the introduction of solid food (fig. S3). Specifically, the median relative abundance of the Bacteroides genus prior to introduction of solid food was 47%.",

For this purpose, we compared the microbial composition of all sample pairs from the same child by calculating the Jaccard index (Materials and Methods). Simply stated, the Jaccard index measures the fraction of shared OTUs between two samples, such that higher values indicate greater similarity. We found that the infant gut microbiota developed continuously and the composition of a child at any given age was more similar to adjacent samples from the same child versus age-matched samples from unrelated children (fig. S4). However, adjacent samples of the same child in the first 6 months of age were not as similar as adjacent samples in older ages, indicating that the community developed most rapidly in the first six months of life (fig. S4).",

Previous studies have reported that children born by Cesarean section initially lack members of the Bacteroides genus in their gut microbiome, in contrast to vaginally born children (30, 38, 39). We did indeed observe that members of the Bacteroides genus were undetectable in the guts of children born by Cesarean section (4/39) , and that this genus was detected for the first time only between 6 and 18 months of age (dark blue, Fig. 1C-E and fig. S5A). However, we unexpectedly found that a substantial proportion of vaginally born children (7/35) also exhibited this \u201clow-Bacteroides\u201d signature (Fig. 1E and fig. S5A), an observation that has not been previously reported. The low-Bacteroides signature was not associated with any clinical variables surrounding the delivery of the child, including antibiotic treatments of the mothers, gestational age, duration of delivery, use of enemas prior to delivery, or time spent at the hospital. We denote the group of 11 children (4 born by Cesarean section, and 7 vaginally born with a Cesarean section signature) as the low-Bacteroides group (see Materials and Methods for exact criteria).",

On average, children from the low-Bacteroides group had a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium species in the first 6 months of life compared to all other individuals (fig. S5B). It is possible that the Bifidobacterium species occupy the niche left open by the lack of Bacteroides. Functionally, Bacteroides are major contributors to the breakdown of human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) (40). Using our metagenomic data, we quantified the relative contribution of each species to this function, revealing that Bifidobacterium were the main contributors to HMO breakdown in the low-Bacteroides group, whereas the Bacteroides species were the dominant contributors for all other children (fig. S5C).",

We measured richness (alpha diversity) by calculating the Chao1 metric (Materials and Methods) for each of the 1,069 samples. On average, the Abx\u2212 children had a richer microbial community compared to the Abx+ children; however, the difference was relatively modest and was evident only after the first year of life (fig. S6A). Additionally, the low-Bacteroides signature was associated with a further decrease in alpha diversity, which was evident by six months of age (fig. S6). Previous studies have suggested that children born by Cesarean section have less diverse gut microbiomes (30, 38); however, we found decreased alpha diversity in low-Bacteroides children irrespective of mode of delivery.",

Using the 240 metagenomes that we obtained at both regular intervals and surrounding antibiotic treatments, we evaluated diversity at the strain level using ConStrains (41). In brief, this approach recruits metagenomic reads on a set of unique genes per species (42) and infers the strain composition and their relative abundance from detected single nucleotide polymorphism sites (SNPs) (commonly 1-10 strains per species). At the strain level, the difference in diversity of the Abx+ children's gut microbiomes became more evident. Within each species, we measured the strain diversity by calculating the diversity index using the probability of observing each strain within the species (Materials and Methods), and defined a species as dominated by a single strain if this score was lower than 0.1. The microbiota of the Abx+ children had significantly more species dominated by a single strain compared to the Abx\u2212 children (P = 1.38e-9; Fig. 2A-C).",

To attempt to determine the origin of the dominant strains in the Abx+ children, we investigated the differences among strains in each individual. For each species, we measured the difference between all of its strains both within and across all children by calculating the number of common SNPs between pairs of strains. Using this mutation-distance matrix, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of all the strains of each species, where the mutation distances are represented by the branch lengths (Fig. 2D), and compared the distance of strains within and across all children (Fig. 2E). To quantify the difference among the various strains in a species within a given individual, we calculated the median branch length of the strains to their most recent common ancestor (MRCA, colored nodes, Fig. 2D). To quantify the difference between strains of unrelated individuals, we calculated the median branch length from the MRCA to the MRCA of all other individuals (Materials and Methods; fig. S7). Using these phylogenetic strain metrics, we observed two patterns in strain-similarity measures. For some species, the strains within an individual were much more closely related to one another than they were to strains in other individuals. This pattern is consistent with the introduction of a single species, followed by evolution within the individual. Note that the single-colonization pattern may reflect multiple exposures, but only a single colonization event. In these cases, children were likely exposed to various strains of this species, but only a single strain robustly colonized their gut. Species with this pattern (referred to as \u2018single-colonization species\u2019) included Escherichia coli, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides fragilis, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (Fig. 2D-E, left and fig. S7, S8). In contrast, for other species such as Bacteroides vulgatus, some strains within an individual were more closely related to strains in other individuals (Fig. 2D-E, right). This pattern is referred to as \u2018multiple-colonization species\u2019 and is consistent with the introduction and colonization of multiple distinct strains into an individual, potentially over time.",

Recent population-wide studies have identified members of the Clostridium clusters 4 and 14a as inducers of T regulatory immune cells (45), and we focused on this group of species as an illustrative example. We found that at the age of three, the total abundance of species from these clusters differed significantly between the Abx\u2212 and Abx+ children (P = 0.037, fig. S8). This difference was largely due to Eubacterium rectale, one of the most abundant members of this group (P = 0.031, fig. S8). Furthermore, when we examined the E. rectale strain-level differences within each individual, we found that strains within Abx+ children were as different as strains from unrelated individuals (fig. S8). One potential explanation for these observations is that E. rectale is a \u2018single-colonization species\u2019 for Abx\u2212 children; however, E. rectale was likely introduced multiple times but did not persist in at least some Abx+ children.",

In each case, we also identified a bacterial species that showed a strongly correlated change in abundance, which was likely to harbor the resistance gene (Fig. 4B). A notable example followed penicillin treatment in subject E021822 at 5 months (Fig. 4A, left panel), where we detected an increase in a Klebsiella pneumoniae beta-lactamase resistance gene. In this example, the sharp increase of the beta-lactamase gene (from 0 to 4000 rpkm) correlated perfectly with an increase in the relative abundance of K. pneumoniae (from 0% to 22%; Fig. 4B, left panel); both the gene and species decreased to nearly zero abundance in the sample from the following month. Another example is the increase of a tolC antibiotic efflux gene (from 0 to 100 rpkm) in subject E021940 at age 6 months (Fig. 4A, middle panel) that is tightly correlated with an increase of E. coli, which is annotated as the host of this gene (from 4% to 24%, Fig. 4B, middle panel). A third example (subject E020924 at 8 months) involves the tet32 resistance gene, which is annotated as belonging to an unclassified Clostridiaceae bacterium (K10). Indeed, we observed that the relative abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus (a Clostridiaceae species) increased to a remarkable 97% at that time point, consistent with the tet32 gene being associated with this species (Fig. 4B, right panel).",

Specifically, their abundance increased upon antibiotic treatment, but did not decrease sharply upon withdrawal of the antibiotic. Instead, the presence of the antibiotic resistance genes continued for much longer periods of time (Fig. 4C). This might be explained by the fact that episomally encoded elements can be broadly distributed across multiple species, whereas chromosomally encoded elements are non-mobile and could impose a significant fitness cost on the single host species.",

The reason for the increased abundance of these genes is unclear. Possible explanations could include (1) response to antibiotics passed on to the child from the environment (e.g., mothers\u2019 breast milk); (2) a response to a natural antibiotic molecule produced by other gut bacteria; or (3) pre-existing presence of the antibiotic resistance gene in the genomes of some early inhabitants of the gut (48). The last explanation would be consistent with the spread of antibiotic resistance through natural populations due to widespread use of antibiotics. Additional studies will be needed to determine the explanation for the early presence of antibiotic resistance genes.",

                    "text": "Infants in the first six months of life showed one of two microbial signatures based on the abundance of Bacteroides species. There have been contradictory reports in the literature regarding the typical microbial profile in infants. Multiple studies have shown that children born by Cesarean section have a low-Bacteroides signature, whereas children born vaginally have higher levels of Bacteroides (30, 38, 39). Furthermore, one study (36) and a review (37) have described the low-Bacteroides signature as the typical profile for all children. Our study clearly demonstrates that the low-Bacteroides signature is not confined solely to children born by Cesarean section. While the low-Bacteroides signature was seen in all infants in our cohort born by Cesarean section, it was also observed in 7 of 35 (20%) children delivered vaginally. The differences cannot be explained by technical variation because the signal is extremely strong and long lasting: the abundance of Bacteroides species is exceptionally high (average 45%) and we observe it across multiple time points per child. We searched extensively for clinical variables that might explain the low-Bacteroides signature in vaginally born children (including exposure of mothers, length of delivery, and mother's use of enema prior to delivery), but with only seven children, we were unable to identify any variables that were statistically significantly correlated with the difference. Larger sample sizes may reveal the explanatory variable. Previous studies have shown that Cesarean section delivery is associated with decreased microbial diversity, even at two years of age (38). Our results critically expand this finding by demonstrating that the decrease in microbial diversity is seen across children with the low-Bacteroides signature regardless of their mode of birth. Interestingly, the decreased microbial diversity persisted, even at 36 months, when Bacteroides had become highly abundant in the low-Bacteroides children. The low-Bacteroides signature merits further study to identify its cause and to understand the implications of the associated decrease in microbial diversity.",

In ecology, repeated perturbations to an ecosystem are recognized as especially harmful when they recur before the ecosystem has had time to recover from an initial insult (51). In adults, the gut microbiome has been reported to recover from a single antibiotic exposure within approximately two weeks, but multiple treatments can cause this time frame to expand substantially (26, 50). We found that antibiotic-treated children had less stable gut microbiomes compared to untreated children. While the gut microbiome largely appeared to return to baseline within one month based on our taxonomic classification, we cannot exclude longer-term effects that are not captured by our measures. Sub-therapeutic antibiotic doses lead to increased body mass in both farm animals (52) and laboratory mice (53), however despite the repeated antibiotic treatment in children examined here, we did not observe any increase in body weight in the Abx+ children (median BMI at 36 months for the Abx+ and Abx\u2212 children was 16.2 kg/m2 and 16.0 kg/m2, respectively; P = 0.69). More detailed analysis of both gut microbiome and host will be required to understand long-term effects of antibiotic exposure.",

Following antibiotic exposures, we observed two alternative patterns for AR gene abundance depending on their genomic context: (1) genes carried on the microbial chromosome tended to show a strong peak in abundance following treatment, followed by a sharp decline, and (2) genes on mobile elements tended to persist much longer after antibiotic withdrawal. Where these genes originated remains unclear, indeed, we detected the presence of AR genes in 2-month-old infants, prior to any antibiotic exposure. Previous studies have also reported that some newborn infants harbor AR genes (54, 55), potentially acquired from their mothers (54). Moreover, AR genes have been found in the guts of Amerindian adults (48) as well as a South American mummy (56), even in the absence of any known exposure to commercial antibiotics. Regardless of their origin, our data suggest that the genomic context of the AR gene may influence its spread and persistence upon exposure to antibiotics. Given the growing prevalence of antibiotic treatments and the frequency at which children exchange microbiota, it is particularly important to understand the effects of childhood antibiotic exposure on the presence and spread of AR genes in the community.",
