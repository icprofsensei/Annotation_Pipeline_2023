Children with ASD are prone to dysregulation in the intestinal microbiota due to environmental and behavioral factors and because of the imperfect development of the immune system [4], especially the nervous immune system [5], thus, disorders of the gut microbiota may have a greater impact on children with ASD [6\u20138]. According to the above evidence, the gut microbiota from fecal samples of ASDs children and healthy control (HC) children was analyzed. Our results showed a significant difference in the microbial community composition between ASDs and HCs.

The abundance of Selenomonadales in the ASD group (0.069\u2009\u00b1\u20090.031) was significantly less than that in the HC group (7.423\u2009\u00b1\u20093.186) (t\u2009=\u20093.157, p\u2009=\u20090.0076) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1B-1).1B-1). The microbiota at the Order level is shown in Fig. \u200bFig.1A-3.1A-3. The average abundance was 1.0%. The abundance of 31 species was above the average in all 15 samples (Fig.\u00a01A-4). The average abundance of Ruminococcaceae was higher in the ASD group (25.378\u2009\u00b1\u20099.562) compared to that in the HC group (13.561\u2009\u00b1\u20098.313), (t\u2009=\u20092.463, p\u2009=\u20090.0285). The average abundance of Prevotellaceae (5.540\u2009\u00b1\u20098.836) in the ASD group was lower than that in the HC group (29.313\u2009\u00b1\u200921.913), (t\u2009=\u20092.957, p\u2009=\u20090.0111), as show in Fig. \u200bFig.1B-2.1B-2. The microbial composition at the Family level (relative abundance >1% in the 15 samples) is shown in Fig. \u200bFig.1A-4.1A-4. Bacteroides and Prevotella_9 were the most abundant genus across all samples.\n\n",

However, based on the differential analysis of gut microbiota of ASD and HC group, striking results were obtained. As regard the principal component analysis, ASD and HC children are distinguished in different quadrants, and they have distinct gut microbiota composition (Fig.\u00a02A).

The most abundant functional pathways are presented in Fig.\u00a03. Cluster analysis of the KEGG pathway revealed that the gut microbes differentially expressed in the ASD group are mostly representing the Organismal Systems pathway. In the analysis of this heat map, the sub-classification of the Organismal Systems difference between the ASD group and the HC group was found located in the Nervous System Pathway.

Although our results confirm that ASD was characterized by several changes in microbiota composition when compared with HCs, the results showed that the analysis might be affected by a variety of confounding factors, in which the severity of the disease itself has a certain impact on the results [11]. Our study was more concerned on the effects of gut microbiota imbalance on the nervous system and cognitive function of ASD and HC. ASD children abundance of Bacteroidales and Selenomonadales was significantly lower than that in normal children. The difference in the level of gut microbiota at the class level is remarkably significant for the host, which has also been reported in other studies related to the relationship between neurological lesions and gut microbiota [12]. The dysregulation of Bacteroidales and Selenomonadales affects intestinal secretion and in turn affects brain function through the vagal response [13]. The role of Bacteroidales is to maintain the immune regulation of intestinal mucosal cells such as CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells, CD8+ T cells and TLR responses, and they may also affect the development of host neurological function [14]. In addition, the within-group analysis according to ASD clinical features suggests the potential role of microbial composition (in particular Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae) and the differential effects of the gut microbiota that further affect the children.",

In the intestinal microbiota biodiversity analysis in the ASD children, the trend of HC concentration is significantly different, and in the alpha diversity analysis based on the biological microbiota, the trend of intestinal microbiota diversity reflecting ASD children is different from HCs [15, 16]. Because children\u2019s nervous system and immune system are not yet well developed, factors such as cesarean section and breastfeeding were consider because they have a significant impact on the microbial community of infants and young children, and these differences affect children\u2019s development [17, 18]. However, the baseline parameters of the children included in this study are referred to a small sample size and, thus, the results were not significant. However, in combination with the biological function prediction of KEGG, it was remarkable to notice that the imbalance of intestinal microbiota led to the inhibition of ASD nervous system and environmental information processes, in addition to the changes of Cellular Processes, which explained the influence of microbiota imbalance to some extent. Since the gut microbiota is controlled by the brain - gut axis, it affects the cognitive abilities of children with ASD and their responses to environmental information.",

Autism is also a disease that is affected by multiple genes and environmental factors. However, the impact of genetic factors is not considered in our present research. Thus, further studies with a larger sample and prospective follow-up study is needed. However, our results demonstrated that it might be possible to improve the state of the nervous system development in patients with ASD by altering the food intake of children with ASD, thus interfering in a positive manner with the composition of the gut microbiota [19\u201321].",
