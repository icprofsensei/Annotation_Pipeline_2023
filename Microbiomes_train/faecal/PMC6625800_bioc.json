Our ability to identify associations between gut microbes and diseases will be greatly improved with the continued establishment of well-powered population-based longitudinal studies coupled with the decreasing costs of DNA sequencing. In order to conduct these large-scale studies, standardized methods that provide reliable estimates need to be implemented.

Microbial communities are complex and constantly changing in response to their environment. Factors such as diet (11\u201314), use of antibiotics and other medications (15,16), and exposure to pathogens (17) can have a pronounced impact on bacteria residing in the gut and other anatomical sites. In the context of epidemiologic research, a microbiome with dramatic fluctuations over time could require multiple sample collections or increased sample sizes for longitudinal studies. Previous studies have evaluated variation of the fecal microbiome over time, but have involved small numbers of participants (18,19), variable sampling periods (20), or only Caucasian populations (21), which may limit generalizability. Here, we assessed the temporal variability of the fecal microbiome in 50 older adults from a multiethnic population with biannual sampling over a two-year period.",

The study design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics have been described previously (22). Briefly, 215,251 men and women between the ages of 45-75 from primarily five racial/ethnic groups (African-American, Japanese-American, Latino, Native Hawaiian, and white) were enrolled into the study from 1993-1996 by completing a self-administered 26-page mailed questionnaire. Over 1800 of these participants (aged 60-77) were recruited in 2013-2017 as part of the MEC Adiposity Phenotype Study (APS) to investigate the relationships between the exposome, genome, microbiome, and metabolome with body fat distribution. Exclusion criteria for the MEC-APS included reported BMI outside the range of 18.5-40 kg/m2; oral or injection antibiotic use in the past 3 months; current or recent (<2 years) smoking; flu shot or other vaccinations in the past month; substantial weight change (>20 lbs) in the past 6 months; soft or metal implants; ileostomy or colectomy; dialysis; insulin or thyroid medication; and any of the following procedures or treatments in the past 6 months: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, corticosteroid hormones, prescription weight-loss drugs, endoscopy or irrigation of the large intestine. Percent body fat was measured by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans (23). Fifty individuals were randomly selected from the APS participants to have an equal distribution by sex (25 male and 25 female), the five main ethnic groups within the MEC (10 African American, 10 Japanese American, 10 Native Hawaiian, 10 Latino, and 10 whites), and BMI categories (within each sex-ethnic group, one from each of 22-24.9, 25-26.9, 27-29.9, 30-34.9 kg/m2 and one either from 18.5-21.9 or 35-40 kg/m2) in which to conduct our longitudinal fecal microbiome study.

The 519R reverse PCR primer sequence was 5\u2019- GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG-3\u2019. A 25-cycle PCR was performed using the HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit (QIAGEN, USA) under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 28 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 53\u00b0C for 40 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute, after which a final elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes was performed. After amplification, PCR products were checked in 2% agarose gel to determine the success of amplification and the relative intensity of bands. Multiple PCR products were pooled together in equal proportions based on their molecular weight and DNA concentrations. Pooled samples were purified using calibrated Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA). The pooled and purified PCR products were used to prepare the Illumina DNA library using a ligation process (TruSeq Nano DNA LT, QIAGEN) which included Illumina adapters, pads, linkers and an 8 base pair (bp) barcode index. Sequencing was performed on the MiSeq using MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 following the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines to obtain 2\u00d7300 bp paired-end reads (Illumina, San Diego, CA). FastQ files were exported and securely transferred (BaseSpace, Illumina) to FHCRC for bioinformatic analysis.",

Sequences were joined with the fastq-join method, using min_overlap=15 and perc_max_diff=12. Sequences were filtered with split_libraries_fastq.py with q parameter set to 25, and defaults otherwise. The Nelson two-step method was used for operational taxonomic unit (OTU) generation at 97% similarity using the SILVA database (release 111, clustered at the 97% similarity level) for closed reference OTU picking following the UCLUST algorithm (26). The OTU table was filtered using the QIIME script filter_otus_from_otu_table.py with --min_count_fraction set to 0.00005 as recommended in Navas-Molina et al (27). Additional OTU entries were filtered out if they were detected as chimeras using QIIME\u2019s identify_chimeric_seqs.py script with the blast_fragments method (28). The sequences were classified using the matching SILVA taxonomy for OTUs found in the first step of the Nelson method, and MOTHUR\u2019s naive Bayesian Classifier (29,30) trained against the SILVA database (release 111, clustered at the 97% similarity level) for OTUs found in the second step. Sequences were aligned to the SILVA 16S rRNA gene reference alignment (31) using the NAST algorithm (32). Sequences that did not align to the appropriate 16S rRNA gene region were removed. The phylogenetic tree was constructed following the FastTree method (33). Sequence counts for each sample ranging from phylum to genus level were generated without rarefaction. Alpha diversity measures [phylogenetic diversity (34), Shannon index (35), Chao1 index (36)] and beta diversity matrices [unweighted and weighted UniFrac (37,38)] were calculated in QIIME based on the average of 10 sub-samples with rarefaction to 10,000 sequences per sample.",

ICCs were calculated by first fitting a linear mixed effects model with a random effect for participant using the \u2018lmer\u2019 function in the R package lme4 (42), and then dividing the between-individual variation by the total variation from the model using the \u2018icc\u2019 function in the R package sjstats. To assess the reliability of genera, we computed ICCs for abundances as well as presence/absence. ICCs for abundances were calculated using the approach described above. ICCs for presence/absence were calculated by first converting the genus abundance table to a presence/absence table by replacing all counts greater than 0 with 1. Any genus that was present in every sample was excluded as the ICC would be undefined due to no variation. Then, a generalized linear mixed effects model with a binomial distribution and a random effect for participant was fitted using the \u2018glmer\u2019 function in lme4 (43). ICCs were then computed using the \u2018icc\u2019 function in sjstats. For all ICC measures, reliability was considered excellent for ICC\u22650.75, good for 0.74\u2265ICC\u22650.60, fair for 0.59\u2265ICC\u22650.40, and poor for ICC\u22640.39 (44).",

Differences between the six-month and baseline samples for those not reporting antibiotic use were also included as a comparison. Changes in alpha diversity for each time interval was assessed using a one-sample t-test for a mean of zero. All analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.3.",

Antibiotic use explained a small but significant proportion of the overall fecal microbiome variation. The strongest and most variable effect on diversity generally occurred in the weeks following use, with samples more closely resembling pre-antibiotic levels in the months that followed. Sampling the fecal microbiome one year (51), and even four weeks after antibiotics (52), has shown return in alpha diversity to pre-treatment levels, although recovery varied for different taxa. Similarly, the ELDERMET study reported that alpha diversity among those who reported antibiotic use within the past month was not significantly different from those who did not (53). However, nine genera were found to be different when using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, as were Bifidobacterium levels when measured by culture. With frequent sampling, Dethlefsen et al. was able to show that adults undergoing courses of ciprofloxacin saw decreases in OTU richness, phylogenetic diversity, and Shannon index within 3-4 days of administration (15). Participants began to recover within a week after taking the antibiotic, although the time needed to reach a stable level varied among participants and alterations in the abundances of certain taxa were apparent. While the gut microbial community as a whole may be able to recover from antibiotics, lingering effects on specific taxa highlight the need for the development of antibiotics with more targeted effects as an alternative to those that act on a broad range of bacteria.",

We found that the fecal microbiome explained more variation in body fat among individuals who used antibiotics. Assuming that antibiotic use captured in our study reflects use before baseline (when percent body fat was measured), this finding might suggest a greater contribution by the altered microbial community structure to metabolic regulation and energy homeostasis. There is evidence that the type of antibiotic may have a different effect on overweight and obesity as well, since a longitudinal study by Bailey et al. (55) found an association between early-life exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics with obesity, but not for narrow-spectrum antibiotics.",

Our study also used 16S rRNA gene data. Additional studies measuring temporal variation of other aspects of the gut microbiome, such as the metagenome and metatranscriptome (56), are crucial. Another limitation was that we did not have information on what types of antibiotics were used or reason for use. Antibiotics have varying mechanisms of action that include targeting bacterial cell walls or membranes, protein synthesis, and DNA or RNA synthesis (57). A two-center randomized controlled trial in the United Kingdom and Sweden reported different responses to the Shannon index from four different antibiotics, with effects on the gut microbiome ranging from no difference after one week to sustained reduction at one year (58). As antibiotics are frequently prescribed for treating a variety of infections, as well as for prophylaxis in preventing infections among high-risk patients, the disease state may also modify the effect of antibiotic treatment. However, the temporal trend we saw was comparable to studies conducted in participants who were healthy at the time of antibiotic administration (15,52).",
