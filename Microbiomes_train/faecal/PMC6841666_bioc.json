Our aim was to compare the microbiome between treatment-na\u00efve MS subjects early in their disease course and controls, and between Caucasian (CA), Hispanic (HA), and African American (AA) MS subjects. From fecal samples, we performed 16S rRNA V4 sequencing and analysis from 45 MS subjects (15 CA, 16 HA, 14 AA) and 44 matched healthy controls, and whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing from 24 MS subjects (all newly diagnosed, treatment-na\u00efve, and steroid-free) and 24 controls. In all three ethnic groups, there was an increased relative abundance of the same single genus, Clostridium, compared to ethnicity-matched controls. Analysis of microbiota networks showed significant changes in the network characteristics between combined MS cohorts and controls, suggesting global differences not restricted to individual taxa. Metagenomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of individual species within Clostridia as well as particular functional pathways in the MS subjects. The increased relative abundance of Clostridia in all three early MS cohorts compared to controls provides candidate taxa for further study as biomarkers or as etiologic agents in MS.",

Ethnicity matched healthy controls also were recruited. About half of the controls were family members of the cases, and the remainder responded to advertisements around the NYU Medical Center campus. All cases and controls were recruited in the same geographic region. Ethnicity was determined based on self-identification and a survey of geographic origin. Subjects of mixed ethnicity, e.g., Caribbean African Americans, were not included. All enrollees were between the ages of 18 and 70. The only allowable medications at study entry were NSAIDs and analgesics at FDA-approved doses. Exclusion criteria included current or prior use of disease-modifying or biologic therapies for MS, recent (<3 months prior) use of any antibiotic therapy, current extreme diet such as parenteral nutrition, known inflammatory bowel disease, any GI tract surgery leaving permanent residua such as gastrectomy, bariatric surgery, or colectomy, or currently active malignancy.

After filtering procedures, similar sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using an open reference approach with UCLUST29 against the Greengenes Core set. A representative sequence was then aligned using PyNAST, and FastTree created phylogenetic trees. Rarefaction analysis used Chao-1 and whole PD to measure \u03b1-diversity. Unweighted UniFrac distances were calculated to assess \u03b2-diversity; the Unweighted paired group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) was performed for UniFrac-based jackknifed hierarchical clustering. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of UniFrac distance matrices provided graphical representation using KiNG. ANOVA was used to compare OTU and genus-level abundances, and Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe), a tool that can compare differences of relative abundance between \u22652 biological conditions30, also was used for analysis.",

Quality filtering was performed by removing host-contaminated sequences using KneadData, and applying a conservative quality threshold criteria of Phred score >20 and minimum sequence length >105\u2009bp, using Cutadapt31. Following quality filtering, the marker-based tool, MetaPhlan2 (v.2.6.0)32 was used for profiling the composition of microbial communities. The biomarker identification tool, LEfSe33 also was used to identify enrichment of species between 2 or more groups. Additionally, filtered reads were processed using the microbial functional profiling tool, HUMAnN2 (v0.11.1)34. In short, reads were initially aligned against a sample-specific microbial pangenome database (ChocoPhlAn) from species detected using MetaPhlan2. Any unaligned reads were subjected to a translated search against the recommended UniRef90 protein database, and MetaCyc pathways were reconstructed. Abundance tables were reported by default to RPK (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript) and further normalized to CoPM (Copies per Million) to account for differences in gene length and sampling depth. The WHAM! program35 was used for the analysis of metagenomic data.",

All of the subjects selected for this analysis were treatment-na\u00efve, had not received steroids for the prior month and were not taking probiotics, and all samples had been obtained within 6 months of the initial MS diagnosis (Table\u00a02). Among the original control sample of 44 subjects, the 24 controls for this subanalysis were selected based on the criteria of no probiotics (or steroids) and then were ethnicity and age-matched to the MS subjects to the degree possible. After eliminating poor quality reads, this analysis yielded a mean sequence depth of 6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 Gbp per sample, with host gene contamination <1%. At a taxonomic level, 6 species were significantly enriched in the control subjects vs 41 in the MS subjects; the latter included 13 individual Clostridia species (Fig.\u00a04). Several species also were significantly decreased in the MS subjects, including Bacteroides xylanisolvens. Analysis of 296 functional pathways identified from the metagenomic data demonstrated significant abundance elevations of two pathways and decreases in four pathways (adjusted p value\u2009<\u20090.05) between the MS and control subjects (Fig.\u00a05). The taxa that significantly contributed to the differential abundances of these six pathways were relatively limited (Fig.\u00a06).",

In another recent study, for example, disease durations are not mentioned, but the onset for the MS subjects ranged from 1983 and 2016, with only 14/71 MS subjects having onset between 2014\u201320165. Patients with longer disease duration tend to have higher rates of constipation38; differences in intestinal transit time may lead to microbiome compositional changes, including increased representation of Methanobrevibacter species1,15.

In that study, the average disease duration was 13.5 years; as with the above studies, the long disease duration and concomitant constipation could alter the composition of the microbiome, with constipation itself associated with increased Clostridia41. In our study of newly diagnosed MS subjects, we also find increased Clostridia which is consistent with a potential role in MS pathogenesis. Cekanaviciute and colleagues found that the spore-forming bacteria from MS subjects (versus those from controls) impaired the in vitro differentiation of IL-10-secreting, regulatory T lymphocytes, consistent with a pathogenic role; however, in a small sub-study, neither the spore-forming bacteria from 2 MS or 2 control subjects had an exacerbating impact on EAE induction in antibiotic-fed mice18. These negative findings could reflect small sample size and variability in gut biota, the lack of other bacterial species that are needed in a network to exacerbate disease, changes in the spore-forming bacteria present in long-standing MS, or that any protective effect relates to different pathophysiologic steps. Further work is needed to elucidate a functional role for the increase in Clostridia representation that we and others have observed in the MS population.",

For example, in comparison to controls, studies have found a decrease in Clostridium perfringens Type A in MS subjects42, or a decrease in Clostridia clusters XIVa and IV in MS subjects3.

While we excluded subjects with any history of DMTs or a history of steroids for the 3 months prior to stool collection, it is possible there were other remote drug exposures that could have altered the microbiomes. Although we have found the same significant differences between all MS subgroups and controls, it is not certain whether the changes identified are causal for MS, result from MS, or are incidental (falsely-positive). Although further taxonomic and metagenomic characterization of the intestinal microbiota in early MS cases will be necessary, this work provides potential biomarkers for future analyses. Further studies will help determine whether candidate species alter immune functions to contribute to early MS, which would have implications for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of MS.",
