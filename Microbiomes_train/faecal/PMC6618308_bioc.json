The composition of the gut microbiome is influenced by many host and environmental factors, particularly diet, as the microbiome is essential to nutrient digestion, synthesis, and absorption (1\u20134). It is also hypothesized that the microbiome is part of a causal pathway linking physical activity (PA) and chronic disease (5;6). Evidence from animal studies suggests that PA is an important modulating factor on gut microbial communities. Active vs. sedentary rodents had greater microbiome diversity (7\u20139) as well as a higher prevalence of bacteria associated with better general and metabolic health (10;11). Certain associations between PA and the gut microbiome were not consistent in experimental rodent studies, e.g. some studies found no relationship between exercise and phylum abundance (12), some studies found that Firmicutes was more prevalent in the high exercise group (13;14), and some studies had the opposite finding (7;8). Furthermore, rodent studies use restricted (locked wheel), forced exercise, and controlled feeding protocols that are not readily generalizable to humans.",

The institutional review board at each participating institution approved the study protocol and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Further information about the MrOS cohort can be found at the MrOS Online website (http://mrosdata.sfcc-cpmc.net). All surviving active MrOS participants were invited to participate in a Year 14 visit with 1841 complete clinic visits occurring from May 2014 and May 2016. An ancillary microbiome study invited 1328 men starting in 2015 and 982 participants agreed to provide a stool sample. Sample collection was concurrent with Visit 4 except for those whose visit had already taken place. Participants were queried on antibiotic use (30 days prior to sample collection). A random subsample of specimens (n=599) from these participants were sent to the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research (CMMR), Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX, for microbiome analysis. The analytic sample for the present analysis included those 373 men with 16S sequencing, objective PA measures based on 5 days and 90% wear time and who reported no use of antibiotics within the past month and no use of probiotics, see Figure 1.",

The monitor uses a combination of five sensors (2-axis accelerometer, a heat flow sensor, galvanic skin response, skin temperature sensors, and ambient temperature sensors) to collect physiological data (including wear time) in 1-minute epochs. The data collection begins at 12 am (midnight) on the first day the participant is given the armband, and ends with the completion of the last 24-hour period at midnight, with times before and after excluded from the data analysis. We included only participants who completed at least 5 days with 90% wear time. These data served as inputs in proprietary algorithms (Innerview Professional 5.1 software, Body Media, Inc; Pittsburgh, PA) along with height, weight, handedness and smoking status to estimate total step counts per day and total energy expenditure (TEE) in kilocalories per day (kcal/d). The resting metabolic rate (RMR) was estimated using the Harris Benedict equations. Non-wear time was detected by the galvanic and temperature skin sensors. The TEE included both wear time energy (from arm band) and non-wear time energy which was imputed from the RMR and the TEE from the wear time. The sleep interval was determined using proprietary algorithms. PA was also expressed as mean metabolic equivalent of task (METs). Minutes per day while awake spent in sedentary (METs \u2264 1.5), light (METs > 1.5, <3), and at least moderate (METs \u22653) activity were quantified. A validation study comparing the SenseWear\u00ae Pro Armband with the criterion method of doubly labeled water showed acceptable levels of agreement with total energy expenditure and strong correlation with measure of active energy expenditure as calculated using a standard equation based on criterion measure of total energy (21). A validation study in older adults demonstrated good concordance between SenseWear\u00ae Pro Armband and pedometer measured steps(22). There was a good correlation between minute-by-minute METS measured by the armband and minute-by-minute oxygen consumption in a small study of those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (23). Sleep time was reliably measured in a study that also performed polysomnography in patients with sleep apnea and controls(24). Self-reported PA was assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) (25). Our primary exposure variable was step count, while other measure of objective activity and self-reported activity were secondary exposure variables.",

Briefly, food groups were constructed using individual food variables from the Visit 4 FFQ based on nutrient similarities, culinary use, and previous studies. A two-factor solution was retained based on eigenvalues and final factor loadings were calculated through varimax rotation. Factor 1 loaded heavily on processed meats, refined grains, potatoes, eggs, sweets, and salty snacks and was designated the Western pattern, similar to derivations in other studies.

We used the Shannon index and the Inverse Simpson index as measures of \u03b1-diversity (richness/evenness). The association of bacterial \u03b1-diversity and subject phenotypes was assessed using linear regression models and adjusted for age, race, BMI, clinical center, number of chronic conditions, and library size. To look at \u03b2-diversity, we used weighted and unweighted Unifrac as a distance measure on the rarefied and log-transformed abundance data (31). Unifrac incorporates phylogenetic differences between organisms in addition to presence/absence (unweighted) and count (weighted) information. \u03b2-diversity was summarized using weighted and unweighted principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). PERMANOVA, as implemented by the function adonis in the vegan package(32), was used to test for associations between activity phenotypes and \u03b2-diversity.

In addition, consideration of genus-level agglomeration reduces the multiplicity of models, therefore impacting power dilution due to correction for multiple testing. The taxa were then included as outcomes if they had a prevalence greater than 10% and a mean relative abundance of at least 10\u22124, resulting in 78 candidate taxa. To determine the relationship between activity phenotype and individual taxa we used a mixture model based on a zero-inflated Gaussian distribution (metagenomeSeq) (36). We included all basic demographic variables in the fully adjusted models but screened other potential confounders for inclusion. We did not include variables (e.g. smoking, alcohol use, diet) that were not associated with step count, our primary exposure variable. Full models were adjusted for age, race, BMI, clinical center, number of chronic medical conditions, and library size. Finally we present the results based on an initial screen including taxa with unadjusted p<0.05 in the fully adjusted models. Including such taxa is important for hypothesis generation as well as comparisons with other studies. We then computed adjusted p-values for the fully adjusted models using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery method using the full set of 78 taxa as described above (genus-level aggregation filtered by prevalence/abundance). Including the results of such adjustment allows for better interpretation and should be used for design of studies which depend on taxa identified in the present study.

There was a broad range of step counts with interquartile range from 2520 to 6447 steps and full range from 30 to 18,688 steps. The characteristics of the analytic sample stratified by step count quartile are shown in Table 1. Those with higher total step count (by quartile) were younger, had lower BMI, and had fewer chronic medical conditions than those with lower step count. Other measures of PA varied consistently by step count quartile. In contrast, education, smoking, diet, and \u03b1-diversity (Shannon, Inverse Simpson) did not vary by step count quartile.",

Compared to individuals with lower step counts, those who had higher step counts also had higher relative abundances of taxa from the genera Cetobacterium and lower relative abundance of taxa from the genera Coprobacillus, Adlercreutzia, Erysipelotrichaceae CC-115 (at FDR adjusted p \u2264 0.05). The point estimates for beta coefficients were quite modest, ranging between \u22120.37 and 0.45 and corresponding to fold-changes ranging between 0.77 and 1.36. Those with higher step counts also had a higher relative abundance of Faecalibacterium, Streptophyta, Prevotella, Clostridium, Lachnospira, Peptococcaceae, Paraprevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and lower relative abundance of Alistipes, Clostridia SHA-98, Anaerotruncus, Eggerthella, Megasphaera (albeit at unadjusted p \u2264 0.05). There was no consistent pattern with respect to direction of association and phylum membership. In particular there were positive and negative associations for PA and individual taxa that were members of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. In secondary analysis we considered both self-reported PA and other objective measures of PA. Figure 4 shows the association between all PA measures and the taxa associated with step count. The magnitude and direction of the association between PA measures and taxa was roughly concordant. The beta coefficients for TEE and minutes of PA were largely consistent in magnitude and direction with those for step count. The beta coefficients for non-sedentary minutes and self-reported PA also tracked with those for step count but were somewhat discordant, most notably for taxa with fold changes closer to 1 (e.g. Streptophyta). Some differences in fold change magnitude but not direction were noted for PA measures and Paraprevotellaceae with estimated fold changes ranging from 1.21 to 1.72.",

Compared to those who were less active, those who had higher step counts had higher relative abundance of Cetobacterium and lower relative abundance of taxa from the genera Coprobacillus, Adlercreutzia, Erysipelotrichaceae CC-115. These results were observed after multivariable adjustment including age and chronic conditions, no confounding by sex (men only), and FDR correction. Possible associations not meeting FDR threshold were observed for other sentinel taxa, such as Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, and Clostridium. Measures of PA were also related to \u03b2-diversity as measured by unweighted Unifrac, a method that considers presence/absence but not relative abundance and is therefore more sensitive to taxa with lower prevalence and abundance, i.e. taxa that are not part of the core gut microbiome. Measures of PA were not related to \u03b1-diversity and only weakly related to weighted beta diversity, thus suggesting that activity has only a limited effect on variation among core taxa. The associations between PA and taxa were generally concordant regardless of the PA measure.",

This is likely important as other reports have found global shifts in predominant phyla that are associated with age. In particular, a cross-sectional study including age range over the life span showed increased prevalence of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and decreased prevalence of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria among the very old vs. middle aged Japanese adults(37). The relative abundance by phyla in the present study was most similar to the oldest age strata (86\u201398) in the Japanese study, an age strata similar to the present study.",

One cross-sectional study of 86 men found clear and consistent differences between the microbiome of 40 professional athletes versus the microbiome of 46 age and sex matched controls (23 low BMI and 23 high BMI)(15). In particular, \u03b1-diversity was higher among athletes compared to controls, but did not differ between high and low BMI control groups. Notably, the top six differences in relative abundance between athletes and high BMI control group were in the Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae, S24\u20137, Succinivibrionaceae, RC9 gut group and Succinivibrio groups, none of which were differentially abundant by step count in the current study. There were 40 taxa that were more prevalent in athletes in comparison with the low BMI group, of which the top six fold changes were for Prevotellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, S24\u20137, Succinivibrionaceae, Prevotella and Succinivibrio groups, none of which were differentially abundant by step count in the present study at nominal level. The comparison of professional athletes vs. either control group is not likely to be generalizable, particular for comparisons within a group of older men. We note however that exact replication may also fail due to data processing and naming of taxa, for example Erysipelotrichaceae includes Coprobacillus and CC-115 and therefore the present finding may well partially confirm previous results.",

                    "text": "A second study based on the same select group of male athletes and controls found that the differences at the taxa level, some of which occur in the present study, were also associated with differences in the functional capacity and associated pathways (e.g. amino acid biosynthesis and degradation, carbohydrate metabolism, vitamin biosynthesis)(16). Notably, the altered functional capacity of the microbiome among athletes was further evident in a higher production of short-chain fatty acids. While there were very clear differences between athletes and controls, the differences may not be wholly attributable to PA per se, since the dietary intake and requirements of athletes is also necessarily different from the control group. In another cross-sectional study of younger women, Bressa et al found that women with higher vs lower PA had a higher relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii measured by quantitative PCR, a finding consistent with the present study(17). Bressa et al also found between group differences for 11 OTUs when analyzed at the genus level, but none of these findings were replicated in the present study. We note however that some discrepancies might be due to slightly different taxonomic names, e.g. Bressa found that PA was related to higher relative abundance of Paraprevotella while the present study found that PA was related to higher relative abundance of Paraprevotellaceae, an OTU only identified down to the level of family. Bressa et al used the same Greengenes reference database, however the clustering of OTUs is sample dependent thus the combination of clustering and matching may result in different names (terminal taxa) for a given sequence. Other findings from Bressa et al were that weighted \u03b2-diversity differed between active vs sedentary women but that \u03b1-diversity and unweighted \u03b2-diversity did not differ between groups.",

                    "text": "A recent longitudinal study(18) assessed the changes in microbiome over a 6 week period among lean and obese sedentary men and women exposed to 3-week intervention of moderate to vigorous activity with a 3 week washout period following the intervention. While there was no formal control group, the experimental design included dietary control (i.e. specified diet prior to sample collection) while other factors could be controlled for using repeated measures among individuals. The exercise intervention successfully altered PA level, cardio-respiratory fitness, and body composition. There were concurrent longitudinal changes in weighted \u03b2-diversity which varied slightly by body mass index. Since Bressa et al was a longitudinal study, changes in microbial composition could be matched with changes in metabolic profile. Notably, those who were lean had an increase in both fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, and a concurrent increase in related microbial taxa (Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiales, Roseburia, Lachnospira, Faecalibacterium) which then reversed after exercise wash-out period and return to sedentary activity. This small longitudinal study also suggests a possible effect modification by body size for the association between PA and the host microbiome. For those who were obese, improvement in cardio-respiratory fitness was associated with increases in Lachnospira, Veillonella, Paraprevotella, and Barnesiella, and decreases in Ruminococcus, Eggerthella, Dorea, Coprobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and f. Bifidobacteriaceae but without the concurrent association with fecal butyrate. In our study higher PA was associated with a greater prevalence of Faecalibacterium and Lachnospira (unadjusted p \u2264 0.05). Butyrate is the preferred energy source of colon epithelial cells stimulating normal growth and apoptosis(38). Butyrate is also implicated in mucin production and protein expression thus preserving the integrity of the gut barrier(39). Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are also implicated in the modulation of the immune response including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and NF-KB(40;41). Our cross-sectional findings are partially consistent with the longitudinal findings of Allen et al, suggesting that the hypothesized mechanisms relating PA and SCFA producing bacteria might also be present in this cohort of older men. Since the present study is cross-sectional, we cannot determine a causal relationship between microbiome and activity, and thus the positive association between relative abundance of Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Prevotella, Clostridium and activity could be attributable to underlying health state that is influenced by both exposure variables, although we did adjusted for underlying multimorbidity.",

The advanced age of the study participants enables a comprehensive assessment of the microbiome in late life. However, our study has limitations. There was no control of either diet or physical activity. Our study has a cross-sectional observational design, and this lack of temporal association limits inference on causality. In addition, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of selection bias and residual confounding. The generalizability of the present study is limited to healthy community-dwelling very old men (mean age 84 years). We note that Claesson et al found notable differences between community-dwelling and nursing home residents(4) leaving open effect modification by residential status. The cohort was also mostly non-Hispanic white with notable differences in \u03b1-diversity by race/ethnicity, thus leaving open potential effect modification by race/ethnicity. While the present study is larger than many of the previous studies relating PA and the microbiome there are still issues concerning sample size. The study population was a select and generally healthy group of older men and most participants fell within a limited range of light and moderated PA. Thus future study is needed to determine associations between PA and microbiome parameters, with larger samples and/or more variation in phenotype. The present study was limited to 16S profiling, and thus limiting the interpretation, with further study necessary to identify taxa down to genus and species and to determine functional repertoire including SCFA production.",
