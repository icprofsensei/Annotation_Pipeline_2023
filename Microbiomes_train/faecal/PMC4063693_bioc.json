For instance, what is the diversity of the T cell repertoire? These questions are partially addressed by high-throughput sequencing techniques that enable identification of immunological and microbiological \u201cspecies\u201d in a sample. Estimators of the number of unseen species are needed to estimate population diversity from sample diversity. Here we test five widely used non-parametric estimators, and develop and validate a novel method, DivE, to estimate species richness and distribution. We used three independent datasets: (i) viral populations from subjects infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type 1; (ii) T cell antigen receptor clonotype repertoires; and (iii) microbial data from infant faecal samples. When applied to datasets with rarefaction curves that did not plateau, existing estimators systematically increased with sample size. In contrast, DivE consistently and accurately estimated diversity for all datasets. We identify conditions that limit the application of DivE. We also show that DivE can be used to accurately estimate the underlying population frequency distribution. We have developed a novel method that is significantly more accurate than commonly used biodiversity estimators in microbiological and immunological populations.",

For example, the human retrovirus HTLV-1 persists within hosts in multiple, genetically identical clones of infected cells. However, the number of clones in one host is unknown; this knowledge is required for an understanding of how the virus survives despite a strong host immune response. The problem arises again in estimating the diversity of the T-cell repertoire, which influences adaptive immunity. For example, the T-cell diversity may influence the outcome of viral challenge. While there have been numerous attempts to address the unseen species problem, there is currently no consensus on how to do so in immunology and microbiology. The aim of this study was to identify a suitable method to estimate the number of species in immunological and microbiological populations. We found that five existing estimators we tested performed poorly across three data sources (HTLV-1 clonality, T cell receptor, and microbial data). We therefore developed a new estimator, DivE, which significantly outperformed the other estimators. Accurate diversity quantification allows better evaluation of the impact on immunity from factors such as ageing and infection.",

If made, these simplifying assumptions allow the extrapolation of individual-based rarefaction curves, which depict the expected number of species against the number of individuals sampled [11]\u2013[14]. However, the above assumptions are frequently violated in ecological populations [14]\u2013[18], where unobserved individuals may differ from observed individuals in their colour, physical size, geographical distribution, movement, variety of habitats and relationship to other species [15], and thus remain unobserved despite substantial subsequent sampling. Second, many common assumptions about population structure are inappropriate for immunological and microbiological populations, for example that all species have equal frequencies [19]\u2013[21], or that the functional form of the population distribution is known [22]\u2013[26].

Although they were originally intended as methods to estimate lower bounds, the Chao1 estimator, and the modified, bias-corrected form Chao1bc [36], have been used to make a point estimate of the number of TCR clonotypes [37], [38], the number of OTUs in hepatitis C virus infection [1], parasite diversity in malaria infection [39] metagenome size [40], the number of integration sites of therapeutic gene therapy vectors [41], soil diversity [42], and again the number of HTLV-1 infected cell clones [35], [43].

These definitions of the population of interest lack flexibility and may be inappropriate or poorly defined for the question in hand.

This approach allows linear and unbiased amplification of all TCRs irrespective of TRBV or TRBJ gene usage. Paired-end sequencing reactions (each 150 bp) were performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer.

To calculate the DivE estimator, many mathematical models are fitted to multiple nested subsamples of individual-based rarefaction curves. Each model is fitted to all nested subsamples, and is scored on a set of four criteria. The five best-performing models are extrapolated and their respective estimates are aggregated to produce the DivE species richness estimate. DivE requires an estimate of population size. If the species richness of a wider population is desired, the same models are used but extrapolated to a different population size; this is only justified if the two populations are similar in their spatial distribution of individuals.",

For the HTLV-1 data, subsample sizes were chosen to be approximately equidistant; however some were removed due to runtime constraints. See Table S1 for further details. Second, we measured the accuracy of DivE by comparing the estimated species richness \u015cobs at the size of the full dataset Nobs from each subsample to the (known) species richness Sobs in the full data. Using the same method, we compared DivE to the second order bias-corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) [65], [66]. Third, the TCR data have rarefaction curves which plateau. Using smaller subsamples of this data and making the assumption that the species richness of the full data is equal to that of the entire population, we were able to evaluate the accuracies of all estimators together. Finally for 11 of the 14 HTLV-1 patients detailed in Table S1, three samples were taken at a single time point. For each time point, the three samples were pooled and used as a practical test of DivE's ability to predict species richness in larger samples.",

However, existing estimators again increased with sample size for the effector memory (EM) CD8+ T cell population from the same subject. These observations can be explained with reference to the TCR rarefaction curves (Figure 3). With the exception of the CD8+ EM dataset (for which the subsample sizes were considerably smaller), each TCR rarefaction curve reached a plateau, implying that the vast majority of observed clonotypes were encountered early. In contrast, the CD8+ EM rarefaction curve did not plateau, suggesting that further sampling would reveal more CD8+ EM clonotypes. In common with the microbial and the HTLV-1 datasets, DivE performed well for all TCR datasets, producing consistent results from all subsample sizes. To make sure that the smallest subsamples did not disproportionately contribute to the observed gradients, we repeated the above analysis using only estimates from the largest three subsamples in each patient dataset, which showed almost identical results (Figure S1).",

This discrepancy is quantified in Figure 3 (middle column) and in Table S2. To ensure the four criteria provide a useful metric of model performance, we compared DivE to the second order bias-corrected Akaike Information Criterion(AICc) [65], [66]. DivE's mean errors (between the species richness of the full data Sobs and \u015cobs) were 3.3%, 1.0%, and 4.0% for the HTLV-1, TCR and microbial data respectively. These were lower than the corresponding errors of 6.7%, 1.1%, and 7.5%, produced when models were scored by the AICc.

Instead we took advantage of the fact that, for 11 of the 14 HTLV-1 subjects, the data comprised three time points,with three samples drawn at each time point in immediate succession from the subject. For a given subject and a single time point, the three samples were combined in silico to produce a single pooled sample. We compared the observed species richness of the pooled sample to each estimator's estimates from a subsample (Figure 5, Figure S3). The total blood diversity must be at least as great as that observed by pooling the samples. However, all existing estimators estimate the total diversity to be less than that observed. Based on a single subsample, the Chao1bc, ACE, Bootstrap, Good-Turing and negative exponential estimators respectively estimate medians of 27.0%, 12.7%, 71.1%, 65.5%, and 47.6% fewer clones than observed in the pooled samples (n\u200a=\u200a11). Since the pooled samples do not saturate, and since the blood contains approximately 105 times more infected cells than the pooled sample, the diversity observed in the pooled sample is likely to be a small fraction of the total diversity. Since the existing estimators produce estimates lower than the pooled sample diversity, let alone total blood diversity, this represents a considerable error. We used DivE to produce two estimates: the pooled sample diversity and blood diversity. From the subsamples DivE estimated a median of 2.6\u00d7103 clones in the pooled samples, a median error of 2.5% (n\u200a=\u200a11) (Figure 5, Figure S3). Additionally, DivE estimated 2.8\u00d7104 clones in the blood, approximately one log higher than the observed pooled sample diversity. Whilst we cannot determine whether or not this is accurate it is at least plausible, considering that it is not less than the diversity of the pooled sample, that the sampling fraction is very small, and that the rarefaction curve has not reached a plateau.",

Uncertainty in the estimates produced by DivE has two sources: parameter values in each respective model (within-model variation), and the choice of model (between-model variation). Using standard errors of parameter estimates to calculate confidence intervals ignores uncertainty from model selection. Information theoretic approaches that take account of model selection uncertainty have become increasingly common in ecology [73], [74] and elsewhere. There are broadly two approaches: i) computing AIC weights, and ii) repeated resampling and model ranking to determine bootstrap model selection probabilities [66]. However, neither approach is appropriate in our case. We do not rank models using AIC since this produces less accurate estimates than DivE (Table S2), and so we cannot use AIC weights to derive confidence intervals. Further, since there is a systematic bias towards lower species richness in bootstrap samples (Figure S7), a similar bias may be introduced in the estimation of bootstrap model selection probabilities, leading in turn to a bias in species richness estimation. Systematic underestimation in bootstrap samples is particular to species richness estimation: this does not highlight a general problem with resampling to quantify model selection uncertainty. As a pragmatic indicator of estimate variability, we use the range of estimates produced by the five best-performing models; the geometric mean of these five models is taken as the point estimate (Table S4).",

In spatially homogeneous populations with equiprobable detection of individuals, estimating population size through scaling by area or volume is justifiable e.g. scaling from cells in 50 ml of blood to cells in the total blood volume. When population size estimates are unavailable, it is still usually possible to provide meaningful diversity estimates, e.g. the number of microbes per gram of faeces. DivE may also be useful in deciding the depth of sampling required for an adequate census. Deeper sampling may require more DNA sequencing or a larger tissue sample from a patient, and so minimizing sampling depth has financial and ethical benefits.

Microbial and TCR datasets were used only for validation as these data consisted of sequence reads and not absolute counts. To the extent that read abundances differ from absolute counts, such data cannot be used to estimate species richness with any abundance-based estimator (e.g. DivE, Chao1bc, and ACE). Over-amplification by PCR may generate a saturating rarefaction curve that is not due to sampling depth, falsely implying that the majority of species have been observed. This can be seen in our TCR data: plateaus were far lower than previously reported diversity estimates [50], [79]. However, absolute counts can often be obtained (e.g. by spiking a sample with a known quantity of identifiable individuals or by barcoding to identify PCR duplicates).",

However, species richness estimates from TCR or microbial data are likely to be susceptible to sequencing error. Sequencing error can falsely increase diversity, and this will influence species richness estimates using any estimator; researchers must therefore exercise caution when analysing such data; ideally by preprocessing the data to remove error prior to further analysis. Caution must also be exercised when assuming that the spatial distribution of individuals is uniform. We believe that these assumptions are reasonable for the blood, but skin tissue for example may be more clustered.",

When applying DivE to a new type of data it is necessary to ascertain which models perform best. This requires that many models be fitted to multiple subsamples. If, for a particular data type, a given set of models performs consistently well, application becomes much quicker because only these models need to be fitted, and it is no longer necessary to fit all models to all subsamples. In our analysis we found that five models performed consistently well, and so we have used the aggregate of the five best-performing models in our estimates. Since the optimal number of models may differ between datasets, we advocate careful analysis of model scores to decide how many models should be aggregated.
