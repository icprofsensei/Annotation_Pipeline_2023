Variability in process parameters such as temperature, pH, water-soluble carbon, germination index (GI) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) are evaluated at TC dosages of 0, 100, 250 and 500\u00a0mg/kg in a 21-day composting. Moreover, microbial community succession is examined by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Findings indicate significant impacts to the process parameters with the increase of TC concentration such as inhibition of temperature increases during aerobic composting, lowering of pH, increasing of water-soluble carbon residue, a decrease of GI, and hindering of DHA. Furthermore, elevated TC concentrations significantly alter the microbial community succession and reduce the community diversity and abundance. Therefore, interference in microbial community structures and a hindrance to biological activity are believed to be the main adverse effects of TC on the composting process and maturity of the composting products.",

                    "text": "Antibiotics are broadly utilized to prevent and treat human diseases [6]. However, these medicines are not well absorbed by humans. Circa 30\u201390% of antibiotic dosages (unaltered and their metabolites) are released, in biologically active forms, in human excreta due to partial absorption [6, 7]. The antibiotics most frequently used by humans include tetracyclines, quinolones and sulfonamides at dosages of up to 2\u00a0g/day and with excretion ratios of up to 90% [8]. Thus, considering the maximum concentrations of these antibiotics in feces mixed into a 5\u00a0kg-scale household composting device [9], the original antibiotics concentration could increase significantly by up to 500\u00a0mg/kg. The effectiveness of aerobic composting for the removal of antibiotics has been demonstrated [10, 11]. However, the potential effects of these antibiotics on the composting process have not been taken into account. The types and concentrations of residual antibiotics fluctuate widely in manure. This fluctuation could cause changes to the microbial community through composting, thus, impacting the composting process and the condition of the compost product [12]. Previous studies demonstrate the effects of oxytetracycline, sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole on the composting process of feces [13, 14]. However, studies on tetracycline (TC) [15], the most commonly used antibiotic by humans is lacking. Understanding of the effects of TC on compost is necessary to improve the process operation, but, until now, no such studies can be found. In addition, previous reports on this subject are based on antibiotics concentrations of less than 200\u00a0mg/kg. Thus, the effects of higher antibiotics concentrations on the small-scale household composting process should be further understood.",

We combined 0.3\u00a0kg of human feces with 0.75\u00a0kg of sawdust particles at a dry weight feces:sawdust ratio of 1:2.5 to achieve a C/N ratio of 24:1 [18].

Variations in the pile temperature throughout the composting process are illustrated in Fig.\u00a02a. Based on these alterations in the pile temperature, the composting process can be split into three stages: the temperature-rise stage, the temperature-fall stage, and the mature stage. For the treatments CK, TC100, TC250, and TC500, the temperatures peaked on the third day at 55.6, 50.5, 48.2, and 46.1\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. In the temperature-rise and temperature-fall stages, the temperature of the CK treatment was greater than those of TC100, TC250, and TC500, suggesting that elevated TC concentrations had inhibitory impacts on the metabolic capacity of the microbial community [26]. Nonetheless, all composts achieved a relatively steady temperature near the ambient temperature. In the mature stage, the temperature was relatively lower in CK and TC100 compared to TC250 and TC500. This difference may be due to the generation of resistant populations in the composting environment with the composting process [27], which increased the metabolic activity of microorganisms in the composting [10]. The heat generated by different metabolic activities led to inconsistent temperature changes in all treatments. Comparably, Sun et al. [26] documented an obvious decrease in temperature in contrast to the control as a result of the addition of tetracycline antibiotics. These outcomes show that elevated TC concentrations in compost may inhibit the increase of temperature in the temperature-rise stage and, thus, delay the composting maturity.\n",

Subsequently, the pH rose rapidly from about 5.2 to 8.1, which was linked to the degradation of organic acids or the liberation of ammonia compounds [28]. Minute decreases in the pH values were recorded in TC250 and TC500, in contrast to CK and TC100 at the mature stage, which demonstrated the inhibition of ammonia liberation by antibiotics [29].",

The peak WSC contents in the CK and TC100 treatments were notably greater than those of TC250 and TC500. Nevertheless, as the composting process proceeded, the WSC contents in TC250 and TC500 steadily increased to exceed those of CK and TC100 in the mature stage.

The WSC values for CK and TC100 were below the threshold value of 17\u00a0g/kg that was established to describe a mature compost by Bernai et al. [30].

However, due to the complexity of composting materials and conditions, widely accepted standard parameters and methods for compost maturity evaluation have not been established. Maturity is not identified by one sole property, so it is best evaluated by measuring two or more parameters of the compost. Maturity parameters are established on various properties: physical, chemical, and biological, such as microbial activity, temperature, pH, WSC, and GI of the compost, all of which are broadly acknowledged as common indicators [32]. Overall, findings from this study indicate that at elevated levels of up to 500\u00a0mg/kg, TC hinders the aerobic composting process for feces disposal and the maturity of the compost produced.",

It is one of the main components of the respiratory chain and offers data on the compost maturity [33]. The highest DHA (mg TPF g\u22121/h) was obtained in TC100 (14.04), followed by CK (12.96), TC250 (11.67) and TC500 (8.69) (Fig.\u00a04). The rapid increase in DHA at the first stage of composting was induced by oxidation of labile organic compounds catalyzed by the enzyme [33]. Similar findings were documented by other researchers [34]. In the first stage of composting, DHA in TC100 was greater than that of CK, which suggested that relatively low concentrations of TC may encourage the activity of dehydrogenase in compost, potentially because of the hormesis of antibiotics [35]. DHA in TC500 was significantly lower than that in the other treatments, which demonstrates an evident inhibition of DHA at high concentrations of TC. The inhibitory effects of elevated concentrations of TC on DHA, consequently, led to an inhibition of the breakdown of organic matter (Fig.\u00a02c). In the mature stage of the composting, however, DHA was lowered, which indicates that the majority of the organic matter had been degraded by microorganisms and changed to a stable material, and thus, the respiratory process slowed down [36]. Moreover, the increase in pH (Fig.\u00a02b) also inhibited enzymatic activity during composting [36].\n",

Through clustering, 7813 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified at the cutoff of 3%. The OTU coverage was enough for community diversity, with a coverage estimate of greater than 0.987 for every library. The \u03b1-diversity indices, including the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices [37], were determined to denote the community diversity (Table\u00a02). The \u03b1-diversity index can be utilized to examine microbial abundance and community evenness from compost. A higher Shannon index or a lower Simpson index value indicates a higher number of microorganism species in more equal abundances. The values of these two diversity indices in TC100 were relatively high, which shows that the microbial community diversity increased with decreasing concentrations of TC [38]. In contrast, the Shannon and Simpson indices for TC500 were lower than those for the other treatments throughout the mature stage of composting. Furthermore, the diversity of the microbial community was slightly lowered with increasing concentrations of TC. This effect could be attributed to the sensitivity of microorganisms to increased levels of antibiotics, thus lowering the number and activity of microorganisms [26].\n",

The makeup of the bacterial community was altered significantly at the phylum level, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a05. It is well established that the composting process impacts the bacterial population [39], but exposure to increased levels of TC can produce a significant shift in the composting microbial community. The bacterial community structures in TC500 and TC250 varied more than that in TC100, in contrast to CK, at the temperature-fall and mature stages of composting. This finding shows that TC has more resolute impacts on the bacterial community at higher concentrations [40].\n",

In raw composting mixtures, Firmicutes (87.3%) were the most plentiful bacteria, succeeded by Proteobacteria (7.3%), Actinobacteria (1.9%), and Bacteroidetes (0.6%). As composting progressed, Proteobacteria increased significantly. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria became the most dominant phyla at the temperature-rise stage, accounting for 88.0\u201394.4% of the total bacterial gene sequences. Compared with the CK treatment, the proportion of Proteobacteria decreased as the TC concentration increased, probably due to the lower thermotolerance of Proteobacteria than Firmicutes [42]. The greatest number of bacteria at the temperature-fall and mature stages belonged to the Proteobacteria phylum followed by the Bacteroidetes phylum. The subsequent dominance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes can probably be ascribed to the relatively lower temperatures of household composting [42]. Actinobacteria, established as a marker for compost maturity [41], showed a rising trend from 0.3% (temperature-rise stage) to 5.9% (temperature-fall stage) in the CK treatment. Nevertheless, the addition of TC may have a greater impact on these bacteria. Overall, all composting samples from the TC treatments showed decreased levels of Actinobacteria than the CK treatment. Thus, TC addition effected changes to the bacterial abundance. These findings contradict prior reports that detailed Actinobacteria as usually plentiful in compost, especially during the temperature-fall and mature stages [39], but they corroborate the findings reported by de Gannes et al. [43].",

The common fecal pathogens Escherichia/Shigella were the predominant species identified from the initial mixture of the CK treatment, which accounted for 47.15% of the total bacteria. For the composts spiked with TC, the proportion of Escherichia/Shigella decreased significantly with increasing TC concentration. Furthermore, the proportion of Bacillus increased to become the predominant genus at the temperature-rise stage. The genus Bacillus is a widespread genus of Firmicutes in feces composting [39] and accounted for 46.41% of the total bacteria in TC500. The genus Bacillus are well known degraders of organic residue, show cellulolytic activity [44], have been found during various stages of composting and are known to produce proteases, chitinases and cellulases [45]. The dominant species at the temperature-fall stage were mainly composed of Sphingobacterium, Moheibacter, Myroides and Pusillimonas. Sphingobacterium was the predominant genus belonging to Sphingobacteriales at the last two stages of composting, especially for the control group. Moheibacter and Myroides were the dominant genera belonging to Flavobacteriales at the temperature-fall stage of TC100 and TC500. Bacteriodetes are considered effective degraders of macromolecules [43]. It has been documented that the genus Flavobacterium in the Bacteroidetes phylum can degrade hydrocarbons [46]. Therefore, Bacteroidetes bacteria may have added to the elimination of organics in this evaluation. The genus Pusillimonas, part of the family Alcaligenaceae, can use organic acid to generate alkali [47]. Thus, it may add greatly to the pH increase and the maintenance of the alkaline environment in the compost. The species of dominant genera increased among samples at the mature stage, indicating that species diversity was enriched at the later stage [42] when mesophilic microorganisms recolonized the compost. The community structures and dominant bacteria in TC-spiked composts at the mature stage had limited similarity in contrast to those in the CK treatment.\n",

Consequently, the relationships between physicochemical properties in the composting process and bacterial community variance were evaluated by RDA (Fig.\u00a07). Findings suggest rapid alterations in bacterial communities in the temperature-rise stage but only minimal changes in the next two stages. Overall, bacterial communities tended to stabilize after the temperature-fall stage, which confirmed the results of the cluster analysis. Seven parameters, specifically, temperature, pH, WSC, NH4+\u2013N, NO3\u2212\u2013N, DHA, and GI, were chosen from the group of physicochemical parameters measured in this evaluation according to their variance inflation factors. Of the selected parameters, temperature, NH4+\u2013N, and GI were positively correlated with the first RDA axis (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and pH and DHA were positively correlated with the second RDA axis (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The parameters as mentioned above were thought to impact the community structure the most. Similar findings have been documented in numerous prior evaluations [41, 48]. However, NO3\u2212\u2013N and WSC had relatively minimal impacts on the different bacterial community compositions compared to the other physicochemical parameters in our study. In fact, nitrogen and carbon are required nutrient elements for bacterial growth [3]. Further, WSC is an actively cycled carbon pool, which is the immediate precursor of bacteria growth and activity, thereby fueling the decomposition processes [37]. Availability of WSC can impact large environmental processes since WSC can accelerate the transport of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, as well as the energy supply, to bacteria [28, 32].\n",

Taking tetracycline as an example, it is demonstrated that elevated levels of up to 500\u00a0mg/kg hinder the aerobic composting process for feces disposal and manure reuse. In addition to process parameters such as temperature, pH and WSC, the most significant adverse effect is that on the maturity of the compost produced, shown by the lowered GI. The decreased DHA at elevated concentrations of tetracycline indicate reduced biological activity, while the significant alteration of microbial community succession explained the main reason for these adverse effects.",
