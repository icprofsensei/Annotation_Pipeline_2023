Next, the influence of the stabilization reagent during sample storage for up to 15\u00a0days was studied. RIN analysis and qRT-PCR of spiked-in and indigenous genes revealed that RNA Later preserved mRNA integrity most efficiently, while samples conserved in RNA Protect showed substantial mRNA decay. Using the optimized pipeline developed here, recovery rates for spiked-in E.coli cells expressing fluorescing proteins were 8.7-9.7\u00a0% for SuperfolderGFP and 14.7-17.8\u00a0% for mCherry. The mRNA of stabilized stool samples as well as of snap-frozen controls was sequenced with Illumina Hiseq, yielding on average 74 million reads per sample. PCoA analysis, taxonomic classification using Kraken and functional classification using bwa showed that the transcriptomes of samples conserved in RNA Later were unchanged for up to 6\u00a0days even at room temperature, while RNA Protect was inefficient for storage durations exceeding 24\u00a0h. However, our data indicate that RNA Later introduces a bias which is then maintained throughout storage, while RNA Protect conserved samples are initially more similar to the snap frozen controls. RNA Later conserved samples had a reduced abundance of e.g. Prevotellaceae transcripts and were depleted for e.g. COG category \u201cCarbohydrate transport and metabolism\u201d.",

[3] and Perez-Cobas et al. [4] provided a proof of concept with their metatranscriptome studies on the disturbance of the gut microbiota during treatment with xenobiotics (antibiotics). In a multi-omics approach Perez-Cobas et al. analysed changes of the total and active metagenome (16S rDNA and rRNA), metabolome, metatranscriptome and metaproteome during treatment of one patient with a common \u00df-lactam antibiotic. Franzosa et al. [5] used stool samples originating from 8 healthy donors of a prospective cohort study to evaluate the relationship between the metagenomes and the metatranscriptomes. Interestingly this study showed that across subjects, metatranscriptomic functional profiles were more individualized than the corresponding metagenomic profiles or 16S rRNA gene diversity. Despite the potential of metatranscriptomic analysis of the GIT microbiota, the technical challenges are numerous and even the best bioinformatic approaches cannot overcome poor biological sample quality and processing artefacts. The short half-lives of mRNA [6], a high content of nucleases present in stool samples [7], ineffective cell lysis [8], high amounts of inhibitory substances co-extracted with the RNA [7;8] and difficult enrichment of bacterial mRNA [9, 10] can be huge hurdles on the way to a successful metatranscriptome study. First metatranscriptome studies of the human gut suffered e.g. from ineffective mRNA enrichment and thus a potential loss of low abundant transcripts due to low sequencing depth [2, 11].",

Since application of liquid nitrogen is often not feasible in clinical practice, the choice of an appropriate stabilizing agent is crucial to prevent RNA degradation. Therefore, we studied the effect of the stabilization reagent (RNA protect or RNA Later) and storage temperature on the decay of mRNA and rRNA for 15\u00a0days using quantitative RT-PCR of indigenous stool genes as well as of spike-in controls. Control samples immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen provided the gold standard.

The efficiency of cell lysis may vary considerably among different species of bacteria. For example, the cell wall of Firmicutes, one of the two dominant phyla colonizing the human gut, consists of multiple layers of peptidoglycan and is therefore hard to lyse. Lakay et al. [8] compared different cell lysis methods and showed that bead-beating is more efficient than methods involving enzymatic lysis, liquid nitrogen grinding or microwave based rupture. The lower yield of our laboratory protocol routinely applied for the lysis of streptococci is therefore caused by the inefficiency of vortexing compared to bead-beating. In the finally chosen protocol for stool metatranscriptomics (MoBio Kit) a bead-beating step is combined with chemical lysis.",

Thus the transfer time between conservation of the stool sample in a stabilizing reagent and its arrival at \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C is a crucial and variable factor. An ideal stabilizing reagent should prevent RNA degradation even at room temperature for at least several hours. We therefore compared RNA stability in 3 different RNA stabilizing reagents (Stool Total RNA Purification Kit (Norgen), Powermicrobiome RNA Isolation Kit (MoBio) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)) at two different storage temperatures (4\u00a0\u00b0C and RT) for up to 360\u00a0h. In addition, the DNA stabilizer solution of the PSP Spin Stool DNA Plus Kit (Stratec, Germany) was also included since this kit would allow to simultaneously isolate RNA and DNA. Allprotect allows the simultaneous analysis of the metabolom, transcriptome and proteome and is therefore of particular interest for multi-omics approaches. RNA Later is also used in the Zoetendal procedure [12]. The experimental design is shown in Fig.\u00a02a. The original stool sample was suspended in the respective stabilizing reagent, spike-in controls were added and the samples maintained at the indicated temperature until analysis up to 15\u00a0days (360\u00a0h) later. As an external control to monitor and quantify the RNA decay, we spiked the samples with IPTG-induced E. coli cells expressing mCherry and GFP under the control of the Lac promoter. The amount of the two spikes was calculated to represent approximately 0.9\u00a0% each of the total cell number in the sample, assuming that 1\u00a0g stool contains approximately 1011 cells [17]. Control samples derived from the same faecium were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. These samples contained no spike-in controls and represent the initial transcriptional profile. RNA from all samples was extracted using the MoBio Kit as described above.",

RNA decay during storage showed large differences depending on the storage temperature and stabilizing reagent. The steepest decrease in RIN number was observed for the samples conserved in RNA Protect at room temperature. After 6\u00a0days the RIN decreased from 9.3 to values around 3. RNA extracted from stool samples conserved in the DNA stabilizer showed a similar behaviour but was slightly more stable. RNA Later and Allprotect prevented RNA degradation much more efficiently. RNA Later performed best: Even after 15\u00a0days of storage at room temperature the extracted RNAs showed RIN numbers above 7. To demonstrate the influence of the storage temperature on RNA quality, we also determined the RINs of RNA extracted from samples stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C in RNA Later.

In Additional file 3: Figure S2 the detected copy numbers for the sFGFP-spike for samples stabilized in RNA Protect and extracted at t\u2009=\u20090 and after 144\u00a0h of storage at RT are shown for primers amplifying approx. 100, 300, 500 and 700\u00a0bp of the sFGFP gene, respectively. The differences in transcript copy numbers between t\u2009=\u20090\u00a0h and t\u2009=\u2009144\u00a0h were more pronounced for primer pairs amplifying a longer region of the target. Accordingly utilization of primers which amplify a longer portion of the target gene is a more sensitive measure for mRNA decay. Utilization of primers amplifying more than 500\u00a0bp of the target gene did not increase the sensitivity of the assay any further. Consequently we used primers amplifying approximately 500\u00a0bp of the target gene for further analysis. Notably, amplification efficiency was not significantly influenced (data not shown). Using these new primers the expected significant decrease in the copy number for samples stored in RNA Protect for a longer period was found (Fig.\u00a03).",

Even at RT, the RNA of stool samples stored in RNA Later was stable for 24\u00a0h to 144\u00a0h. In contrast, RNA stored in RNA Protect degraded rapidly. The copy numbers for the 4 targets decreased strongly after 144\u00a0h. At RT, the copy numbers of the indigenous targets GAPH and the 23S rRNA were significantly reduced already after 24\u00a0h, while both spike-ins were unchanged, possibly because of their higher total abundance. The data are in accordance with the RNA integrity analysis using the Bioanalyzer and confirm a good correlation between the stability of rRNA and mRNA. Among the tested stabilizing reagents RNA Later thus is the reagent of choice to conserve stool sample RNA at ambient temperature.",

Thus per spiked-in E.coli cell 7.66 to 9.23 copies of mCherry mRNA and 4.52 to 5.02 copies of sFGFP transcripts were found. So et al. [19] showed that induction of the Lac promoter with 1\u00a0mM IPTG (as conducted for our spike-in controls) results in a mean of 52 molecules of mRNA per cell encoding a fluorescent reporter protein. Thus the recovery rate of mCherry was between 14.7\u00a0% (RNA Protect) and 17.8\u00a0% (RNA Later) while for sFGFP a recovery rate between 8.7\u00a0% (RNA Protect) and 9.7\u00a0% (RNA Later) was found. The good correlation between the recovery rate for mCherry and sFGFP indicates reproducible sample processing.

Based on these results they assumed that the sample sequencing depth was in that low range. Satinsky et al. [21] found similar recovery rates for RNA spikes in their metatranscriptome analysis of the phytoplankton bloom in the Amazone river plume. However, the stability of pure extracellular mRNA that is added to a sample and then undergoes numerous extraction steps must be significantly different from that of mRNA protected within a bacterial cell. Bursts of nuclease activity from lysing cells in combination with a temperature increase, both occurring during bead beating, may rapidly degrade the spike-in controls. Moreover Gifford et al. combined two methods to enrich mRNA and subsequently linearly amplified the mRNA. Thus multiple enzymatic and experimental steps were conducted before sequencing, each accounting for potential loss of the spike.",

Between 56 million and 93 million reads were obtained per sample. In the RNA Later time series samples the number of total reads was stable. Interestingly, for samples stored in RNA Protect read counts increased with storage time. The total read counts for the samples stored 24 and 144\u00a0h in RNA Protect were higher (82 and 93 million reads) than those for the 0\u00a0h sample (72 million reads). In these two samples the percentage of rRNA was much higher (40\u00a0% for 24\u00a0h and 69\u00a0% for 144\u00a0h) than in all other samples (2-16\u00a0%) analysed, in accordance with the low RIN numbers (3.3 and 5.3). The low efficiency of rRNA removal in these samples is probably caused by the failure of the subtractive hybridisation process used to eliminate rRNA in the RiboZero approach, which depends on the presence of intact 5\u2032and 3\u2032ends that are targeted by the capture oligonucleotide probes. Partially but not completely degraded rRNA will no longer be removed and thus be sequenced. Exonucleases hydrolyse their targets beginning from the ends and account for the degradation of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the transcripts [22]. Interestingly, for the highly degraded RNAs (e.g. 144\u00a0h in RP) a prominent degradation smear in the range of 100\u2013200\u00a0bp was observed in the Bioanalyzer runs. This partially degraded RNA is sequenced since no size exclusion step is conducted before library preparation and most likely accounts for the high number of read counts in those samples. However, the fraction of mRNA is much lower and thus the sequencing depth is reduced in RNA Protect conserved samples, especially after 24\u00a0h and 144\u00a0h of storage at room temperature. Low abundant transcripts may be lost in these samples. This clearly demonstrates the better applicability of RNA Later to prevent RNA degradation in stool samples.",

Non-rRNA reads were mapped against the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) database using bwa [13]. Read counts per strain and read counts per cds were calculated for bwa showing that 60-80\u00a0% of reads mapped to the cds deposited in the HMP. Additionally, Kraken [23] was used to classify reads using its standard database consisting of available NCBI genomes. Here, 40-60\u00a0% of the reads could be assigned taxonomically. Although the bwa alignment assigned more reads than Kraken, the latter has been shown to be highly accurate, though sacrificing sensitivity [23].",

Figure\u00a04 shows qRT-PCR and sequencing results for the relative abundance of the two spike-ins mCherry (A) and sFGFP (B) after 0, 24 and 144\u00a0h of storage in the stabilizers RNA Protect (RT) and RNA Later (RT, 4\u00a0\u00b0C). For both spikes the trend of the qRT-PCR analysis was verified by the sequencing results. The relative copy number of the spikes decreased most strongly for RNA Protect, while RNA Later prevented mRNA decay more efficiently. After 144\u00a0h of storage sequencing revealed that 38\u00a0% (mCherry) and 35\u00a0% (sFGFP) of the initial spike was detectable in samples preserved in RNA Protect. This finding correlates well with the results of the qRT-PCR analysis, showing that 20\u00a0% (sFGFP) and 49\u00a0% (mCherry) of the initial copies of the spike were present after 144\u00a0h of storage. For the RNA Later samples stored either at RT or 4\u00a0\u00b0C, significantly higher proportions of the spikes were still detectable after 144\u00a0h storage (80 and 88\u00a0% for sfGFP and 65 and 74\u00a0% for mCherry) by qRT-PCR. In contrast to the qRT-PCR results, the sequencing analysis showed no significant influence of the storage temperature on mRNA decay of the spike-ins in RNA Later conserved samples. As no size exclusion step is conducted before library preparation for Illumina sequencing, we assume that partially degraded RNAs are still sequenced. This might explain while the qRT-PCR detects differences in mRNA decay between samples stored at ambient temperature and 4\u00a0\u00b0C in RNA Later that were not found in the sequencing results. Thus, the qRT-PCR approach used here is a more sensitive measure to detect mRNA decay than sequencing. Furthermore this implies that Illumina sequencing of partially degraded mRNA still provides reasonable results for a global profiling of the sample.",

Non rRNA reads derived from the SortMeRNA filtering were utilized as input for Kraken. They represent both coding and non-coding RNAs. For the sake of brevity the term mRNA will be used subsequently instead of non rRNA. Fig.\u00a05a shows that while the absolute read counts were relatively stable for samples preserved in RNA Later, a strong decrease in taxonomically assignable reads was observed with increased storage time for samples preserved in RNA Protect. Thus, the sequencing depth in RNA Protect decreases during storage as already inferred from the previous analyses. Interestingly, the snap frozen control samples showed a large decrease in total read counts between replicates, from almost 5xe7 for sample 1 to 3xe7 for sample 3. Since those samples were processed in parallel and were not stabilized, the apparent degradation of mRNA may reflect the time spent on ice and highlight the need for speed when isolating mRNA because of the rapid degradation of thawed RNA.",

Since they were only detected in the stabilized samples, but not in the controls which did not receive spike-ins, we conclude that they represented the E. coli spike-ins which had been misclassified by BW. Using the default settings of bwa the alignment against the HMP database was performed with 19\u00a0k-mers, while Kraken utilizes 31\u00a0k-mers. These differences explain the higher accuracy of the Kraken results and are in accordance with the lower sensitivity of Kraken, which taxonomically assigned less reads than bwa. We therefore utilized Kraken for taxonomic classification of reads for all subsequent analyses.",

The overall correlation between the samples was high, with a correlation coefficient of 0.92 representing the lowest value between any two samples in the whole data set, indicating a high reproducibility of the experimental approach. Nevertheless, interesting differences between RNA Later and RNA Protect can be observed. Figure\u00a06a shows that transcriptional profiles of all samples stored in RNA Later were highly correlated, regardless of storage duration and temperature. Samples stored in RNA Protect were less well correlated with each other, but more similar to the snap frozen controls. The correlation between the 0\u00a0h and 144\u00a0h sample was the lowest, indicating substantial changes of the transcriptional profile during storage for 6\u00a0days. Moreover, the similarity between the RNA Protect samples and the controls decreased during storage. Thus, RNA Protect conserved the transcriptional profile less efficiently than did RNA Later. Control samples (K1-K3) were highly correlated with each other. Interestingly, samples stored in RNA Protect initially (at 0\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h) correlated slightly better with the controls than the samples stored in RNA Later.",

For RNA Protect samples, the distance to the controls increased with storage time.

Again, the functional profiles of samples stored in RNA Later were somewhat different from the control samples while the profiles of samples stored in RNA Protect resembled the profiles of the controls more closely. One very obvious difference between the control samples and all stabilized samples was the higher abundance of COG category \u201cCarbohydrate transport and metabolism\u201d and the reduced abundance of COG category \u201cTranscription\u201d and \u201cAmino acid transport and metabolism\u201d in the controls. Samples stored in RNA Protect showed changes in the abundance of COG categories \u201cTranscription\u201d, \u201cReplication, recombination and repair\u201d,\u201d Cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning\u201d,\u201d Cell motility\u201d and \u201cIntracellular trafficking\u201d over time, which were not observed in RNA Later conserved samples. The relative abundance of transcripts belonging to the category \u201ctranscription\u201d dropped from 14.9\u00a0% (0\u00a0h) to 4.6\u00a0% (144\u00a0h) in RNA Protect conserved samples.

Thus, it is absolutely necessary to immediately snap-freeze the stool sample in liquid nitrogen or to immediately resuspend it in a stabilizer solution. Although RNA Later performed best of all tested reagents in preventing mRNA decay, our data indicate that this stabilizer introduces a bias into the transcriptional profile of the sample. As this was observed immediately after resuspension in RNA Later but not in RNA Protect, it cannot be explained by mRNA degradation during sample processing. Within-sample variation is also unlikely to account for this bias, since samples from 3 different parts of the faecium were pooled for one stool sample used for the metatranscriptome analysis. Moreover, all six RNA Later samples were highly similar to each other. The observed differences between the transcriptomes of controls and RNA later conserved samples might be caused by effects of the stabilizing agent on the microbial community during preprocessing of the sample. RNA Later might influence the precipitation behavior of the bacterial cells, thus leading to an enrichment/depletion pattern for some species. Moreover RNA Later contains high amounts of salts introducing osmotic stress to the cells [5]. The lower abundance of Prevotellaceae transcripts in RNA Later preserved samples could have been caused by lysis of some members of this family during sample processing. Prevotellaceae are Gram-negative bacteria and are easier to lyse than the pre-dominant Firmicutes. During the centrifugation step in our protocol, which is used to pellet the bacteria after removal of fecal debris and solid matter, extracellular RNA originating from lysing bacteria may be lost.",

They found that on the mRNA level the within-subjects correlations between frozen and mock-shipped samples were lower than on the DNA level with respect to species or gene abundance. The lowest value for the Pearson correlation coefficient between treatments on the mRNA level was 0.83. Transcriptional profiles of RNA Later and frozen samples showed a within-subject correlation of approximately 0.93.",

These may not play a large role for a global view on the metatranscriptome of a sample. However, if one is interested in a particular pathogenic species, the activity of a rare microbe, or a specific metabolic pathway, biases such as those occurring in RNA Later or during long-term storage in RNA Protect could be critical. Haiser et al. [29] showed that Eggerthella lenta, a member of the Actinobacteria, is able to metabolize the cardiac drug digoxin to the inactive form dihydrodigoxin using a specific fumarate reductase. This observation highlights the importance of a single, rare species and a specific pathway for the fate of therapeutics due to the metabolic conversion of host-targeted drugs by the gut microbiota. This example also demonstrates the importance of high sequencing depth to capture transcripts with low abundance.",

The recovery rates of the spikes were in the range of 9 \u2013 18\u00a0% showing the high efficiency of the optimized RNA extraction protocol. With this method, RNA extraction efficiency should be routinely controlled. Quantifying RNA decay either globally (RNA Seq) or for specific targets (Q-PCR, RIN analysis) clearly revealed that RNA Protect is inefficient in stabilizing the transcriptional profile for periods exceeding 24\u00a0h. In contrast, the transcriptional profiles of samples preserved in RNA Later did not change significantly even after 6\u00a0days storage at ambient temperature. To our knowledge this is the first study providing quantitative data on mRNA and rRNA decay in stool samples. Our data indicate that storage of a stool sample in a preservation reagent (RNA Later) introduces a bias in the mRNA profile. This study represents the first report showing the applicability of Kraken for a complex metatranscriptomic dataset and demonstrates that the Kraken software tool is more reliable than bwa in assigning taxonomic labels to metatranscriptomic data.",

The higher stability of the metatranscriptome in RNA Later is obtained at the cost of losing some of the transcripts of labile species. Thus it depends on the focus of the study if this bias is acceptable or not. The take-home message for cohort studies or clinical trials it that RNA Later should be used when stool samples need to be shipped at ambient temperature to the laboratory, since the RNA will be stable for up to 6\u00a0days. When shipping can be realized within 24\u00a0h or samples can be shipped on ice, RNA Protect may represent a better alternative since the introduced bias is smaller.",

Approximately 1\u00a0g of stool was sampled using a sterile spatula at three different locations of the faecium, suspended in the stabilizer solution, mixed thoroughly, incubated at room temperature for 5\u00a0min, and frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until further processing. This was repeated for each of the four stabilizer solutions and the two storage temperatures (4\u00a0\u00b0C and RT) to be tested, i.e. a total of 8 stabilized sub-samples were obtained. Snap-frozen controls were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For extraction of RNA, samples were thawed on ice, an equal volume of ice-cold PBS was added and samples were homogenized by vortexing. Samples were centrifuged for 1\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 700\u00a0g to remove solid fecal matter. The supernatant was transferred to a new reaction tube and cells were pelleted at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 9.000\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min. The bacterial cells were resuspended in the different lysis solutions and further treated as described in the special protocols. For comparing the different methods for RNA extraction, a second faecium from the same donor was used and sub-sampled as described above.",

Enriched mRNA was further analysed using capillary gel electrophoresis (Bioanalyser) to verify removal of 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA.",

All genomes, which represent 2718 bacterial and 2343 viral taxa, have been downloaded from NCBI RefSeq on May, 8,\u20092014 and were used to build the standard Kraken database with k\u2009=\u200931. Reads were assigned in paired end mode with standard parameters. Reports generated from the classifications were used for further custom visualisation. For hierarchical clustering, the abundances were normalized to the number of reads that could be classified. The families Enterobacteriacea and Alcaligenaceae were removed in this analysis since Escherichia coli was used as spike-in for the stabilized samples and Alcaligenaceae were found to be mainly represented by reads incorrectly mapping to an Achromobacter genome. The corresponding Achromobacter reference was found to contain an artifact potentially caused by an inappropriate assembly of the reference NC_023061.1. The positions 2434634\u20132434704 and 6057301\u20136057337 in this reference were found to be massively covered, whereas more than 99\u00a0% of the remaining genome were not covered at all. The origin of these regions is unclear at the moment, but we suspect the reads being an artifact of the Illumina sequencing machines.",
