                    "text": "Recent evidence suggests that immunotherapy efficacy may be impacted by the gut microbiota, which profoundly shape the human immune system [6] and thus may play a role in antitumor T cell responses. In mice receiving anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy, antitumor immunity was dependent on the presence of specific Bacteroides species [7]. Likewise, Bifidobacterium enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in mice with melanoma [8]. In human melanoma patients undergoing immunotherapy, gut microbiome composition has been significantly associated with clinical response [9\u201312], and antitumor immunity was enhanced in germ-free mice receiving fecal transfer from the responding patients [9, 10]. However, results between studies thus far have been inconsistent regarding which species and metagenomic functions are related to immunotherapy response. Notably, most published studies have dichotomized patients into responders and non-responders, a practice which ignores time-to-event data and could result in loss of precision [13]. Additionally, published studies have not incorporated metatranscriptomic data into their analysis, which is crucial for understanding actual expression levels of metagenomic functions in the microbial community. Here, we robustly characterized the pre-immunotherapy gut microbiome in a pilot study of melanoma patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenome sequencing, and shotgun metatranscriptome sequencing. We tested whether gut microbiome overall diversity and composition were related to progression-free survival using Cox proportional hazards models, and identified specific microbial taxa and functional pathways that were consistently related to progression-free survival in repeated cross-validation analyses.",

Taxonomic abundance was transformed using the centered log ratio (clr) transformation [35, 36] after adding a pseudocount, in order to remove compositional constraints of sequencing. 16S agglomerated genera or species missing genus- or species-level classification, respectively, were removed for this analysis.

Selected metagenomic pathways with correlated metatranscriptomic expression that were related to longer progression-free survival included biosynthesis pathways for l-isoleucine and petroselinate. Those related to shorter progression-free survival included biosynthesis pathways for 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate, pantothenate and coenzyme A, flavin, pyridoxal 5-phosphate, and guanosine nucleotides, and the degradation pathway for l-rhamnose (Fig.\u00a04a, b; Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S3). Within each of these pathways, abundance of specific biochemical reactions were also related to progression-free survival, typically in the same direction as the parent pathway (Fig.\u00a04c). Selected metagenomic reactions with correlated metatranscriptomic expression that were related to shorter progression-free survival included reactions involved in nucleotide phosphorylation and biosynthesis, l-rhamnose degradation, pectin degradation, and aerobic respiration (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S4, S6; Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S3). Most of the selected gene families with correlated metatranscriptomic expression were uncharacterized proteins; results for these gene families are shown in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S5 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S4. In repeated cross-validated Cox regression for metatranscriptomic expression and relative expression of functional pathways, reactions, and gene families, we did not identify features meeting our selection criteria, likely due to the smaller sample size (n\u2009=\u200917) available for this analysis (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S3-S5).\n",

                    "text": "Risk-associated metagenomic pathways tended to be positively correlated with risk-associated species/subspecies and negatively correlated with protective species (Fig.\u00a05a). For example, risk-associated Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides ovatus were positively associated with l-rhamnose degradation and pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis. Protective metagenomic pathways did not correlate strongly with protective species/subspecies. Similar correlation patterns were observed for species/subspecies with metatranscriptomic expression of these pathways (Fig.\u00a05a). We next explored average species contributions to overall metagenome and metatranscriptome pathway abundances in this patient population (Fig.\u00a05b); while multiple species are involved in each pathway, we noted that Bacteroides ovatus was a significant contributor to degradation of l-rhamnose and biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5-phosphate, 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate, and pantothenate and coenzyme A, while Bacteroides dorei was a significant contributor to guanosine nucleotides biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a05b). Analysis of per-species pathway abundances with progression-free survival implied that degradation of l-rhamnose and biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5-phosphate, 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate, and pantothenate and coenzyme A by Bacteroides ovatus was related to shorter progression-free survival; that guanosine nucleotides biosynthesis by Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides massiliensis was related to shorter progression-free survival; and that l-isoleucine biosynthesis by Coprococcus eutactus was related to longer progression-free survival (Fig.\u00a05c).\n",

Clustering of patients based on the underlying microbial composition in their stool revealed patient groups with significantly different progression-free survival, including a high-risk group enriched in Bacteroides species, and a low-risk group enriched in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and other protective species. Further, we observed metagenomic functions related to progression-free survival that had correlated metatranscriptomic expression and may serve as mechanisms for bacteria to influence immunotherapy response, including protective pathways of amino acid biosynthesis and risk-associated pathways of sugar degradation, guanosine nucleotide biosynthesis, and B vitamin biosynthesis. Finally, we observed that greater microbiome community richness was significantly associated with prolonged progression-free survival. Many of these results are consistent with previous literature, highlighting emergent bacterial modulators of immunotherapy treatment response.",

                    "text": "While several studies now suggest that the gut microbiome is a critical player in immunotherapy response, the mechanisms by which this may occur remains unclear. The main principle of immunotherapy is to block immunosuppressive T cell checkpoints, allowing cytotoxic T cells to attack tumors [39]. Human gut microbiota may modulate the effectiveness of immunotherapy, and anticancer immunosurveillance in general, by shaping both effector and suppressor immune cell populations through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), antigens, and metabolites [40]. One hypothesis by which this occurs is via microbial proteins that mimic tumor antigens, resulting in T cell cross-reactivity; T cells may be primed by microbial antigens in the gut and travel to tumor sites, or the gut microbes or microbial antigens themselves may translocate to distant sites to induce a local T cell response near the tumor [40]. A second hypothesis is that gut microbes or microbial products activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which stimulate the production of cytokines and interferons, thus leading to immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive reactions in T cells; PRR activation may occur in the gut and stimulate traveling innate immune cells, or the microbes or microbial products themselves may translocate [40]. Evidence for these hypothetical mechanisms underlines the potential causal impact of the gut microbiota on immunotherapy response and supports the future use of microbiome manipulation to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy [40].",

                    "text": "To our knowledge, four studies have examined the relationship of the gut microbiome to immunotherapy response in human patients with melanoma. In 2018, Gopalakrishnan et al. reported higher \u03b1-diversity, higher relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and lower relative abundance of Bacteroidales, in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy responders (n\u2009=\u200930) compared to non-responders (n\u2009=\u200913) [9]. They quantified T cell densities in pre-treatment tumors and peripheral blood and observed significant positive correlations of gut Faecalibacterium relative abundance with tumor CD8+ T cell infiltrate and peripheral CD8+ T cell and effector CD4+ T cell frequencies, while Bacteroidales was inversely related to these markers. Further, they found that gut Faecalibacterium was positively related to a peripheral cytokine profile favorable for response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, while Bacteroidales was related to a blunted peripheral cytokine response and to higher peripheral frequencies of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells [9]. Germ-free mice receiving fecal transplant from responding patients had reduced tumor size and enhanced antitumor T cell responses compared to mice receiving fecal transplant from non-responding patients [9]. Also in 2018, Matson et al. reported higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium longum, Collinsella aerofaciens, and Enterococcus faecium and lower relative abundance of Ruminococcus obeum and Roseburia intestinalis, in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy responders (n\u2009=\u200916) compared to non-responders (n\u2009=\u200926) [10]. They too administered fecal material of responders and non-responders to germ-free mice via gavage, and found improved tumor control and enhanced T cell responses in the mice receiving fecal material from responding compared to non-responding patients [10]. In 2017, Frankel et al. reported enrichment of Bacteroides caccae in immunotherapy responders (n\u2009=\u200924) compared to non-responders (n\u2009=\u200915); among ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4)\u2009+\u2009nivolumab (anti-PD-1) responders, they observed enrichment of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides thetaiotamicron, and Holdemania filiformis, while in pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) responders they observed enrichment of Dorea formicigenerans [11]. Finally, in another 2017 report, Chaput et al. observed higher relative abundance of Faecalibacterium, Gemmiger, and Clostridium XIVa and lower abundance of Bacteroides, in anti-CTLA-4 responders (n\u2009=\u20099) compared to non-responders (n\u2009=\u200917) [12]. Two of these studies have found that Bacteroides is related to poor immunotherapy response, while Faecalibacterium is related to improved response, consistent with our findings here. However, some of these previous studies have identified response-related taxa that were not significant in our study, and vice versa, we have identified response-related taxa that were not related to response in previous studies.",

However, it is possible that the functional capacities of the microbiota (which can be redundant across species) are the more key determinant of immunotherapy responses rather than individual species. For this reason, we have characterized the metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of the study patients, to identify metagenomic functions expressed by the microbial community that may influence patient outcomes. We observed that a sugar degradation pathway (l-rhamnose), B vitamin biosynthesis pathways (pantothenate, pyridoxal 5-phospate, flavin, and 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate [folate precursor]), and guanosine nucleotide biosynthesis pathways were associated with shorter progression-free survival. Lactate, a product of sugar degradation, is known to drive tumor progression via its use by cancer cells as a nutrient source and by its promotion of tumor inflammation and inhibitory effect on cytotoxic T cells [41, 42]. It is not clear how microbial B vitamin biosynthesis may diminish immunotherapy response; yet interestingly, metagenomic pantothenate and riboflavin biosynthesis were both associated with resistance to colitis in melanoma patients on anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy [43], perhaps indicative of their effects on immunity. We also observed that biosynthesis of the amino acid l-isoleucine was associated with longer progression-free survival. With mechanisms again unclear, Gopalakrishnan et al. also highlighted that metagenomic amino acid biosynthesis predominated in melanoma patients who responded to immunotherapy [9], though no specific amino acids were identified. Biosynthesis of the fatty acid petroselinate was also related to longer progression-free survival, though reactions within this pathway were not, making this a somewhat unstable finding. Finally, we observed that pectin degradation reactions were associated with shorter progression-free survival, leading us to infer that anticancer properties of pectin [44] may be disrupted by bacterial degradation.",

This allowed us to focus on expressed metagenomic functions potentially related to prognosis, which may be important for identifying adjuvant therapeutic targets for metagenomic functions, rather than specific species. We were additionally able to replicate our findings with the two primary flavors of microbiome profiling\u2014targeted 16S amplicon sequencing and broad metagenomic shotgun sequencing. With analysis of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenome data side by side, we were able to confirm the robustness of our findings with two data types. Clustering of patients based on 16S microbiome composition was slightly more predictive of progression-free survival than clusters based on shotgun microbiome composition, but species-level classification was much higher in the shotgun data, permitting us to identify more response-associated species than with 16S data alone. A further strength of our study was the long follow-up of patients and our use of survival analysis rather than dichotomization of patients into responders and non-responders, a practice done in previous studies [9\u201311] which may result in loss of precision [13].",

A further limitation of our study is that we had insufficient sample size to analyze adjuvant and metastatic patient groups separately and thus present a combined analysis of adjuvant and metastatic patients as one group. Though we did not observe differences in pre-treatment gut microbiome composition between adjuvant and metastatic patients (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S6), we were unable to examine heterogeneity of microbiome effects on survival. Similarly, sample size was insufficient to analyze patient groups separately by immunotherapy treatment regimen; this type of analysis will be important to determine which immunotherapies could be enhanced most by an optimal microbiome composition. Finally, metatranscriptome sequencing data was only available for a subset of 17 patients, which limited our power to assess the relationship of metatranscriptomic expression and relative expression with progression-free survival.",

Larger studies with robust microbiome characterization are needed to validate the microbial species and functions related to progression-free survival in melanoma patients on immunotherapy, and whether these relationships differ for adjuvant and metastatic patients or by immunotherapy type. Ultimately, this research may provide microbial therapeutic targets to improve immunotherapy outcomes and increase survival in these patients.",
