Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (a) patients with moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) (Harvey\u2013Bradshaw Index\u00a0\u2265\u00a07, n\u00a0=\u00a011) and (b) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n\u00a0=\u00a04). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid\u2010gut, from healthy donors), and follow\u2010up visits were performed at baseline, 3\u00a0days, 1\u00a0week, and 1\u00a0month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow\u2010up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from five individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3\u00a0days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (three out of four UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease\u2010specific displacement advantages under two\u2010disease status. Finally, most post\u2010FMT species (>\u00a080%) could be properly predicted (area under the curve >\u00a085%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre\u2010FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.",

The etiology of IBD has been proposed to be multifactorial, involving a dysregulated immune response to environmental factors in a genetically susceptible individual 1. Interestingly, given the evidence accumulated in recent years, the gut microbiota is now recognized for playing an important role in IBD. Dysbiosis is a decrease in gut microbial diversity owing to a shift in the balance between commensal and potentially pathogenic microorganisms of the gut microbial ecosystem and has long been characterized as a trait of IBD patients 2, 3. The article by Sunkara et al. explains in detail about how gut microbiota dysbiosis is characterized by a significant reduction of obligate anaerobes and a sharp increase in facultative anaerobes. Release of anti\u2010inflammatory compounds is caused by a decrease in obligate anaerobes which causes increased inflammation 4. Bacteroids\u00a0fragilis and Faecalibracterium\u00a0prausnitzii were considered to have the potential to promote intestinal inflammation through downregulation of Treg cells 5, 6, 7.",

Its successful application for the treatment of Clostridium\u00a0difficile infection has inspired people to apply it to IBD patients 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. However, this application is still in its early stages. According to a recent systematic review and meta\u2010analysis, after minimizing publication bias, IBD patients who received FMT had a remission rate of only 36.2%: 22% for UC and 60.5% for CD 14.

In addition, the majority of studies conducted so far to investigate the role FMT plays in treating IBD have used 16S rRNA sequencing, which has limited resolution on taxonomic and functional classification of sequences. Contradictory results were often observed at species\u2010level resolution, making it hard to determine the exact role of different bacterial agents. For instance, the abundance of F.\u00a0prausnitzii was found to decrease in one study and to increase in another 19, 20. Thus, it is necessary to be able to appreciate the whole composition of gut microbiota at a strain level. Strain\u2010level variants within microbial species are crucial in determining their functional capacities within the human microbiome, such as interaction with host tissues 21, modulation of immune homeostasis 22, and xenobiotic metabolism 23. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing with the ability to target all DNA material in a sample can give a base pair\u2010level resolution of the genome that makes single nucleotide analysis possible. Additionally, promising machine learning methods could enable the establishment of predictive models to predict the microbiota composition of post\u2010FMT recipients. Recently, Smillie et al. constructed a machine learning model to predict the species profile of post\u2010FMT recipients for 18 C.\u00a0difficile patients and found that bacterial abundance and phylogeny were the strongest determinants of engraftment 24. In our study, we utilize a random forest model to predict the mOTU profile of IBD recipient 3\u00a0days after FMT and identified the variables that contribute most to model prediction accuracy.",

It appeared that introduced strains were more likely to be established in a new environment if the species was already present, and a pattern of donor strains establishing alongside indigenous strains of the recipient was observed.

Given this perspective, it would make sense to relate the change in clinical parameters to the abundance change of gut microbiota in response to FMT treatment. We established the relationships between the change in clinical indexes and in mOTUs of recipients using Spearman\u2019s correlation. We found that defecation changes were significantly positively correlated with Selenomonas\u00a0artemidis and two unclassified species, and negatively correlated with Enterococcus\u00a0casseliflavus and Prevotella\u00a0bivia. Changes in CD4+/CD8+, which have been identified to be higher in IBD patients than in normal people in previous studies, were significantly positively correlated with Streptococcus.sp. C150, Streptococcus\u00a0infantis, Streptococcus\u00a0parasanguinis, and Streptococcus\u00a0australis, and negatively correlated with changes in Streptococcus\u00a0gordonii and Lactobacillus\u00a0salivarius, a probiotic bacterium that lives in the gastrointestinal tract and has a range of therapeutic properties including suppression of pathogenic bacteria 33. Changes in TSC were significantly positively correlated with changes in B.\u00a0fragilis, which is found in most anaerobic infections and can promote the induction of type 1 T helper (TH1) cells, suppress IL\u201017 production, and improve experimental colitis 34. Additionally, we tested whether the physical characteristics of patients, such as BMI, age, and disease duration, (Table S2) could affect clinical outcomes. Changes in CD4+/CD8+, Th.cell.Induced (counted by FCM), and abdominal pain score were found to significantly negatively correlate with the disease start age of patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which could reflect disease duration. In addition, changes in CD4+/CD8+ and Th.cell.Induced were significantly negatively correlated with the age of patients (when patients received FMT treatment). Disease duration and the age of patients were also discovered to be important features in the random forest classification model. As a result, we speculated that disease duration and age could be used as stratifying factors for IBD patients in future therapy plans (Fig. \u200b(Fig.77B).",

As our study revealed, microbiota alterations can be reflected at both species level and strain level after FMT. Strain\u2010level identification makes it possible to run toward the development of probiotics. In addition, the possibility of combining microbiota elements with phenotype factors to predict the gut microbiota composition of post\u2010FMT recipients has also been demonstrated. This highlights the value of utilizing advanced machine learning methods in investigating the principles of species engraftment.",
