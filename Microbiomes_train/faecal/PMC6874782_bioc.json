In a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled crossover study, seven healthy adults received 4\u00a0weeks of daily UCC118 or placebo supplementation. GI hyperpermeability was induced by strenuous treadmill running performed before and after each supplementation period. While running, participants ingested 5\u00a0g of lactulose, rhamnose, and sucrose. Urine was collected before, immediately after, and every hour for 5\u00a0h after exercise to assess GI permeability. Metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal homogenates collected prior to exercise to identify changes in microbial diversity and\u00a0taxon\u00a0abundances. Inflammatory biomarkers were assessed from blood and fecal homogenates collected prior to and immediately following the cessation of exercise. Exercise significantly induced intestinal permeability of lactulose, rhamnose, and sucrose (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). UCC118 significantly reduced sucrose (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 vs. 1.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) recovery, with no substantial change in lactulose (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23 vs. 0.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15; P\u00a0=\u00a00.16) or rhamnose (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22 vs. 0.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28; P\u00a0=\u00a00.22). Taxonomic sequencing revealed 99 differentially regulated bacteria spanning 6 taxonomic ranks (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after UCC118 supplementation. No differences in plasma IL\u20106 or fecal zonulin were observed after UCC118 supplementation. The results described herein provide proof of principle that 4\u00a0weeks of UCC118 supplementation attenuated exercise\u2010induced intestinal hyperpermeability. Further research is warranted to investigate the as\u2010yet\u2010to\u2010be defined molecular processes of intestinal hyperpermeability and the effects of probiotic supplementation.",

Clinical signs are variable, but often present as persistent diarrhea, abdominal cramping and pain, excessive bloating and flatulence, nausea and vomiting, or rectal bleeding. Interestingly, the gastrointestinal symptoms observed in IBS are similar to those observed in endurance athletes, where splanchnic hypoperfusion is believed to comprise intestinal barrier function. Though the underlying mechanisms of these complications in both patients with GI disease and endurance athletes remain unclear, perturbations in the GI tract are frequently documented (Arrieta et al. 2006), and include a breakdown in the intestinal epithelial barrier leading to increased solute permeability (Bischoff et al. 2014).",

As biologics are limited and/or have harsh side effects, there is increased interest in modifying the gut microbiome with probiotics as a means to manage these diseases. While existing evidence demonstrates efficacy of some probiotics in the management of certain disorders, the benefits appear to be strain specific and not transferable to generalized GI complaints (Lamprecht et al. 2012; Whelan and Quigley 2013; Ghouri et al. 2014). UCC118\u00ae is a strain of Lactobacillus salivarius (Lb. salivarius) isolated from the human terminal ileum with characteristics desirable for the manufacturing of an orally administered probiotic species (Dunne et al. 2001). These include enhanced adhesive properties in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) (Neville and O'Toole 2010), direct microbial inhibition, bile resistance, acid tolerance, and inflammatory inhibition (Claesson et al. 2006; O'Hara et al. 2006). Furthermore, UCC118 has been used to improve glycemic control and pregnancy outcome among women with gestational diabetes. Supplementation was safe, tolerable, and led to an attenuation of maternal lipid responses (Lindsay et al. 2015). Preliminary in vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that UCC118 is a safe, well\u2010tolerated probiotic strain with therapeutic potential for the management of GI symptoms and disorders. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of a Lb. salivarius strain, UCC118, on GI permeability in healthy humans.",

Raw read counts were obtained for each of the identified taxa within the sample. Low complexity reads were removed to reduce background before assigning the taxonomic groups. A custom reference genome collection was generated from the larger NCBI nucleotide database to compile all identifiable taxa. Any taxa with an abundance of <5 reads were filtered. Approximately 4100 taxa (abundance >5 reads) were identified within the fecal samples. Reads passing the initial quality thresholds were then clustered against the reference sequence collection described above, identifying and assigning taxa. Taxa were profiled by aligning the reads against the reference sequence collection. Ambiguously mapped reads were reassigned to ensure all reads were mapped appropriately. The abundance for each marker representing a specific taxa was estimated as reads per kilo (RPK) base units, and then normalized by the total number of reads in the metagenome.

Probiotic supplementation has emerged as a promising treatment target, though few bacterial strains have demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials (Kajander et al. 2008; West et al. 2014). While some have observed marked improvements in GI permeability and function (Rosenfeldt et al. 2004; Lamprecht et al. 2012), others have demonstrated weaker to limited benefit (Leber et al. 2012; Shing et al. 2014). Overall integrity of design, length of supplementation, probiotic strain efficacy, and population differences limit comparison to the results obtained herein. Nonmetabolized disaccharide probes, such as lactulose and L\u2010rhamnose, are widely used as a clinical diagnostic for the assessment of intestinal permeability (van Elburg et al., 1995). Under nonpathologic conditions, less than 3% of lactulose is absorbed, and is primarily digested in the colon (Clausen and Mortensen 1997). Thus, hyperexcretion of lactulose largely represents damage to the distal intestinal tract (Mishra and Makharia 2012). Sucrose is rapidly metabolized in the small intestine after passage from the stomach, which allows for its use as a marker of upper GI or gastroduodenal permeability (Kawabata et al. 1998). Herein, sucrose permeability, rather than lactulose, L\u2010rhamnose, or the ratio of lactulose to L\u2010rhamnose, was reduced after UCC118 supplementation. Thus, these data suggest that UCC118 may function by reducing or protecting against exercise\u2010induced small intestinal permeability.",

Network analysis of the changes in microbial abundances led to the identification of phylum Verrucomicrobia, which was markedly reduced and observed in all lower taxonomic ranks after UCC118 supplementation. The phyla Verrucomicrobia is lowly expressed throughout the human GI tract, with exception to the duodenum, where it accounts for ~15% (Wang et al. 2017), of all reads or under disease states where its abundance may be enriched (Dubourg et al. 2013). Furthermore, lactobacilli largely localize in regions of the proximal intestine due to the ability to form biofilm\u2010like structures that enhance adherence (Walter 2008). Therefore, we postulate that a primary mechanism of action of UCC118 is the targeting of Verrucomicrobia and related subspecies in the gastroduodenal tract, which enhances protection against hyperpermeability. Supporting this notion, mice with a mutation leading to spontaneous irritable bowel syndrome display increased Verrucomicrobiaceae abundance (Schaubeck et al. 2016). Recently, Li et al. discovered that treatment with 5\u2010Fu, a potent inducer of colonic mucositis, also increases both fecal and cecum abundance of Verrucomicrobia (Li et al. 2017). However, healthy Chilean\u2019s exhibit increased microbial abundance of Verrucomicrobia compared to obese age\u2010matched counterparts (Fujio\u2010Vejar et al. 2017), suggesting that the targetability of Verrucomicrobia in GI\u2010related disorders may be population and environment specific.",

Both Roseburia and Lachnospiraceae, well characterized butyrate producing bacteria, were dramatically upregulated after treatment with UCC118. Short\u2010chain fatty acids, acetate, propionate and butyrate, are the primary fermentation byproducts of the gut microbiome. Butyrate is of high biological importance as it serves as the primary fuel source for the colonocyte and assists in modulating intestinal immune function. Butyrate also helps to maintain intestinal epithelial cell integrity, preventing disassociation of the tight junction proteins which seal the paracellular space and protect against macromolecule translocation (Ahmad et al. 2000; Smith et al. 2013). Furthermore, one of the most consistent findings among microbiome studies in patients with GI disease is alterations in levels of butyrate producing bacteria (Kostic et al. 2014). Multiple strains of bacteria positively associated with cardiovascular disease, such as Streptococcus mutans (S.\u00a0mutans) and Succinivibrio\u00a0, were reduced after supplementation (Nakano et al. 2006; Serena et al. 2018). Though the patients sequenced in this investigation were very healthy and free of confounding disorders, these findings suggest broader therapeutic application of UCC118.",

Previous research has shown reductions in zonulin and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines after probiotic supplementation in humans (Lamprecht et al. 2012). IL\u201010 knockout mice supplemented with UCC118 exhibited reduced GI inflammation (O'Mahony et al. 2001; Feighery et al. 2008). Additionally, infants with ectopic eczema supplemented with probiotic displayed significant reductions in severity of allergic inflammation (Isolauri et al. 2000). However, multiple well\u2010controlled clinical trials have failed to detect changes in inflammatory markers, despite improvements in primary therapeutic outcomes (Kajander et al. 2008; Worthley et al. 2009; Andreasen et al. 2010). Therefore, it may be that probiotic\u2010related clinical improvements in inflammatory disease are reflected in cellular, bacterial, and tissue remodeling, and to a lesser extent in the peripheral circulation.",
