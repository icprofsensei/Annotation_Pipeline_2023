The isolation of DNA from microbiome specimens is a key prerequisite for such examinations, but challenges remain in obtaining sufficient DNA quantities required for certain sequencing approaches, achieving accurate genomic inference of microbiome composition, and facilitating comparability of findings across specimen types and sequencing projects. These aspects are particularly relevant for the genomics-based global surveillance of infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance from different reservoirs. Here, we compare in a stepwise approach a total of eight commercially available DNA extraction kits and 16 procedures based on these for three specimen types (human feces, pig feces, and hospital sewage). We assess DNA extraction using spike-in controls and different types of beads for bead beating, facilitating cell lysis. We evaluate DNA concentration, purity, and stability and microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and for selected samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results suggest that inferred community composition was dependent on inherent specimen properties as well as DNA extraction method. We further show that bead beating or enzymatic treatment can increase the extraction of DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Final DNA quantities could be increased by isolating DNA from a larger volume of cell lysate than that in standard protocols. Based on this insight, we designed an improved DNA isolation procedure optimized for microbiome genomics that can be used for the three examined specimen types and potentially also for other biological specimens. A standard operating procedure is available from https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3475406.",

Such insight could further the development of innovative ecosystem management approaches for the protection of our natural resources and the design of more effective and sustainable solutions to prevent and control infectious diseases. Genome sequence information is an organism (pathogen)-independent language that can be used across sectors, space, and time. Harmonized standards, protocols, and workflows for sample processing and analysis can facilitate the generation of such actionable information. In this study, we assessed several procedures for the isolation of DNA for next-generation sequencing. Our study highlights several important aspects to consider in the design and conduct of sequence-based analysis of microbiomes. We provide a standard operating procedure for the isolation of DNA from a range of biological specimens particularly relevant in clinical diagnostics and epidemiology.",

Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance analysis carried out separately for each of the three specimens revealed that the samples largely clustered according to DNA isolation procedure (Fig.\u00a02A to C). For the human fecal specimen, the bacterial community composition derived from the Easy-DNA isolation differed from the communities obtained using all other methods (Fig.\u00a02A), which is in agreement with the observations on microbial richness (above). The Bray-Curtis distances between the samples from InnuPure, MagNA Pure, FastDNA, PowerSoil.HMP, QIAStool, and QIAStool+BB DNA isolations were on average 0.337 \u00b1 0.012 (SEM), whereas the distances between these and the ones derived from the Easy-DNA procedure were on average 0.825 \u00b1 0.014 (SEM).",

This ratio was lower in the spiked human fecal specimen using InnuPure, FastDNA, PowerSoil.HMP, and QIAStool+BB, which are all methods that involve a bead beating step (Enterobacteriaceae/Staphylococcaceae ratio range, 0.3 to 2.3). The Easy-DNA method involves an additional enzymatic lysis step, and using this method, the determined Enterobacteriaceae/Staphylococcaceae ratio was 3.7. Using the MagNA Pure method, no or lower read numbers assigned to Staphylococcaceae were detected in the spiked samples than in nonspiked samples in the human fecal specimen, and hence, the ratio resulted in negative values (Fig.\u00a04A). A similar result was obtained when the samples were examined using metagenomics (see Fig.\u00a0S4 in the supplemental material).",

To address this aspect, we examined the effect of modifications to standard protocols on output DNA concentration (modifications are described in detail in the supplemental materials and methods [see Text\u00a0S1\u00a0in the supplemental material]). We chose the QIAStool method as a starting point, as we obtained DNA extracts using this method that were of high purity and stability (see Table\u00a0S1A in the supplemental material). Another concern is processing time and costs for DNA isolation procedures, particularly for large-scale microbiome projects. The protocol of the QIAamp Fast DNA stool minikit (QIAFast), a kit that became available at the time that the present study was carried out, suggested reduced processing time compared to the QIAStool method. When we compared the QIAStool and QIAFast methods using metagenomic sequencing, we obtained similar richness, diversity, and microbial community composition with these two methods (see Fig.\u00a0S5 in the supplemental material).",

One current ambitious goal is to establish a global surveillance system for infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance based on next-generation DNA sequencing approaches (15). Given that infectious agents occupy various ecological habitats, DNA needs to be extracted from various types of specimen using standardized approaches in a time- and cost-efficient manner. It is advantageous if a range of different specimens can be processed using the same standard operating procedure (SOP). In light of these considerations, we compared eight commercially available DNA isolation kits (a total of 16 protocols) and based on the findings developed an improved protocol using the QIAamp Fast DNA stool minikit.",

The taxonomic microbiome composition appeared to be dependent on both the specimen and the DNA isolation method. For example, the Easy-DNA procedure preferentially extracted DNA from Gram-positive bacteria from the human feces and hospital sewage, while the FastDNA procedure preferentially extracted DNA from Gram-positive bacteria from pig feces. Methods that did not include a bead beating or enzymatic treatment step generally extracted less DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, the results from our experiment that included the detection of spiked bacteria (Gram negative and Gram positive) suggest that quantification of distinct organisms from complex specimens is more challenging when the organisms are present at lower abundance levels.

However, we also observed several differences (e.g., Fig. 2 and \u200band3).3). Hence, one cannot conclude that the DNA from a particular bacterial family will be extracted preferentially using one specific DNA isolation method across different types of specimens. This could be due to different inherent cellular properties of the taxa belonging to a specific family, affecting mechanical and enzymatic cell lysis. Moreover, the chemical and physical composition of the specimen could influence DNA isolation and downstream procedures. For example, it is well known that certain compounds, such as humic acid, polysaccharides, and bilirubin, can affect PCR (16). Furthermore, fecal sample consistency, reflecting differences in water content and activity, can impact microbial community composition (17).",

One reason could be the known primer biases toward certain taxa in 16S rRNA gene-based analysis (18). An additional reason could be differences in the composition of the reference databases used for the two sequence-based strategies. While 16S rRNA gene databases are composed of 16S rRNA gene sequences from a high diversity of taxa, the metagenomic sequence databases are based on whole- and draft genome sequences from fewer and less diverse taxa. The two strategies complement each other, and efforts are ongoing in developing harmonized analytical workflows for sequence-based microbial community analysis.",

This procedure includes a bead beating step to obtain DNA from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative taxa and a step in which the double amount of cell lysate is transferred to the column to increase the DNA quantity. For aqueous sample types, like sewage, additional modifications are included, such as increasing the input amount and processing aliquots of it in parallel, as described in the standard operating procedure (SOP). While there was no single approach among the 16 procedures tested that appeared to completely resolve all challenges, we found the SOP based on the QIAamp Fast DNA stool minikit useful for a number of reasons, including the following: (i) DNA extracts contained large amounts of DNA (sufficient to permit PCR-free metagenomic sequencing) with high reproducibility, (ii) DNA extracts were of high quality in terms of DNA purity and stability, (iii) DNA from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was reasonably well extracted (including from Bifidobacteria) as determined by 16S rRNA amplicon profiling and metagenomic sequencing of spiked and unspiked complex samples, (iv) the method worked well for all examined sample types based on the DNA quality assessment and inferred microbiota composition, (v) the reagents and materials required were cheaper, and (vi) the time needed for carrying out the DNA isolation was shorter than for several of the other procedures. A standard operating procedure for this DNA isolation method is available from https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3475406; it can be used for different specimen types and may be relevant to projects like EFFORT-against-AMR, COMPARE-Europe, the International Microbiome Initiative, and International Human Microbiome Standards.",

DNA concentrations were measured using the Qubit double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) BR assay kit on a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). As DNA extracts can contain contaminants such as proteins and other organic molecules that can affect downstream procedures such as DNA amplifications in PCR, we determined the DNA purity by measuring the ratios of absorbance at 260/280 and 260/230 using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). DNA extracts with a 260/280 ratio between ~1.7 and ~2.0 and a 260/230 ratio between ~2.0 and ~2.2 are regarded as \u201cpure.\u201d The stability of the DNA in the extracts was determined by measuring the DNA concentration after 2 and 7\u00a0days of incubation at 22\u00b0C. A decrease in DNA concentration over time can indicate the presence of DNases in the extract.",

The samples were pooled in equal concentrations and concentrated using the DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Paired-end 2 \u00d7 250-bp sequencing of barcoded amplicons was performed on a MiSeq machine running v2 chemistry (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The sequences were processed using the UPARSE pipeline (21), and an OTU \u00d7 sample contingency table was created. Using QIIME1.8.0 (22), taxonomy was assigned with uclust using assign_taxonomy.py based on the Greengenes 13.8 reference database. Ecological diversity estimates and microbial community comparisons were performed using the relevant scripts provided by QIIME, phyloseq, and R (22,\u201324).
