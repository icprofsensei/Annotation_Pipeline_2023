Gut microbes are an epidemiologically important reservoir of resistance genes (resistome), yet prior studies indicate that the true diversity of gut-associated resistomes has been underestimated. To deeply characterize the pediatric gut-associated resistome, we created metagenomic recombinant libraries in an Escherichia coli host using fecal DNA from 22 healthy infants and children (most without recent antibiotic exposure), and performed functional selections for resistance to 18 antibiotics from eight drug classes. Resistance-conferring DNA fragments were sequenced (Illumina HiSeq 2000), and reads assembled and annotated with the PARFuMS computational pipeline. Resistance to 14 of the 18 antibiotics was found in stools of infants and children. Recovered genes included chloramphenicol acetyltransferases, drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductases, rRNA methyltransferases, transcriptional regulators, multidrug efflux pumps, and every major class of beta-lactamase, aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme, and tetracycline resistance protein. Many resistance-conferring sequences were mobilizable; some had low identity to any known organism, emphasizing cryptic organisms as potentially important resistance reservoirs. We functionally confirmed three novel resistance genes, including a 16S rRNA methylase conferring aminoglycoside resistance, and two tetracycline-resistance proteins nearly identical to a bifidobacterial MFS transporter (B. longum s. longum JDM301). We provide the first report to our knowledge of resistance to folate-synthesis inhibitors conferred by a predicted Nudix hydrolase (part of the folate synthesis pathway). This functional metagenomic survey of gut-associated resistomes, the largest of its kind to date, demonstrates that fecal resistomes of healthy children are far more diverse than previously suspected, that clinically relevant resistance genes are present even without recent selective antibiotic pressure in the human host, and that cryptic gut microbes are an important resistance reservoir. The observed transferability of gut-associated resistance genes to a gram-negative (E. coli) host also suggests that the potential for gut-associated resistomes to threaten human health by mediating antibiotic resistance in pathogens warrants further investigation.",

                    "text": "Increasing antibiotic resistance in human pathogens threatens to render many bacterial infections untreatable [1]\u2013[3]. Human commensal microbiota harbor numerous functional antibiotic resistance genes which, in aggregate, comprise the human gut-associated resistome [4], [5]. These genes can be exchanged among gastrointestinal microbes [6], including potential pathogens, particularly during host stress [7]. Therefore, characterizing the diversity and mobility of the commensal resistome is essential to understand the dissemination of multidrug resistance in hospitals and communities. The establishment of human gut-associated resistomes is ideally studied in the pediatric fecal microbiota. This microbial community is dynamic in early life: a newborn\u2019s sterile gut is colonized immediately after birth, and the population structure then fluctuates rapidly for several years until it attains a composition that likely persists into adulthood [8]\u2013[10]. Alterations to the microbiota during this critical developmental period may permanently alter both its phylogenetic composition and its associated resistome. Exposure to a fairly limited set of antibiotics (mostly beta-lactams, macrolides, and folate-synthesis inhibitors) is common in children [11]\u2013[13], and resistance to beta-lactams, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, macrolides, and chloramphenicol has been reported in infant gut microbiota [14]\u2013[17]. However, previous functional investigations of human fecal microbiota suggest that pediatric resistome diversity may have been significantly underestimated by culture- and PCR-based studies [5]. Moreover, though culture- and PCR-based studies may identify resistance genes and phenotypes, the association of resistance genes with mobile genetic elements, a crucial risk factor for dissemination of resistance, is not readily assessed with those methodologies.",

To deeply characterize the fecal resistome of 22 healthy pediatric clinic patients aged 1 month to 19 years, we coupled functional metagenomic selections with next-generation (Illumina platform) sequencing and a recently developed pipeline for high-throughput assembly, and annotation of functionally-selected DNA (PARFuMS, Parallel Annotation and Reassembly of Functional Metagenomic Selections) [18]. We sought to optimally represent the pediatric gut resistome by maximizing both the number of subjects included (22, an order of magnitude higher than prior functional metagenomic studies of gut-associated resistomes [5]) and the diversity of functional resistance screens (18 antibiotics representing eight drug classes). Because metagenomic (microbial community DNA) libraries created in a model Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) host models the potential transfer of resistance genes from native intestinal microbes to human pathogens, we were able to select for resistance genes with the most potential to confer resistance to human pathogens, regardless of the genes\u2019 functions in their native hosts. This protocol also facilitates novel gene discovery because antibiotic resistance is detected by functional selection rather than by homology to previously described sequences. Finally, because resistance genes are identified on contigs 1\u20135 kb in length, we are able to identify resistance genes at greatest risk for dissemination by virtue of their close association with mobile genetic elements.",

A fifth group of beta-lactamases, CLOBOL, was comprised of proteins with high amino acid identity to the putative beta-lactamase CLOBOL_04087 from Clostridium boltae ATCC BAA-613 (GenBank Accession NZ_ABCC02000033.1). The function of CLOBOL has not been experimentally verified, and although it is not a known ESBL, it clustered with Class A ESBL protein families SHV, CTX-M, and TEM on an approximate maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). CLOBOL was found in 8 of the 20 subjects (2 infants, 6 children <11 years old) and was closely associated with mobilization elements, which suggests significant dissemination of this poorly-understood beta-lactamase in this cohort of healthy pediatric clinic patients.",

Constitutive expression of the marA transcriptional regulator and its homologs SoxS and Rob induce transferable antibiotic resistance in various microorganisms; all three were found in our samples [30], [31]. MarA and other genes in the marCRAB locus were also found in beta-lactam and tetracycline selections, consistent with the known activity of the mar regulon. Although these transcriptional regulators are only capable of generating antibiotic resistance in a host organism (such as Salmonella enterica or our model recipient E. coli) in which they can act to upregulate efflux pumps, their presence in healthy children is significant because they most likely reflect the presence of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, which, in addition to being a common component of the gut microflora, is also an important human pathogen.",

Moreover, this population of healthy infants, children and adolescents harbored a diverse array resistance genes associated with mobilization elements and therefore poised for dissemination. The scale of this study, an order of magnitude larger than prior functional metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiota, was facilitated by the novel high-throughput coupling of next-generation sequencing with PARFuMS, a computational pipeline that assembles and annotates short-read sequence data from up to 200 functional selections in parallel, allowing dramatically increased throughput at <1% of the cost of Sanger-based methods [18] (details in File S1). Specifically, genes encoding all Ambler beta-lactamase classes were present, including pathogen-identical and novel proteins. Likewise, all major molecular mechanisms in the tetracycline-resistance family were represented. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferases were commonly found in this cohort, as were multiple-antibiotic-resistance transcriptional regulators (MarA and its homologs SoxS and Rob). All major classes of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were detected, as well as rRNA methyltransferases. Presumed drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductases and D-ala-D-ala ligases were present in every metagenomic library. Even some resistance genes for which antibiotic selections were not performed (e.g. macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance genes) were identified via proximity to other resistance genes. The use of an E. coli host organism facilitated detection of resistance genes with demonstrable ability to confer resistance to a model Gram-negative pathogen, and included many contigs with high sequence identity to widely varied organisms (commensals, pathogens, and both Gram-positive and \u2013negative bacteria), representing a true cross-section of the fecal microbial community.",

Although the limited clinical information associated with these archival samples precludes examining any association between antibiotic and other environmental exposures (e.g. family members, pets [10], [40]) and resistance phenotypes and genotypes, subject or family member exposure to several of the agents tested (tigecycline, D-cycloserine, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol) were extremely unlikely in this cohort. The capture of resistance genes against these agents, and the presence of resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and cycloserine in all libraries, suggests that, in some cases, the resistome is established independent of antibiotic selection in the host. In particular, elevated tigecycline MICs in our E. coli host were found in several libraries even though the fecal samples were collected before this agent was introduced [41]. Decreased tigecycline susceptibility was conferred by TetX1 and TetX2, which likely encodes a tetracycline-degrading enzyme similar to tetX; this presumably conferred decreased susceptibility to tigecycline due to structural similarities between tetracycline and tigecycline. These findings suggest a potential role for functional metagenomics in predicting emerging resistance to new antibiotics and improving surveillance and control of multidrug-resistant organisms.",

While some familiar mobile resistance genes were identified, such as the TEM beta-lactamase associated with E. coli R1 plasmids and tet family genes associated with Bacteroides conjugative transposons, we also identified mobilizable resistance genes on contigs with little identity to known microbial genomes or mobile genetic elements archived in the NCBI nt and wgs databases in every class of antibiotics assayed. This demonstrates that poorly characterized uncultivated organisms in the gut microbiota are important sources of resistance genes, even to rarely used antibiotics. The detection of chloramphenicol resistance in every library was especially surprising; prior culture-based studies of pediatric fecal microbiota detect chloramphenicol resistance less frequently than resistance to other agents [14]\u2013[17], [42]. The factors underlying the common chloramphenicol resistance in the uncultured fecal microbiota are unclear, although selective pressures in the environment such as agricultural use of chloramphenicol [43], or vestigial resistance from an era when chloramphenicol was more widely used in humans, are plausible. Clearly, the pediatric fecal microbiota must be further characterized as an important reservoir of mobilizable resistance against common and rarely used antibiotics, particularly if the rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens spurs reintroduction of rarely used agents [44].",

Although many safety assessments of food-grade and probiotic organisms have been performed [45], the omission of functional selections in these experiments might have underestimated the potential of these organisms to act as resistance gene reservoirs. For instance, we show that two proteins >98% identical to MFS transporters from B. longum s. longum JDM 301 generated high-level tetracycline and oxytetracycline resistance in E. coli, yet a detailed computational analysis of this strain did not associate these transporters with tetracycline resistance [46]. Although these results must be interpreted with caution, as the risk of horizontal gene transfer from probiotic to pathogen in the absence of a mobile genetic element is low, this example of a widely-used food-grade organism with the potential to donate high-level antibiotic resistance to a pathogenic host, regardless of the gene\u2019s function in its native context illustrates that an organism\u2019s potential to act as a reservoir of resistance genes is best assayed using functional metagenomics, a key complement to culture-based and in-silico approaches.",

Although our laboratory-designed transfer of resistance genes to the model recipient E. coli does not prove that such transfer occurs naturally, the ease of transferring resistance phenotypes to a model recipient closely related to many human pathogens is concerning. While current data are insufficient to assess the risk of commensals transferring resistance alleles to pathogens, the presence of functional resistance genes in healthy children that are more diverse than previously suspected and include a mobilizable resistance reservoir against rarely used antibiotics, is worrisome. Our identification of tigecycline resistance in fecal samples collected before introduction of that drug, of unanticipated resistance function of proteins (e.g. MFS transporter in Bifidobacterium longum), and of a putative novel resistance mechanism (Nudix hydrolase) demonstrate the potential for functional metagenomics to detect new patterns of resistance, and suggest that increased surveillance for resistance genes in commercial organisms (i.e. probiotics) and in human microbial communities, may be warranted. Together, these results underscore the importance of functional metagenomics as a complement to culture-based, PCR, and computational resistance assays, and illustrate its promise as a powerful tool for illuminating fecal resistome diversity and identifying emergent resistance trends.",

Each primer pair is assigned a number from 1\u201312 with the forward primer designated as \u201cA\u201d and the reverse primer designated as \u201cB\u201d. PCR templates and products are listed to the right of the primer sequences. Table S3 in File S1: Antibiotics used in functional metagenomic screens Antibiotic concentrations were selected according to the minimum observed inhibitory concentration (MIC) of MegaX DH10B T1R that had been transformed with unmodified pZE21. If the MIC for the MegaX DH10B T1R with pZE21 was lower than the sensitivity breakpoint for Enterobacteriaceae listed in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) manual, the antibiotic concentration was set at the sensitivity breakpoint. The sole exceptions were ciprofloxacin, which was screened at the lowest observed MIC for MegaX DH10BT1R transformed with pZE21, which was below the breakpoint listed in the CLSI, and tigecycline, for which there are no standards in the CLSI manual for dilution susceptibility testing (disk diffusion only is described). A tigecycline concentration of 2 ug/mL was used to determine tigecycline nonsusceptibility in our E. coli host, as this far exceeds the reported range of susceptibility in wild-type E. coli. [53], [54] All concentrations are in ug/mL, and all antibiotics were added to Mueller-Hinton agar with 50 ug/mL of kanamycin (MH-Kan). Table S4 in File S1: Keywords used to categorize PARFuMS annotations. If any term in a given category (antibiotic resistance, transporter, or mobile element) appeared in the set of annotations for an ORF, the entire ORF was categorized accordingly. There was a hierarchy of categories so that the antibiotic resistance category superseded the transporter or mobile element categories (e.g. if one annotation was for an efflux pump, and another was for a multidrug-resistant efflux pump, the ORF would be classified as an antibiotic resistance gene). If an ORF was annotated with any of the terms in the column marked \u201cflagged for further review\u201d, the ORF was reviewed manually by performing a BLASTx with default settings against the NCBI nr database and against the Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB) to determine if a resistance gene was present. Table S5 in File S1: Categories of metagenomic fragments based on keyword search of PARFuMS output. Each metagenomic fragment was assigned to one of the categories listed in the left column based on the assignment of its component ORFs, as listed in the left column. Contigs initially assigned as \u201cunknown\u201d were BLASTed against the NCBI nr/nt databases to identify any additional resistance genes; their ORFs were then re-categorized and the contigs reassigned accordingly. Table S6 in File S1: rRNA methylases identified in gentamicin screens. Contig names are listed as well as the functional annotation, the highest-scoring hit to the 16S rRNA methylase ORF in the NCBI nr database, as well as the identity to the top nr hit. The ORF from F19GE_3 was PCR-amplified and cloned into MegaX DH10B T1R E. coli, where it was found to confer extremely high-level resistance to amikacin and gentamicin. Table S7 in File S1: Selected chloramphenicol resistance genes.
