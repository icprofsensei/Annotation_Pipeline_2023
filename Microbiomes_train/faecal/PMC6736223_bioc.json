Dysbiosis of the stool microbiota has been reported in CLD (5\u20139) with a reduction in the abundance of commensal microbiota and a relative increase in potentially pathogenic ones (10). This may in part be due to invasion of the distal gut by \u201coral type\u201d microbiota (5). The mechanisms by which gut microbial dysbiosis contribute to liver disease in humans are not clear, but it is thought that an increase in intestinal permeability (11,12), leading to the translocation of microbial products, plays a major role.",

Most studies have examined stool microbiota (5\u20137,14), which are not necessarily representative of small intestinal mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) due to regional variation in the bacterial populations throughout the gut (15). In animal models, mucosal bacteria are more likely to translocate across the gut wall compared to luminal bacteria (16). The MAM from the proximal small intestine (SI) drains into the portal vein and are well placed to exert an influence on the liver. Emerging data suggest that there may be dysbiosis of the duodenal MAM in cirrhosis (17), although how this relates to the pathogenesis of cirrhosis is unclear. Additionally, the associations between small intestinal dysbiosis, small intestinal permeability, and liver injury in humans have not been examined in detail.",

In brief, alpha diversity was assessed using the Shannon index, and differences in the relative abundance of taxa were analyzed by both differential expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution and analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) statistical tests. Analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons testing. For both differential expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution and ANCOM analyses, taxa with a P < 0.05 with a false discovery rate q value <0.05 were highlighted as significant. Beta diversity was assessed by principal co-ordinate analysis (PCoA), using the Bray-Curtis distance metric and adonis nonparametric statistic. To assess the overall contribution of taxa to the patient cohorts, linear discriminant analysis effect size and the constrained multivariate mixOmics method, sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (20) were used. Predicted function of the genome based on the 16S rRNA sequence data was determined using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) (http://picrust.github.io/picrust) (21).",

The CLD MAM was less diverse overall, and specifically had a reduction in the abundance of Moryella, Porphyromonas, and Veillonella and Actinomyces taxa. Certain Streptococcus-affiliated lineages were increased in CLD, and these largely accounted for the differences in separation between the duodenal MAM communities of CLD and control subjects. In CLD, lower microbial diversity correlated with both increased small intestinal permeability, and serum ALT, suggesting an association with gut barrier dysfunction and hepatic inflammation.",

The number of human studies in CLD that focus specifically on the duodenal MAM is very limited. Chen et al. (17) observed dysbiosis in a study of duodenal MAM from cirrhotic subjects with chronic HBV and primary biliary cholangitis. Taxonomic differences in the CLD subjects between their study and ours are likely explained by demographic differences between the study populations, and variations based on the 16S rRNA gene variable region selected for amplification. In our study, HCV subjects had the most pronounced dysbiosis. This may be linked to overall disease severity, with the higher ALT levels implying a greater degree of hepatic inflammation. Although the virus itself may influence B and T lymphocyte function (25,26), there was no association between HCV viral load and duodenal MAM or permeability.",

We demonstrated that reduced microbial diversity was associated with increased small intestinal permeability and hepatic inflammation (based on the serum ALT). Collectively, these data suggest that enriched microbial diversity in the SI may be a protective factor, and loss of this may compromise intestinal homeostasis and integrity. Notably, endotoxemia, which is a recognized feature of advanced liver disease, was not associated with small intestinal permeability. This may be explained by the low overall abundance of Gram-negative bacilli in the duodenal MAM. It is likely that a variety of microbial metabolites in addition to endotoxin may be important in disease processes in CLD (27) and that endotoxemia is not necessarily driven by the small intestinal microbiota.",

Primary biliary cholangitis spp., which shaped the CLD MAM, are highly functioning in the SI and are dependent on their capacity to utilize carbohydrates, for which they compete with the host (28). Gut mucins are a key factor in maintaining intestinal barrier function (29), and primary biliary cholangitis spp. produce mucin-degrading enzymes (30). Although we did not find a correlation between the abundance of primary biliary cholangitis and small intestinal permeability, more robust metagenomics and metabolomics analyses are required to interrogate this relationship more fully.",

This may be a limitation of the small sample size, particularly among noncirrhotic subjects, and the heterogeneity of the population. As our primary aim was to evaluate the microbiota in CLD compared to non-CLD subjects, there may have been insufficient power for detailed analysis by grouped stages of hepatic fibrosis, and disease etiology. Hepatic fibrosis and liver disease severity are also a product of disease duration, and longitudinal studies are needed to interrogate this more robustly. However, the novelty of this study is the analysis of microbiota derived from a very limited resource, namely duodenal tissue, from subjects who have no other duodenal pathology, in relation to intestinal permeability. To our knowledge, his has not been done before.",
