Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, the pathogenesis of PsA remains unclear. The prevalent paradigm posits that in the presence of predisposing genetic factors (e.g., HLA-B*27, Cw6), individuals with Ps will develop PsA after exposure to yet-unidentified environmental factors (1,2). Previously proposed triggers include viruses, bacterial infections, trauma and stress. Interest has recently reemerged concerning the role of the gut microbiome (the totality of bacteria and their genes in a given biological niche) and associated gut inflammation in the pathogenesis of the SpA disease spectrum (3\u20136). HLA-B27 over-expressing rats, for instance, develop arthritis and colitis only in the presence of specific intestinal microbes (7). Similarly, SKG mice develop joint inflammation, enthesitis, skin inflammation and ileitis after injection with \u03b2-glucan, a major component of bacterial and fungal cell walls (8).",

Subsequently, LefSe applies LDA to those bacterial taxa identified as significantly different (P < 0.05) and further assesses the effect size of each differentially abundant taxon (16). Only those taxa that obtain a log LDA score >2 are ultimately considered. As a result, LefSe indicates those taxa and OTUs that better discriminate between phenotypes. In addition, since LefSe does not consider multiple hypothesis testing, we further applied the non-parametric Wilcoxon test for every taxon at every phylogenetic level whose average abundance was higher than 0.1% (in any of the three groups analyzed). We then applied the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate test (FDR). Those bacterial taxa/OTUs with P < 0.05 and FDR q value lower than 0.2 were considered as the main bacterial taxa differentiating between groups of samples.",

Using a distance-based similarity of \u226597% for operational taxonomic units (OTU) assignment, a total of 2835 OTUs were identified. When compared to healthy subjects, microbial diversity was significantly reduced in PsA and Ps samples, as calculated by the Shannon diversity index and Faith\u2019s phylodiversity index (Supplementary Figures 1A, B). Subsequently, we analyzed whether the overall structure of the microbiota of healthy samples differed from that of Ps and PsA and quantified the similarity by applying the UniFrac phylogenetic distance. We further applied PCoA to cluster samples along orthogonal axes of maximal variance. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1C, PC1 axes discriminated most healthy samples from the majority of Ps and PsA samples. Moreover, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of the obtained UniFrac distances between samples revealed that overall microbiota structure was also significantly different when comparing PsA to Ps samples (Supplementary Figure 1).",

Interestingly, while no bacterial taxa were found to be enriched in PsA patients, relative abundance of several microbial clades were decreased in both PsA and Ps, and therefore enriched in healthy controls (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2). Within these identified components of the intestinal microbiota, Akkermansia, Ruminococcus and Pseudobutyrivibrio were considered the most relevant genera that discriminated PsA microbiota from healthy controls (Figure 1A, D). At other levels of taxonomic classification, unclassified Clostridia and the parental taxonomic levels of Akkermansia (Verrucomicrobia, Verrucomicrobiae and Verrucomicrobiales) were also significantly decreased in PsA. The Ps gut microbiota was characterized by a reduced relative abundance of the genera Parabacteroides and Coprobacillus (Figure 1B, D). The comparison between PsA and Ps groups revealed that the higher taxonomic levels for Akkermansia and Ruminoccocus (including Firmicutes/Clostridiales and Verrucomicrobiales, respectively) were significantly less abundant in PsA patients (Figure 1C, D), while Bacteroidetes phylum and Coprobacillus genus were less abundant in Ps samples. Akkermansia and Ruminoccocus per se were also relatively decreased in PsA (Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 2).",

OTU11 was the only overrepresented OTU in the Ps group.

Given their proposed role in PsA pathogenesis (18), fecal levels of RANKL and OPG were also measured, along with S100 (a novel neutrophil-derived mucosal marker for IBD). PsA patients had an increase in sIgA relative to healthy controls (Figure 3A; P=0.06). Conversely, fecal RANKL was significantly reduced in PsA (Figure 3B; P < 0.05), with only 19% of patients having measurable RANKL compared to 30% of healthy subjects and 75% of Ps patients. Fecal OPG was significantly lower in Ps vs controls (Figure 3C; P < 0.05) but not when compared to PsA. Levels of fecal S100 were similar among all groups. To determine whether fecal quantities of all these proteins were a reflection of systemic levels (which may have translocated into the gut lumen), we performed concomitant serum measurements to calculate correlation coefficients. Although there was no significant correlation between fecal and serum levels of these proteins (Supplementary Figure 4), serum levels of S100 were significantly elevated in Ps patients compared to PsA and healthy subjects (Figure 3D; P < 0.05).",

This analysis revealed that, at the genus level, the relative abundance of intestinal Akkermansia and Ruminococcus \u2013 both low in PsA \u2013 had a significant positive correlation with Heptanoate and Hexanoate (Figure 5A). Akkermansia (as well as OTU85) was inversely correlated with fecal levels of sIgA and the SCFAs Acetate and Butyrate. Interestingly, Coprobacillus, a genus decreased in Ps, negatively correlated with S100 levels in serum. At the OTU level (Figure 5B), OTU43 (Coprococcus), diminished in both Ps and PsA, was also positively correlated with quantities of fecal Heptanoate and Hexanoate. This OTU correlated with OTU31, which in turn positively correlated with OTU109 (Supplementary Figure 5), all of which were also decreased in both groups of patients. OTU16 (UC_Lachnospiraceae), low in PsA, was the only OTU positively correlated with fecal levels of RANKL (also decreased in PsA), and co-occured with two other OTUs that were relatively decreased in PsA: OTU32 and OTU119 (Supplementary Figure 5). Taken together, these interactions describe a potential distinctive pattern representative of the PsA gut microbiota and its metabolites, characterized by lower relative abundance of several taxa and decreased levels of fecal RANKL and MCFAs.",

The role of HLA-B27 and related genes was recently validated in AS, IBD and PsA (19). Subclinical histological and molecular markers of gut inflammation are also found in patients with AS (20,21) and with PsA (10). While these studies addressed the activation of host mucosal immunity, they did not directly examine the role of the intestinal microbiome. The link between intestinal bacteria and SpA has been investigated separately. Prior studies, however, utilized indirect serologic methods, classic culture approaches and/or limited, low-throughput PCR/DGGE-based techniques (22), assessing for prevalence of only a handful of taxa.",

It is conceivable therefore that an altered intestinal microbiota constitutes yet another shared feature between IBD, AS and PsA patients.

Several reports showed that Akkermansia and Ruminococcus species, as well as Alistipes genus, are also diminished in IBD patients. Akkermansia is detectable in the majority of healthy subjects (24) and is an important component in two of three recently described human gut enterotypes (25). Using publicly available genetic alignment tools (BLAST), we found that OTU85 has 100% sequence identity to Akkermansia muciniphila and is virtually absent from our PsA cohort. Functionally, A. muciniphila is predominantly a mucus-degrading gut symbiont that converts mucin into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) Acetate and Propionate, activating host epithelial cells and stimulating an adequate immune response. Notably, A. muciniphila was the most abundantly identified mucolytic mucosa-associated bacterium in healthy controls vs IBD patients (26\u201328), suggesting a protective role for this taxon. In two recent studies, Ruminococcaceae were also underrepresented in gut microbiota from IBD patients, particularly in ileal Crohn\u2019s disease (29,30). Many Ruminococcus species, except R. gnavus, are decreased in Crohn\u2019s disease (31). Interestingly, several Ruminococcus species are also mucin-degrading bacteria and important in maintaining gut homeostasis, particularly via the production of SCFAs. SCFAs in turn promote intestinal health, creating favorable conditions for resistance to pathogenic bacteria and protection against colitis (32). None of the SCFAs analyzed in our cohort, however, were significantly lower in PsA patients.",

Although insufficiently studied, two reports have shown a significant decrease of these MCFAs in IBD patients (33,34). Interestingly, MCFAs display antibacterial effects and were shown to activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3 (35), which in turn is known to ameliorate colitis in animal models (36) and human Crohn\u2019s (37).

An inability to contain this altered antigenic load may lead to broader inflammation, either in the gut (as in the case of Crohn\u2019s disease) or in distal compartments, such as entheses or joints (as in PsA and other types of SpA) (3,5). In our studies, increased immune activation in the intestine that accompanied the dysbiosis was reflected by a higher concentration of sIgA in the gut lumen of PsA patients. It is conceivable that this indicates a local mucosal reactive pattern marked by an effort of the host to confine the immune response to the gut. Conversely, this could also represent the initial evidence of a gut barrier breach only seen in individuals with a specific intestinal dysbiosis, as in the case of recent-onset PsA (i.e., decreased diversity; absence of protective taxa). The exact nature of this response, its antigenic target and its cause-effect directionality merit further study.",

This observation is relevant for several reasons. First, levels of RANKL have been found to be higher in sera of PsA patients (38,39), while RANKL expression was also up-regulated in PsA synovium (40) and in the epidermis of psoriasis patients (41). Second, gut stromal-derived RANKL is the critical factor controlling the differentiation of microfold (M) cells in the intestinal lamina propria, which are crucial for sampling of antigens from the lumen (42). Lastly, in colonic explant cultures from patients with IBD there was an increase in OPG secretion with normal levels of RANKL (43). It is conceivable that this decrease in fecal RANKL levels in PsA patients may actually represent a response to a specific composition of gut bacterial community. Alternatively, the RANKL/OPG system may be a true modulator of gut microbiota and an imbalance in detriment of RANKL in the lumen of PsA patients may facilitate the dissemination of inflammation to distal (joint) sites.",

This is in contrast with our present findings in PsA patients and suggests a distinctive pattern for both conditions. The significance of this divergence is unclear. Prevotella may represent an environmental trigger for RA in at-risk individuals (e.g., those with circulating autoantibodies) as it has been found to exacerbate induced colitis in mice by our group (12) and others (44). A second possibility is that Prevotella expands preferentially under specific local and systemic inflammatory conditions, representing rather a downstream consequence of RA pathogenesis. These marked differences will require further validation and mechanistic investigations as they may significantly contribute to the understanding of RA and Ps-PsA pathogenesis.",
