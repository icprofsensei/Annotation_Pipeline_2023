In addition, anemic male infants exhibited significantly lower serum concentrations of several amino acids compared with nonanemic male infants. Although no specific structural or functional differences in the microbiota were observed with anemia in general, likely due the heterogeneity of its etiology, IDA affected the microbiome both structurally and functionally. Specifically, the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria was lower in IDA subjects of both sexes than in nonanemic, non\u2013iron-deficient subjects of the same sex (females: Butyricicoccus, P\u00a0=\u00a00.041; males: Coprococcus, P\u00a0=\u00a00.010; Roseburia, P\u00a0=\u00a00.027). IDA male infants had higher concentrations of 4-hydroxyphenyllactate (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and putrescine (P\u00a0=\u00a00.042) than those without IDA, whereas IDA female infants exhibited higher concentrations of leucine (P\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and valine (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003).",

The timing, extent, and duration of deficiency result in a wide range of observed cognitive deficits, some of which may arise as a result of alterations in systemic metabolism, because the brain relies on nutrients supplied through the blood rather than storing energy itself (11).",

Ferritin concentrations are high at birth and continue to increase for the first 2 mo of life (26), but the concentrations decrease drastically from 4 to 9 mo of age (27). The wide range of ferritin concentrations observed in infants decreases its usefulness as a biomarker for defining iron status at this age (25). Furthermore, the inflammation often associated with malnutrition may increase ferritin concentrations (28, 29), and these changes may not be corrected for in the adjustment of ferritin based on infection status. Therefore, the standard cutoff of adjusted ferritin of <12 \u03bcg/L was used to define deficiency (24). For the following analyses, infants were defined as being ID if sTfR was \u22658.3 mg/L. A single female infant exhibited a borderline deficient sTfR concentration (8.06 mg/L), but adjusted ferritin and body iron stores indicated deficiency. This pattern was also classified as ID.",

Anthropometric and biochemical indexes were initially assessed for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test. The differences between the sexes were assessed using a t test and Cohen's D effect size in the case of normally distributed data or a Kruskal-Wallis test and Cliff's \u03b4 effect size in the case of nonnormally distributed data. The prevalence of stunting, anemia, and anemia attributed to ID between the sexes were assessed using chi-square tests. Differences in serum metabolite concentrations associated with anemia or IDA in this cohort were analyzed within each sex separately using single-factor ANCOVA (anemia and IDA, both accounting for height-for-age z score as a covariate). Fecal metabolite and fecal microbial relative abundance were assessed using the same models as described for the serum metabolome but included age as an additional covariate. False discovery rate (FDR) correction (corrected by the total number of metabolites or OTUs that were observed in each respective data set) was applied to all calculated P values for the serum metabolome, fecal metabolome, and fecal microbiome. Because correcting for all observed metabolites or OTUs decreases the chance of type 2 errors (false positive) but increases type 1 error (false negative) and our study population is relatively small, uncorrected P values are reported and any differences that remained significant after FDR correction are additionally noted. All reported differences in microbial taxa were considered significant if the uncorrected P value was \u22640.05, a moderate to strong effect size (Cohen's D \u22650.5) was observed, and the OTU was observed in \u226520% of the population being tested.

In this study, anemic subjects exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, as indicated by lower serum concentrations of TCA cycle intermediates (Table 2). Male infants additionally had lower serum concentrations of several essential amino acids, which feed into the TCA cycle (Figure 2), and lower serum taurine concentrations, which may further contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction (39). Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to induce fatty liver, which may occur more readily in males than in females (Figure 6) (40). Moreover, rodent studies have noted similar impacts of ID and IDA on male (41, 42), but not female (43), rodents.",

In the subset of infants without indications of acute illness, males exhibited higher AGP concentrations than females, which suggests in this study that they experience greater oxidative stress. Further indications of increased oxidative stress in anemic males included elevated concentrations of serum inosine, which is released from cells when experiencing metabolic stress (46), and lower serum taurine concentrations, which is a biological antioxidant (47). ID (27), as well as the low energy status (48, 49) and hypoxia (50) associated with anemia, downregulate mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1; Figure 5), a serine/threonine kinase with an extensive role in regulating cellular growth, proliferation, metabolism, and survival (48, 49). Lower availability of amino acids further downregulates mTORC1 activity (51\u201353), which may disadvantage anemic males over anemic females (Figure 5). For instance, inhibition of mTOR leads to decreased oxygen consumption and oxidative capacity of mitochondria through decreased phosphorylation of a number of enzymes involved in the TCA cycle and electron transport (54). Second, mTORC1 has a critical role in hemoglobin synthesis (55). Finally, activation of mTORC1 in hypoxic conditions promotes transcriptional activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (56), leading to altered expression of several genes involved in oxygen supply and redox balance to promote survival in hypoxia (57). Taken together, our results suggest that anemic males may have an impaired ability to activate mTOR signaling, which exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction and increases oxidative stress.",

However, in males, the combined abundance of Coprococcus and Roseburia is 6.7% in reference subjects and 1.6% in IDA subjects. It is unknown whether these low bacterial abundances would produce a biological impact. Indeed, no difference in fecal butyrate concentrations was observed.

In males, IDA was associated with elevated fecal 4-HPL, and although 4-HPL is produced by several bacteria and is noted to suppress reactive oxygen species production in mitochondria (64) and neutrophils (65), no differences were seen in the relative abundance of the bacterial genera or species that produce this compound (65).

Indeed, balanced mTOR activity is critical for proper neurodevelopment (Figure 7) (67\u201373). Lower choline concentrations in anemic males could also negatively affect neurotransmitter synthesis and myelination (74). In addition, sex-dependent effects of the microbiome on neurodevelopment and cognition are beginning to be deciphered (75). Our results suggest that the male microbiome is negatively affected by IDA to a greater extent than the female microbiome, with lower abundances of butyrogenic bacteria in IDA males than in IDA females that may contribute to lower colonic butyrate concentrations in males with IDA. Because evidence has been compiled for benefits of butyrate or butyrate-producing bacteria on cognitive function (58), this change may negatively alter the gut-brain axis in IDA males. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of putrescine in IDA males may have further negative effects because elevated concentrations are toxic and have been implicated in neuronal damage (76).",

In addition, blood samples were not collected at a defined time after a subject's last meal, and with a decreased desire to eat associated with anemia, differences could be due to fasting. Moreover, low blood amino acid concentrations have been associated with stunting (77) and hepatic fatty acid accumulation with protein malnutrition (78, 79). Here, the effect of stunting on the serum metabolome is likely minimal because there was no significant difference in the proportion of anemic (32%) and nonanemic (13%) stunted male subjects (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a01.02, df\u00a0=\u00a01, P\u00a0=\u00a00.312). Finally, only vitamin A status was assessed, yet multiple nutrient deficiencies have been shown to alter fasting amino acid concentrations (80) and could affect anemia status.",
