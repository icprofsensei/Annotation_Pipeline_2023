Studies have verified that the anticarcinogenic effects of Oxp rely on gram-negative (G\u2212) bacteria in the host intestinal tract. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the main component of G\u2212 bacterial cell walls, induces myeloid cells to produce high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under oxidative stress, the DNA damage caused by Oxp is enhanced in the tumor, triggering cancer cell death.9 5-FU, the other component of FOLFOX, has been defined as a first-line drug for NC, and has been used extensively in CRC.11,12 As an analogue of uracil, 5-FU and its prodrugs block nucleotide biosynthesis and induce cell division, in addition to being converted to thymidine-5\u2019-monophosphoric acid by thymidylate synthase.13 Based on clinical feedback and previous studies, there is a clear difference in drug potency among patients.14\u201316 The observed variation in 5-FU efficacy may be due to the different genetic backgrounds of each patient,17 though it is difficult to explain the widespread 5-FU tolerance among different races.18 Such variation suggests that the bowel microflora environment is a key factor in the action of NC.",

We performed deep metagenomics sequencing of all stool samples, and metabolomic analyses of their metabolic profiles; we further built a classification system for the responders and nonresponders based on gut microbiota and metabolites. Our results provide evidence that chemical therapy may affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Additionally, the gut microbiota might be a factor used to improve the effects of FOLFOX agents before treatment for low-set rectal cancer.",

The species\u2019 relative abundances were more than 10\u22124, as shown in Figure 2 (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p\u2009<\u20090.05). When comparing differences in abundance between the responder and nonresponder groups before and after treatment, only Clostridium species were significantly more abundant in the responder group both before and after treatment. As shown in Figure 2, before NC, Clostridium ramosum (labelled with light purple) was detected in the responder group but could not be found in more than 90% of nonresponders. After treatment, Clostridiales bacterium 1.7.47 FAA (labelled with dark purple) was at a higher level in the responder group. In contrast, Megamonas rupellensis and Coprobacter fastidiosus (labelled with light green) were enriched in NRB, and Parvimonas micra, Bacteroides clarus, Porphyromonas uenonis, Solobacterium moorei, and Coprobacter fastidiosus (labelled with dark green) were enriched in NRA.",

Conversely, Campylobacter ureolyticus, Prevotella timonensis, and Solobacterium moorei (labelled with dark purple) nearly disappeared in the responder group after NC.

For each subset, we calculated the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) (Supplementary Table S4). The subset including Coprobacter fastidiosus, Alistipes finegoldii, Gemella unclassified, Granulicatella adiacens, Parvimonas micra, and Clostridium ramosum had the highest AUC of 0.9708 (Figure 3a, Supplementary Table S4).

These genes were then separately clustered into metagenomic linkage groups (MLGs) based on correlated abundance variation among samples. MLGs containing more than 50 genes, 235 MLGs in total, were used for network analysis. There were 64, 91, 62, and 18 MLGs in each comparison, and the Simpson correlation value, more than 0.6, was 51, 136, 97, and 9, respectively. Among all comparison groups, the most complex network was RA versus NRA, and the simplest was NRB versus NRA.

Based on KEGG orthology, PCA revealed striking differences in microbial functions. A set of 31 (n\u2009=\u200931) KEGG modules were differentially enriched in different groups in the cross-comparisons (adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Figure 5, Supplementary Table S6). With regard to FOLFOX treatment, the degree of functional alteration was similar to the microbiotal composition and MLGs, and the number of different modules was greatest in the RB and RA comparison. During this process, the modules involving essential amino acid and polyamine biosynthesis increased, and modules of some nonessential amino acids and fucose decreased; only the pyruvate fermentation function was increased in NRB. In previous studies, metabolic functional alterations in CRC patient fecal samples included iron, phosphate, and amino acid transport, short-chain acid biosynthesis, and methanogenesis.29\u201331 However, in our study, these microbiota pathways did not change during the NC treatment. Moreover, the result was unexpected when comparing the different modules between the responder and nonresponder groups before and after treatment. There were 21 (n\u2009=\u200921) differential modules when RB was compared with NRB, but only 4 (n\u2009=\u20094) when RA was compared with NRA. When comparing the microbial composition and MLGs, the range of divergence was consistent. Nonetheless, the functional analytical results were conflicting. Before NC treatment, the modules involving aromatic amino acid and deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis were enriched in NRB, whereas tetrahydrofolate, ornithine, and ubiquinol biosynthesis and degradation pathways, which might produce short-chain fatty acids, were enriched in RB. After NC treatment, only four (n\u2009=\u20094) modules displayed differences, and these involved in petroselinate biosynthesis, glycolysis, and ester metabolism. Considering the contribution rate of the microbes (Supplementary Table S7), although there were fewer different microbes between RB and NRB, they are polyfunctional during metabolism; in contrast, microbes that displayed abundance differences between RA and NRA have a similar metabolic function.",

In almost all studies, stool samples were collected at the end of the treatment when the outcomes were known. According to these outcomes, the patients were separated into responder and nonresponder groups.36\u201338 However, in this approach, the gut microbial composition at the beginning of therapy remained unknown. Many changes, especially in the immune system and gut microbiota, occur during the use of antineoplastics because of the effects of these drugs within the body.9,32\u201334 To address these limitations, we assembled a cohort of 37 Chinese low-set rectal cancer patients among patients at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing, China, and carried out genomic sequencing technology.

Previous studies rarely report on the relationship between M. rupellensis or C. fastidiosus and CRC. In our work, these microbes were scarce in the responder group. Conversely, several studies supported the notion that P. micra has a close association with CRC,35,48\u201350 and is involved in tumor growth.51 Moreover, the high prevalence of P. micra in NRA suggests that this species might be an important element affecting NC results. This hypothesis should be verified in the future.",

V. atypica is a gastrointestinal bacterium with a high detection rate in dysbacteriosis and samples from patients with celiac diseases.60 It also has a high detection rate in human oral, gastric juice and gastric mucosa samples.61 Moreover, V. atypica can multiply on oral cancer lesion surfaces and constitutes the oral mucosal core bacteriome of oral cell carcinoma.62,63 This suggests that V. atypica has a strong association with intestinal mucosa or tissue lesions, which might worsen the outcomes of tumor treatment. A. muciniphila is an intestinal mucin-degrading bacterium (phylum Verrucomicrobia) that is widespread in humans and animals.64 Recent studies have shown its beneficial roles in re-establishing gut barrier function, maintaining gut microbial balance, reducing obesity, and relieving metabolic disturbance.65\u201367 This bacterium may also enhance the effects of antiprogrammed cell death protein/ligand 1 (anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1) during treatment for epithelial tumors.38 Nonetheless, some studies have reported that this bacterium has a higher abundance in mucosal samples from CRC patients than from healthy controls.68,69 In animal studies, A. muciniphila colonization was found to exacerbate intestinal inflammation, which is induced by Salmonella typhimurium, or increase the tumor burden in Apc gene-mutation mouse models.64,70 This suggests that A. muciniphila may have a dual effect on host health that is dependent on the host and environmental conditions. In our study, intestinal mucosa lesions were worse in the nonresponder group after treatment, and the level of disturbance in the gut was more severe. This condition might accelerate the growth of A. muciniphila.",

Although further investigation is needed to verify these findings, the results will inspirit the development of a novel noninvasive diagnostic method for patients before chemotherapy and help them to avoid unnecessary treatment.",

Similar outcomes were observed in the MLG analysis. As in previous studies,71\u201373 we built a co-occurrence network to investigate the concordance of microbes between each comparison group, and distinguishing the co-occurrence networks according to their components and topographies was very successful. The MLG assembly method was different from taxonomic annotation, but the most notable differential bacteria were also significantly different in the relative abundance analysis. According to these results, consistency of gut microbiotal variation occurred not only across the FOLFOX but also between different outcomes in bacterial relative abundance and in their interactive relationship. At the end of our study, we performed functional alteration analysis according to the microbiotal pathways, with unexpected results. When checked for their contribution, some of the bacteria were found to be involved in more than one pathway, which was always a significantly different species in the comparison group. Perhaps in future research, these species will help in our understanding of the ways in which drugs modulate the gut microbiome.",

In our cohort, 62 samples were clustered into two distinct enterotypes,75 with Bacteroides and Prevotella as dominate bacteria (Figure S2, Supplementary Table S7). After FOLFOX treatment, eight of the paired samples\u2019 enterotypes shifted, including five responders and three nonresponders. Notably, in the responder group, the change occurred consistently from enterotype II to enterotype I. Moreover, according to clinical records, three patients showed significant treatment efficacy, as their tumors had almost disappeared and their carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were almost normal at 5\u201310\u2009ng/ml after the entire course of treatment (Supplementary Table S1). Nevertheless, it was difficult to identify the underlying principle with regard to these three nonresponder group samples, with some changes from enterotype I to enterotype II and some in the other direction. Although this result is not very convincing, it suggests a relationship between enterotype and NC efficacy as well as the significance of gut microbes in the course of chemical therapy (Figure S3).",

Therefore, it is very difficult to build a large cohort to obtain more information on the association between the gut microbiota and agent efficacy or to construct a model to predict treatment results. Although our cohort size was limited, we were able to demonstrate dynamic trends in the gut microbiota during the therapeutic process.
