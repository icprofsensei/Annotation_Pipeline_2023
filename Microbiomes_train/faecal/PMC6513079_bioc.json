                    "text": "Traditional zoonotic disease research focuses on detection of recognized pathogens and may miss opportunities to understand broader microbial transmission dynamics between humans, animals, and the environment. We studied human-macaque microbiome overlap in Kosum Phisai District, Maha Sarakham Province, Thailand, where a growing population of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Kosumpee Forest Park interact with humans from an adjacent village. We surveyed workers in or near the park with elevated exposure to macaques to characterize tasks resulting in exposure to macaque feces in addition to dietary and lifestyle factors that influence gut microbiome composition. Fecal samples were collected from 12 exposed workers and 6 controls without macaque exposure, as well as 8 macaques from Kosumpee Forest Park and 4 from an isolated forest patch with minimal human contact. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from fecal sample extracted DNA was amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq to characterize the microbial community. A permuted betadisper test on the weighted UniFrac distances revealed significant differences in the dispersion patterns of gut microbiota from exposed and control macaques (p = 0.03). The high variance in gut microbiota composition of macaques in contact with humans has potential implications for gut microbiome stability and susceptibility to disease, described by the Anna Karenina principle (AKP). Human samples had homogenous variance in beta diversity but different spatial medians between groups (p = 0.02), indicating a shift in microbial composition that may be explained by fundamental lifestyle differences between the groups unrelated to exposure status. SourceTracker was used to estimate the percent of gut taxa in exposed humans that was contributed by macaques. While one worker showed evidence of elevated contribution, the overall trend was not significant. Task observations among workers revealed opportunities to employ protective measures or training to reduce exposure to occupational hazards. These results suggest the potential for hygiene measures to mitigate negative aspects of contact between humans and macaques in order to optimize the health of both populations.",

Supplemental feeding for religious reasons or tourism contributes to a growing macaque population unconstrained by natural food resources. Amidst these changes, the high level of human-macaque conflict has led researchers to call for improved management plans and conservation strategies [1, 2]. The reasons for concern are two-fold: 1) human-macaque conflict\u2014such as crop-raiding\u2014can disrupt or damage livelihoods, resulting in negative perception of macaques and impairing conservation efforts and 2) the increased level of contact can provide opportunities for transmission of zoonotic diseases into either macaque or human populations.",

                    "text": "Due to their genetic similarity, humans and macaques are susceptible to many of the same infectious diseases including tuberculosis and hepatitis [3]. Parasitic infections from soil-transmitted helminths capable of infecting humans and macaques, such as Strongyloides fuelleborni and S. stercoralis have also been documented in this region [4, 5]. These pathogens may (e.g. Ebola virus) or may not (e.g. Herpes B virus) cause overt disease in macaques, however cross-species pathogen transmission from wildlife reservoirs to human hosts is a recognized factor in the emergence of novel diseases [6]. These spillover events can readily occur where natural and urban spaces meet. An example of such an interface is the Kosumpee Forest Park (KFP), a small fragmented forest in northeastern Thailand that is home to over 700 long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and lies adjacent to the Kosum Phisai community of 4,235 persons [7, 8]. Unlike other popular tourist sites in Southeast Asia, macaques in KFP rarely climb onto people and feeding by the people often involves simply throwing food on the ground [9]. However, workers in and around the park regularly feed macaques and sweep macaque excrement from public spaces, elevating their risk of zoonotic disease transmission relative to other members of the Kosum Phisai community. While these workers represent a control point for broader spread of zoonoses, little is known about their knowledge, attitudes, and practices surrounding macaque exposure [10]. Based on task observations, it may be possible to identify intervention strategies to reduce exposure to macaque biological material. Such strategies could include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), training in basic hand hygiene, or other measures to mitigate the risk of disease transmission. These measures would also promote responsible wildlife conservation by protecting macaques from pathogens that the workers could transmit through reverse zoonotic transmission.",

Additionally, previous surveys among this worker population indicated that scratches or bites are infrequent, and ingestion of aerosolized fecal matter may be a more common route of exposure to zoonoses. Therefore, in this setting, we chose to analyze the microbial communities of fecal samples in humans and macaques with close contact. Advantages of analyzing the fecal microbiota include the fact that, compared to the skin microbiota, it is better characterized in literature, more temporally stable, and yield higher read counts [11]. Recent studies have demonstrated that the community composition of human microbiota is influenced by our environment and the animals sharing that environment. The degree of contribution from these sources can be quantified using Bayesian approaches like SourceTracker [12, 13]. We performed a pilot study of fecal microbiota of workers and macaques in a shared environment to test the hypothesis that workers exposed to macaques will exhibit microbiota profiles that contain a greater percentage of microbes found in macaque feces compared to unexposed individuals. The goals of this study were to provide a baseline assessment of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission between macaques and workers and guide prevention recommendations.",

Alpha diversity metrics (observed OTUs, Shannon\u2019s diversity index, Faith\u2019s Phylogenetic Diversity, and Pielou\u2019s Evenness) were calculated in QIIME2. In order to attain valid comparisons of abundance and diversity across samples, we normalized to the lowest sample depth of 12,466 reads per sample [18]. Sequences were assigned taxonomy using the SILVA 132 reference database [19]. Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes (ANCOM) was performed in QIIME2 between species and exposure groups with significantly different abundance values identified based on the W-statistic [20]. Principal Coordinate of Analysis (PCoA) plots and taxa bar plots were generated using the phyloseq package (version 1.22.3) in R [21]. PCoA plots were generated to visualize clustering patterns based on weighted UniFrac distance measures, which describes the degree of similarity between sample compositions by measuring the fraction of unique branch length from the phylogenetic tree of sample features and weights the distance by the relative abundance of that taxa within a sample. Profile clustering patterns from weighted UniFrac distance measures were analysed using adonis and betadisper tests from the vegan package (version 2.5.1) [22]. All tests were performed using 999 permutations based on the spatial median. To further characterize microbial sharing, SourceTracker [23] was applied to feature tables with macaques as source and humans as the sink under the default settings at a rarefaction depth of 1000 with 100 burn-ins and 10 re-starts.",

In an assessment of zoonotic disease knowledge, one-third of workers thought a diseased animal could transmit that agent to a human. Only one worker thought a human could make an animal sick and remarked that this would be with a high degree of contact. Workers typically only have direct physical contact with carcasses, but occasionally trap live macaques to move them from private properties to the forest park or when helping researchers. In one instance, a janitor had to remove a macaque from a classroom using a stick and grabbing it by hand.

However, the relative importance of environment or diet was not characterized in that study. It is not clear to what degree the diet of macaques and humans overlap in our study setting. In addition to bananas, local residents and tourists bring a variety of foods to the macaques. During observations conducted between Sept-Dec 2016 [7] much of the provisioning consisted of fruits and vegetables, but also included a variety of other foods not typically found in a wild macaque diet, e.g., breads, cookies, chips, etc [26]. All five macaque groups were observed to consume these provisioned foods although some macaques (particularly from the Hare Lip group) also routinely foraged in trash.

This finding may be due to a number of other exposure factors that warrant further investigation to determine the consequences of this location effect, including differences in age, SES, smoking status, delivery mode, and history of infectious diseases. Early life factors are believed to play an important role in shaping the adult microbiome, and there were differences in delivery method and infant diet between exposed and control groups. While there is a considerable difference in age, all subjects were adults, so this factor alone is not expected to greatly influence results as gut microbiota, which tends to be well-established in healthy adults. Healthy adults\u2019 gut microbiomes are usually less sensitive to perturbations than infants, whose microbiota are developing and have not reached a stable state and elderly (>75 years old), who tend to have lower total bacterial levels [27]. However, age may be correlated with other factors (e.g., greater likelihood of an infectious disease history among older individuals), which could shift their microbial composition. We also emphasize the need to exercise caution when excluding participants based on antibiotics use. Some respondents listed paracetamol or anthelminthic medication when asked about antibiotic use, or indicated they are unsure whether a drug they took was an antibiotic. Future studies should ask participants about antibiotic use by referencing specific drugs based on locally used names and example pills or obtain packaging from the medications used, if possible. A sub-analysis excluding participants who reported antibiotic use did not alter the general conclusions of this study.",

Dispersion essentially reflects variation of microbiota composition, that is the taxa present and their abundance differs from sample to sample among exposed macaques, whereas the control macaques are composed of similar taxa at a similar abundance, and therefore cluster tightly together, with minimal dispersion. This significant dispersion pattern on exposed macaques is suggestive of the \u201cAnna Karenina principle,\u201d a signature of dysbiosis characterized by increased variation in profiles of individuals in a disease state [28]. This dysbiosis may be due to environmental stressors or diseases that perturb a stable state in an unpredictable manner. We cannot definitively determine whether AKP effects are occurring without longitudinal sampling, however the initial findings are suggestive of these effects. In the KFP population, this dysbiosis could be a result of increased stress and competition among macaques, an increased disease burden, or may be attributable to their atypical diet. When asked if they noticed any changes in macaque behavior, workers reported that the macaques drank more Coca-Cola and ate more chicken than they used to. While most of the provisioned food appears to be fruits and vegetables, according to author RCK, who has observed this population extensively, the more extreme dietary changes like foraging in trash, might explain the high variation in composition among macaques at KFP. The population density of the macaques in KFP during the study period also was approximately 3,670 individuals/km2 which is considerably higher than found in more natural settings [7]. This likely results in elevated stress and aggression among macaques, which may ultimately facilitate pathogen spread. Since their microbiota appear to be in a dysbiotic state relative to macaques with low levels of human contact, a condition that may predispose them to gut-related diseases, they might be expected to present a greater health threat to humans than wild macaques with typical gut flora [29, 30].",

While evenness based on Shannon index, Pielou evenness, and Simpson evenness was marginally lower among exposed macaques, this difference was not statistically significant. It is important to note that our control macaques were primarily juveniles (Table 4), which are expected to exhibit a less diverse, but more variable microbiome than adults [31]. However in our study, we find that the control macaque microbiota were not highly variable, as evidenced by tight-clustering or small inter-individual differences in Fig 4. Therefore we do not have reason to suspect that the difference in age would alter our conclusions regarding the potential AKP effects. Nonetheless, our small sample size limited power and increased the risk of beta error, in which a study may fail to reject the null hypothesis due to insufficient power. The small sample size and the disparate ages of control and exposed macaques are limitations that should be addressed in any future studies. By further characterizing changes in susceptibility to pathogens related to gut dysbiosis, we can improve understanding of the consequences of human activities such as diet supplementation or habitat encroachment on wild macaque populations.",

The cross-sectional study design employed is practical as a baseline assessment that could be repeated in the future for continued, longitudinal surveillance of high-risk worker populations and matched controls. It may also be practical to search for macaque-specific microbes as a marker of exposure among humans. The taxa noted in Table 5 as differentially abundant in macaques may be promising candidates for such a marker. Another approach might be to identify a strain that has moved from macaques to humans (or vice versa) and characterize SNPs or metabolic adaptations seen in isolates from each group.

Even if there were no microbial hazards from this exposure, the dust particles or endotoxin from Gram negative bacteria can cause irritation to the lungs.

A traditional approach concerning only the human health impacts of macaque exposure may not have yielded an overtly apparent risk. Our finding of dysbiosis in the gut flora of macaques with close human contact may indicate increased susceptibility to pathogens. While further investigation is needed to determine the implications of this finding, a microbiome-based approach considering human and animal health in parallel may provide a more complete picture of health in an ecosystem.",

Characterizing shifts in gut microbial communities allows for improved understanding of whether health changes are occurring due to increased human-macaque contact in a shared environment. Based on our analysis, workers\u2019 gut microbiota may under certain circumstances be influenced by their exposure to macaques, but this would need to be confirmed in larger studies. The dispersion effects seen in macaques of Kosumpee Forest Park suggest that their altered diet and/or interaction with an urban environment may contribute to gut dysbiosis with unknown health consequences. Given the risk of transmission or respiratory irritation from ingesting or inhaling fecal microbes, exposed individuals and their employers should consider greater use of basic PPE and infection prevention methods, particularly proper hand hygiene. Targeted health protection and disease awareness promotion among forest park workers could limit opportunities for disease spillover from macaque populations into the broader community.",
