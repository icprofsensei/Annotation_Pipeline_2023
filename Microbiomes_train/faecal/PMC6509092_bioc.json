During the intervention the participants were given metformin up to 1\u00a0g twice daily. Participants were examined five times in the fasting state with blood sampling and recording of gastrointestinal symptoms. Examinations took place at Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark before and after the pre-intervention period, halfway through and immediately after the end of intervention and after the wash-out period. Faecal samples were collected at nine evenly distributed time points, and bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in order to evaluate gut microbiota composition.

                    "text": "For decades, the biguanide, metformin, has been the first-line oral glucose-lowering drug of choice when treating type 2 diabetes. The antihyperglycaemic effects of metformin include suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle tissue mediated by activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [1\u20133]. Some studies also suggest the involvement of non-AMPK-mediated suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis [4, 5]. However, evidence suggests that the gastrointestinal tract and the microorganisms that reside within it are partly involved in mediating both beneficial and adverse effects of metformin. Intraluminal metformin concentration in the gastrointestinal tract is up to 300 times higher than in plasma [6, 7], and metformin treatment decreases intestinal glucose absorption [8]. Furthermore, AMPK activation in duodenal epithelium lowers the plasma glucose concentration in rats [9]. Individuals with type 2 diabetes have an altered composition of the gut microbiota [10\u201314], and part of the aberration of the microbiota is linked to metformin treatment [14\u201318]. The gut microbiota is involved in intestinal bile acid metabolism and short-chain fatty acid production, which could explain some of the glucose-lowering effect of metformin, through effects on incretin secretion, hepatic glucose homeostasis and beta cell function [19, 20]. In support of this, data from 22 patients with type 2 diabetes, treated with metformin for 3\u00a0days, showed a Bacteroides fragilis-linked increase in the intestinal concentration of glycoursodeoxycholic bile acid, which in rodent studies has been associated with improvement of hyperglycaemia [15]. Furthermore, the faecal concentration of the short-chain fatty acid propionate was increased in 15 metformin users compared with nine non-users [21]. Similarly, during a 4\u00a0month intervention, faecal butyrate and propionate concentrations were increased significantly in men treated with metformin compared with placebo [18], demonstrating an effect of metformin on fermentative metabolites involved in regulating human metabolism. A hyperglycaemia-independent effect of metformin on the induced perturbation of the gut microbiota has recently been shown after 1\u00a0week of metformin intake in 18 healthy individuals [16], and elucidation hereon could further our understanding of the link between type 2 diabetes and the gut microbiota.",

The abundance of five bacterial genera was significantly decreased and the abundance of six was significantly increased during the metformin intervention at a false discovery rate of 10%, at least once during the intervention period (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2,2, ESM Fig. 1 and ESM Table 1). All returned to baseline levels after treatment cessation. Of the genera decreasing in abundance, Intestinibacter, Clostridium (Clostridium sensu stricto 1) and Terrisporobacter decreased immediately after treatment initiation and remained low throughout the intervention period. The abundance of Senegalimassilia decreased immediately after treatment initiation but reverted to baseline at subsequent time points. The abundance of an unclassified Lachnospiraceae (UCG-010) genus was unaffected during the first 10\u00a0days (F4) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1a)1a) of metformin treatment, decreased 3\u00a0weeks (F5) into the intervention after the dose was increased to 1500\u00a0mg daily and then subsequently reverted to baseline levels. Among the bacterial genera that increased in abundance, Escherichia/Shigella increased immediately after treatment initiation (F4) and remained significantly increased throughout the intervention period. Likewise, Bilophila increased throughout the intervention, but this increase was not evident until week 3 (F5) in the intervention. The increase in the abundance of Lachnoclostridium was nominally significant 3\u00a0weeks (F5) into the intervention period and this increase became significant compared with baseline at 4.5\u00a0weeks (F6), after which time this genus began to revert to baseline levels (remaining increased compared with baseline at nominal significance). Caproiciproducens showed a nominally significant increase 4.5\u00a0weeks after treatment initiation (F6) and became significantly increased after 6\u00a0weeks of metformin treatment (F7). Tyzzerella (Tyzzerella_3) was increased immediately after treatment but reverted to baseline at the subsequent time points. A Prevotella genus (Prevotella_6) increased in abundance with nominal significance after 3\u00a0weeks and significantly at 4.5\u00a0weeks of treatment (F6) but reverted to baseline before treatment cessation.",

Overall, we saw an increase in gastrointestinal discomfort, represented by an increase in the severity of abdominal pain (404% [95% CI 91, 1225]; p\u2009=\u20090.0011), nausea (392% [95% CI 78, 1258]; p\u2009=\u20090.002), bloating (283% [95% CI 31, 1007]; p\u2009=\u20090.01) and diarrhoea (261% [95% CI 23, 959]; p\u2009=\u20090.02) and an increase in overall abdominal discomfort (67% [95% CI 216, 1800]; p\u2009<\u20090.001) at the first visit (3\u00a0weeks) after initiation of the intervention. All side effects diminished towards the end of the intervention period. There was, however, substantial inter-individual variation in gastrointestinal adverse effects, with some individuals developing severe discomfort and others experiencing only mild side effects or none at all. We dichotomised the study group based on the change in overall abdominal discomfort from baseline to the first visit during the intervention: ten participants who developed abdominal side effects and 13 who did not (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3a).3a). When building an RF classifier on baseline abundances of 124 unselected bacterial genera, we were able to moderately discriminate between participants who developed gastrointestinal side effects and those who did not, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.70 (95% CI 0.79, 0.60). Repeated feature selection identified 12 bacterial genera having discriminative importance (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3b),3b), with Sutterella, Allisonella, Akkermansia, Bacteroides and Paraprevotella as the main discriminant genera. By building an RF classifier based on the baseline abundances of these 12 genera, we were able to distinguish participants who developed gastrointestinal side effects from those who did not, with a ROC AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.94, 0.87) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3c).3c). No bacterial genera or ASVs changed differently in the two groups during the metformin treatment.",

A double-blinded randomised study [18] of 40 treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes given placebo or metformin for 4\u00a0months showed an increase in abundance of Escherichia spp. and Bilophila wadsworthia along with a decrease in Intestinibacter spp. and Clostridium spp. Similarly, using shotgun sequencing-based metagenomic analyses we previously reported an increase of Escherichia spp. and a reduced abundance of Intestinibacter spp. in metformin-treated type 2 diabetes patients [14]. In a recent study of 18 healthy participants given 850\u00a0mg metformin twice daily for 1\u00a0week an increase of Escherichia/Shigella was also reported [16]. Our analyses of healthy normoglycaemic individuals similarly showed a reduced abundance of Intestinibacter spp. and Clostridium spp., as well as an increased abundance of the genus Escherichia/Shigella and B. wadsworthia in response to metformin treatment. Collectively, the findings substantiate that the effect of metformin is independent of the dysbiosis induced by diabetes. Additionally, we identified seven genera changing in abundance during the metformin intervention, further demonstrating that metformin treatment has a profound impact on the gut microbiota.",

In a recent study of 18 healthy young men exposed to metformin for 1\u00a0week, an association between increased abundance of Escherichia/Shigella spp. prior to the intervention and later development of gastrointestinal side effects was reported [16]. However, no formal statistical evidence was provided to substantiate this finding. In the present study, we aimed to identify genera associated with development of gastrointestinal adverse effects. The composition of 12 bacterial genera of the pre-intervention gut microbiota was identified as a possible predictor of self-reported gastrointestinal adverse effects during metformin treatment. Among these, the highly abundant genera Sutterella, Akkermansia and Allisonella had the greatest predictive value [28]. Interestingly, Sutterella spp. have been associated with infections of the gastrointestinal tract, inflammatory bowel disease [29] and autism [30].",

In studies in animals [32] and humans [17, 33], metformin treatment was associated with increased abundance of A. muciniphila and the bacterium has been linked to improved glycaemic control [34]. We did not identify A. muciniphila among the metformin-responsive bacteria in the present study, perhaps because metformin treatment in individuals with diabetes resets a perturbation in A. muciniphila abundance caused by the disease; an imbalance that is not present in healthy individuals.",

                    "text": "The genus Allisonella, and the only known species A. histaminiformans, produces histamine from histidine [35]. Histamine is a potent vasoactive agent causing vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability, as well as a potent inducer of mucus secretion. Histamine is capable of inducing stomach ache, cramps, meteorism and diarrhoea, which are all known gastrointestinal side effects of metformin treatment [36]. Interestingly, in vitro studies have shown that metformin inhibits degradation of histamine by diamine oxidase at concentrations achieved in the intestine after therapeutic doses [37]. Whether metformin affects histamine production by the gut microbiota, how that may interact with effects on host capacity for histamine degradation to induce gastrointestinal intolerance and how the intolerance might be prevented or treated require testing in future studies. Yet, our findings of gastrointestinal side effects associated with pre-treatment bacterial composition must be interpreted with caution as our dataset is limited by its size and lack of validation in an independent cohort. Furthermore, there is a risk of overestimation due to small sample size and the large number of features in the model. Despite this major limitation, our data generate a hypothesis for future studies aiming to limit gastrointestinal side effects in patients introduced to metformin by modulating intestinal bacterial composition before medication is given.",

Longitudinal sampling during and after the intervention also demonstrates the dynamics of the gut microbiota in response to the initiation and cessation of treatment. The design is, however, underpowered to test inter-individual effects, which is presumably why we were unable to identify bacterial genera or ASVs responding differently to the metformin intervention in participants who developed or did not develop gastrointestinal side effects. Much larger sample sizes are required to reliably identify interventional effects in between-group analyses [38]. Other limitations include the lack of blinding and inclusion of a placebo control group. Technologically, the study was limited by usage of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing approach, which is well suited for detecting signals at the genus level but provides limited insight at the species level.",
