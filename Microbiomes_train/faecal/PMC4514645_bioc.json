The 8.1 ancestral haplotype (AH8.1) include the classical HLA alleles HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-DRB1*03:01, and has been associated with a large number of autoimmune diseases, but the underlying mechanisms for this association are largely unknown. Given the recently established links between the gut microbiota and inflammatory diseases, we hypothesized that the AH8.1 influences the host gut microbial community composition. To study this further, healthy individuals were selected from the Norwegian Bone Marrow Donor Registry and categorized as either I. AH8.1 homozygote (n=34), II. AH8.1 heterozygote (n=38), III. Non AH8.1 heterozygote or IV. HLA-DRB1 homozygote but non AH8.1 (n=15). Bacterial DNA from stool samples were subjected to sequencing of the V3\u2013V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene on the 454 Life Sciences platform and data analyzed using Mothur and QIIME. The results showed that the abundances of different taxa were highly variable within all pre-defined AH8.1 genotype groups. Using univariate non-parametric statistics, there were no differences regarding alpha or beta diversity between AH8.1 carriers (categories I and II) and non-carriers (categories III and IV), however four different taxa (Prevotellaceae, Clostridium XVIII, Coprococcus, Enterorhabdus) had nominally significant lower abundances in AH8.1 carriers than non-carriers. After including possible confounders in a multivariate linear regression, only the two latter genera remained significantly associated. In conclusion, the overall contribution of the AH8.1 haplotype to the variation in gut microbiota profile of stool in the present study was small.",

The AH8.1 is strongly associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases including celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, primary sclerosing cholangitis and systemic lupus erythematosus [6]. This haplotype contains several genetic variants with biological implications [7], including the classical HLA alleles influencing antigen presentation and genetic variants influencing the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and complement factors. While for some diseases the AH8.1 association may be linked most strongly to single disease-related alleles (e.g.HLA-DQ2 involving in celiac disease), multiple independent associations are observed in several diseases [8,9] and epistatic effects between several risk variants within this haplotype are likely conferring a general risk for the development of autoimmune disease [6].",

Environmental influences like diet are important determinants of the gut microbial composition [13]. However, there is firm evidence from twin studies that also the effects of host genetic factors are considerable [14,15]. Strong evidence implicating single genes in the shaping of the gut microbiota have been found in mouse models with genetically altered levels of e.g. defensins, IgA and the bacterial sensing protein NOD2 [16\u201319], the latter also seen in humans [19]. Importantly, similar gene-microbiota interactions have also been associated with genetic variants commonly observed in the healthy population, e.g. in the FUT2 gene, responsible for the presence of blood antigens on epithelial surfaces [20]. There is also evidence from both mice and humans suggesting an impact of classical HLA alleles on the gut microbiota composition [21\u201323]. Development of AH8.1 associated diseases like type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease have also been linked to alterations in the gut microbiota [10,24,25]. Given the unexplained associations between the AH8.1 and autoimmune diseases, we hypothesized that the sum of multiple genetic variants on the AH8.1 haplotype with biological implications causes alterations in the gut microbiota that increase disease risk and are detectable in the normal population.",

After denoising using the PyroNoise algorithm [31], sequences with an ambiguous base call, a homopolymer >8 nucleotides, or length <200 or >1000 nucleotides were removed. After removing the barcode and primers portions from reads, sequences were then aligned using a NAST-based sequence aligner to a custom reference based on the SILVA alignment (v102). Sequences which did not align to the anticipated region of the reference alignment were removed. The rest were pre-clustered by merging sequence counts that were no more than 2 nucleotides different from a more abundant sequence. Chimeric sequences identified using UCHIME algorithm were then removed [32]. Sequences were classified using a Bayesian classifier with RDP database (v7). Definition of a sequence\u2019s taxonomy was determined using a pseudobootstrap threshold of 80%. Sequences that classified as \"Cyanobacteria_Chloroplast\", \"Mitochondria\", or \"unknown\" (i.e., sequences that could not be classified at the kingdom level) were removed. The remaining sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 3% distance cutoff using the average neighbor-clustering algorithm. All OTUs were broadly categorized as either gram positive or gram negative according to known phylum characteristics.",

However, a related hypothesis has been explored in a series of studies from a Spanish group on gut microbiota and genetic risk factors for celiac disease [23,39,40]. In their first study [23], there was a higher prevalence of gram negative bacteria and more Prevotella in children carrying HLA-DQ2 (the strongest risk factor for celiac disease). In contrast, in the present study there was a reduced prevalence of the Prevotellaceae family, in which Prevotella is a member, and no difference related to gram staining properties. There are however, major differences between these studies, including the large age difference and the use of DNA probes for profiling instead of sequencing. In addition, while the major genetic determinant in celiac disease, HLA-DQ2, is present on the AH8.1 haplotype, it can also be present on other haplotypes (e.g. HLA-B*18-DRB1*03) or be encoded in trans, meaning that the results are not directly transferable. In a later, sequencing-based study from the group targeting the V5-V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene [40], a higher prevalence of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria was observed in HLA-DQ2 carriers. This was also not observed in our study. The contrast between these studies highlight the need for standardization of methods and replication of findings prior to establishing associations in studies of the gut microbiota [41].",

Several hypotheses may explain this, including the possibility that the AH8.1 primarily acts on the host physiology and not the gut microbial content. One possibility is that the presence of AH8.1 alone is not sufficient to induce an observable effect. Individuals affected by disease and suffering from a relatively impaired immune system may show more sensitive interaction with gut microbes [10\u201312], suggesting that patients affected by an AH8.1 associated disease should be included in later studies. It is also possible that AH8.1 influences the microbiota early in life and that this genetic effect has been replaced by environmental influences at the age of ~50 years as in the present study. There is therefore a strong rationale for similar analyses in children [23,39,40]. The accessibility of biological material from a healthy population was the main reason for analyzing microbiota profile of the stool and not intestinal mucosa. A spatial distribution of gut microbiota has been shown by detailed analyzes of the microbiota in the mucosal folds compared with the central lumen [42]. Several immunomodulatory bacteria are known to adhere to the mucosa [43,44]. Future studies in patients need to account for this fact [45].",

                    "text": "Power calculations for microbiota studies are not well developed, except for some specific statistical models [46]. Power calculations are challenging since little is known about the effect sizes to be expected from the variables under study. Genetic risk factors in polygenic diseases detected outside the HLA typically have odds ratios of 1.1\u20131.5 and require thousands of study participants to be detected. In contrast, disease associations in the HLA complex typically have odds ratios of 2.0\u20135.0, suggesting a large influence on the host physiology (and according to our hypothesis; the gut microbiota) potentially detectable also in healthy individuals, highlighting this genetic region as a good starting point in candidate gene-microbiota interaction studies. The many possible confounders in gut microbiota studies, exemplified by the confirmation of an inverse relationship between body-mass index and alpha diversity [47,48], may also reduce the power in multivariate analyses. Importantly, the main limiting factor regarding the size of this study was the access to healthy AH8.1 homozygote individuals volunteering to provide a stool sample, while it is difficult to conclude on the ideal study size based on the present study. Related to this it should also be noted that to maximize the number of participants this study only required homozygozity for the segment HLA-B*08-DRB1*03, which has the strongest disease associations [6], and not the entire classically defined AH8.1 which includes e.g. HLA-A*01. In addition, the grouping of all other HLA haplotypes in one category (which was necessary due to low frequencies of homozygosity for other haplotypes) could potentially hide differences between specific haplotypes with diverse influences on the gut microbiota.",

One example of a possible mechanism is the Clostridium XVIII genus, which had reduced prevalence in the AH8.1 carriers in the univariate analysis. This genus has been shown to induce T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs) in mice [49] and less Clostridium XVIII could be speculated to lead to fewer Tregs and thereby susceptibility to autoimmunity [50]. Recent data from a large twin study provide strong evidence that the gut microbiota profile is in part heritable, and that the heritable components may be associated with a disease-related phenotype (obesity) [14]. On a more general level, the literature therefore provides support for further efforts to delineate which chromosomal regions contribute to the heritable components of the gut microbiota.",
