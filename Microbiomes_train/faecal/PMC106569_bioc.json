PCR amplicons of the V6 to V8 regions of fecal 16S rRNA and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) were analyzed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). TGGE of fecal 16S rDNA amplicons from 16 individuals showed different profiles, with some bands in common. Fecal samples from two individuals were monitored over time and showed remarkably stable profiles over a period of at least 6 months. TGGE profiles derived from 16S rRNA and rDNA amplicons showed similar banding patterns. However, the intensities of bands with similar mobilities differed in some cases, indicating a different contribution to the total active fraction of the prominent fecal bacteria. Most 16S rRNA amplicons in the TGGE pattern of one subject were identified by cloning and sequence analysis. Forty-five of the 78 clones matched 15 bands, and 33 clones did not match any visible band in the TGGE pattern. Nested PCR of amplified 16S rDNA indicated preferential amplification of a sequence corresponding to 12 of the 33 nonmatching clones with similar mobilities in TGGE. The sequences matching 15 bands in the TGGE pattern showed 91.5 to 98.7% homology to sequences derived from different Clostridium clusters. Most of these were related to strains derived from the human intestine. The results indicate that the combination of cloning and TGGE analysis of 16S rDNA amplicons is a reliable approach to monitoring different microbial communities in feces.",

These have largely been studied by plate count analysis of fecal samples, which usually contain 1010 to 1011 CFU per g (9, 13, 29). One of the limitations in using conventional microbiological methods is that only easily cultivable organisms are counted. Bacteria which have obligate interactions with the host or other microorganisms, or which require unknown growth conditions, will not be selected this way. Estimates of culturability of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract vary from 10 to 50% (16, 20, 37). Other limitations of cultivation include the selectivity of the medium used, the stress imposed by cultivation procedures, and the necessity of strictly anoxic conditions. As a consequence, insight into the interaction between the host and the microbial community, and into the influence of environmental factors on microbial composition, is still lacking.",

So far, the rRNA approach has been used only incidentally to study human intestinal microbial ecology, and only specific groups of bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, have been studied (16, 19). In addition, PCR has been used to quantify specific groups of bacteria in human feces (35), and random cloning approaches have been used to analyze the microbial diversity of feces from one individual (37). Although these studies report significant information on specific bacteria and specific individuals, the approaches are time-consuming, expensive, and unsuitable for characterizing complex microbial communities. Methods such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (10) or temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) (28) have been developed to analyze microbial communities rapidly, based on sequence-specific separation of 16S rDNA amplicons (8, 22). The aim of the present study was to use molecular approaches to describe the bacterial diversity in human fecal samples and to investigate to what extent this diversity is affected by the host. We analyzed PCR-amplified V6 to V8 regions of 16S rRNA (23) by TGGE to describe the diversity of the predominant bacteria in fecal samples. Since the ratio of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and rRNA is dependent on cellular activity (33), we compared TGGE patterns derived from 16S rRNA and rDNA amplicons. Finally, to gain insight into the phylogenetic positions of the most prominent bacteria, we prepared a 16S rDNA clone library and sequenced clones corresponding to dominant bands in the TGGE pattern of a single individual.",

Amplicons of the V6 to V8 regions were analyzed by TGGE. Migration distances from different gels were compared by using a marker which consisted of amplified V6 to V8 regions from nine clones with different mobilities. Additionally, a clone library of 16S rDNA amplicons (Escherichia coli positions 8 to 1510) from a fecal sample of one individual was prepared. The mobilities of cloned amplicons were screened by TGGE, and those corresponding to specific bands in the RNA-derived profile were sequenced.  ",

Remarkable differences in individual banding patterns were observed. Differences were found in both the positions of specific bands and the number of bands (up to 38 in the profile of subject profile C). While most prominent bands were found at different positions, some distinct bands were observed in all fecal samples (indicated in Fig. \u200bFig.33 and \u200band4).4).

Twelve of the 33 clones which did not match any band in the pattern showed similar mobilities during TGGE. The sequence showed the highest homology (98.9%) to an unidentified rumen bacterium (GenBank accession no. AF018503) (36a). The next closest relative was Prevotella veroralis (89.9%). Nested amplification of the V6 to V8 regions of the 16S rDNA amplicons showed the appearance of this band in the pattern (data not shown), indicating a preferential amplification of this sequence in the first PCR amplification.

Because eubacterial primers which show very limited efficiency in the amplification of Archaea and Eucarya have been used, the TGGE pattern reflects the predominant bacteria in fecal samples. The differences between intensities of specific bands in the 16S rDNA- and 16S rRNA-derived patterns are most probably due to differences in the activities of different groups of bacteria. The amount of rRNA per cell is dependent on the type of species and the physiological condition of the cell. In addition, differences in the copy number of the rRNA operon per species (2) also play a role in differences in intensity. Some bacteria which have reached high numbers in the intestine could have been inactivated by losing contact with the mucosa or by exposure to oxygen during the collection of the fecal samples.",

Twelve clones with similar mobilities during TGGE did not correspond to any dominant band in the rRNA- and rDNA-derived profiles of individual A. The partial sequence showed the highest homology with an unidentified rumen bacterium and was grouped in the Prevotella cluster. However, this amplicon was found in the DNA-derived pattern after nested amplification of the V6 to V8 regions of amplified 16S rDNA. This result supports the existence of PCR and cloning biases as reported previously (27, 32, 34, 37). Another reason for the difference between the results of cloning and TGGE analysis was described by Felske et al. (7). Analysis of a PCR amplicon by TGGE visualizes only the dominant fraction of the population, while a cloning approach randomly selects 16S rDNA amplicons. As a consequence, hundreds of bacteria which represent a numerically important part of the total community do not form visible bands in the TGGE profiles, although some of them will be selected by cloning.",

Since the individuals were unrelated, were of different ages, and had different dietary preferences, the reasons for this uniqueness are likely to be found in host factors. The conclusions are based on an approach which could be biased by irregular cell lysis and primer specificity, which are general drawbacks of molecular microbial ecology. Even though the quality and reproducibility of the extraction of nucleic acids and their amplification have been investigated, the possibility that some important, hitherto unknown bacteria were missed cannot be excluded. The approach reported here can be useful in studying the effects of certain diets, food components, probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics, as well as the genetic background of the host, on the stability and composition of the dominant microbial community.",
