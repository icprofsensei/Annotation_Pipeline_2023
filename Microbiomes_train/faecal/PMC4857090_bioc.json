Blastocystis is one of the most common single-celled eukaryotes detected in human faecal samples. However, the clinical significance of this widespread colonization remains unclear, and its pathogenic potential is controversial. To address the issue of Blastocystis pathogenicity, we investigated the impact of colonization by this protist on the composition of the human gut microbiota. For that purpose, we conducted a cross-sectional study including 48 Blastocystis-colonized patients and 48 Blastocystis-free subjects and performed an Ion Torrent 16S rDNA gene sequencing to decipher the Blastocystis-associated gut microbiota. Here, we report a higher bacterial diversity in faecal microbiota of Blastocystis colonized patients, a higher abundance of Clostridia as well as a lower abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. Our results contribute to suggesting that Blastocystis colonization is usually associated with a healthy gut microbiota, rather than with gut dysbiosis generally observed in metabolic or infectious inflammatory diseases of the lower gastrointestinal tract.",

Furthermore, diverse enteric pathogens can induce significant perturbations in the microbiota or bloom during dysbiosis23. For example, intestinal dysbiosis was highlighted after acute Toxoplasma gondii gastrointestinal infection in mice24. The presence of gut microbiota is also essential for the pathogenic expression of certain enteric eukaryotes, such as Entamoeba histolytica or Giardia duodenalis25,26,27.

A higher bacterial diversity was found in Blastocystis-colonized patients compared to that identified in Blastocystis-free individuals. Moreover, Blastocystis-colonized patients exhibited a higher abundance of Clostridia at the class level, and a higher abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae at the family level, whereas Enterobacteriaceae were enriched in Blastocystis-free patients.

Blastocystis colonization was less frequent in winter than in summer (RR\u2009=\u20090.59 [0.45\u20130.81] and OR\u2009=\u20090.53 [0.36\u20130.77]) and higher in Lille than in other hospital locations (p-value\u2009<\u20090.01). Blastocystis was also more frequently present in faecal samples of patients having travelled recently (RR\u2009=\u20091.89 [1.36\u20132.62] and OR\u2009=\u20092.22 [1.46\u20133.37]) and presenting other faecal parasites (RR\u2009=\u20092.53 [1.81\u20133.54] and OR\u2009=\u20093.56 [2.11\u20135.99]).

These six variables were then used to compute the ranked Blastocystis colonization risk scores for each patient (see Supplementary Sheet S1). Therefore, the risk scores were used to select the 24 highest score values and the 24 lowest scores in each population of Blastocystis-positive or Blastocystis-free patients, thus determining 4 groups of 24 patients. Groups 1 and 2 were composed of Blastocystis-colonized patients and groups 3 and 4 included Blastocystis-free patients; groups 1 and 3 were linked in terms of low environmental and clinical risk factors, and groups 2 and 4 shared high risk factors (see Supplementary Sheet S2).",

More than 40% of the total variance was explained using the first two principal components. This graphic shows that, on one hand, groups 3 and 4, the two groups constituting the Blastocystis-free cluster, had a homogeneous microbiota pattern that is relatively distinct from, on the other hand, groups 1 and 2 that constitute a homogeneous Blastocystis-positive cluster. The relative abundance of the 5 predominant bacteria orders for these 4 groups of patients was quite similar, ranging from 68.58% to 71.12%, respectively, for groups 4 and 3. Among these 5 orders, only two, Lactobacillales and Clostridiales, could be considered to be statistically differentially abundant between Blastocystis-free and Blastocystis-positive main groups (Fig. 4(b)). Clostridiales, which represented the major abundant order, were significantly more abundant in colonized patients (MWW, p\u2009=\u20090.0133; W, p\u2009=\u20090.014), and Lactobacillales were more profuse in Blastocystis-free individuals (MWW, p\u2009=\u20090.001; W, p\u2009=\u20090.020) (see Supplementary Fig. S1, Fig. 4(b)). These results were confirmed by performing a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test analysis on OTU relative abundances in the faecal microbiota of group 1 vs. 3 or group 2 vs. 4 patients (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (data not shown).",

Moreover, at the class level, Blastocystis-colonized patients exhibited a higher abundance of Clostridia. In colonized patients, Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae families were also more abundant than in Blastocystis-negative patients, whereas Enterobacteriaceae were enriched in these Blastocystis-free patients. Additionally, the genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, known to contain butyrate-producing bacteria, had a significantly higher abundance in Blastocystis-positive patients. Interestingly, butyrate is considered one of the most important metabolites for maintaining colonic health in humans, as it serves as the major energy source of colonic epithelial cells, has anti-inflammatory properties, and regulates gene expression, differentiation and apoptosis in host cells38,39,40. Significant reductions in the abundance of these bacteria have been identified as markers of dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease37,41,42.",

In humans, in a more recent study comparing the composition and diversity of bacterial communities from the faecal microbiota of Malaysian individuals colonized or not by helminths, helminth colonization was associated with greater bacterial species richness45. Interestingly, the ability of gastrointestinal nematodes to modulate intestinal inflammation and improve the pathology of chronic intestinal diseases has even led to the development of helminthic therapy. In a recent paper, Cantacessi et al. suggested that hookworms administered to patients with chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract could exert their therapeutic effect, at least in part, by maintaining microbial diversity and thereby restoring microbial homeostasis in the gut46.",

The aim of our study was not to determine the enterotypes of patients, but it seems interesting to point out that the OTU relative abundance of Ruminococcus and Prevotella were higher in Blastocystis-positive patients than in Blastocystis-negative individuals.",

Nevertheless, this type of isolated study cannot determine if there are causal relationships between the parasite and gut microbiota. This is like the chicken and the egg question: which came first? Is this finding due to a reduced ability of Blastocystis to establish itself in the microbiota of patients with gut dysbiosis, or is Blastocystis playing a role in structuring microbiota communities and actively contributing to intestinal homeostasis? To address this, further longitudinal metagenetic studies in humans are required. Our results also highlight the urgent need for developing an effective and reproducible Blastocystis animal model. Comparison of the microbiota of Blastocystis-free animals before and during the colonization by the protist could continue to advance the frontiers of knowledge in the understanding of the functional impact of Blastocystis on the bacterial microbiota.",

A standardized questionnaire was designed to collect information about each participating subject (sex, age, profession, recent travels and destinations, exposure to pets) as well as clinical data, especially regarding the presence of digestive symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, bloating, constipation and abdominal pain), and diagnosis of IBS or IBD. In addition, the observation of intestinal protozoans, fungi, and helminths by direct-light microscopy of faecal smears was also recorded, as well as digestive diseases of bacterial origin.",

The odds ratio (OR) and relative risks (RR) were calculated to quantify how strongly different Boolean variables (including the sampling season and all variables cited above) were associated with the presence or absence of Blastocystis in the population of 788 individuals. A logistic regression test was also performed for non-Boolean variables like hospital locations. A forward stepwise logistic regression method using AIC (Akaike information criterion) criterion was then used to select the variables and build the optimal model in order to compute a Blastocystis colonization risk score (see Supplementary Sheet S1). The risk scores of each patient were then ranked, a high score being indicative of high Blastocystis colonization susceptibility.",

Alpha-diversity rarefaction curves were produced by plotting these several diversity metrics against the number of sequences considered from a sample.

To explore the differences in overall microbial community composition across the two groups of patients, the taxonomic Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were calculated after additional filtering of the normalized read counts to remove singletons. The QIIME beta_diversity_through_plots Python script also produced a Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) plot in which the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between the samples were used to visualize the differences among groups of samples.
