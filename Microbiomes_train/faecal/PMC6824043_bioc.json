Those who relocate from Latin America to the USA at an early age have reductions in Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios that persist across the life course. Shannon index of alpha diversity in fungi and bacteria is low in those who relocate to the USA in early life. In contrast, those who relocate to the USA during adulthood, over 45\u2009years old, have high bacterial and fungal diversity and high Prevotella to Bacteroides ratios, compared to USA-born and childhood arrivals. Low bacterial diversity is associated in turn with obesity. Contrasting with prior studies, our study of\u00a0the Latino population shows increasing Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio with greater obesity. Taxa within Acidaminococcus, Megasphaera, Ruminococcaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiales, Christensenellaceae, YS2 (Cyanobacteria), and Victivallaceae are significantly associated with both obesity and earlier exposure to the USA, while Oscillospira and Anaerotruncus show paradoxical associations with both obesity and late-life introduction to the USA.",

Follow-up studies of migrants suggest that geographic relocation to the USA often coincides with a decrease in gut microbial diversity and transition in GMB organisms, concurrent with replacement of dietary starches and fiber with animal proteins and fats [4]. Changes in diet alter the GMB makeup by restricting nutrients needed for growth of certain bacteria while enhancing the growth of others. After an altered GMB is established, the new microbial communities in the host gastrointestinal tract can lead to changes in metabolic processes and generation of metabolites [5, 6].",

We quantified alpha diversity using the Shannon index to describe the 16S rRNA gene V4 region bacterial and ITS1 fungal microbiome. We also derived the Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio from 16S data; these taxa frequently appear as important and dominant in other gut microbiome studies [14\u201316], hence the focus here. From analysis of the Bray-Curtis community ordination, we performed principal coordinate analysis (PcoA) using the 16S and ITS1 data. The first 16S principal coordinate (PCoA1) was strongly correlated with the Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio (Spearman\u2019s r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.89), while PCoA2 was correlated strongly with Shannon index (r\u2009=\u20090.77). Correlations with PCoA1 were \u2212\u20090.89 and 0.94 for relative abundance of Prevotella and Bacteroides, respectively.",

In contrast, Prevotella had higher prevalence among Latin American-born individuals, as compared with the mainland US-born Hispanics. Among the most commonly occurring genera, Prevotella also had the highest variability as defined by the interquartile range in both US-born and Latin American-born groups of participants. Within Prevotella, we found that P. copri was the dominant species, comprising 88.7% of Prevotella albeit with a substantial count of unclassified species (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). US-born and Latin American-born individuals had similar abundance rankings of other common bacterial taxa (Fig.\u00a02). In bivariate analyses, some taxa reached nominal statistical significance (P\u2009<\u20090.05) for differences in abundance by birthplace, including Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Enterobacteraceae, and Sutterella.\n\n",

Multivariable adjustment was performed for gender, study center, intake of vegetables excluding potatoes, intake of whole fruit, intake of whole grains, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), body mass index (BMI), diabetes, visits returning to home country, education and income, and medications including use of antibiotics and metformin. Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio was lowest among those born in the US mainland (Fig.\u00a03a). Among those born in Latin America, Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio increased monotonically with increasing relocation age. Analyses of bacterial (16S) Shannon index failed to find a clear \u201cdose response\u201d between timing of exposure to the USA and bacterial diversity. (Fig.\u00a03a). Point estimates suggested that the Latin America-born group who relocated to the USA after 45\u2009years of age had high bacterial alpha diversity, while in contrast, those who relocated from Latin America before 18\u2009years of age had the lowest bacterial alpha diversity. Enigmatically, a high bacterial alpha diversity was also found in the US-born group. Confidence intervals for the groups were largely overlapping, and none of these findings for bacterial alpha diversity met q value criteria of <\u20090.05. Fungal (ITS1) Shannon index was lowest among individuals with early-life US exposure (i.e., born in the mainland USA or relocated prior to age 18\u2009years), and highest among those who relocated to the mainland USA after age 45 (Fig.\u00a03b).\n",

Before conducting analyses within groups stratified by current age, we excluded individuals who had relocated to the USA after age 26 because this group was strongly biased towards having older current ages. The current age and relocation age were uncorrelated after this exclusion was applied (Beta\u2009=\u20090.017, 95% CI \u2212\u20090.029, 0.063) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S3). We then examined the association of relocation age and Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio within each of five groups that were defined based on age at the time of the GMB study (25\u201334\u2009years, 35\u201344\u2009years, 45\u201354\u2009years, 55\u201364\u2009years, and 65\u2009years and older). The association between childhood relocation to the USA and lower Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio was seen across the full range of attained age, up to and including the oldest group aged 65\u2009years and older (Fig.\u00a04). We thus were able to control for the potential confounding influence of current age, showing that the association of relocation age and Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio was independent of current age and indicating that the association between relocation age and Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio was durable across the life course.\n",

However, English language preference was associated with higher Shannon bacterial diversity (versus Spanish language, beta English preference\u2009=\u20090.09 higher 16S Shannon index, 95% confidence interval, 0.01, 0.16); this contradicts the hypothesis that increasing exposure to the USA leads to depletion of the bacterial microbiome. Those consuming primarily \u201cAmerican\u201d foods rather than \u201cHispanic\u201d foods (dietary acculturation) had significantly lower Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio, although this dietary acculturation variable was not associated with alpha diversity.

Latin America-born individuals, especially those who relocated to the US mainland during later adulthood, had the most favorable eating habits, evidenced by a higher Alternative Healthy Eating Index\u00a0- 2010 (AHEI) score, a summary measure of diet quality (Table\u00a02), lower consumption of fats and sodium, and higher consumption of fiber (Table\u00a03). Fiber was further analyzed by food sources (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S2 displays definition of food group-derived variables.) We found no significant variation in bean/legume intake according to US-born or relocation age groups. Instead, fruit and whole grains were the sources of fiber that appeared to differ across the population, favoring the adult age immigrants to the USA who had higher intakes of these foods. More favorable AHEI diet score was associated with higher Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio (beta 1 AHEI unit\u2009=\u20090.0063, 95% confidence interval 0.0027, 0.0100, P value\u2009=\u20090.0062) (Table\u00a04). AHEI was not associated with alpha diversity for 16S (beta\u2009=\u2009\u2212.0004, 95% confidence interval \u2212\u2009.0048, 0.0040, P value\u2009=\u20090.34) or for ITS1 (beta\u2009=\u20090.006, 95% confidence interval 0.0010, 0.0099, P value\u2009=\u20090.40). Four specific foods that were associated with higher Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio were higher whole grains, higher vegetables, lower red meat, and lower trans fats (Table\u00a05). Higher grain intake was associated with lower bacterial (16S) alpha diversity, while higher vegetable intake was associated with higher fungal (ITS1) alpha diversity (Table\u00a05).\n\n\n",

Prior data suggest that gut microbiomes of Hispanic/Latino adults appear as a distinct cluster when analyzed alongside a collection of USA and worldwide populations [7, 23]. The results presented here describe characteristics of GMB variation and their determinants within the US Hispanic population. GMB heterogeneity among the US Latino study population was significantly accounted for by differences between the \u201cfirst-generation\u201d (Latin America-born) and \u201csecond-generation\u201d (mainland US-born) groups. Each group had its own distinct microbiome pattern which was dependent both upon place of birth and timing of geographic relocation to the mainland USA (e.g., \u201crelocation age\u201d). People who relocated to the mainland USA from Latin America, particularly those who did so relatively late in life, were characterized by a relatively high ratio of Prevotella to Bacteroides. This accounts for the fact that migration- and acculturation-related variables were among the leading explanatory variables in Bray-Curtis distance clustering analyses of 16S sequence data when ranked by explained variation (Fig.\u00a02, R2). There was also evidence for increased GMB diversity of both bacterial and fungal components in arrivals from Latin America, particularly among those who arrived in the USA during middle to late adulthood as opposed to early life. Our data are consistent with the prevailing tendency for people in lower-income countries to have different gut microbial characteristics [24] including a Prevotella-dominant microbiome [4], when compared with the US population. In contrast to the Latin America-born, the US-born Latino population had low Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio and low fungal alpha diversity.",

A novel contribution of our study was our observation that the strength of sociodemographic, region of birth, and migration-related influences rivaled that of known contributors to GMB diversity. The findings are supportive of a strong and lasting influence of early-life environment on the gut microbiome. Our cohort of largely immigrant US Latinos captured the \u201c1.5 generation,\u201d a subset of the first generation which refers to those who relocated to the USA during childhood and adolescence. Individuals in this group have lived their adult life in the US environment, but during childhood development, their gut microbiomes would have been established under the influence of the Latin American environment and lifestyle. The \u201c1.5 generation\u201d had levels of Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio that were intermediate between the \u201cfirst\u201d and \u201csecond\u201d generations. Particularly interesting was that relocation age effects were seen regardless of the current age of participants. Thus, the tendency for childhood arrivals with longer time living in the USA to have lower Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio as compared with adult arrivals was a consistent phenomenon that did not dissipate across the life course. This finding suggests a critical time window for establishment of the adult microbiome, in line with the observation that age at separation determined GMB concordance between twins in the UK Twins cohort [26]. We also showed that Hispanic adult US residents raised in Latin America had diet patterns that differed from that among the US-born. These differences in prevailing diet patterns were discernable even after immigrants had lived in the USA a long time, and they appeared to contribute to the makeup of the GMB. However, diet did not explain the GMB differences by birthplace and migration. The dual dependencies of both GMB and diet on the historical age at migration provide an interesting avenue of research to understand the long-term health of Hispanic populations of the USA.",

We found a relatively weak overall association between exposure to the USA and bacterial diversity. As compared both with those who relocated as adults, and those who were born in the mainland USA, those who relocated to the USA during childhood tended to have lower bacterial diversity. Moreover, those preferring to use the English language over the Spanish language had significantly higher 16S Shannon index, which was at odds with the a priori expectation that higher acculturation to the US environment would be associated with reduced bacterial alpha diversity. This seems to provide a more nuanced picture when compared with findings among other communities [24] which have observed loss of GMB diversity after migration from a low-to-moderate income setting to the USA. It should be noted that in some studies these immigrant generation differences in bacterial diversity have been relatively modest [4] and most studies have not analyzed data separately from the \u201cgeneration 1.5\u201d childhood-arrival population.",

We also used classification of subjects according to Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio because it is a frequently used metric to define the microbiome, although it only captures one feature of microbiome space [16]. While decreasing Prevotella relative to Bacteroides was associated with exposure to the USA and \u201cUS style\u201d (versus \u201cLatino\u201d) foods, enigmatically Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio tended to be higher rather than lower among obese individuals. Therefore, our results were not consistent with the hypothesis that \u201creplacement\u201d of Prevotella with Bacteroides among immigrants relocating to high-income nations is associated with increased risk of obesity. On the contrary, our data suggested that normal weight Latino adults had low prevalence of Prevotella relative to Bacteroides. While resolving specific species and strains could not be done from our 16S data, it seems clear that this will be an important next step for assessing health effects of the GMB in Hispanics. For example, Prevotella copri is a common species that has been associated with increased risks of various diseases including diabetes [27]. Both Prevotella [28] and Bacteroides [29] are highly diverse and with strain-specific gene functions that differ between Western and non-Western populations. As compared with the Prevotella-dominant GMB typical of the Latin American region, Latinos highly adapted to the USA who have a Bacteroides-dominant GMB may have different responses to dietary components and exposure to disease-related mechanisms such as short-chain fatty acid production and degradation of the GI mucus barrier [5, 6]. To resolve apparent differences between studies, an intriguing hypothesis that trans-cohort collaborations might be able to address states that disease-associated microbiota patterns may be different in different geographic regions [10].",

Fruit and whole grain consumption were variable in the population, favoring the older adult age immigrants to the USA who had higher intakes of these foods. Bean and legume consumption was high by US standards [30]. However, this food had similar consumption across the population, and based on our adjusted analyses, we consider this diet component unlikely to contribute to the observed GMB differences.",

For instance, Acidaminococcus (anaerobic, Gram-negative, acetate- and butyrate-producer [31]) was more abundant both with high BMI and with mainland US birth. Acidaminococcus has been associated with metabolic disease risks in prior worldwide studies. Abundance of these bacteria may be reduced in type 1 diabetes (China [32], Mexico [33]) and increased in children with stunting (Malawi, Bangladesh) [34]. Consistent with our results, Acidaminococcus has been found to be increased in higher BMI adults (Bangladesh [35], USA [36]) and in adults with high combined cardiovascular risk factors (China) [37]. We also confirmed that those with unfavorable body weight had reduced abundance of Oscillospira [22], which has been also shown as a microbiome feature that correlates with fatty liver disease which is of particularly high prevalence among Latinos [38]. Paradoxically, although adiposity and US exposure are strongly associated with one another, Oscillospira as well as Anaerotruncus (another bacteria known to be negatively related with obesity) had lower abundance in the obese but higher abundance in the US-born. This discordant pattern between these two epidemiologically linked participant characteristics was therefore seen for Prevotella, Anaerotruncus, and Oscillospira, which we consider an interesting finding albeit of uncertain interpretation.",

                    "text": "We found an association of reduced mycobiome diversity with early-life exposure to the USA. Components of the mycobiome have been implicated in chronic disease risk, but this is an understudied area [39]. The lead explanatory variable for fungal beta diversity (Bray-Curtis distance) was poor oral health (missing teeth), and oral health overall is poor in the Latino population, as shown for the groups enrolled in HCHS/SOL [40]. Fungal diversity also varied by income and neighborhood of residence (census block), which may be further evidence that low socioeconomic status and living environment may influence the mycobiome. A few of our findings relating to particular fungal taxa are worthy of note. We suspect that higher abundance of Cyberlindnera jadinii (which is added to processed foods [41]) among US-born as compared with Latin American-born individuals may be associated with some aspect of diet. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, a yeast species that can be found in the environment including within foods and beverages [42], was practically absent in the US-born members of our cohort; however, among those of Latin American birth, this species had mean abundance ~\u20091% in the Caribbean-born groups (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico) and 2\u20133% in the Mexico-, Central America-, and South America-born groups. R. mucilaginosa is considered a rare although emerging human pathogen [42], and in the context of chronic disease, it is interesting for its carotenoid-producing potential [43]. Latin American-born individuals also had substantial mean abundance of several Candida species that were rare in the US-born, including C. sake, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis. C. tropicalis is considered part of the normal human microbiota, yet it is of particular clinical interest for producing a virulent and sometimes antifungal-resistant systemic infection among patients in the Latin American and Asian regions [44]. Despite several interesting differences in the fungal distribution between US- and Latin American-born people, we were unable to identify particular fungal taxa that correlated significantly with obesity among US Hispanics.",

These may include conditions and mode of childbirth, breastfeeding, diet, functioning of the immune system due to pathogen exposures, and exposure to pets and livestock. In our study, lifestyle factor profiles including diet and socioeconomic status differed between the Latin American-born and US-born groups. Physical activity levels also varied across Hispanic groups, although this dimension of lifestyle was not found to be associated with GMB, an interesting null finding in light of prior studies showing GMB differences across more extreme contrasts of exercise habits [45]. Although several of these lifestyle factors were themselves associated with GMB, our multivariable adjustment models showed that lifestyle and socioeconomic variables did not explain the birthplace and migration associations with GMB or obesity risk. Nonetheless, despite the availability of a lengthy and wide-ranging in-person data collection protocol, it can be hard to exclude the influence of mismeasurement, unmeasured behaviors, or other environmental variables.",

We speculate that the life course experience of childhood migrants from Latin America may have a particular influence on GMB. For instance, dramatic changes in diet, nutritional status, and environment after relocation to the USA may exert different effects when experienced in early life versus later adulthood. Thus, we might consider age-varying explanatory biological phenomena involving immunity, the physiology and function of the gastrointestinal tract, or social factors such as contacts with other US- and non-US-born individuals in the household. The time course for establishment of the adult microbiome pattern has been well studied (see [46]), although little is known about how age may alter the response to environmental perturbation (here represented as age at relocation from Latin America to the USA). In this regard, we note our prior report from the HCHS/SOL cohort that adults who were childhood migrants to the USA had higher prevalence of asthma as compared with both US-born individuals and adulthood migrants [47]. Like our GMB findings, these data on asthma are consistent with an immunological phenotype associated with early-life geographic relocation.",

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing is in progress, which may allow identification of specific taxa down to the species and subspecies level, a necessary step to derive well-understood and modifiable biological targets. While we addressed the bacterial and fungal microbiome in parallel, interplay among bacterial and fungal taxa (co-occurrence, co-exclusion) will be complex to disentangle and will require larger samples and new statistical methods. Data on diet were assessed years prior to the GMB assessment, although we obtained these data using rigorous methods designed to capture habitual diet and showed strong associations between diet and GMB. Early-life environment was assessed retrospectively and subject to recall bias, suggesting that the relatively weak GMB signals in our data for variables such as childhood sanitation are likely to be underestimated. We did not study recent migrants because of the design of SOL, and geographic data was limited to the place of birth and the location of residence during the years of study participation. We also lacked repeated stool samples over time, and the analyses were cross-sectional, which will be overcome as the HCHS/SOL cohort members undergo future longitudinal assessments. Extant data suggest that genetic influences on the GMB are relatively weak and overshadowed by the environment [51, 52]. Hispanic background groups differ in average continental ancestry [53] yet we did not see a consistent pattern of difference by Hispanic background. Finally, only adults were studied, although results on migration suggest that studying children and adolescent migrant populations may capture a critical period for influences on lifelong GMB composition.",

Another design feature which lends credence to these comparisons was the approach of sampling all study participants from four US communities using random population-based recruitment methods and conducting assessments in a uniform manner across four US locations. The parent HCHS/SOL cohort had a relatively high participation rate of over 40%, which is notable considering that the cohort was inducted into a lengthy research program by door-to-door community recruitment. The participants were not selected from a diseased population, which allows us to address a large array of disease and biometric characteristics across a range of disease severity.",

In addition, obesity was associated with low bacterial alpha diversity consistent with other studies, but the findings of higher Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio in obese individuals was enigmatic suggesting a unique aspect of the GMB-host relationship in Latinos. This in turn suggests the hypothesis that particular aspects of the microbiome may explain unusual epidemiological patterns observed among the Latino community, such as high prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and asthma [47, 54, 55], concurrent with a paradoxical propensity for longevity [56].",

Self-reported variables included Hispanic/Latino background, place of birth, age at relocation (here termed \u201crelocation age\u201d), and years living in the mainland USA (with the US territory of Puerto Rico considered to be part of Latin America). Following previously described approaches, we used a combination of self-reported, objective monitoring, and clinical examination and blood laboratory components to define sociodemographic factors [59], medical history and medication use [60], physical activity including sedentary time and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) derived from 7-day hip worn accelerometry (Actical version B-1 model 198-0200-03; Respironics, Inc., Bend, OR) [61], and diet [62]. Sedentary time was classified according to quartiles, while MVPA was categorized according to whether participants met the 2008 US guidelines [63]. Diet variables were derived from the average of two 24-h dietary recalls that were collected at the HCHS/SOL baseline visit. The first recall was collected in person, and the second recall was collected by telephone within the following 3\u2009months. Diet recalls were conducted using the Nutrition Data System for Research software (version 11) developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, (Minneapolis, Minnesota). Health insurance was defined according to participant self-report. Childhood economic hardship was assessed by the question, \u201cDid your family ever experience a period of time when they had trouble paying for their basic needs, such as food, housing, medical care, and utilities, when you were a child? / Spanish: \u00bfSu familia alguna vez tuvo dificultades para pagar sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas como comidas, vivienda, cuidados m\u00e9dicos, o servicios p\u00fablicos, cuando usted era ni\u00f1o(a)?\u201d Access to sanitation during childhood was assessed by, \u201cWhen you were growing up, did your home have the following basic utilities?... plumbing, septic tank. / Spanish: \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo usted estaba creciendo, la casa donde viv\u00eda ten\u00eda los siguientes servicios p\u00fablicos? Plomer\u00eda, Drenaje/fosa s\u00e9ptica.\u201d English or Spanish language preference was defined by the participant\u2019s choice of English or Spanish written and spoken language in data collection encounters. Dietary acculturation was a self-reported measure stating whether a typical Hispanic, non-Hispanic (\u201cAmerican\u201d), or blended style diet was consumed (\u201cOf Hispanic/Latino and American food, do you usually eat...? Mainly or Mostly Hispanic/Latino foods\u201d / Spanish: \u201cDe la comida hispana/latina y la comida americana, \u00bfpor lo general come usted...? Principalmente comidas hispanas/latinas, or Mayormente comidas hispanas/latinas y algunas comidas americanas\u201d.) We administered a modified 10-item version of the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (SASH) which has 5-point Likert scale responses. The derived score for social acculturation was an average of the four SASH items regarding socialization practices and preferences [64]. Higher SASH response values represent greater acculturation to the dominant US culture. The overall SASH reliability was acceptable in the full sample (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.90), and for both English and Spanish language versions (\u03b1English\u2009=\u2009.76; \u03b1Spanish\u2009=\u2009.85). The reliability of SASH was similar across Hispanic/Latino background groups (ranging from \u03b1South Americans\u2009=\u2009.85 to \u03b1Mexicans\u2009=\u2009.89). In addition, the use of antibiotics or probiotic supplements and dietary preferences within the prior 6\u2009months, as well as stool characteristics (Bristol scale), were ascertained via directed questions on self-administered questionnaire at the time of stool sample collection.",

Lead correlates of beta diversity were identified by conducting PERMANOVA analysis of Bray-Curtis distances, computing the percent of sample clustering explained by 156 participant characteristics relating to stool quality, anthropometry (for example, height), behaviors (for example, diet), disease and use of medications (including clinical laboratory values, for example liver function tests), childhood exposures (including access to sanitation in home), sociocultural characteristics (including birthplace and relocation to the mainland USA), and demographic variables (sex, age). This set of variables was a subset of all collected variables available at the HCHS/SOL baseline and follow-up examinations, including those that had a plausible relationship with GMB and after selecting one out of every highly correlated set of variables. Pairwise correlations among included variables are shown in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S9 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S10. The adonis function from the vegan package in R was used to assess statistical significance for PERMANOVA analyses. For simplicity, we used a single, uniform modeling approach for PERMANOVA analysis, using linear ordination across categories of independent (predictor) variables. This test was most sensitive to dose-response relationships between levels of the explanatory variable, and Bray-Curtis distance. To understand our results more fully, we also explored alternative statistical approaches including global differences among categories without assuming a dose-response ordination, which provided a more sensitive statistical test for variables such as relocation age which had a non-linear association with GMB metrics (data not shown). As expected, those variables rose in the R2 and P value rankings under the alternate modeling approach.",

Linear modeling was performed using the base R [25] lm function with the dependent variable defined as the metrics of GMB including Shannon index, Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio, and the first two principal coordinates of Bray-Curtis distance. We performed log transformation as appropriate to improve model fit. We used the approaches of stratification combined with multivariable adjustment to address the relationship among multiple correlates of GMB in order to isolate associations with the variables of primary interest and exclude confounding. Adjustment variables were chosen based on a combination of empiric data on correlates of the main predictor and outcome variable, and knowledge of risk factor and disease relationships. These covariates included age (except for analyses with the primary predictor of interest defined as relocation age), gender, and study center for the initial adjusted models, and for the fully adjusted models, we added intake of vegetables without potatoes, intake of whole fruit, intake of whole grains, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (continuous), BMI (six groups), diabetes/pre-diabetes/normoglycemic defined by American Diabetes Association criteria applied to study glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels (three groups), length and frequency of visits back to the participant\u2019s country of origin (continuous), education level (four groups), income level (five groups), antibiotic use in the last 6\u2009months (binary), and metformin use (binary). Next, in order to exclude confounding effects of age at the time of study, we examined the associations of relocation age with GMB across strata of current age at the time of GMB collection. This analysis was done after excluding individuals who relocated to the USA beyond age 26\u2009years old in order to remove the strong correlation between relocation age and current age. A leave-one-out approach was also used to determine whether any single Hispanic background group was responsible for our main findings, and the Mexican subgroup of the HCHS/SOL was deemed large enough to allow analyses to be repeated in this group alone. To avoid false inferences due to small sample size, we excluded participant subgroups that had a small number of participants (for example, some of the mainland US-born groups separated out by Hispanic background). The final set of analyses examined the independent associations of GMB metrics and individual bacterial (16S) and fungal (ITS1) defined taxa with body mass index (obesity) and birthplace and migration. Significance testing followed a P\u2009<\u20090.05 criteria, and q values were used to control for multiple testing in R according to the method of Storey (http://github.com/jdstorey/qvalue).",
