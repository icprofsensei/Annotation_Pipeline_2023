To assess microbial translocation, we compared the serum microbial composition of patients with and without ascites and characterized the ascitic fluid microbiome using 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing data. A complex and specific microbial community was detected in the serum and ascitic fluid of patients with cirrhosis but barely detectable in the serum of healthy controls. The serum microbiome of patients with ascites presented higher levels of lipopolysaccharide binding protein, a marker of microbial translocation, associated with higher diversity and relative abundance of Clostridiales and an unknown genus belonging to the Cyanobacteria phylum compared to patients without ascites. The composition of the fecal microbiome was also more altered in patients with than without ascites, confirming previous studies on fecal microbiome. We propose that alteration of the serum and fecal microbiome composition be considered indicators of cirrhosis progression.",

It is the final phase of chronic liver disease, in which inflammation is associated with dying hepatic cells and fibrosis, leading to poor liver function and portal hypertension. Alterations in the gut microbiota, which represents the collective microbial cells present in the digestive tract, or its products, are linked to the progression of liver disease and the complications of cirrhosis2. Over the last decade, advances in molecular techniques and bioinformatics, as well as the exponential decrease in the cost of sequencing, have allowed comprehensive characterization of the composition and function of the gut microbial community. Using these techniques, recent studies on the gut microbiome have demonstrated an alteration of the composition of the stool microbial community in cirrhotic patients compared to healthy controls3,4. Furthermore, this level of alteration appears to be positively correlated with the severity of the disease5.",

Together, these results suggest that a loss of microbial diversity in fecal samples is associated with cirrhosis without ascites, but the progression to ascites is not associated with a further loss of diversity. Clustering analysis using PCoA and UPGMA methods based on UniFrac metrics showed that the stool microbiome of cirrhotic patients clustered separately from that of healthy controls (Fig. 1c,d).

Interestingly, when we analyzed the stool microbiome of patients with ascites and those without ascites separately, only the former displayed a significant dysbiosis at the species level, with depletion of unknown Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales and Peptostroptococcaceae, Roseburia faecis and Alistipes putredinis and with an enrichment of Veillonella dispar compared to healthy controls (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05; Kruskal-Wallis test; Fig. 1f). For several of these species, such as Roseburia faecis, Alistipes putredinis and Veillonella dispar, our findings are in line with those of Qin et al.4 and further support the notion that the progression of the disease is associated with a greater dysbiosis, as reported by Bajaj et al.5. Patients without ascites presented only a trend towards lower relative abundance of unknown Mogibacteriaceae and Alistipes (FDR\u2009=\u20090.053; Kruskal-Wallis test) compared to healthy controls.",

We analyzed the microbiome serum from 7 healthy controls and from the 27 patients and ascitic fluid from 11 patients. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene of such low-biomass samples may generate contamination at various steps of the process. Therefore, we applied strict protocols for sample collection, DNA extraction, and PCR amplification. For sample collection, we used gloves and proceeded in sterile conditions. For DNA extraction, we used chemicals such as DNA terminator (Biotools, B & M Labs, Spain) to degrade any trace of contaminant DNA in laboratory equipment, and we added negative controls (blanks) during extraction. During PCR amplification, we used UV to clean consumables and H2O and also added PCR blanks.",

No DNA band was observed for four control serum samples out of seven, one serum sample from patient with ascites and one ascitic fluid sample, or for the negative controls added during the extraction (NEG1 and NEG2) and PCR (NEG3) procedures. The PCR amplifications of serum and ascitic fluid samples provided a gradient of intensity in the DNA bands, as analyzed in the electrophoretic gel (Supplementary Fig. 1), in the following order: healthy control serum\u2009<\u2009cirrhotic patients without ascites\u2009<\u2009cirrhotic patients with ascites\u2009<\u2009ascitic fluid, thereby also suggesting a gradient in the microbial load. To remove potential false positive OTUs during sequence analysis, we subtracted sequences with abundant taxa generated in the blanks from the serum and ascitic fluid samples and applied a more restricted filter to the data obtained from samples in order to remove taxa with a low abundance, as specified in the method section. The contamination present in the negative controls was identified as being mostly Proteobacteria (69%) at the phylum level and Pseudomonas (30%), Halomonas (18%) and unknown (12%) at the genus level. After this filtering step and at a rarefaction of 1000 sequences per sample, we obtained sequence data for 24 out of 27 serum samples from patients and for eight out of 11 ascitic fluid samples and no sequence data were recovered from healthy controls. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the taxonomic profiling of the three sample types at the phylum level before and after the sequence-filtering step.",

Serum and ascitic fluid were similar in terms of diversity and richness, as assessed by an abundance-based richness estimator (Chao1) (Fig. 3a). However, serum specimens of patients with ascitic fluid presented a more diverse microbiome (P\u2009=\u20090.008) than those of patients without (Fig. 3b), and a significantly higher concentration of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) (P\u2009=\u20090.02, Mann Whitney test), a marker of microbial translocation (Fig. 3c). This observation could be explained by patients with ascites, who are expected to have a greater deterioration of the intestinal barrier integrity, also having a higher degree of microbial translocation than those without ascites, thus leading to a higher microbial diversity in serum.",

By comparing the taxa between samples, we detected on average 37 taxa common to both stool and serum, 20 to serum and ascitic fluid, and three to ascitic fluid and stool (Supplementary Fig. 5). These results indicate that the three sites share few common microbial taxa and therefore suggest that the microbial taxa present in the serum, but not detected in stool, could either take root in extra-intestinal sites such as the lung or the vagina for women or were in too low abundance in the stool to be detectable but when they reached the serum, a more appropriate environment for their growth, they became detectable.",

Our findings showed that the microbial community in serum and ascitic fluid, although showing more than 80% similarity with that of the stool microbiome at the genus level, is specific and complex at the taxa level. Previous studies using a variety of techniques, mainly conventional PCR, reported the presence of bacterial DNA in ascitic fluid and/or blood only in up to 30\u201360% of these patients8,9,10,11. Moreover, most of the DNA detected in these studies was monomicrobial, identified as being Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus8,9,10,11. A recent study has reported the characterization of the microbial composition of the ascitic fluid of cirrhotic patients12. However, the authors amplified the 16\u2009S gene from only one individual out of seven and this individual was positive for Escherichia coli in culture. Using shotgun-sequencing technique on two pools of ascitic fluid obtained from three patients, they were able to identify only 0.1% of bacterial DNA, for which the majority was identified as being Escherichia. However, according to our findings, Escherichia belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum could also be found in the extraction and PCR blanks. We therefore recommend that future studies on samples with a low biomass include several blanks and minimize the amount of Taq polymerase used during the PCR amplification, since it may contain contaminant DNA. The detection of polymicrobial DNA in the serum and ascitic fluid observed in the present study is in line with our previous findings in rats, showing a high microbial diversity in MLNs of a model of CCl4-induced liver injury, as well as in those of control rats7.",

Indeed, the presence of DNA bands in the electrophoretic gel after serum amplification could be due to the presence of human DNA combined with contaminant DNA during extraction and amplification, thus impeding analysis of the microbiome of these samples after filtering out the contaminant sequences. As the same method of sample collection and processing was used for patients with cirrhosis, this finding supports that the detection of bacterial DNA in patients with cirrhosis was not caused by contamination. This observation suggests that healthy individuals harbor a very low or undetectable microbial load in blood, which is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating the presence of a gut-vascular barrier that controls the systemic dissemination of bacteria in healthy individuals but not in patients with celiac disease and liver damage13. In cirrhotic patients, the similarity of the microbiome composition between serum and ascitic fluid compared to stool samples could be due, in part, to the body site selecting only microorganisms capable of growing in a liquid and relatively aerobic environment. The differences found in diversity (Chao1 index) and in composition and structure of the serum microbiome between patients with and without ascites are alterations that are associated with cirrhosis progression, thereby validating the assumption of previous studies14.",

However, in contrast to other authors5, we did not observe a significant increase in potential pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteria, but only a trend towards an increase in Proteobacteria or Streptococcaceae. This observation could be explained by a smaller sample size and the fact that the patients in our study presented a relatively preserved liver function, as reflected by the low Child-Pugh and MELD scores, in comparison with other studies that included groups with more advanced liver failure.",

A demultiplexing step was performed to assign back each read to its corresponding sample and to remove barcodes. A total of 3,393,253 high quality sequences were finally recovered (2,910,686 for feces and 482,567 for serum and asctic fluid samples). UCLUST algorithm based on 97% of similarity was used to cluster similar sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) or taxa. Representative sequences of each OTU were aligned using PyNAST against Greengenes template alignment (gg_13_8). Chimeric sequences were then identified and removed with ChimeraSlayer. Finally, a taxonomical assignment for each OTU was performed with the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) and the combination of two microbial databases (Greengenes and PATRIC). A phylogenetic tree was obtained with the FastTree program. The general OTU table was split into various tables in order to individually analyze feces, serum, and ascitic fluid samples.",
