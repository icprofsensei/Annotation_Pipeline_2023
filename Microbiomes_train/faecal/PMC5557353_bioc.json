                    "text": "The composition of porcine milk oligosaccharides (PMO) was analyzed during early lactation and their relation to piglet gut microbiome was investigated. Pigs are considered ideal intestinal models to simulate humans because of the striking similarity in intestinal physiopathology to humans. The evolution of PMO was investigated in the milk from 3 healthy sows at prefarrowing, farrowing, and d 7 and 14 postpartum by Nano-LC Chip Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Previously sequenced metagenome libraries were reanalyzed to examine changes with specific gut bacterial populations. Over 30 oligosaccharides (OS) were identified in the milk, with 3\u2032-sialyllactose, lacto-N-tetraose, \u03b11\u20133,\u03b21\u20134-d-galactotriose, 2\u2032-fucosyllactose, and 6\u2032-sialyllactose being the most abundant species (accounting for ~70% of the total OS). Porcine milk had lower OS diversity (number of unique structures) than human milk, and appeared closer to bovine and caprine milk. In agreement with previous studies, only 3 fucosylated OS were identified. Surprisingly, their contribution to total OS abundance was greater than in bovine milk (9 vs. 1%). Indeed, fucosylated PMO increased during lactation, mirroring a similar trend observed for neutral and type I OS content during early lactation. Taken together, these results suggest that, in terms of abundance, PMO are closer to human milk than other domestic species, such as bovine and caprine milks. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that fucose-consuming bacterial taxa in the gut microbiota of piglets were qualitatively but not quantitatively different between nursing and weaning stages, suggesting that both the composition and structure of dietary glycans may play a critical role in shaping the distal gut microbiome. The similarity of both intestinal physiopathology and milk OS composition in human and porcine species suggests similar effects on gastrointestinal development of early nutrition, reinforcing the use of the pig intestinal model to simulate human intestinal models in the clinical setting.",

                    "text": "Breast milk is the optimal source of nutrition for the first few months of an infant\u2019s life, as it provides all the necessary nutrients for optimal growth and development. Its composition has been shaped by natural selection, which acts on both the infant and the mother, maximizing infant survival, growth, and development while minimizing the metabolic costs of lactation for the mother (Zivkovic et al., 2011). As a result of this natural selective pressure, breast milk evolved to have a unique composition where lipids and lactose are the most abundant components, followed by oligosaccharides (OS) and proteins (German et al., 2008). Despite OS being the third most abundant components in milk (Kunz et al., 2000), it was long thought they had no biological significance. Recent studies pointed out many and diverse biological activities afforded by milk OS, including prebiotic activity, antiadhesion effects, anti-inflammatory properties, glycome-modifying activity, and roles in brain development, as well as influencing the growth-related characteristics of intestinal cells (Hickey, 2012; Lane et al., 2012; ten Bruggencate et al., 2014). Taken together, these bioactivities favor the establishment of a protective and healthful intestinal environment (Smilowitz et al., 2014). Milk OS are typically composed of 3 to 10 repeating monosaccharide units, including glucose (Glc), galactose (Gal), N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc), fucose (Fuc), and sialic acids (NeuAc/ NeuGc). The core unit of bovine milk and other domestic milk OS can be either lactose [Gal(\u03b21\u20134)Glc] or N-acetyl-lactosamine [Gal(\u03b21\u20134)GlcNAc; Aldredge et al., 2013]. Based on their chemical composition, OS are classified as acidic (decorated by sialic acid, NeuAc/NeuGc) or neutral (containing GlcNAc, HexNAc, or fucose, lacking sialic acid).",

The OS content can be as high as 23 g/L in colostrum and rapidly decrease during lactation to values a low as 5 to 10 g/L late in nursing (Newburg, 2013). Human milk OS (HMO) have been widely studied, with more than 200 structures partially characterized (Wu et al., 2010, 2011) displaying a predominance of neutral fucosylated (50\u201370%) compared with sialylated OS (10\u201325%; Ni\u00f1onuevo et al., 2008). The concentration of OS in milk from other mammalian species is lower than that in human milk, with a concentration of 1 g/L in bovine colostrum and even lower concentrations in mature bovine milk (Fong et al., 2011); however, a great diversity of OS structures has been reported for domestic animals. A bioinformatic library of 55 structures was assembled for bovine milk OS (BMO; Aldredge et al., 2013), whereas 39 OS were described in porcine milk (Tao et al., 2010; Albrecht et al., 2014), 20 OS in caprine milk (Meyrand et al., 2013; Albrecht et al., 2014), and only 12 OS in camel milk (Alhaj et al., 2013; Albrecht et al., 2014). Conversely, the ratio of fucosylated to sialylated OS in milk from domestic animals is shifted toward sialylated OS, which predominate the overall composition (70%; Urashima et al., 2013).",

The microfluidic chip contained one enrichment and one analytical column, both packed with graphitized carbon. Chromatographic elution was performed with a binary gradient of 3% ACN/0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 90% ACN/0.1% formic acid in water (solvent B). The column was initially equilibrated with a flow rate of 0.3 \u00b5L/min for the nanopump and 4 \u00b5L/min for the capillary pump. The 65-min gradient was programmed as follows: 0 to 2.5 min, 0% B; 2.5 to 20 min, 0 to16% B; 20 to 30 min, 16 to 44% B; 30 to 35 min, 44 to 100% B; 35 to 45 min, 100% B; and 45 to 65 min, 0% B. Data were acquired in the positive ionization mode with a 450 to 2,500 m/z range. The electrospray capillary voltage was 1,700 to 1,900 V. The acquisition rate was 0.63 spectra/s for both MS and MS/MS modes. Automated precursor selection was employed based on ion abundance, performing up to 6 MS/MS spectra per individual MS when precursor was above ion abundance threshold. The precursor isolation window was selected to be narrow (1.3 m/z) to improve accuracy. Fragmentation energy was set at 1.8 V/100 Da with an offset of \u22122.4 V. Internal calibration was continuously performed by infusing 2 reference masses: 922.009 and 1221.991 m/z (ESI-TOF Tuning Mix G1969\u201385000, Agilent Technologies).",

The number of OS identified is within the range described in literature (Tao et al., 2010; Albrecht et al., 2014), differences may due to genetic variability in sows from different studies. Similarly to human milk, only a small number of OS (i.e., 5 compounds) represented nearly 70% of the remaining OS abundances.

Human milk is reported to contain more than 200 OS, whereas bovine milk or colostrum has up to 55 (Aldredge et al., 2013; Albrecht et al., 2014) and porcine milk 39 OS (Tao et al., 2010; Albrecht et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2015). Porcine milk contains 2\u2032-fu-cosyllactose and type I OS (LNT, lacto-N-fucopentaose I, lacto-N-fucopentaose II, lacto-N-difucohexose I) in higher abundance, whereas type II OS (whose core units are LNnT or LNnH, lacto-N-fucopentaose III) are present in lower abundances. No type I OS have been identified in bovine milk (Urashima et al., 2013). To identify the type of OS in the porcine milk analyzed, samples were spiked with reduced standard solutions of LNT, LNnT, LNH, and LNnH. Results (Supplemental Figure S2; http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-10966), which allowed us to identify the isomers LNnH, LNT and LNnT in the samples, suggest that porcine milk OS are structurally closer to OS in human milk than those in bovine milk. This work characterized 3 fucosylated OS, which is in agreement with Albrecht et al. (2014) but is lower than by Tao et al. (2010). Regardless of the lower structural diversity, the contribution of fucosylated OS to the total OS is high compared with bovine milk (9.1 vs. 1%). Overall, the composition and abundance of PMO suggest porcine milk is closer to human milk than bovine milk based on the higher abundance of fucosylated OS structures, the lower abundance of sialylated structures, and the presence of LNT at a high abundance (20%).",

The PMO profile and abundance revealed a high variability during lactation (Tao et al., 2010), either increasing or decreasing with lactation. The peak with RT between 20.0 and 20.5 min corresponding to 3\u2032-sialyllactose was the most abundant, as previously described for porcine milk (Tao et al., 2010), human milk (Thurl et al., 1996; Smilowitz et al., 2013), and bovine milk (Tao et al., 2009). Importantly, the OS at RT \u224813.5 was identified as LNT, which is abundant in human milk but only present at trace level in bovine milk. Relevant shifts in OS composition occurred as lactation progressed (see Figure 4). In precolostrum and farrowing stage samples, sialylated and nonfucosylated neutral OS were the most abundant and had similar abundances, whereas fucosylated OS were present in low abundance (4\u20136%). A significant decrease (P < 0.05) of sialylated OS correlated with a significant increase (P < 0.05) of fucosylated OS at d 14 is observed. Figure 5 shows the variation of the most abundant neutral nonfucosylated (top panel, 710.265 m/z; 507.185 m/z), sialylated (central panel, 636.228 m/z, 3\u2032-sialyllactose; 677.225 m/z, 6\u2032-sialyllactose), and fucosylated OS (bottom panel, 637.239 m/z; 491.190 m/z). The most abundant sialylated OS (central panel) decreased during early lactation (\u221230 to \u221260%), the abundance of the main fucosylated OS (bottom panel) increased during the same time period (98 to 615%), and neutral OS abundances (top panel) did not show a clear pattern, with some greatly increasing and others decreasing (+430 to \u221271%); LNT actually increased in porcine milk during lactation.",

Both fucosylation and sialylation play significant roles in those functions (Bode and Jantscher-Krenn, 2012; Charbonneau et al., 2016), whereas sialylated OS are essential for neuronal development (ten Bruggencate et al., 2014). Given that PMO are structurally closer to HMO than to BMO, it is interesting to consider whether milk OS are tailor-made for the postnatal development of the specific type of animal gastrointestinal system and, thus, the more similar the gastrointestinal systems are, the closer their milk OS compositions will be (Albrecht et al., 2014). This hypothesis needs to be validated by performing studies using comparable instrumentation and similar methodology to further characterize other mammalian milks and compare their composition and abundances to human milk.",

We previously described the distal gut microbiome of animals born to the sows profiled in this study of OS. That study showed how composition of dietary glycans dramatically shape the nursing gut microbiome from both taxonomic and functional standpoints during nursing and after weaning (Frese et al., 2015). Congruent with findings that previously noted sialic acid and HexNAc as dominant components of sow milk, we found these were crucial in shaping the different communities comprising the gut microbiome before weaning and that the abundance of these OS was high in the milk fed to the nursing pigs during the various stages of lactation in our study. Nearly half of the glycans in sow milk analyzed in the present study were in a sialylated form, which agrees with the previous report by Tao et al. (2010) with regard to PMO. In profiling the gut metagenome of nursing pigs, we found that the consumption of free sialic acid was largely dominated by the Enterobacteriaceae, a family that makes up a large fraction of the total community during the nursing period (Frese et al., 2015). Accordingly, this sialic acid-consuming microbiota disappeared at weaning, when these structures decreased in the diet and were replaced by dietary starches.",

However, we did not previously examine how the fecal microbiome may be associated with fucose catabolism. In the present study, we reanalyzed these previous metagenomics-sequencing libraries to consider how fucose may affect the fecal metagenome. In contrast with our previous observations of microbial genes associated with Neu5Ac and HexNAc consumption (Frese et al., 2015), fucose catabolism pathways were not significantly different before and after weaning. However, the identity of fucose-consuming taxa changed dramatically at weaning, where Enterobacteriaceae comprised more than 53% of total assigned reads for metagenomic reads predicted to encode a fucose permease during nursing to 0.6% after weaning (see Figure 6). This suggests that both the composition and construction of dietary glycans may play a critical role in shaping the distal gut microbiome. Mirroring the interactions with sialic acid reported previously (Frese et al., 2015), Enterobacteriaceae were found to encode genes related to the consumption of free fucose (Figure 6) but lack the enzymatic capacity to liberate these monomers from PMO, which may also support the hypothesis that microbial cross-feeding is shaping these gut communities. Preferences among carbohydrate sources have been reported for Enterobacteriaceae (Chang et al., 2004), and this certainly offers a competitive advantage in the ecosystem for potential pathogens (Ng et al., 2013).",

Porcine milk OS composition and evolution during early lactation were similar to those of human milk (despite lower diversity and number of structures), as indicated by the relative increase in fucosylated compounds and decrease in sialylated compounds as lactation progressed, accompanied by high amounts of neutral and type I OS. The consumption of milk OS was previously found to be reflected in the enzymatic potential of the gut metagenome, which is expanded here in light of our new findings related to the abundance of fucosylated structures. These findings suggest that porcine milk could be an ideal source for extraction of human milk OS mimics. The present study reinforces the pig model as one of the best human intestinal models. The similarity of both intestinal physiopathology and milk OS composition could lead to studies in the neonatal pig that would model how early nutrition intervenes in the gastrointestinal development in human infants.",
