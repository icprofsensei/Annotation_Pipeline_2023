Although individuals diagnosed early have a greater than 90\u00a0% chance of survival, more than one-third of individuals do not adhere to screening recommendations partly because the standard diagnostics, colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, are expensive and invasive. Thus, there is a great need to improve the sensitivity of non-invasive tests to detect early stage cancers and adenomas. Numerous studies have identified shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota associated with the progression of CRC, suggesting that the gut microbiota may represent a reservoir of biomarkers that would complement existing non-invasive methods such as the widely used fecal immunochemical test (FIT).",

Although structural exams including colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are able to detect both adenomas and carcinomas, the high cost and invasive nature are barriers for many people. Fear, discomfort, and embarrassment are among the most cited reasons patients choose to forego CRC screening [3]. Likewise, the large disparity in screening rates between those with and without health insurance highlights the need for inexpensive screening methods [1, 4, 5]. Unfortunately cheaper, less invasive stool-based tests like guaic fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and FIT are unable to reliably detect adenomas [6]. The newly introduced stool DNA panel has improved accuracy compared to FIT, but is still limited in its ability to accurately detect adenomas [2]. Thus there is need for novel screening methods that are inexpensive and capable of detecting both cancer and adenomas.",

Furthermore, several members of the gut microbiota have been shown to potentiate both the development and progression of CRC by a variety of mechanisms [14\u201316]. Although each of these organisms may play a role in certain cases of CRC, none of them is present in every case.

In doing so, we confirmed previously observed associations of certain bacterial taxa with CRC. Many lesions detected using the microbiota were distinct from those detected by FIT, suggesting the microbiota could complement FIT to improve sensitivity. By incorporating data on hemoglobin and bacterial abundances into a single model (labeled the multitarget microbiota test or MMT), we were able to improve the sensitivity for adenomas and cancer compared to FIT alone.",

Patient age at the time of enrollment was in the range of 29\u201389 years with a median of 60\u00a0years. All patients were asymptomatic and were excluded if they had undergone surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy for current CRC prior to baseline samples or had inflammatory bowel disease, known hereditary non-polyposis CRC, or familial adenomatous polyposis. Colonoscopies were performed and fecal samples were collected from participants in four locations: Toronto (ON, Canada), Boston (MA, USA), Houston (TX, USA), and Ann Arbor (MI, USA). Patient diagnoses were determined by colonoscopic examination and histopathological review of any biopsies taken. Patients with an adenoma greater than 1\u00a0cm, more than three adenomas of any size, or an adenoma with villous histology were classified as advanced adenoma. Whole evacuated stool was collected from each patient either prior to colonoscopy preparation or 1\u20132 weeks after colonoscopy. This has been shown to be sufficient time for the microbiota to recover from colonoscopy preparation [20]. Stool samples were packed in ice, shipped to a processing center via next day delivery, and stored at \u201380\u00a0\u00b0C. The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved this study, and all participants provided informed consent. This study conformed to the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration.",

Sequences were classified using a naive Bayesian classifier trained against a 16S rRNA gene training set provided by the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) [23]. Curated sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a 97\u00a0% similarity cutoff with the average neighbor clustering algorithm. Species-level classifications for OTUs of interest were determined by blasting the predominant sequences within each OTU to the NCBI 16S rRNA database. The putative species was only reported for OTUs with greater than 99\u00a0% sequence identity to a single species in the database; otherwise the consensus RDP classification was used. The number of sequences in each sample was rarefied to 10,000 per sample to minimize the effects of uneven sampling.

Among these patients, 120 had CRC, 198 had adenomas, and 172 had no colonic lesions. In addition to characterizing the bacterial community, we tested each sample for the concentration of hemoglobin using FIT. With these data, we compared the ability to detect lesions using FIT to using a microbiota-based model. First, we developed a random forest classification model for differentiating healthy individuals from those with adenomas based on the relative abundance of bacterial populations in stool. We determined the optimal model using the AUC-RF algorithm for maximizing the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve for a random forest model [24]. The optimal model utilized 22 bacterial populations (Additional file 1: Figure S1A). The vast majority of OTUs in the model (17 out of 22) belonged to the order Clostridales, four were associated with the genus Bacteroides, and one OTU was unclassified at the phylum level (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). The AUC for this and subsequent random forest models were generated based on the OOB probabilities for each sample. Additional leave-one-out and 10-fold cross validations showed no significant difference in AUC compared to the OOB AUC (Additional file 2: Figure S2A). The AUC for the microbiota model (0.673) was significantly different from a random assignment (p <0.001), but not significantly different from that of FIT (FIT AUC:0.639, p >0.05, Fig.\u00a01a). At the 100\u00a0ng/mL cutoff, FIT detected 15.7\u00a0% of adenomas with a specificity of 97.1\u00a0%. Setting the microbiota model to the same 97.1\u00a0% specificity resulted in 18.2\u00a0% sensitivity for adenomas. When comparing the results of the tests for each sample, only 2.5\u00a0% of adenomas were detected by both tests, while 28.8\u00a0% were detected by only one of the two tests (Fig.\u00a01b). Thus, the two tests detected small but distinct subsets of adenomas.",

The ROC curve for the model had an AUC of 0.847, which was similar to AUCs reported for other microbiota-based models for CRC [17, 18]. The AUC of this model was significantly better than a random assignment (p <0.001), but was significantly lower than that of FIT (FIT AUC:0.929, p\u2009=\u20090.005, Fig.\u00a01c).

Based on these observations, we developed a random forest model using both the microbiota and FIT that would differentiate normal individuals from those with any type of colonic lesion (i.e. adenoma or carcinoma). The optimal model, referred to as the MMT, used the relative abundances of 23 OTUs and the concentration of hemoglobin as determined by FIT. Of those OTUs, 16 were members of the Firmicutes phylum, including three from the Ruminococcaceae family and 10 from the Lachnospiraceae family (Additional file 4: Figure S4). Three OTUs were associated with the genus Bacteroides. The remaining OTUs were associated with Porphyromonas, Parabacteroides, Collinsella, and Enterobacteriaceae. The OTU associated with Porphyromonas was most closely related to Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, which has been previously shown to be predictive of CRC [17, 18, 32]. Interestingly the majority of OTUs used in the model, especially the Lachnospiraceae, were enriched in normal patients (Additional file 4: Figure S4), suggesting that a loss of beneficial organisms in addition to the emergence of pathogens may be indicative of CRC development. As with the previous random forest models we performed leave-one-out cross validation and 100 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation and found no difference in AUC compared to the OOB estimates (Additional file 5: Figure S5).",

Subdividing the lesions, detecting adenomas by the MMT (AUC: 0.755) was significantly better than FIT (AUC: 0.639, p <0.001), but not for differentiating cancer from normal (MMT AUC: 0.952, FIT AUC: 0.929, p\u2009=\u20090.09). To generate a categorical prediction from the MMT, we determined the model\u2019s optimal threshold for detecting cancer (0.57 probability of a lesion) using Youden\u2019s J statisitc [26]. Samples scoring above this cutoff were classified as lesions, and those below the cutoff were classified as normal. We then compared the sensitivity and specificity of the MMT to those of FIT using a threshold of 100\u00a0ng/mL of hemoglobin. At these cutoffs, the MMT detected 91.7\u00a0% of cancers and 45.5\u00a0% of adenomas compared to 75.0\u00a0% and 15.7\u00a0% for FIT (Table\u00a01, Fig.\u00a02b, c). When adenomas and cancers were pooled together, the MMT detected 62.9\u00a0% of lesions, while FIT only detected 38.1\u00a0%.

The prevalence of lesions in an average-risk population was obtained through a previously published meta-analysis [33]. Based on sensitivities of FIT and MMT in our dataset, we estimate that MMT would detect approximately 40\u00a0thousand additional cancers, 1.3 million additional advanced adenomas, and 5.1 million additional non-advanced adenomas compared to using FIT (Table\u00a02). Thus the improved sensitivity of the MMT would increase the total number of true positives identified in the recommended screening population of the United States by approximately 6.5 million. However, due to the lower specificity of MMT, it would also result in an estimated 4.3 million additional false positives compared to FIT.

However, the model was significantly better at differentiating normal from lesion for women than for men (p\u2009=\u20090.02; Additional file 6: Figure S6).

Although FIT was better at detecting cancers than a model using only the microbiota, microbiota-based models detected a subset of lesions that were not detected by FIT. This suggested that the two methods could complement each other. Based on this observation we developed a cross-validated random forest model that combined both FIT and the microbiota to detect colonic lesions. The resulting MMT had higher sensitivity than FIT for detecting lesions, especially adenomas. The MMT was also able to detect the majority of cancers missed by FIT. However, the increased sensitivity of MMT was accompanied by a decrease in specificity compared to FIT. With a false positive rate more than three times higher than FIT (9.9\u00a0% versus 2.9\u00a0%), an annual MMT would result in more colonoscopies than using FIT as the primary screening test. However, the higher sensitivity of the MMT might make it possible to reduce the frequency of screening, thereby offsetting the difference in the number of colonoscopies. Additional studies would be needed identify the appropriate screening interval and to determine whether the increased number of true positives identified by MMT justify the increased number of false positives.",

Such results support the assertion that because of the large interpersonal variation in markers for adenomas and carcinomas, it is necessary to employ a panel of biomarkers and to use a model that integrates the biomarkers. The accuracy of our model may be further improved by incorporating additional indicators such as host-associated biomarkers or those targeting specific genes involved in the underlying mechanism of tumorigenesis such as bacterial toxins [15, 16, 18]. More generally, predictive and diagnostic models for other diseases with a microbial etiology may benefit from a similar approach. For example, we recently demonstrated the ability to detect Clostridium difficile infection based on the composition of the microbiota [37].

This is likely due to these OTUs being positively correlated with FIT (all p <0.001, Spearman correlation), meaning they add little information when used in combination with FIT. Instead the MMT is enriched for OTUs that help detect adenomas. Thus the MMT model relies primarily on FIT for detecting cancer, and uses the microbiota to help identify adenomas undetectable by FIT alone. It is also interesting that most of the OTUs used in the MMT were enriched in normal individuals, suggesting that a loss of beneficial organisms in addition to the emergence of pathogens may be important for colorectal cancer development. Many of the OTUs that were depleted in patients with lesions belonged to the Ruminococcoaceae and Lachnospiraceae families, which contain the predominant producers of butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid with anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic properties [38\u201341]. Likewise Zeller et al. observed a depletion of a potential butyrate-producing Eubacterium spp. in patients with CRC [18]. Loss of butyrate or other anti-inflammatory microbial metabolites may contribute to CRC development. These possibilities highlight the need for longitudinal studies to better understand how changes to an individual\u2019s microbiome or the metabolic profile of the gut might predispose them to CRC.",

Periodontal pathogens have been shown to promote the progression of oral cancer [42]. Therefore it is possible that these taxa could influence the progression of CRC by a similar mechanism. These observations may warrant further investigation into a potential link between periodontal disease and CRC. Furthermore, since the structure of an individual\u2019s oral microbiome is correlated with that of the gut [43], alterations in the oral community could potentially be a proxy for ongoing or future changes to the gut community.",

This represents the largest cohort to date, but still only consists of 490 patients. In contrast, the cohort used to validate the Multitarget stool DNA test included 9989 participants. Development of a larger cohort will allow us to apply the MMT to a separate validation set. It is also unclear how sensitive the MMT is to variation in sample preparation and processing. Many of the samples included in the current study were collected 1\u20132 weeks after the participants\u2019 colonoscopy. A previous study showed that the microbiome quickly returns to normal following colonoscopy [20]. Likewise, we found no difference in the microbiome between samples collected prior to or after colonoscopy (PERMANOVA: p\u2009=\u20090.45). Regardless, we would have greater confidence in the predictive potential of the microbiota if all samples were collected prior to colonoscopy. Despite these shortcomings, the ability to improve the sensitivity of detecting adenomas suggests that further methods development and validation are warranted.",

Using the random forest algorithm it was possible to interpret FIT results in the context of the microbiota. The MMT had higher sensitivity for lesions, especially at early stages of tumorigenesis. Moreover the model detected the majority of cancers that FIT was unable to detect. The shortcoming of the MMT is its lower specificity. However, the potential value of the MMT is its higher sensitivity, which is the purpose of preventive screening \u2013 finding lesions earlier so that cancer would be avoided.",
