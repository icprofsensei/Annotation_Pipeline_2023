The reported worldwide prevalence of PCOS among women of reproductive age is 6\u201318% and varies due to the use of different diagnostic criteria, such as those issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) [1]. PCOS phenotypes can range from mild to severe and are often accompanied by disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism[1\u20133]. Women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of infertility, pregnancy complications, depression, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the related long-term outcomes [3\u20136]. Additionally, PCOS patients display a heightened inflammatory state with increased circulating C-reactive protein [7]. The etiology of PCOS has not been fully explained, but is assumed to be multifactorial, comprising genetics, the intrauterine environment, and lifestyle factors [3].",

Recent large-scale studies and meta-analyses support an association between the gut microbiome and obesity in humans, though this association may be weaker than previously assumed [12\u201314]. Furthermore, a link between gut bacteria, obesity, and host genetics is emerging, suggesting that certain bacteria predisposing to a healthy or unhealthy metabolic state may be heritable [13\u201315].",

This endotoxemia promotes insulin resistance and lipid storage through an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory signaling [17]. In 2012, Tremellen and Pearce postulated the hypothesis that diet-induced gut bacterial dysbiosis and subsequent gut barrier dysfunction and endotoxemia may drive the chronic inflammation and subsequent insulin resistance and androgen hypersecretion associated with PCOS [18]. To date, no published data on the gut microbiome in human PCOS patients exist, though there have been recent reports of alterations in the fecal microbiome in PCOS rodent models [19,20]. Data on gut permeability in PCOS patients are likewise scarce, though an increase in serum zonulin, a regulator of tight junction function, has been reported [21].",

An OTU was defined as a group of sequences with a similarity of 97% or more. Alpha rarefaction analyses were based on the number of observed OTUs and Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity index and performed in QIIME. Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) were based on unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances, calculated in QIIME, and plotted in GraphPad Prism 5 [33]. Taxa summaries were performed in QIIME. Three different OTU abundance cut-offs were tested to assess the impact of high- and low-abundance taxa and spurious OTUs resulting from sequencing errors. The cut-offs used were the removal of singleton OTUs, OTUs with a relative abundance <0.01%, and OTUs with a relative abundance <0.1%. Applying a relative abundance cut-off of 1% retained only 12 OTUs and was therefore deemed too strict.",

This finding was confirmed by real-time qPCR, where PCOS Tenericutes DNA content was more than two-fold lower in PCOS patients than in controls (p = 0.022) (Fig 4). This result became more significant after removing one outlier with very high Tenericutes counts in the control group (p = 0.003, data not shown). One unclassified genus from this phylum belonging to the order ML615J-28, was less abundant in PCOS patients (p = 0.026). An unclassified genus from the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family S24-7 was also less abundant in PCOS patients (p = 0.039). While bacteria from these taxa were present at a low relative abundance in a number of control samples, they were undetectable in most PCOS samples. Bacteria from the phylum Tenericutes were detected with 10 or more reads in 11/19 (58%) of controls and 1/24 (4%) of PCOS patients. S24-7 were detected with 10 or more reads in 9/19 (47%) of control samples and 1/24 (4%) of PCOS samples and ML615J-28 in 5/19 (26%) of control samples and 0/24 (0%) of PCOS samples. Negative controls did not contain sequences from any of the taxa that were found to be differentially abundant in PCOS patients and controls (S3 Table).",

A reduction in stool bacterial diversity of up to 30% has previously been reported in individuals with obesity and metabolic dysfunction [10,35]. Recent meta-analyses have concluded that there is a significant, yet very modest, decrease in alpha diversity in obesity, while differences in community composition and specific taxa are highly study-dependent and do not show a statistically significant overarching pattern [12,36]. In patients with type 2 diabetes, a reduction of putatively beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria has been reported, while alpha diversity was found to be unchanged [37\u201339]. We did not observe significant differences in alpha diversity, UniFrac distance matrices, or taxa relative abundances due to body mass index or insulin sensitivity in our study. This may have been due to the small sample size of our cohort, as well as the pilot design, which was not conceived to test the association between the gut microbiome and obesity or insulin resistance. The significant changes that we did observe may result from another variable specific to PCOS or, more likely, from a combination of variables which may include BMI and insulin resistance.",

Lim et al. found higher diversity and an enrichment of bacteria from the phylum Tenericutes in healthy individuals compared to metabolic syndrome patients [14]. Interestingly, Tenericutes were identified as a significantly heritable taxon among the healthy group. In another study of microbiome heritability, the order ML615J-28 was identified as part of a heritable bacterial cluster associated with leanness in humans [14,15]. In another study, the relative abundance of bacteria from the family S24-7 was decreased in mice receiving a high-fat diet and increased after exercise [40]. We conclude that although the PCOS patients in our study had a relatively mild metabolic phenotype with only slightly higher indices of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia than the control group and no significant difference in BMI, these disturbances may nevertheless be reflected in the gut microbiome of these patients. Furthermore, as both PCOS and the gut microbiome appear to have some degree of heritability, these mechanisms may be linked. Hypothetically, the same genetic factors predisposing to PCOS may also promote the establishment of a metabolically adverse gut microbiome, which would further drive the PCOS phenotype.",

The median total testosterone and DHEAS levels were well below the defined cut-offs in the majority of patients. This resulted in 42% of patients with the Rotterdam phenotype D (OA and PCOM), which is greater than previously published data from larger PCOS cohorts and may therefore not be an accurate representation of the general PCOS population [41]. The phenotype D has been reported to have less reproductive dysfunction and metabolic risk than the remaining phenotypes [41]. Therefore, the high prevalence of this \u201cmild\u201d phenotype may have attenuated some microbiome changes that are present in the more symptomatic phenotypes.

While there are currently no general recommendations for sample sizes in microbiome studies, it has been estimated that an \u201cn\u201d of 20 per group allows for the detection of differences with effect sizes of 0.008 in unweighted and 0.04 in weighted pairwise distances with 90% power [42]. While our sample size was appropriate for unweighted UniFrac analysis, the study was underpowered to detect small effects in weighted UniFrac analysis, and likely also in taxa comparisons. Conversely, the effects due to the gut microbiome in our mildly affected cohort may be too small to be detected even in a larger sample of the same phenotypes. We therefore hypothesize that more pronounced microbiome changes will be observed when investigating a larger cohort including more severe PCOS phenotypes with obesity (BMI>30) and manifest type 2 diabetes, as well as more pronounced hyperandrogenemia. We cannot exclude that the observed microbiome changes are the result of biological changes due to aging, as controls were significantly older than PCOS patients and age was associated with phylogenetic diversity and the relative abundance of the three significant taxa. However, as both groups were premenopausal and the difference in the median ages was only five years, we argue that any age effect would be much weaker than effects due to PCOS or other factors. It has been reported that PCOS symptoms can be more pronounced in young patients and attenuated with age [43]. We therefore hypothesize that there is a gradient of gut dysbiosis in PCOS, with younger, more symptomatic patients showing greater microbiome changes.",

As the included negative controls did not contain any sequences belonging to these taxa, they are likely not the result of a contamination. That such rare taxa can have a biologically significant impact on the host is unlikely, but not impossible. For example, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are found in very low abundance or not at all in mouse feces, but are highly abundant in the small intestinal mucosa and play a crucial role in early-life immune system maturation [44]. In humans, an age-related decline in stool SFB abundance has been observed and SFB are rarely detected in adult stool [45]. If some of the taxa which were reduced in our PCOS patients are heritable, as was suggested recently for ML615J-28 and Tenericutes, they may regulate hormonal and metabolic development in the small or proximal large intestine in early life up to puberty and decline in abundance thereafter [14,15].",

Zonulin is a regulator of tight junction function in humans and serum levels correlate with in vivo gut permeability assessed by lactulose/mannitol test [46]. The serum zonulin increase observed in our study is in accordance with recent studies in PCOS patients and obese individuals, where serum zonulin was correlated with measures of insulin resistance and fecal bacterial colony count [21,47]. Serum endotoxin and hsCRP did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Zonulin, calprotectin, LPS, and blood lymphocytes were associated with gut microbiome parameters, indicating support for the gut barrier-endotoxemia-inflammation mechanism hypothesized by Tremellen and Pearce and previously shown in mice by Cani et al. [16\u201318]. However, this study does not provide enough evidence to make the claim that this process is driving PCOS symptoms. Similar to the gut microbiome, gut barrier changes may become more pronounced in specific PCOS phenotypes, such as those meeting all three Rotterdam criteria or with more pronounced insulin resistance and/or obesity.",

Weaknesses of the study include the small sample size, which precluded stratification of PCOS patients based on diagnostic criteria or metabolic parameters, the high prevalence of PCOS patients with a mild phenotype, and the assessment of gut barrier function using surrogate parameters rather than an in vivo lactulose-mannitol test. Despite these shortcomings, the study achieved its aim of providing a first descriptive look into the gut microbiome-gut barrier axis in PCOS and a knowledge base for future studies.",
