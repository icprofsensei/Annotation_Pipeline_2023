It is noteworthy, that BMI alone may not account for high-zonulin levels indicating low gut barrier integrity. This was also underlined by the fact that the high- and low-zonulin groups were not different with regard to BMI and BMI showed only a modest correlation with serum zonulin levels (r\u2009=\u20090.235, p\u2009=\u20090.017). As BMI is not a sensitive measure of obesity, it is of note that we found significant differences of waist circumference between the high and low-zonulin group (p\u2009=\u20090.017) and the high-third- and the low-third-zonulin group (p\u2009=\u20090.048). Adding to this, there was a significant correlation\u00a0between waist circumference and serum zonulin (r\u2009=\u20090.263, p\u2009=\u20090.007) confirming the results of a former study by Ohlsson which has shown impaired gut barrier in obese patients and a significant correlation between zonulin and\u00a0waist circumference [29].",

Faecalibacteria are gram-negative SCFA producing Firmicutes, which have anti-inflammatory properties [35]. Faecalibacteria also display remarkably low abundances in diseases affecting internal and external barrier function, for example Crohn\u2019s disease [36] and atopic dermatitis [37]. Therefore, low counts of Faecalibacteria could weaken the gut lining leading to inflammatory responses. Odoribacter and Rikenallaceae were predominantly abundant in the low-third-zonulin group. Odoribacter are also known for their SCFA (butyrate-) production [38]. An increase in taxa within Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcaceae and Rikenellaceae has been described in colonization resistance against Clostridium difficile in patients [39]. In general, those butyrate-producing bacteria are as well reduced in inflammatory bowel disease compared to healthy individuals [40\u201342]. This suggests that butyrate has a strengthening effect on the gut barrier, which was also demonstrated in experimental studies [43, 44] and highlights the important role of butyrate to prevent inflammation [45]. Therefore, the total amount of butyrate produced by gut bacteria seems to be of more importance than the abundance of bacterial species, families and phyla [46, 47].",

To our knowledge, no clinical study has yet investigated the impact of diet on intestinal permeability in different BMI groups including AN patients and a group of athletes. The high-zonulin group consumed significantly more calories, protein and fat, while the groups did not differ in total grams of food eaten but differed in total caloric intake. Mokkala et al., who investigated serum zonulin concentrations in overweight women in early pregnancy, detected a negative correlation\u00a0between serum zonulin and protein intake [7] and suggested that proteins may have a positive impact on intestinal barrier function. On the contrary, the high-zonulin group in our study reported a significantly higher protein and vitamin B12 intake compared to the low-zonulin group. Dietary protein components are known to cause significant changes in metabolites of gut bacteria such as SCFAs, ammonia, hydrogen, sulfide and methane. These metabolites may act as cytotoxic agents and have been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer [48]. Hence, low-protein diets are often recommended to these patients, because a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates has been shown to increase the risk of diseases by inducing the growth of pathogens and protein-fermenting bacteria. Summarized, by affecting the gut barrier, a diet-induced dysbiosis may, therefore, stimulate immune-mediated inflammation [48]. In an interventional study with a Nordic diet zonulin levels in serum tended to correlate positively with energy percentage of protein and inversely with energy percentage of carbohydrates [29]. They concluded, that higher protein content in food may trigger inflammation.",

In our study, serum zonulin correlated with carbohydrate intake, however, there was no correlation\u00a0between zonulin and fibre intake. Further, the total fibre intake did not differ significantly between the high and low-zonulin group. It is of note that the general fibre consumption in Austria is low and the recommended daily amount of 30\u00a0g fibre per day is not commonly reached [49]. Due to this, fibre intake might not have reached significance between the high and the low-zonulin group. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies have shown that a diet high in fibre is associated with lower inflammation [50]. Therefore, more interventional studies are needed\u00a0to investigate zonulin and fibre intake.",

This could be due to the presence of vitamin B12 in protein-rich food such as eggs, dairy products, meat and fish. Among others, LeFse analysis identified Ruminococcaceae as a differentially abundant feature between the high and the low vitamin B12 group. Vitamin B12 was significantly higher in the high-zonulin group. Ruminococcaceae were more abundant in the low-zonulin group and low vitamin B12 group. As for the chain of events, it might be reasonable, that vitamin B12 intake might increase zonulin levels through changing total abundances of Ruminococcaceae. However, as this was a cross-sectional study, longitudinal dietary intervention studies are needed to shed light on this hypothesized chain of events.",

Hence, the individual\u2019s menstrual cycle and the estrogen levels may have had an influence on gut microbiota and subsequently on zonulin levels. Third, we only included women in our study. To our best knowledge, there are no differences of serum zonulin between men and women [2, 60].
