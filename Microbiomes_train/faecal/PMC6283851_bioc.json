Several compelling examples have emerged providing insight into the relationship between human-associated microbiota and cancer treatment. The bacterium Mycoplasma hyorhinis and species of Proteobacteria, when present within a tumor, may metabolize the chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine, into a deaminated inactive metabolite [2], resulting in drug resistance [3]. \u03b2-glucuronidases produced by bacterial species in the GI tract can reactivate the excreted, inactive metabolite of the topoisomerase I inhibitor, irinotecan, causing adverse drug toxicities, including severe diarrhea [4]. Likewise, although the mechanism is not fully understood, there is emerging evidence that the GI microbiota can influence the efficacy of immunotherapy [5\u201311].",

Eradication of the commensal intestinal flora by antibiotic treatment or via use of germ-free mice eliminates therapeutic efficacy of these agents in different tumor models. A study in a melanoma model showed that the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy could be bolstered by feeding animals a strain of Bifidobacterium\u2014a species commonly used in probiotic supplements\u2014prior to initiating therapy [8]. Three recent human studies, two in melanoma patients [9, 11] and one in patients with epithelial tumors [10], reported that the presence of certain types of bacteria including Ruminococcaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, and Akkermansia muciniphila are associated with response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Fecal microbial transplant from human donors that were responders to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy into germ-free mouse allograft tumor models conferred antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy versus fecal samples transplanted from non-responders [9\u201311]. Collectively, these studies indicate that members of the intestinal microbiome may be essential for cancer drug efficacy and that modulating intestinal microbiome composition may enhance therapeutic response.",

There is, however, compelling evidence that the GI microbiome is involved in multiple-related processes such as modulation of circulating hormone levels [12, 13], stimulation of antitumor immune responses [5, 6, 8], and induction of treatment-related toxicities (including immunotherapy-induced colitis [14] and radiation-induced bowel toxicity [15]), and/or morbidities including development of metabolic syndrome [16, 17]. Animal studies suggest that the GI microbiota may also be affected by circulating androgen levels [12, 13] and castration [16]. We hypothesize that hormonal therapy, particularly oral formulations of androgen axis-targeted drugs, used in the treatment of prostate cancer may promote changes in the GI microbiota. In this exploratory study, we determined compositional differences in GI microbiota in (1) men with and without prostate cancer and (2) men with localized prostate cancer, biochemical recurrence after primary treatment, and hormone-sensitive or castration-resistant metastatic disease. We also examined the relationship between GI microbiota composition and androgen deprivation therapies, with a focus on orally administered androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies (ATT).",

Patients who were currently taking an antibiotic were excluded. Patients designated as \u201ccontrols\u201d were being followed in the Urology clinic primarily for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Importantly, since the control patients did not undergo prostate biopsy, they cannot be definitively defined as cancer free. Men categorized as \u201cbenign\u201d were being evaluated for suspicion of prostate cancer, but subsequently had a negative biopsy. For the benign group, the rectal swab was collected at the evaluation clinic visit, which was prior to the patient taking prophylactic antibiotics for the biopsy. For the seven men in the \u201ccancer\u201d group, three had swabs taken 1\u20132 months prior to their diagnostic biopsy, one had their swab taken 1 month after diagnostic biopsy, and three men had swabs taken >6 months after prior biopsy. For the purposes of our medication analyses, the designation \u201cNoMeds\u201d indicated men who were not undergoing androgen derivation therapy (ADT), \u201cGNRH\u201d were men only being treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH) agonist/antagonist, and \u201coral ATT\u201d were men being treated with oral androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies.",

Interestingly, a screen of more than 1000 marketed non-antibiotic drugs against 40 representative GI bacterial strains found that nearly a quarter inhibited bacterial growth [21]. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy have been shown to induce dysbiosis (a pathogenic microbial imbalance) of the GI microbiota in rodent models [7, 22]. The most mature data involving longitudinal studies are in patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma undergoing bone marrow transplant conditioning chemotherapy, which induced pathogenic shifts in the GI microbiota that were associated with treatment toxicities [23, 24]. A study in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy demonstrated direct bacteriostatic effect of chemotherapeutics, as well as outgrowth of pathogenic enterococci that could not be fully explained by concurrent use of antibiotics [25]. Compositional changes to the GI microbiota induced by chemotherapy or immunotherapy could conceivably impact factors such as the local inflammatory environment in the intestinal tract, systemic inflammatory effects, and/or the efficacy of any subsequently administered cancer therapies.",

Altering the gastrointestinal flora in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes impacted testosterone levels, as well as the development of type 1 diabetes [12]. In another study, mice consuming a diet rich in the commonly used probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri had a reduced systemic inflammatory state through reduction of IL-17, and an increase in serum testosterone levels [31]. On the converse, the microbiome can also be affected by hormone levels, as another mouse study showed that castrating mice induced alterations in GI microbiota composition, and subsequent development of abdominal obesity [16]. Intriguingly, this study by Harada et al. implies that the GI microbiota may mediate several of the side effects associated with ADT, including obesity and the metabolic syndrome. In our study, we found that men taking oral ATT had a different GI microbiota composition than men taking GNRH agonists/antagonists alone or men not undergoing ADT. Functional pathway inference of the species present in the fecal microbiota of men taking oral ATT indicated an intriguing possibility that the species capable of steroid/hormone biosynthesis are more abundant in the GI flora when men are taking these oral medications (Table\u00a03). This finding, if confirmed, could have important implications and perhaps represent a mechanism for potential alternative pathways for production of steroid metabolites that could influence treatment response to oral ATT. Critical follow-up studies will correlate the presence of GI bacterial species capable of steroid/hormone biosynthesis to circulating hormone levels.",

Important follow-up studies will include samples collected prior to start of therapy and then longitudinally after therapy initiation. Such studies will further strengthen our hypothesis that ATT is responsible for the compositional differences that we observed, as opposed to other factors that can influence the composition of the GI microbiome such as diet or stress levels. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in GI microbiota alpha diversity in patients with prostate cancer that was independent of medication status. Decreased diversity in GI microbiota has been reported as a risk factor for several other types of disease as well as \u201cWestern\u201d lifestyle [33]. Our results should be taken with caution, however, as many of the men with prostate cancer in this study had undergone prior treatments that could have conceivably influenced the diversity of the GI microbiota. Our results prompt further examination of GI microbiota diversity as a risk factor for prostate cancer in larger patient cohorts.",

We hypothesize that these compositional differences may influence treatment response to oral ATT or to subsequent treatments such as immunotherapy. Future longitudinal studies pre-, during, and post-therapy are warranted to confirm the degree to which the GI microbiota are altered and to assess whether these alterations are correlated to prostate cancer treatment responses. Collectively, these studies could determine whether the GI microbiome is both essential for therapeutic efficacy and whether it could serve as a target that could be modulated to enhance treatment response.",
