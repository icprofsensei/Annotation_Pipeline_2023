After trimming off both primer sequences, the reads were then sorted and grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the UCLUST algorithm (http://www.drive5.com/) with a sequence identity threshold of 96%. Taxonomic assignments of each OTU were made by similarity searching against the publically available 16S (RDP ver. 10.27 and CORE update 2 September 2012) and the NCBI genome database using the GLSEARCH program. In both unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance analyses, phylogenic tree-based metrics was used to measure differences in the overall bacterial diversity and composition of the samples.12 The estimation of the OTU numbers by extrapolation using Chao 1 was calculated with the vegan package (v2.0-5) for the R software program(v2.15.2). All the filter-passed reads of the 16S V1\u2013V2 sequences analyzed in the present study were deposited in the DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL database with accession numbers DRA 002611, 002617, and 002618.",

After removing low-quality and possibly chimera reads, 1,237,315 high-quality 16S reads were ultimately generated from 135 microbiota samples. Of them, 3,000 reads were randomly selected for each sample and used for the further analyses. The rarefaction curves, which plots the OTU number as a function of the read number, showed that the contours of the three microbiota almost overlapped, suggesting no difference in the degree of bacterial species richness among them (Figure 1a). The species richness (alpha diversity) of the samples was also evaluated using the observed OTU number and the estimated OTU numbers by the Chao 1 index (Figure 1b). These analyses demonstrated no significant differences in the species richness among the salivary, GF, or fecal samples. On the other hand, the log CFU bacterial count (mean\u00b1s.d., median) quantified by qPCR was 8.70\u00b10.25, 8.69/ml; 7.75\u00b10.57, 7.79/ml; and 10.56\u00b10.26, 10.46/mg in the saliva, GF, and feces, respectively, when examined in 10 randomly selected subjects (Supplementary Figure S1 online). These results suggested that the luminal microbiota in the oral cavity, stomach, and colon consisted of a similar number of species, although the bacterial cell number varied by ~1,000 times with the following order, GF<saliva<feces.",

In the comparison between those two groups, the mean age of the subjects was significantly higher in PPI-users compared with that in PPI-nonusers. The pH value of the saliva was moderately higher in the former compared with that in the latter. In the GF, the pH value was significantly higher in PPI-users than in PPI-nonusers, which indicated that gastric acid secretion was significantly inhibited in PPI-users. The log bacterial count obtained using culturing methods was also significantly higher in PPI-users compared with that in PPI-nonusers. A significant correlation was observed between the pH value and the cultured bacterial count in all the GF samples (Figure 6), thus indicating that the increase in the bacterial count in PPI-users could be due to low gastric acidity. On the other hand, the average log copy number of the bacterial cells in the GF (/ml) measured by qPCR was nearly the same between PPI-users (8.0\u00b10.8) and PPI-nonusers (8.1\u00b10.8), although qPCR cannot distinguish between live and dead bacteria (Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore, the discrepancy in the estimated bacterial quantity in the GF microbiota of PPI-nonusers using culturing and qPCR methods (mean, 4.4 vs. 8.1, respectively) may be explained by the inability of culturing method to detect dead or metabolically inactive bacteria in highly acidic GF.",

On the other hand, the bacterial count estimated by the qPCR method varied from 10 to 1,000 times among these microbiota. These findings suggested that the overall species richness is highly similar among the three microbiota irrespective of their different habitats, whereas the total bacterial count was sensitive to different environmental factors including pH, oxygen concentration, and nutrient availability.

Both studies identified two major abundant genera, Streptococcus and Prevotella, which accounted for ~40% of the total detected species. The present study on the luminal microbiota also detected these two species as the top two genera, accounting for ~50% of the total species in the stomach. Neisseria and Rothia, which were detected as the third major genera in the previous studies, were also ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, in the present study. This similarity of the bacterial composition between the two intragastric compartments, luminal and mucosa-associated, suggested a \u201ctwo-way interaction\u201d in which the luminal bacteria not only colonize the mucosa but also the mucosal bacteria flow back into the lumen. H. pylori is also thought to inhabit the stomach in this two-way manner, although it typically colonizes the mucosa, including gastric epithelial cells, and the surface mucous layer.16 In fact, H. pylori was identified as the dominant bacterial species in the gastric mucosal specimens from H. pylori-infected patients,17 whereas the present study revealed H. pylori to be a minor bacterium in the GF samples.",

The relationship between changes in the pH value and bacterial count using the culturing method in the GF reported by Ruddell et al.1 was similar to our findings. That is, at pH 5.0, the bacterial count was 106\u2013107 CFU/ml in both the previous and present studies, indicating the consistency of our culturing method. It has been reported that GF with pH<4 has a bactericidal property, whereas GF pH>4 enables bacterial residence in the stomach.18, 19 As the GF pH ranged >4 in PPI-users (see Table 1), many of transient bacteria from the oral cavity may have survived, even in the stomach. Because both the bacterial count by qPCR and the bacterial composition were nearly identical between PPI-users and PPI-nonusers, a marked increase in the number of gastric bacteria demonstrated by the culturing method in PPI-users may be due to a lack of killing rather than proliferation of the bacteria in the stomach. These results thus suggested that the inflow of metabolically active gastric microbiota, many of which transferred from the oral cavity, into the colon may significantly affect the intestinal microbial community in PPI-users. The relevance of PPI administration to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth remains uncertain in the present study, because no specific examination was performed to identify small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in the present study.",

Amir et al.20 also reported that the unweighted UniFrac analysis demonstrated an increase in the beta diversity of the GF microbiota of the subjects who were treated with PPI for 8 weeks. The pH value is known to be higher in the feces comapred with that in the GF. Furthermore, the beta diversity of the fecal microbiota was also significantly higher compared with that of the GF microbiota in our study. It is interesting that an elevation of the pH in the GF by PPI treatment was associated with an increase in the beta diversity of the GF microbiota in the present study, although the biological significance remains unclear. Considering that the pH value-associated increase in the beta diversity by PPI treatment was also observed in the salivary microbiota in our study, a change in the beta diversity of the GF microbiota may be caused by such a change in the salivary microbiota and/or an elevated pH in the GF. It is also possible that PPI may directly affect the microbiota through targeting the proton pump of certain bacteria that contain P-type ATPase.21",

The reduced abundance of Faecalibacterium was also reported in the feces of dogs administered PPI for 15 days.22\nFaecalibacterium is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties and is depleted during episodes of inflammatory bowel diseases.23, 24 It is thus interesting that lansoprazole, one of the representative PPI, is reported to be associated with collagenous colitis, a chronic inflammatory illness of the colon.25 Seto et al.26 treated healthy volunteers with PPI for 28 days and examined the change in the fecal microbiota. Although no reduction in the abundance of Faecalibacterium was observed in their study, a significant decrease in the OTU number was found in the fecal microbiota. On the other hand, no such decrease of the alpha diversity in the fecal microbiota was found in PPI-users compared with PPI-nonusers in our study. Taken together, the influence of PPI administration on the fecal as well as gastric luminal microbiota appears to be controversial and requires further investigation.",
