Since most attention has been focused on bacteria present in feces, knowledge about the mucosa-associated bacterial communities in different parts of the colon is limited. In this study, the bacterial communities in feces and biopsy samples from the ascending, transverse, and descending colons of 10 individuals were analyzed by using a 16S rRNA approach. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that 105 to 106 bacteria were present in the biopsy samples. To visualize the diversity of the predominant and the Lactobacillus group community, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed. DGGE analysis and similarity index comparisons demonstrated that the predominant mucosa-associated bacterial community was host specific and uniformly distributed along the colon but significantly different from the fecal community (P < 0.01). The Lactobacillus group-specific profiles were less complex than the profiles reflecting the predominant community. For 6 of the 10 individuals the community of Lactobacillus-like bacteria in the biopsy samples was similar to that in the feces. Amplicons having 99% sequence similarity to the 16S ribosomal DNA of Lactobacillus gasseri were detected in the biopsy samples of nine individuals. No significant differences were observed between healthy and diseased individuals. The observed host-specific DGGE profiles of the mucosa-associated bacterial community in the colon support the hypothesis that host-related factors are involved in the determination of the GI tract microbial community.",

These bacteria have an important metabolic and protective function in the GI tract (23). The complex interactions between the host and the bacterial community are of considerable importance but are just starting to be understood (3, 9, 10). Most of the knowledge about bacterial diversity in the human GI tract has been obtained by selective cultivation of microbes from fecal samples. Recently, culture-independent approaches using the sequence variability of the 16S rRNA genes have shown that most of the predominant bacteria in human fecal samples have not been obtained in culture yet, which indicates that our knowledge of these predominant members is very limited (22, 26, 28). In addition, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) analyses of fecal 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and rRNA amplicons have shown to be powerful approaches in determining and monitoring the bacterial community in feces (28, 29). Such studies revealed that the predominant bacterial community in mammalian feces is stable in time, host specific, affected by ageing, and not altered after consumption of certain probiotic strains (11, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29). Furthermore, DGGE has been used to compare bacterial communities in fecal samples from infants with and without necrotizing enterocolitis, although no differences associated with this disease were observed (17).",

Most of these analyses with contents from sudden-death victims (15) or with biopsy samples from living individuals involved a culturing approach and focused on the attachment of certain probiotic strains (1, 2, 12), the presence of sulfate reducers (5, 27), and/or on bacterial population levels in diseased persons (6). Since biopsy samples are very small in size and therefore more easily exposed to oxygen during sampling, the number of viable strict anaerobes might be reduced easily. Not surprisingly, relatively high levels of facultative anaerobes were reported to be present in intestinal biopsy samples. So far, there have been no studies in which the bacterial composition of biopsy samples has been analyzed at the species level. Molecular approaches based on the sequence variability of 16S rRNA genes could be instrumental in analyzing the composition of bacterial communities in intestinal biopsy samples. Recently, such an approach was used to study the bacterial diversity within the human subgingival crevice (13). In another recent study, temporal TGGE analysis of 16S rDNA fragments was successfully used to compare the bacterial compositions in gastric biopsy samples and showed that Helicobacter is detectable in samples from healthy individuals and those suffering from gastritis (18). In addition, Marteau and colleagues reported significant differences in community structure between samples from feces and contents from the cecum by using culturing techniques and dot blot hybridization (16).",

We used DGGE approaches to characterize the 16S rDNA sequence variability of the predominant bacterial composition and that of the Lactobacillus-like species with general and specific PCR primers (8, 28). We focused on lactobacilli as a subgroup because of their potential probiotic effects in the human GI tract. The compositional variability in feces and colonic biopsy samples from the ascending, transverse, and descending colons of 10 volunteers was studied.",

First, the complete 16S rDNA was amplified with the canonical primers Bact-0011f and Bact-1492r (14). After purification with the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), the Lactobacillus group-specific PCR was performed with primers Bact-0124-GCf and Lab-0677r followed by DGGE analysis on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing a urea-formamide gradient from 30 to 60% (8). For cloning and sequence analysis, the Lactobacillus group amplicons were purified, cloned, and sequenced as described previously (8).",

Since the bacteria were released from the biopsy material by a mild treatment and since it is difficult to determine how many cells were still attached after sonication, the total count of bacteria was determined as the minimal number per biopsy sample. PI-stained bacterial cells could be accurately counted when beads with known concentration were added, as illustrated in Fig. \u200bFig.1.1. The different biopsy samples revealed bacterial quantities that varied between 8.6 \u00d7 104 and 6.9 \u00d7 106 cells depending on the location in the colon and the individual (Table \u200b(Table1),1), with a mean count of 1.1 \u00d7 106 bacteria per sample. The detection limit for accurate counting was found to be 3.7 \u00d7 104 (\u00b1 standard deviation [SD] of 1.4 \u00d7 104) cells per sample. The numbers of bacteria in specimens from the ascending colon seem to be slightly lower than from the other locations, although no significant differences in bacterial numbers at these locations (the lowest P2-tail was 0.075) were found by paired t test analyses.",

Amplicons were detected in all samples with the exception of the biopsy samples from the ascending and transverse colon of individual 7. DGGE analysis of the fecal and biopsy samples showed an enormous difference in the diversity of the amplicons in the profiles from the different individuals (as illustrated in Fig. \u200bFig.2).2). Dilution of biopsy specimen DNA (10 times) did not result in a change in the profile, indicating that the number of cells per biopsy sample was sufficient to obtain reliable and reproducible DGGE profiles. Remarkably, the predominant community in biopsy samples from all locations in the colon gave very similar profiles in each individual, despite the difference in diversity and diagnosed illness of the individuals (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). In contrast, the fecal profiles were in most cases different from those obtained with the biopsy samples, indicating that it is very unlikely that fecal contamination took place during the colonoscopy. Since the biopsy samples were taken after evacuation of the colon it is very plausible that the bacteria detected in these specimens are mucosa-associated and therefore in close contact with the host cells.",

It was observed that within comparisons between a fecal sample and one of the biopsy samples the individual variation was relatively high compared to the comparisons between different biopsy samples from the same individual. For example, the similarity indices for comparisons between feces and descending colon biopsy specimens varied from 13.6 to 91.3, while similarity indices between 81.6 and 98.1 were found when descending colon biopsy specimens were compared to ascending colon specimens (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Overall, indices for the similarity indices of comparisons between all biopsy samples from the same individual were very high (91.6 \u00b1 9.6 [SD]), close to those calculated for the reproducibility of the procedures (93.4 \u00b1 3.6). To rule out that the diagnosed illness of some of the individuals had an influence on the observed findings, the mean and standard variation of each similarity index within the healthy individuals and those with diagnosed illness were compared separately. Student's t test revealed that there was no significant difference between the similarity indices of both groups for each comparison, since the lowest P2-tail observed was 0.065 (7 df) for the similarity indices for comparison between ascending and transverse colonic biopsy samples.",

In contrast to the DGGE profiles of the predominant bacterial community, the Lactobacillus group-specific profiles were lower in diversity, as illustrated in Fig. \u200bFig.4.4. Because of this low diversity, similarity indices for the DGGE profiles cannot be determined. In contrast to the predominant bacterial community, the Lactobacillus communities in fecal and biopsy samples were very similar in 6 of the 10 individuals. In these individuals, only one amplicon was dominating (see, for example, the data for individuals 1 and 5 in Fig. \u200bFig.4).4). In the other individuals one of the fecal amplicons was the only predominant one in the biopsy samples or vice versa (such as for individual 10 in Fig. \u200bFig.4).4). Furthermore, for 3 of the 10 individuals some minor differences in the Lactobacillus group compositions between the biopsy samples were found. These small differences could not be explained by the physiological condition, age, or gender of the host since they were found in individuals 2 (healthy), 8 (remission of ulcerative colitis), and 10 (healthy).",

The descending colon was chosen, since all diagnosed illnesses were observed at least in this part. The profiles of the predominant bacterial community appeared to be unique for each individual, and no specific amplicon could be assigned to the presence or absence of a colonic illness (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5A).5A). To analyze the predominant communities, similarity indices of the comparisons between the DGGE profiles were calculated. Repetitive comparisons between the UPGMA, Ward, and neighbor-joining algorithms were performed, and dendrograms were constructed. Only two clusters were found in all dendrograms, while the position of the others branches in the dendrogram changed depending on the clustering method. The large error bars of the nodes in the UPGMA tree (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5B)5B) could be seen as an indication that the corresponding branches of these nodes may vary between the different algorithms. One of the repetitive clusters consisted of four healthy individuals (i.e., individuals 1, 2, 6, and 7), and the other consisted of the two individuals diagnosed with an active form of a GI tract disorder (i.e., individuals 3 and 5). This preliminary observation suggests that there might be differences in the predominant bacterial composition between healthy and diseased individuals, although the group of individuals in this study is too small to allow a definite conclusion.",

Since it appeared to be a Lactobacillus gasseri-like species (see below), we tested whether its predominance might be a result of preferential amplification. Our nested-PCR approach did not show any preference in favor of L. gasseri when mixtures of its DNA with that from Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei were used as template DNA for PCR. Cloning and sequence analysis of the amplicons from the DGGE profiles of individual 1 (healthy) and individual 3 (with polyposis) showed that both sequences had 99% similarity with L. gasseri. Alignment of the two sequences showed that they differ by only one base (adenine in one and thymine in the other). This indicates that L. gasseri is likely to be a predominant Lactobacillus species in the biopsy samples.",

Fecal and biopsy samples were taken from people with and without a diagnosed illness. Since the colon was evacuated before biopsies were performed, it is very likely that the bacteria in the biopsy samples are mucosa associated. The minimum number of cells per biopsy sample as measured by flow cytometry is comparable to numbers found by cultivation of bacteria from biopsy samples which were obtained by a similar procedure (1). Considerable variation was found in the bacterial numbers from different biopsy samples. Factors that may cause this variation include the evacuation and sampling procedures, the sonication procedure, and individual differences. On the other hand, this variation in bacterial number may explain why no PCR product could be obtained from two biopsy samples.",

The DGGE profiles reflecting the predominant bacterial communities in biopsy samples from different locations in the GI tract were highly similar to each other, while they differed significantly from those of fecal samples (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3).3). Therefore, it seems that the mucosa-associated bacteria are equally distributed along the complete colon and that different populations are dominating in the mucosa and the feces. Recently, differences in the structures of communities in feces and cecal contents, observed through a dot blot hybridization and culturing approach, have been reported (16). Culture-dependent studies of contents from different parts of the colon (including the ascending, transverse, and descending parts) of sudden-death victims have revealed that the conditions, for example, pH and concentration of fermentation products, in these parts differ considerably from one another (15). This suggests that the uniform distribution of the attaching bacterial composition along the colon is very likely due to host-bacterium interactions at the mucosa. Several studies have already suggested that the bacterial community in the GI tract has a strong effect on the host and that signaling between host and bacterium is very important (3, 9, 10). In a recent study, a significant positive relationship between the genetic relatedness of the hosts and the similarity between their bacterial communities was found (29). However, it is not clear yet what the nature of these host-related factors is.",

In contrast to those of the predominant community, the profiles of biopsy and fecal samples were quite similar for 6 of the 10 individuals. Furthermore, for 3 of the 10 individuals some minor differences between the biopsy samples were found in the Lactobacillus group composition. This suggests that the changing conditions in the GI tract influence the presence or absence of certain species belonging to the Lactobacillus group. Another explanation could be the detection limit of these bacteria in the biopsy specimens. Since we are focusing on a subpopulation in a community which contains approximately 106 bacteria, a small difference in the number of organisms of a certain species might have a large impact on its detection. Remarkably, one amplicon with the highest sequence similarity (99%) to L. gasseri was found in descending colon biopsy samples of 9 of the 10 individuals. Moreover, it was the most predominant one in most biopsy specimens. Since the 16S rDNA of this species was not preferentially amplified by the nested-PCR approach, L. gasseri may be regarded as a general mucosa-associated bacterium in humans.",

No significant difference could be detected with respect to the number of bacteria per biopsy specimen, the composition of the predominant bacterial community, and that of the Lactobacillus group community. This is supported by the observation that the profiles reflecting the predominant community were highly similar along the complete colon for both groups. Lactobacilli were detected in both feces and biopsy samples from all individuals, and no differences in the Lactobacillus group populations between healthy and diseased tissues were found.",

A strikingly high similarity between bacterial communities from different locations in the colon was observed. This observation suggests strongly that host-related factors are important in the colonic ecosystem, which is in line with previous observations (3, 9, 10, 29). A culture-independent approach was also used to characterized subpopulations of the Lactobacillus genus. Similar approaches using group-specific primers can also be applied to study (sub)populations of other bacteria such as those implicated in the initiation and maintenance of ulcerative colitis (4, 5, 27). Hence, systematic culture-independent approaches could be instrumental in determining the roles of various GI tract subpopulations in the pathogenesis of colonic diseases.",
