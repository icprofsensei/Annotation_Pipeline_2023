Fecal DNA is the primary source for the majority of human gut microbiome studies. However, further improvement is needed to obtain fecal metagenomic DNA with sufficient amount and good quality but low host genomic DNA contamination. In the current study, we demonstrate a quick, robust, unbiased, and cost-effective method for the isolation of high molecular weight (>23\u00a0kb) metagenomic DNA (260/280 ratio >1.8) with a good yield (55.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8\u00a0ng/mg of feces). We also confirm that there is very low human genomic DNA contamination (eubacterial: human genomic DNA marker genes\u00a0=\u00a0227.9:1) in the human feces. The newly-developed method robustly performs for fresh as well as stored fecal samples as demonstrated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing using 454 FLX+. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene analysis indicated that compared to other DNA extraction methods tested, the fecal metagenomic DNA isolated with current methodology retains species richness and does not show microbial diversity biases, which is further confirmed by qPCR with a known quantity of spike-in genomes. Overall, our data highlight a protocol with a balance between quality, amount, user-friendliness, and cost effectiveness for its suitability toward usage for culture-independent analysis of the human gut microbiome, which provides a robust solution to overcome key issues associated with fecal metagenomic DNA isolation in human gut microbiome studies.",

Removal of fibers and undigested particles from feces is difficult, which in turn affects overall quality and quantity of metagenomic DNA being isolated [14], [15], [16]. Moreover, the presence of these impurities also compromises efficient lysis of microbial cells. Many microbes elude complete lysis, resulting in an uneven contribution of metagenomic DNA and eventually compromised microbial diversity [11], [17]. Additionally, human genomic DNA remnants in metagenomic DNA affect the metagenomic sequence data output, thereby increasing per base sequencing cost [6]. To overcome these challenges, many metagenomic DNA extraction protocols are being standardized, which include phenol/chloroform enzymatic lysis and freeze thaw [11], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. These kits have improved the quality of metagenomic DNA. However, great concerns remain pertaining to microbial diversity biasness and human genomic DNA contamination [12], [17], [20]. The cost per sample, amount of sample, and associated impurities are other issues which may be improved upon. In the current study, we intend to overcome these limitations and provide a faster, robust, and economical metagenomic DNA extraction method with a good quality and quantity.",

Notably, low yields of DNA were obtained using these methods in comparison to that using current method (Table 1). Gel electrophoresis analysis indicated poor DNA yield with method A, B, and D, while RNA contamination was observed in DNA isolated with method C (Figure2A). Similarly, spectrometric analysis showed a lower yield and compromised 260/280 ratios for DNA extracted using methods A\u2212D (Table 1). Moreover, these methods did not work well for extracting metagenomic DNA from one-month-old stored fecal sample (Table 1). We failed to extract metagenomic DNA from frozen feces using methods A\u2013C, while a low amount of DNA was recovered using method D. On the other hand, although with a reduced yield when compared to using fresh feces, more significant DNA with decent 260/280 ratio was recovered when using our method to extract DNA from frozen feces.

In general, lower Ct value indicates higher copy number of target gene, while higher Ct value means low copy number of target gene. A low Ct value of 6.780\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.231 was observed for eubacterial 16S, and of 34.740\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.374 for human-specific MUC5B using metagenomic DNA isolated with current method. Metagenomic DNA isolated with other methods showed varied Ct values: 19.310\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.185 (method A), 22.010\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.089 (method B), 28.130\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.821 (method C), and 11.780\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.295 (method D) for 16S gene, respectively, while Ct values of 32.690\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.332 (method A), 34.090\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.166 (method B), 28.270\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.426 (method C), and 32.630\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.647 (method D) were observed for human-specific MUC5B gene, respectively. Lower Ct values of other methods for human-specific MUC5B gene compared to our method indicated few human DNA remnants in the metagenomic DNA isolated with current protocol, reflecting superior representation of the eubacterial-specific metagenomic DNA in comparison to the limited presence of human genomic DNA in metagenomic DNA extracted with current methodology.",

We then estimated the species richness by normalizing the read counts with the sequence value (\u2212e) based on the minimum number of high quality sequencing reads for each sample, which is 6300 in the current study, and analyzed the total alpha diversity. Our results showed that despite fewer reads, more species were observed for DNA isolated using current method than using method A. An average number of 611 and 635 microbial species were observed in samples H1 and H2, respectively, which were isolated using the current method, in comparison to 515 and 496 microbial species from the same source feces with DNA isolated using method A (Table 2).
