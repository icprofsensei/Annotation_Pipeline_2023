Therefore, we sequenced the viromes (metagenomes) of virus-like particles isolated from fecal samples collected from adult female monozygotic twins and their mothers at three time points over a one-year period. These datasets were compared to datasets of sequenced bacterial 16S rRNA genes and total fecal community DNA. Co-twins and their mothers share a significantly greater degree of similarity in their fecal bacterial communities than do unrelated individuals. In contrast, viromes are unique to individuals regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. Despite remarkable interpersonal variations in viromes and their encoded functions, intrapersonal diversity is very low, with >95% of virotypes retained over the period surveyed, and with viromes dominated by a few temperate phage that exhibit remarkable genetic stability. These results indicate that a predatory viral-microbial dynamic, manifest in a number of other characterized environmental ecosystems, is notably absent in the very distal intestine.",

In many environments, the dominant ecological relationship between viruses and their microbial hosts is predatory and follows Lotka-Volterra (LV)/ Kill-the-Winner dynamics. LV is characterized by top-down control of microbial communities (i.e., microbial biomass is significantly below the carrying capacity of the habitat), rapid microbial and viral population shifts, and evidence of Red Queen co-evolution (i.e. escape strategies in prey population are countered by predator adaption). One manifestation of this arms race is positive selection on loci like bacterial O-antigens and CRISPR elements1,2, and viral tail fibers3. In contrast to this predator-prey dynamic, there is another viral life cycle where temperate rather than lytic viruses are longer term contributors to microbial host phenotypes through provision of adaptive genes. This latter dynamic can change the metabolic capacities of free living bacteria, obligate intracellular mutualists4, as well as the lifestyles of pathogens5. In fact, many of the differences between closely related microbial strains arise from prophage insertions6,7.",

In this report, we characterize the fecal viromes of four pairs of adult female monozygotic (MZ) twins and their mothers. All were healthy and none had received antibiotics in the 6-month period prior to sampling. Fecal samples were obtained at the beginning of the study, two months later (50\u00b19 days) and 1 year later (364\u00b110 days). VLPs were purified from 32 frozen fecal specimens. Since the yield of VLP DNA from 2\u20135 g of feces averaged 500 ng, we performed random amplification of the purified viromes to obtain sufficient material for shotgun 454 FLX pyrosequencing. After quality filtering, our final dataset contained 280,625,127 nt (Table S1). We verified the reproducibility of the protocol by sequencing replicates from 5 samples (Table S1; Methods). One additional sample was subjected to deeper sequencing (70,157,333 nt). Bacterial taxa represented in fecal samples were characterized by pyrosequencing of their 16S rRNA genes (Table S2). We had previously performed12 shotgun sequencing of total fecal DNA isolated from the 12 frozen samples obtained at the first time point that were now used to prepare purified VLPs (Table S3).",

However, most of the identifiable viruses in the 32 VLP-derived viromes were prophage or phage generally classified as temperate (Fig. 1). The Podoviridae illustrate this point: this family consists of both lytic and temperate members; in the fecal viral community its dominant representatives were temperate (e.g., coliphage P22-like). The predicted hosts of the identifiable phage and prophage were members of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (Fig. 1); these phyla, and in particular the families Ruminococaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidaceae, comprised the most abundant bacterial taxa in the sampled fecal microbial communities, as defined by 16S rRNA gene analysis (Fig. S2).",

Analysis of 16S rRNA datasets, where noise due to PCR and pyrosequencing artifacts and chimeras had been removed, indicated that there were ~800 species-level bacterial phylotypes in the first time point fecal communities14. Recent results obtained from deep shotgun sequencing of other fecal microbiomes suggest that the number may be <200 species15. Thus, the ratio of virotype to bacterial phylotype in the fecal microbiota of these healthy adults appears to approach 1.",

The second approach was based on contig assemblies generated from the pooled VLP viromes (Maxiphi16; see Methods). Both beta-diversity estimates showed that the same individual harbors very similar fecal viral communities over at least a one-year period: i.e., within an individual >95% of the viral genotypes were present and their relative abundances showed minimal variation (<8% permutation of the rank abundance).

Comparison of VLP-derived viromes and the 12 microbiomes revealed significant functional differences (Fig. S9) in agreement with previous studies of aquatic ecosystems where viruses were significantly enriched for genes related to DNA, RNA synthesis and replication while the corresponding microbial communities were enriched for nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism, and membrane transport18. Fig. 2 and S10 provide a sample-by-sample view of the proportional representation of KEGG and COG categories in sequenced purified VLP-derived viromes and in fecal microbiomes.

Moreover, the distribution of these functions is similar to their distribution in 121 sequenced human gut genomes (R2=0.82 for KEGG, 0.95 for COG; Table S9). In contrast, there is marked variation in these functional categories in the sequenced VLP-associated viromes (Fig. 2 and S10), although further and deeper analysis of these differences was limited by the low percentage of viral reads that were classifiable.",

Homologs of these proteins present in 121 gut genomes were subsequently retrieved, aligned19 and approximate maximum likelihood trees generated using FastTree20.

Probably the clearest example of Red Queen dynamics between phage and their hosts are the CRISPR elements in sludge1 and acid mine drainage systems2. Similarly, phage genomes often show evidence of changes in their tail fibers over time3. Given this paradigm, it is striking that we found essentially no evidence of this type of behavior in fecal phages (see Supplementary Discussion for analysis of CRISPRs). In contrast, we found high abundances of dominant phage, present in the same individual for extended periods of time, with no significant divergence or mutations in their genomes.

Experimental evidence for this scenario is provided by gnotobiotic mice co-colonized for two weeks with Marvinbryantia formatexigens, a human gut acetogen that contains three predicted prophages, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a saccharolytic bacterium that harbors two predicted prophages. Normalized RNA-Seq counts, generated from cecal contents and fecal samples harvested at the time of sacrifice (n=3 mice)23, revealed that one of the three prophages in M. formatexigens was completely activated (all ORFs transcribed) in all fecal samples and in a subset of cecal samples (Fig. 3). In the case of the remaining two M. formatexigens prophages, only a few genes were expressed, including a pair of adjacent ORFs encoding a HicA family toxin (BRYFOR7601) and a HicB family anti-toxin (BRYFOR7602) in one of the prophages, and a pair of genes that specify a RelE family toxin (BFYFOR9696) and a PHD family anti-toxin (BRYFOR9697) in the other prophage; these two gene pairs were constitutively expressed in all fecal samples, in all cecal samples, and during in vitro growth in defined medium containing a variety of carbon sources (Fig. 3). Co-expression of toxin-antitoxin genes is known to maintain stable integration of phage DNA in bacterial chromosomes24,25. Importantly, the one prophage that was fully activated (prophage 2 in Fig. 3) does not have a detectable toxin/anti-toxin gene pair. Only two small (2\u20133 gene) clusters were expressed in the two B. thetaiotaomicron prophages in vivo; all of these clusters encode predicted toxin or anti-toxin genes (Fig. S14). These findings illustrate how a prophage may be liberated from its host cell when that cell is present in a fecal community.",

Our results suggest that these metagenomic studies should also include VLPs recovered from various body habitat microbiota (Fig. S15 and Supplementary Discussion). Functions embedded in both dominant and sub-dominant phages may provide informative molecular signatures (biomarkers) of a microbiota and its human host, of microbial community responses to impending or fully manifest disease states, and of the extent to which community health or pathology endures after apparent recovery of the human host from a disease or therapeutic intervention. In addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring defined collections of human gut symbionts inoculated with VLP-derived viromes should provide informative models for further dissection of various aspects of the interactions of phage and their microbial hosts in different regions of the gut, including an assessment of whether LV dynamics operate in more proximal regions of the intestine where energy generated from dietary components may be more available.",

For VLP purification a 2\u20135 g aliquot of each fecal sample was re-suspended in 25 mL SM buffer [100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 0.002% gelatin (wt/vol)]. Following centrifugation (2,500 \u00d7 g for 10 min at room temperature), the resulting supernatant was removed and passed sequentially through 0.45\u03bcm and 0.22\u03bcm Whatman filters to remove residual cells. The filtrate was then adjusted with CsCl to a density of 1.12g/mL and deposited on top of a 3 mL step gradient prepared using 1mL CsCl solutions with densities of 1.7 g/mL SM buffer, 1.5 g/mL, and 1.35 g/mL. Samples were centrifuged for 2h at 60,000 \u00d7 g (4\u00b0C) in a SW41 swinging bucket rotor (Beckman). The 1.5 g/mL layer was recovered since material in this density range is known to be enriched for bacteriophages27. At each step of the purification procedure, an aliquot of the sample was viewed under an epifluorescence microscope after viral particles had been stained with SYBR-gold; this allowed us to document the presence of VLPs and note whether a decrease in the representation of bacterial and eukaryotic cellular elements had occurred.",

We pooled 16,567 reads derived from WGA DNA, and 18,845 reads from the unamplified aliquot and clustered them using the procedures used for alpha diversity calculations (see CD-Hit Clustering below). We found that 98.4% of the sequences from the un-amplified DNA were also present in the WGA reads while 91.96% of the WGA sequences were represented in the un-amplified sample dataset. This difference could be due to sequencing of amplified low abundance viral DNAs that were not sequenced in the unamplified sample.
