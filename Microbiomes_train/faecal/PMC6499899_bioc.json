The capacity to produce butyrate from complex carbohydrates is generally attributed to gram-positive anaerobic bacteria that inhabit the colon. Two of the major butyrate producing groups are Faecalibacterium (clostridial cluster IV) and Eubacterium rectale/Roseburia spp. (clostridial cluster XIVa) [13\u201315]. Previous studies in animal models have shown that a decrease in intestinal butyrate after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is correlated with adverse outcomes [7]. Specifically, reduced butyrate in intestinal epithelial cells resulted in decreased histone acetylation, whereas exogenous administration of butyrate restored intestinal epithelial cell junction integrity and diminished graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) [7]. Furthermore, addition of high-butyrate producing bacteria also mitigated GVHD [7]. In 2018, it was also reported that higher levels of butyrate producing fecal microbiota were associated with increased resistance against lower respiratory viral infections in allogeneic HSCT recipients [14].",

A variety of bacteria such as Fusobacterium spp., Escherichia coli, Bacteroides spp., and Enterococcus faecalis have the ability to convert tryptophan into indole and its derivatives [16]. Low levels of 3-indoxyl sulfate (3-IS) (a major conjugate of indole) in the urine after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT) were associated with significantly higher transplant-related mortality (TRM), intestinal GVHD (iGVHD) being the primary cause [18].

Because low microbial diversity has been associated with increased GVHD and mortality rates after HSCT, we hypothesized that loss of microbial diversity results in decreased production of intestinal bacterial derived metabolites that are relevant to mucosal integrity and immune tolerance. Thus, we sought to determine whether measuring stool metabolites using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (commonly used in clinical laboratories of larger hospitals or tertiary care centers) could be used to monitor microbiome diversity in the clinical setting, and whether these metabolite measurements could be correlated with complications associated with loss of microbial diversity.",

Differences in microbial communities (genera) among healthy volunteers and HSCT recipients at baseline could also be detected via \u03b2-diversity biplots (Figure 1B). The variation between the 2 groups was driven by the abundance of Pseudobutyrivibrio in healthy volunteers, and Bacteroides, Enterobacter, and Akkermansia in HSCT recipients at baseline. This was further examined by comparing the relative abundance of specific genera at baseline; levels were significantly higher for Pseudobutyrivibrio and Subdoligranulum in healthy individuals and for Enterococcus in HSCT recipients (Figure 1C). Our findings are in contrast to a previous report in which HSCT recipients who did not contract severe GVHD maintained stool microbiota broadly similar to healthy donors [29].",

Again marked changes occurred between baseline and the first week after transplantations, when samples with higher indole levels at week 1, visit 2, after transplantation were now also enriched for the Ruminococcaceae and Erysiopelotrichaceae families. Similar to patient samples with low levels of butyrate, those with low levels of indole were also enriched for Enterococcaceae and Lactobacillales (Supplementary Figure 2B). It is of interest that not all of the taxa positively associated with indole levels are known to produce indole, such as Erysiopelotrichia [16].",

In the current study, fecal butyrate and indole levels in HSCT recipients was correlated with microbial diversity, as well as the abundances of specific taxa at baseline and directly after transplantation (Figure 2 and \u200band3).3). Thus, fecal indole and butyrate could be used as surrogate markers for microbial diversity or specific taxa. Given the associations found in previous studies between microbial diversity or particular taxa and key clinical outcomes [36, 37], metabolite measurements could potentially be applicable in the clinical setting, given that these assays are amenable to a shorter turnaround time than metagenomic sequencing.",

Nevertheless, it remains a possibility that butyrate levels in the actual colonic mucosa, rather than measurements from the feces, are the important factor to consider for GVHD outcomes. For example, Mathewson et al [7] observed a lack of changes in the amounts of luminal butyrate, despite microbiome shifts after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, but they found that butyrate decreases occurred in the intestinal tissue, leading to decreased histone acetylation. However, unlike Mathewson et al [7], we found that fecal indole and butyrate were correlated with microbial \u03b1 diversity and specific taxa of the stool samples reported herein (Figure 2 and \u200band33).",

We saw similar taxa associated with high indole levels in stool samples (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 2). Bacilli were enriched in samples with low fecal indole levels, as was previously reported for low urinary 3-IS levels [39]. An analogous trend occurred in butyrate fecal levels; high butyrate levels were associated with groups of bacteria within the Clostridia class, and low butyrate levels were enriched for groups of bacteria within the Bacilli class. Of note, Blautia, Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcus, whose losses were previously reported to be associated with acute GVHD or GVHD-related death, were taxa associated with high indole and butyrate measurements in this study. Similarly, increases in Enterococcus and Streptococcus, which were negatively associated with fecal butyrate and indole levels in the current study, have also been reported to be associated with acute GVHD or GVHD-related death (Supplementary Figure 3) [20, 21, 23, 24, 29, 30].",

This is consistent with findings of studies showing that depletion of butyrate-producing Clostridia after antibiotic treatment elevates mucosal colonic lumen oxygen and promotes aerobic pathogen expansion [40]. Such expansion could lead to intestinal domination by pathogenic bacteria with subsequent translocation across damaged epithelium [5]. Inasmuch as dietary interventions can facilitate butyrate production, these data suggest that a \u201cprebiotic\u201d approach could help ameliorate serious infections and other adverse outcomes in HSCT recipients, and this is the subject of an ongoing clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02763033).",

To minimize these effects, we included an internal standard to all sample runs and conducted absolute quantitation by including a calibration curve constructed by spiking known concentrations of external reference standards. A limitation was that we did not determine the external standard curve in a null sample matrix devoid of the compounds of interest. When matrix effects were evaluated using the instrument standard (7-hydroxy-coumarin), the stool sample matrix suppressed the output signal, potentially resulting in an underestimate of the true concentrations. In our study fecal butyrate measurements were approximately 10-fold less than previously reported [41] and is likely to reflect the use of antibiotics and chemotherapy, which can reduce the overall biomass of metabolite-producing microbes within the gut, or be a consequence of the method. Nevertheless, because we diluted samples to ensure measurement in the linear range of the calibration curve, the sample-to-sample comparisons of the measured metabolites are most likely accurate.",

Our findings further solidify the association of \u03b1 diversity at the time of engraftment with acute iGVHD. Our results suggest using fecal microbial metabolites as surrogate markers for low microbial diversity or particular taxa. Further studies in larger cohorts in multiple institutions will need to be performed to confirm the predictive capabilities of fecal metabolites as surrogate biomarkers for microbial diversity and specific taxa before and after transplantation. In addition, further investigations on how these metabolites affect host physiology and clinical outcomes in HSCT recipients may offer appropriate targets for therapeutic interventions by modulating defined bacterial species, the enzymes required to produce the metabolites, or exogenous administration of the metabolites themselves.",
