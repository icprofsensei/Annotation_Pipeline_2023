In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional study and recruited 30 obese (OG) and 30 non-obese (NG) women with PCOS, 30 healthy women (NC) and 11 healthy but obese women (OC) as controls to investigate the characteristic gut microbiota and its metabolic functions in obese and non-obese patients with PCOS. The blood and non-menstrual faecal samples of all the participants were collected and analysed. As a result, the Hirsutism score, LH/FSH and serum T level in NG and OG both increased significantly compared with their controls (P\u2009<\u20090.05). High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota changed in patients with PCOS. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) indicated that Lactococcus was the characteristic gut microbiota in NG, while Coprococcus_2 in OG. Correlation heatmap analysis revealed that the sex hormones and insulin levels in human serum were closely related to the changes in the gut microbiota of NG and OG. Functional prediction analysis demonstrated that the citrate cycle pathway enriched both in NG and OG, and other 12 gut bacterial metabolic pathways enriched in NG. This study highlighted significant differences in the gut microbiota and predictive functions of obese and non-obese women with PCOS, thereby providing insights into the role and function of the gut microbiota that may contribute to the occurrence and development of PCOS in obese and non-obese women.",

The pathophysiology of PCOS is centred on hyperandrogenism and IR and can cause many short- or long-term complications, such as spontaneous abortion, metabolic syndrome and endometrial cancer (1). The clinical manifestations of PCOS are highly heterogeneous, and obesity is a common clinical phenotype in patients with PCOS. Hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism can mutually aggravate each other to form a \u2018vicious circle\u2019. Excessive fat storage in obese patients can increase insulin concentration in the blood and trigger and aggravate IR, promoting the development of PCOS (2).",

(3) found that the abundance of ML615J-28 and 124-7 from phylum Tenericutes was considerably low in the intestine of patients with PCOS. According to Liu et al. (4), the ratio of Escherichia/Shigella and the abundance of Streptococcus in intestine increase, whereas the abundance of Akkermansia and Ruminococcaceae decreases in patients with PCOS. Although Torres et al. (5) revealed that the gut microbiota diversity in patients with PCOS was closely related to hyperandrogenism, they did not conduct further studies on the correlation between obesity and gut microbiota in patients with PCOS, nor did they identify any specific genera closely related to the onset of PCOS. Based on the above research, Insenser et al. (6) determined the characteristics of gut microbiota from obese and non-obese patients with PCOS, non-hyperandrogenic women and healthy men, and found the specific correlations among gut microbiota, gender, sex hormone and obesity, which may promote the occurrence and development of PCOS. However, the study involved only 46 subjects divided into three groups. Additional interference factors were included when the researchers compared women with PCOS with healthy men. In addition, the altered metabolic functions of gut microbiota in patients with PCOS were not revealed. The purpose of our study was to investigate gut microbiota composition, reveal gut microbiota characteristics and predict metabolic functions and clinical manifestations in 101 obese and non-obese PCOS women and healthy women.",

Individuals with one of the following conditions were excluded: pregnancy, smoking, tumour, chronic diarrhoea, autoimmune diseases, history of gastrointestinal surgery and other endocrine diseases. None of the individuals were treated with oral contraceptives, antiandrogens, insulin sensitizers, antibiotics and probiotics. Women in the control group showed no history of menstrual dysfunction, infertility, endocrine diseases or diagnosed PCOS by Rotterdam criteria.

The purified amplified fragment was constructed into a library of PE 2*300 according to the standard operating protocol of the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, USA). The library was constructed as follows: (1) connecting the \u2018Y\u2019-shaped joint; (2) using magnetic beads to remove the self-ligating fragment; (3) enriching the library template by PCR amplification; and (4) producing ssDNA fragments after the denaturalization of sodium hydroxide.

The detailed process was as follows: (1) bases below 20 at the end of reads were filtered and a window of 50 bp was set. If the average mass in the window was less than 20, we truncated the back-end bases from the window. Reads below 50 bp were filtered after quality control, and reads containing an N base were removed; (2) according to the overlapping relationship between sequencing data, paired reads were spliced into a sequence with a minimum 10 bp overlap length; (3) the maximum allowable mismatch ratio of the overlap region of stitching sequence was 0.2, and the mismatch sequence was screened out and (4) the barcode and primers at both ends of the sequence were used to distinguish the samples and adjust the sequence direction. The allowable and maximum mismatch number of barcodes and primers was 0 and 2, respectively. Usearch software of Qiime platform (version 7.0 http://drive5.com/uparse/) was then used to cluster the sequences according to 97% similarity.

Simpson and Shannon indexes reflected community diversity. Coverage index reflected community coverage. Beta diversity was reflected by principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) charts conducted by PCoA statistical analysis method with R language. Kruskal\u2013Wallis H test and multiple test correction were used to complete the analysis of species difference at the level of phylum and genus among four groups. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and GraphPad Prism 8.0 were used to analyse the difference between the two groups and map species diversity at phylum level. The gut microbiota with significant difference in abundance was detected by non-parametric factorial Kruskal\u2013Wallis sum-rank test. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to estimate the effect of each species contributing to the difference and formed the LDA discriminant result table. R language (pheatmap package) was used to obtained the Spearman correlation coefficients between environmental factors and selected species, and heatmap diagram was used to display the obtained numerical matrix. The OTU abundance table was standardized by PICRUSt, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) information corresponding to each OTU were obtained through Greengene ID according to the information of KEGG database. The abundance of each functional category was calculated according to OTU abundance.

The larger the LDA score, the more significant the difference between the two groups was. Only those genera that obtained a log LDA score >2 were ultimately considered. Compared with the 16 characteristic species found in NC, 1 characteristic bacteria (Lactococcus) were found in NG (Fig. 2C). The Coprococcus_3 and other two characteristic species were found in OC, and only one kind of species (Coprococcus_2) was found to be characteristic microbiota in OG (Fig. 2D).",

In OG, 16 species were associated with serum sex hormones level, much more than those in NG group (Supplementary Table 2). Comparing the two groups, Lachnoclostridium was positively correlated with prolactin (PRL) in OG, but negatively correlated with PRL in NG group. Streptococcus was negatively correlated with insulin level in both groups. Lachnospiraceae_UCG-004 and insulin level were negatively correlated in OG, but positively correlated in NG. Klebsiella, Veillonella, Collinsella, Dialister, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, Agathobacter, Megasphaera, Roseburia and Parasutterella were found in both groups to be closely correlated with serum hormones level.\n",

Compared with OC, the only enrichment metabolic pathways found in OG was Citrate cycle (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Interestingly, the Citrate cycle pathway enriched both in NG and OG compared with their controls.\n",

The Hirsutism score, LH/FSH and serum testosterone level in obese and non-obese PCOS patients were significantly higher than those in their control groups, and the diversity of gut microbiota was lower than control groups. The characteristic species of gut microbiota in obese and non-obese women with PCOS were revealed. The close relationships between several types of gut microbiota at genus level and serum hormones level were presented. The metabolic functions of differential gut microbiota were enriched and predicted in obese and non-obese women with PCOS.",

(7) found that the abundance and diversity of Tenericutes in the intestine of healthy people are higher than those of patients with metabolic syndrome. Lindheim et al. (3) compared the abundance of Tenericutes in the intestine of patients with PCOS with healthy women decreased significantly and was negatively correlated with the total blood lymphocyte count. Our study further uncovered that the abundance of Tenericutes in non-obese women with PCOS was significantly lower than that in healthy women, but no difference was found between obese women with PCOS and healthy but obese women. Synergistets plays an important pathogenic role in oral infections (8, 9). Synergistets can promote the production of natural Immunoglobulin M and exhibits vital function in inhibiting autoimmune diseases (10). Synergistetes exists in the human oral cavity, intestine, vagina and skin, but this type of bacteria is still difficult to isolate and culture (11). Our study showed that the abundance of intestinal Synergistets in non-obese patients with PCOS was significantly lower than that in healthy women. At the genus level, we identified the specific bacteria in PCOS patients, such as Coprococcus_2, Lactobacillus and Prevotella_7 in the intestine of obese women with PCOS, Lactococcus, Paraprevotella and Alloprevotella in the intestine of non-obese women with PCOS.",

In this study, we found Lachnoclostridium was closely related to the serum PRL level both in obese and non-obese women with PCOS, which never reported. We found that the dysbacteriosis in the intestine of PCOS patients had a correlation with the serum sex hormones level, which suggested that we may regulate the status of gut microbial community to adjust the patients\u2019 serum sex hormones level.",

Actually, hyperandrogenism and dysfunction of glucose and insulin metabolism are the common symptoms in patients with PCOS and may be promoted by the abnormal gut microbiota. And the patients in this group, their microbiota had more significant effects on the digestion and absorption of nutrients and glucose metabolism, which might cause the excessive accumulation of energy in host. In addition, the gut microbiota of non-obese patients with PCOS was abnormal active in amino acid, pyrimidine and purine metabolism compared with healthy women. These metabolic functions are closely related to the transport and absorption of nutrients and critically affected the levels of serum hormones, cytokines and other substances in the human body. Notably, citrate cycle pathway, the key link of carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism (14), enriched both in obese and non-obese patients with PCOS. Based on the above evidence, the altered gut microbiota had a tightly relationship with the activity of these metabolic pathways and may affect human endocrine function and cause the occurrence and development of the diseases.",
