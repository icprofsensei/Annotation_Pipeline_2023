Numerous factors in the design of PCR can impact the sequencing error rate, the abundance of chimeric sequences, and the degree to which the fragments in the product represent their abundance in the original sample (i.e., bias). We compared the performance of high fidelity polymerases and various numbers of rounds of amplification when amplifying a mock community and human stool samples. Although it was impossible to derive specific recommendations, we did observe general trends. Namely, using a polymerase with the highest possible fidelity and minimizing the number of rounds of PCR reduced the sequencing error rate, fraction of chimeric sequences, and bias. Evidence of bias at the sequence level was subtle and could not be ascribed to the fragments\u2019 fraction of bases that were guanines or cytosines. When analyzing mock community data, the amount that the community deviated from the expected composition increased with the number of rounds of PCR. This bias was inconsistent for human stool samples. Overall, the results underscore the difficulty of comparing sequence data that are generated by different PCR protocols. However, the results indicate that the variation in human stool samples is generally larger than that introduced by the choice of polymerase or number of rounds of PCR.",

We found that these choices can have a profound impact on the way that a microbial community is represented in the sequence data. The effects are relatively small compared to the variation in human stool samples; however, care should be taken to use polymerases with the highest possible fidelity and to minimize the number of rounds of PCR.

Factors such as the choice of primers have an obvious impact on which populations will be amplified (18, 21). However, a variety of PCR artifacts can also impact the perception of a community, including the formation of chimeras (14, 22,\u201324), misincorporation of nucleotides (23, 25, 26), preferential amplification of some populations over others, leading to bias (24, 27,\u201333), and accumulation of random amplification events leading to PCR drift (24, 27, 32, 34). Many bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify chimeras; however, there are significant sensitivity and specificity tradeoffs (14, 35). Laboratory-based solutions to minimize chimera formation have also been proposed such as minimizing the amount of template DNA in the PCR, minimizing the number of rounds of PCR, minimizing the amount of shearing in the template DNA, using DNA polymerases that have proofreading ability, and emulsion PCR (14, 23, 36). Others have attempted to account for PCR bias using modeling approaches (29, 37). In cases where such modeling approaches have been successful, it has been with relatively small communities with consistent composition (29). To minimize PCR drift, some investigators pool technical replicate PCRs hoping to average out the drift (34). Other factors that have been shown to impact the formation of PCR artifacts are outside the control of an investigator, including the fraction of DNA bases that are guanines or cytosines, the variation in the length of the targeted region across the community, the sequence of the DNA that flanks the template, and the genetic diversity of the community (28, 30,\u201333). Early investigations of the factors that lead to the formation of PCR artifacts focused on analyzing binary mixtures of genomic DNA and 16S rRNA gene fragments to explore PCR biases and chimera formation. Although these studies were instrumental in forcing researchers to be cautious about the interpretation of their results, we have a poor understanding of how these factors affect the formation of PCR artifacts in more complex communities.",

There has been recent interest in how the choice of the hypervariable region and data analysis pipeline impact the sequencing error rate (15, 18,\u201320); however, these studies use the same DNA polymerase in the PCR step and implicitly assume that the rate of nucleotide misincorporation from PCR are significantly smaller than those from the sequencing phase. There has been more limited interest in the impact that DNA polymerase choice has on the formation of chimeras (23, 38). A recent study found differences in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and chimeras between normal and high fidelity DNA polymerases (38). The authors of the study reduced the difference between two polymerases by optimizing the annealing and extension steps within the PCR protocol (38). Yet this optimization was specific for the community they were analyzing (i.e., captive and semicaptive red-shanked doucs) and assumed that if the two polymerases generate the same community structure that the community structure was correct. In fact, the community structures generated by both methods were not free of artifacts but likely had the same artifacts. A challenge in these types of experiments is having a priori knowledge of the true community representation. A mock community with known composition allows researchers to quantify the sequencing error rate, fraction of chimeras, and bias (19); however, mock communities have a limited phylogenetic diversity relative to natural communities. Natural communities, in contrast, have an unknown community composition, making absolute measurements impossible. They can be used to validate results from mock communities and to understand the relative impacts of artifacts on the ability to differentiate biological and methodological sources of variation. Given the large number of DNA polymerases available to researchers, it is unlikely that a specific recommendation is possible. Rather, the development of general best practices and understanding the impact of PCR artifacts on an analysis are needed.",

It was hypothesized that additional rounds of PCR would exacerbate the number of artifacts. We tested (i) the effect of the polymerase on the error rate of the bases represented in the final sequences, (ii) the fraction of sequences that appeared to be chimeras and the ability to detect those chimeras, (iii) the bias of preferentially amplifying one fragment over another in a mixed pool of templates, and (iv) intersample variation in community structure of samples amplified with the same polymerase across the amplification process. To characterize these factors, we sequenced a mock community of 8 organisms with known sequences and community structure and human fecal samples with unknown sequences and community structures. We sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes from a mock community by generating paired 250-nucleotide (nt) reads on the Illumina MiSeq platform. This region and sequencing approach were used because they have been shown to result in a relatively low sequencing error rate and are a widely used protocol (18). To better understand the impact of DNA polymerase choice on PCR artifacts, we selected five high fidelity DNA polymerases and amplified the communities using 20, 25, 30, and 35 rounds of amplification. Collectively, our results suggest that the number of rounds and to a lesser extent the choice of DNA polymerase used in PCR impact the sequence data.

More importantly, sequencing errors themselves can alter the representation of the community. Therefore, it is important to minimize the number of sequencing errors. Using a widely used approach that generates the lowest reported error rate, we quantified the error rate by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes from an 8-member mock community. We also removed any contigs that were at least three bases more similar to a chimera of two reference sequences than to a single reference sequence (18, 19, 39). Regardless of the polymerase, the error rate increased with the number of rounds of amplification (Fig.\u00a01). Using 30 rounds of PCR is a common approach across diverse types of samples. Among the data generated using 30 rounds of PCR, the Accuprime polymerase had the highest error rate (i.e., 0.124%), followed by the Platinum (i.e., 0.094%), Phusion (i.e., 0.064%), KAPA (i.e., 0.062%), and Q5 (i.e., 0.060%) polymerases (Fig.\u00a01). When we applied a preclustering denoising step, which merged the counts of reads within 2\u2009nt of a more abundant sequence (19), the error rates dropped considerably such that the Platinum polymerase had the highest error rate (i.e., 0.014%), followed by the Accuprime (i.e., 0.012%), Q5 (i.e., 0.0053%), Phusion (i.e., 0.0049%), and KAPA (i.e., 0.0049%) polymerases (Fig.\u00a01). Although specific recommendations are difficult to make because the phylogenetic diversity of the initial DNA template is likely to have an impact on the results, it is clear that using as few PCR cycles as necessary and a polymerase with the lowest possible error rate is a good guide to minimizing the impact of polymerase on the error rate.",

Although numerous bioinformatic tools exist to identify and remove chimeric sequences with high specificity, their sensitivity is relatively low and can be reduced by the presence of sequencing errors (14, 35). Because the true sequences of the organisms in the mock community were known, we generated all possible chimeras between pairs of V4 16S rRNA gene fragments and used these possible chimeric sequences to screen the sequences generated under the different PCR conditions to detect chimeras. The number of chimeras increased with rounds of amplification (Fig.\u00a02A). Interestingly, the fraction of chimeric sequences from the mock community varied by the type of polymerase used. After 30 rounds of PCR, the Platinum polymerase had the highest chimera rate (i.e., 18.2%), followed by the Q5 (i.e., 8.1%), Phusion (i.e., 7.5%), KAPA (i.e., 2.3%), and Accuprime (i.e., 0.9%) polymerases. To explore the characteristics of the chimeras further, we analyzed those chimeras formed after 35 cycles. Because of the uneven number of chimeras generated across the five polymerases, we subsampled the frequency of the chimeras to have the same number of chimeras per polymerase, the Q5, Phusion, Accuprime, and Platinum polymerases; the chimeric sequence yield with the KAPA polymerase was significantly lower than the other polymerases and was omitted from our initial comparison. As has been shown previously (14), chimera formation was not random. Among the chimeras that were generated in mock community samples, 4.4% of the chimeras were found across all four polymerases. These chimeras represented between 67.6 and 74.5% of the chimeras generated with each polymerase; they represented 40.4% of the chimeric sequences generated using the KAPA polymerase. These results indicate that the mechanisms leading to the formation of chimeras are largely independent of the properties of the polymerase but are more likely due to the properties of the sequences.",

The specificity for all polymerases was above 95.4% and showed a weak association with the number of cycles used (Fig.\u00a02A). There was considerable interpolymerase and interround amplification variation in the sensitivity of UCHIME to detect the chimeras from the mock community. This suggested that the residual error rate after preclustering the sequence data did not compromise the sensitivity of UCHIME to detect chimeras. The sensitivity of UCHIME varied between 50 and 87.0% when at least 25 cycles were used. The generalizability of these results is limited because we used a single mock community with limited genetic diversity. Although we did not know the true chimera rate for our four human stool samples, we were able to calculate the fraction of sequences that UCHIME identified as being chimeric (Fig.\u00a02B). These results followed those from the mock communities: additional rounds of amplification significantly increased the rate of chimeras, and there was variation between the polymerases that we used.

The mock community was generated by mixing equal amounts of genomic DNA from 8 bacteria resulting in uneven representation of the rrn operons across the bacteria, as each bacterium had a different genome size and varied in the number of operons in its genome. The vendor of the mock community subjects each lot of genomic DNA to shotgun sequencing to more accurately quantify the actual abundance of each organism in the community. It should be noted that this approach to quantifying abundance is also not without its own biases (40), but it does provide an alternative approach to characterizing the structure of the mock community. We compared the vendor-reported relative abundance of the 16S rRNA genes from each bacterium in the mock community to the data we generated across rounds of amplification and polymerase (Fig.\u00a03). Interestingly, for some bacteria, their representation became less biased with additional rounds of PCR (e.g., Lactobacillus fermentum), while others became more biased (e.g., Enterococcus faecalis), and others had little change (e.g., Bacillus subtilis). In contrast to prior reports (28), the percentage of bases in the V4 region that were guanines or cytosines was not predictive of the amount of bias. Across the strains, there was no variation in the length of their V4 regions, and they each had the same sequence in the region that the primers annealed. One of the bacteria represented in the mock community, Salmonella enterica, had 6 identical copies of the V4 region and 1 copy that differed from those by one nucleotide. The dominant copy had a thymidine, and the rare copy had a guanine. We used the sequence data to calculate the ratio of the dominant variants to rare variants from S. enterica expecting a ratio near 6 (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material). The Accuprime, Phusion, Platinum, and Q5 polymerases converged to a ratio of 5.4; however, the ratio for the KAPA polymerase was above 6 for all rounds of PCR (6.1 to 7.4), and the ratio for Q5 was below 6 for all rounds of PCR (5.3 to 5.5). Given the subtle nature of the variation in the relative abundances of each 16S rRNA gene fragment, it was not possible to create generalizable rules that would explain the bias.",

                    "text": "Because the variation in bias between polymerases and across rounds of PCR could be artificially inflated due to sequencing errors and chimeras, we analyzed the alpha and beta diversity of the mock community data at different phases of the sequence curation pipeline (Fig.\u00a04). First, we removed the chimeras from the mock community data as described above and mapped the individual reads to the OTUs that the 16S rRNA gene fragments would cluster into if there were no sequencing errors. This gave us a community distribution that reflected the distribution following PCR without any artifacts (Fig.\u00a04A, \u201cNo errors or chimeras\u201d). Although the richness did not change, the Shannon diversity increased with the number of rounds of PCR for all polymerases except the KAPA polymerase, for which the diversity decreased. These data suggest that PCR had the effect of making the community distribution more even than it was originally, except for the data generated using the KAPA polymerase, where the evenness decreased. Next, we used the observed sequence errors but removed chimeras by comparing sequences to all possible chimeras between mock community sequences and clustered the reads to OTUs (Fig.\u00a04A, \u201cResidual errors, complete chimera removal\u201d). The richness and diversity metrics trended higher with higher error rates and number of rounds of PCR. Finally, we used the observed sequence data and the UCHIME algorithm to identify chimeras (Fig.\u00a04A, \u201cResidual errors, chimera removal with VSEARCH\u201d). Again, the richness and diversity metrics trended higher with higher error rates and numbers of rounds of PCR. These comparisons demonstrated that although the bias at the sequence level was subtle, PCR introduces bias at the community level that is exacerbated by errors and chimeras when sequences are clustered into OTUs. When we measured the Bray-Curtis distance between the communities observed after 25 rounds of amplification and those at 30 and 35, distances between 25 and 35 rounds were higher than between 25 and 30 rounds for each of the polymerases by an average of 0.022 units (Fig.\u00a04B). The Platinum polymerase varied the most across rounds of amplification (25 versus 30 rounds, 0.13; 25 versus 35 rounds, 0.15). For any number of cycles, the median Bray-Curtis distance between polymerases ranged between 0.074 and 0.11. Although the distances between samples were small, the ordination of these distances showed a clear change in community structure with increasing rounds of PCR (Fig.\u00a04C). This observation was supported by our statistical analysis, which revealed that the effect of the number of rounds of PCR (R2 = 0.21; P\u2009<\u20090.001) was comparable to the choice of polymerase (R2 = 0.20; P\u2009<\u20090.001). These results demonstrate that subtle differences in relative abundances can have an impact on overall community structure. This variation underscores the importance of comparing only sequence data that have been generated using the same PCR conditions.",

To study this further, we calculated alpha and beta diversity metrics using the human stool samples for each of the polymerases and rounds of amplification. We calculated the number of observed OTUs and Shannon diversity for each condition and stool sample (Fig.\u00a05A). Although there were clear differences between PCR conditions, the relative ordering of the stool samples did not vary meaningfully across conditions. When we characterized the variation between rounds of amplification using human stool samples, the distance between the 25 and 30 rounds and 25 and 35 rounds varied considerably between samples and polymerases (Fig.\u00a05B). In general, the interround variation was lowest for the data generated using the KAPA and Accuprime polymerases. The data generated using the Platinum polymerase were consistent across rounds, but overall, it was more biased than the other polymerases. Considering that the average distance across the four samples varied between 0.39 and 0.56, regardless of the polymerases and number of rounds of amplification, any bias due to amplification is unlikely to obscure community-wide differences between samples. In support of this was our principal coordinates analysis of the Bray-Curtis distances, which revealed distinct clusters by stool sample (Fig.\u00a05C). Within each cluster, there were no obvious patterns related to the polymerase or number of rounds of PCR. Our statistical analysis revealed statistically significant differences in the community structures with the stool sample explaining the most variation (R2 = 0.79; P\u2009<\u20090.001), followed by the number of rounds of PCR (R2 = 0.044; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and the choice of polymerase (R2 = 0.033; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Together, these results indicate that for a coarse analysis of communities, the choice of number of rounds of amplification or polymerase is not important, but that they must be consistent across samples. It is difficult to develop a specific recommendation based on the level of bias across rounds of PCR or polymerases; however, the general suggestion is to use as few rounds of amplification as possible.",

To test this, we determined the average Bray-Curtis distance between replicate reactions using the same polymerase and number of rounds of amplification (Fig.\u00a06). Using the mock community data, there were no obvious trends. The average Bray-Curtis distance within a set of conditions varied by 0.062 to 0.11 units. Although we did not generate technical replicates of each of the stool samples, the intersample variation for each set of conditions was consistent and varied between 0.50 and 0.56 units. These data suggest that amplicon sequencing is robust to random variation in amplification and that any differences are likely to be smaller than what is considered biologically relevant.",

Although it was not possible to make direct connections between PCR conditions and specific sources of bias, we were able to identify general recommendations that reduce the amount of error, chimera formation, and bias. Researchers should strive to minimize the number of rounds of PCR and should use a high fidelity polymerase. Although specific PCR conditions impact the precise interpretation of the data, the effects were consistent and were smaller than the biological differences between the samples we tested. On the basis of these observations, amplicons must be generated by consistent protocols to yield meaningful comparisons. When comparing across studies, values like richness, diversity, and relative abundances must be made in relative and not absolute terms. Furthermore, care must be taken to not directly compare or pool samples from different studies. Instead, it is important to statistically model the study-based variation, as has been done in recent meta-analyses that compared relative effect sizes or pooled data using a mixed effects statistical model (41, 42).",

Accuprime and Platinum have fidelity that are approximately 10 times higher than that of Taq, whereas the fidelity of Phusion, Q5, and KAPA are more than 100 times higher. Among these polymerases, the KAPA polymerase consistently resulted in a lower error rate, lower chimera rate, and lower bias across rounds of PCR for the mock community samples. Furthermore, among the human samples, the KAPA polymerase consistently had the lowest detected chimera rate and intercycle bias. These benefits were most accentuated at 35 cycles. However, in our experience and despite efforts to optimize the yield with the KAPA polymerase, the reactions typically had a high proportion of primer-dimer products and low yield of correctly sized products. Although the error rate with the Accuprime polymerase was not as low as that with KAPA, we consider it to be an acceptable alternative. Considering that polymerase development is an active area of commercial development with potential new polymerases becoming available, it is important for researchers to understand how changing the polymerase impacts downstream analyses for their type of samples.",

In addition to obvious biases imposed by primer selection, other factors inherent in PCR can influence the representation of communities. Factors that can lead to preferential amplification of one fragment over another have included guanine and cytosine composition, length, flanking DNA composition, amount of DNA shearing, and number of rounds of PCR (24, 27,\u201333). These factors may become exacerbated if PCR is performed on multiple samples that vary in their concentration (43). In addition, environmental and reagent contaminants can also have a significant impact on the analysis of low biomass samples (44). Less well understood is the effect of phylogenetic diversity on bias and chimera formation. Communities with low phylogenetic diversity may be more prone to chimera formation, since chimeras are more likely to form among closely related sequences (14, 35). The interaction of these various influences on PCR artifacts are complex and difficult to tease apart. Minimizing the level of DNA shearing, controlling for template concentration across samples, and using the fewest number of rounds of PCR with a polymerase that has the highest possible fidelity are strategies that can be employed to minimize the formation of chimeras. Although care should always be taken when choosing a polymerase for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, our observations show that variation among polymerases is smaller than the actual biological variation in fecal communities between individuals.",

Beyond the imperfections of the best polymerases, sometimes difficult to lyse organisms require stringent lysis steps and low biomass samples require additional rounds of PCR. A host of bioinformatics tools are available for removing residual sequencing errors (18, 45,\u201347). Other tools are available for removing chimeras (14, 35) where there is a tradeoff between the sensitivity of detecting chimeras and the specificity of correctly calling a sequence a chimera. In recent years, parameters for these algorithms have been changed to increase their sensitivity with little evaluation of the effects on the specificity of the algorithms (45, 47). Others recommend removing any read that has an abundance below a specified threshold as a tool to remove PCR and sequencing artifacts (e.g., removing all sequences that appear only once) (20, 45,\u201347). This method must be approached with caution, as such approaches are likely to introduce a different bias of the community representation and ignore the fact, as we showed, that artifacts may be quite abundant and reproducible. Ultimately, researchers must test their hypotheses with multiple methods to validate the claims they reach with any one method (48). All methods have biases and limitations, and we must use complementary methods to obtain robust results.",

The protocol has been previously published (18) (https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP). Briefly, paired reads were assembled using mothur\u2019s make.contigs command to correct errors introduced by sequencing (18). Any assembled contigs that contained an ambiguous base call, mapped to the incorrect region of the 16S rRNA gene, or appeared to be a contaminant were removed from subsequent analyses. Sequences were further denoised using mothur\u2019s pre.cluster command to merge the counts of sequences that were within 2\u2009nt of a more abundant sequence. The VSEARCH implementation of UCHIME was used to screen for chimeras (35, 51). At various stages in the sequence processing pipeline for the mock community data, the mothur seq.error command was used to quantify the sequencing error rate as well as the true chimera rate. This command uses the true sequences from the mock community to generate all possible chimeras and removes any contigs that were at least three bases more similar to a chimera than to a reference sequence. The command then counts the number of substitutions, insertions, and deletions in the contig relative to the reference sequence and reports the error rate without the inclusion of chimeric sequences (19). UCHIME\u2019s sensitivity was calculated as the percentage of true chimeras that were detected as chimeras when using UCHIME. Its specificity was calculated as the percentage of nonchimeric sequences that were detected as being nonchimeric by UCHIME. The reference sequences and rrn operon copy number for each bacterium were obtained from the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community DNA Standard protocol (https://web.archive.org/web/20181221151905/https://www.zymoresearch.com/media/amasty/amfile/attach/_D6305_D6306_ZymoBIOMICS_Microbial_Community_DNA_Standard_v1.1.3.pdf). Sequences were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a threshold of 3% dissimilarity using the OptiClust algorithm (52). To adjust for unequal sequencing when measuring alpha and beta diversity, all samples were rarefied for downstream analysis. The Good\u2019s coverage for the samples was routinely greater than 95%.",
