The present study aimed to determine the effect of consumption of native chicory inulin on the stool frequency of middle-aged to older adults (40\u201375 years old) with uncomfortably but not clinically relevant low stool frequency, specified as two to four days without bowel movements per week. Two randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials were conducted using similar protocols in differing populations. Trial A was conducted in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and subsequently Trial B was conducted in Newcastle, United Kingdom. Both trials involved supplementation for 5 weeks with 10\u202fg per day of inulin or placebo, a washout period of 2 weeks, and then crossed over to receive the other treatment. In Trial B, faecal gut microbiota composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In Trial A, which 10 volunteers completed, the stool frequency was significantly increased to an average 4.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23 (SEM) times per week during inulin periods versus 3.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25 in the periods with placebo (p\u202f=\u202f0.01). In contrast, in Trial B which 20 volunteers completed, there was no significant effect of the inulin on stool frequency (7.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.1 times per week with inulin, 8.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.0 with placebo, p\u202f=\u202f0.35). However, many subjects in Trial B had a stool frequency >5 per week also for the placebo period, in breach of the inclusion criteria. Combining the data of 16 low stool frequency subjects from Trials A and B showed a significant effect of inulin to increase stool frequency from 4.1 to 5.0 per week (p\u202f=\u202f0.032). Regarding secondary outcomes, stool consistency was significantly softer with inulin treatment compared to placebo periods, it increased 0.29 on the Bristol stool scale (p\u202f=\u202f0.008) when data from all subjects of Trials A and B were combined. No other differences in bowel habit parameters due to inulin consumption were significant. None of the differences in specific bacterial abundance, alpha or beta diversity were significant, however the trends were in directions consistent with published studies on other types of inulin. We conclude that 10\u202fg per day of native chicory inulin can increase stool frequency in subjects with low stool frequency.",

The prevalence of constipation is difficult to determine as most people do not seek medical treatment, however, it is estimated to cause recognised discomfort to around 2\u201327% of the general population, with an increase with age (Gallagher & O'mahony, 2009).",

Specifically, consuming less than the recommended daily fibre intake of 25\u202fg/day has been associated with an increased incidence of constipation (Suares & Ford, 2011). In a recent meta-analysis, increased dietary fibre has been shown to be a useful treatment in those people suffering with constipation (Rao, Yu, & Fedewa, 2015), although how to increase dietary fibre intake remains an area of concern, and it is not known if all types of fibres have equal effects.",

A specific subset of dietary fibres, such as inulin, can selectively stimulate certain gut microbiota species and those fibres may be termed prebiotics. The most recent prebiotic definition of the International Scientific Association of Pro- and Prebiotics (ISAPP) is \u201ca substrate that is selectively utilised by the host microorganisms conferring a health benefit\u201d (Gibson et al., 2017). Inulin, derived from the chicory root, is well established for its prebiotic properties, as recognised by ISAPP. Inulin fibre passes through the upper GIT undigested, reaching the colon where it is fermented by bacteria thereby modulating the bacteria residing in the GIT, i.e. \u2018gut microbiota\u2019 (Gibson & Roberfroid, 1995). Inulin has been shown to improve bowel habit through increased stool weight, softer stools, reduced GIT symptoms, and improved quality of life (Castiglia-Delavaud et al., 1998; Den Hond, Geypens, & Ghoos, 2000; Vandeputte et al., 2017a). Although the exact mechanism of how inulin may improve GIT health and relieve constipation are not completely understood, the impact of nutrition (Flint, Scott, Louis, & Duncan, 2012), and more recently inulin's ability to modulate the gut microbiota have been suggested to play a role (Vandeputte et al., 2017a).",

Changes in \u2018normal\u2019 bowel habits, commonly reported in people with constipation, have been linked to changes in gut microbiota composition, which has been suggested to have a functional role in the pathogenesis of constipation (Kim et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2014). Consumption of foods high in fibre has been shown to be an effective treatment for symptoms of constipation (Lembo & Camilleri, 2003; Voderholzer et al., 1997). Fibre provides a substrate for microbial fermentation, and in so doing stimulates the growth of intestinal microbiota (Flint et al., 2012). Modulating the gut microbiota through fibre intake has the potential to increase the abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria, whilst reducing potentially pathogenic bacteria (Chen et al., 2013), and this may alleviate the symptoms of constipation (Ingvar, 2004). Intake of native chicory inulin has previously been shown to stimulate changes in the relative abundance of bifidobacteria in several studies using culturing or quantitative PCR (Schaafsma & Slavin, 2015), and secondly mixes of chicory inulin type fructans show similar effects using 16S rRNA sequencing approaches (Reimer et al., 2017). More recently inulin has been shown to increase Bifidobacterium, Bilophila and Anaerostipes in constipated subjects (Vandeputte et al., 2017a).",

The placebo maltodextrin (MD 20) was obtained from Avebe (Foxhol, the Netherlands). Maltodextrin is a fully digestible carbohydrate, not a fibre. Maltodextrin behaves similarly to inulin in solution and tasting behaviour thus the placebo drink was identical in taste and texture to the inulin drink. Each volunteer received all the treatment materials in two batches, one batch at the start of each treatment period. In Trial A, each subject received 80 pre-mixed orange juice drinks containing 5\u202fg of either inulin or placebo (enough for up to 40 days); the subjects were suggested to consume one drink in the morning and one drink mid-afternoon. In Trial B, each subject received 80 sachets with each 5\u202fg inulin or placebo and a package with 80,100\u202fml bottles of shelf-stable juice or water (according to preference), and a mixing container. The orange juice used for this trial was selected as it has previously been shown not to have any pre-biotic effects (Hickey, Calloway, & Murphy, 1972). The subjects were instructed to mix one sachet and one portion of the liquid in the mixing container, and drink the mixture within 2\u202fh of mixing, twice a day with breakfast and mid-afternoon. Volunteers used 1 portion of juice mix per day in the first three days when starting the study. After 3 days and during the rest of the trial the volunteers were instructed to consume 2 portions per day to reach the 10\u202fg dose, and to return any unused study product to the study site (for compliance monitoring).",

Study sachets were prepared by Sensus BV in pre-packed boxes pre-labelled with the subject numbers and study phase (see \u2018Final label\u2019 in Fig. 2). Subjects and all research staff involved in the conduct of the study were thus verifiably blinded to the treatment allocation, i.e. the sequence of study product intake, until final database lock. For safety reasons, sealed envelopes specifying the treatment corresponding to each of the different treatment labels were kept with the research team, to allow emergency unblinding if necessary.

In Trial B, the bowel habit daily diary was modified by removing a question on \u2018ease of defecation\u2019. Additionally, a validated questionnaire Patient Assessment of Constipation - Symptom (PAC-SYM) (under licence from Mapi Research Trust, France) was provided to the volunteers to be completed prior to and following the study period. Although this questionnaire has been developed for patients with a clinical diagnosis of constipation, it includes a wide range of symptoms with varying severity, and therefore is relevant for the healthy volunteers recruited to the present study. The corresponding Quality of Life questionnaire (PAC-QoL) was not used, since the ranges used for the outcomes were strongly skewed towards hospitalised patients, which was not relevant for this study population. Adverse events and concomitant medication were recorded for the duration of the trials in accordance with ICH/GCP guidelines. One volunteer experienced a migraine episode during an inulin consumption period. However, in consultation with the volunteer's GP it was concluded that the event was not related to the treatment.",

Each stool sample was homogenised at room temperature using a mortar and pestle as previously described (Vandeputte, Tito, Vanleeuwen, Falony, & Raes, 2017b), and a 5\u202fg aliquot was stored at \u221280\u202f\u00b0C until DNA was extracted in order to minimise alterations in bacterial composition following 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Lauber, Zhou, Gordon, Knight, & Fierer, 2010). The samples were managed according to the requirements of the Human Tissue Authority (HTA). An aliquot of 300\u202fmg of stool from each time point was extracted using MP FastDNA\u2122 Spin Kit for Feces following the manufacturer's instructions (Qbiogene, MP Biomedicals, Illkirch, France). The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using barcoded Illumina adaptors primer pair 515F/806R and then sequenced in the MiSeq platform (Illumina) using the 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f250 bp paired-end protocol yielding pair-end reads that overlap almost completely. The primers used for amplification contain adapters for MiSeq sequencing and single-end barcodes allowing pooling and direct sequencing of PCR products (Caporaso et al., 2012).",

Paired reads were demultiplexed based on the unique molecular barcodes and then merged using the USEARCH v7.0.1090 (Edgar, 2010), allowing no mismatches with a minimum overlap of 50 bases. The merged reads were then trimmed at the first base with Q5, followed by a quality filter was applied and reads containing >0.05 expected errors were removed. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were then clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU), a term used to classify groups of bacteria that are closely related at a cut-off similarity value of 97% using the UPARSE algorithm (Edgar, 2013). The OTUs were mapped onto an optimised version of the SILVA database that incorporated only the 16S V4 region to determine taxonomies (Quast et al., 2013). Bacterial abundances were recovered by mapping the demultiplexed reads to the UPARSE OTUs. A custom script was then constructed for a rarefied OTU table using output files from the previous two steps, allowing analysis of phylogenetic trends, alpha-diversity and beta-diversity (Lozupone & Knight, 2005). Each sample was rarefied to 2997 reads, (range of 134\u2013141,466). Four samples below this were removed for gut microbiota analysis.

                    "text": "Data recorded in the bowel habit diaries during weeks 3 and 5 of each treatment period were transformed into difference data (by subtracting the average of the recorded week 3 and 5 scores during the placebo period from the average week 3 and 5 scores for the corresponding inulin period) in order to express the effect of the treatment as two numerical values for each volunteer. The overall trial average difference for each volunteer was also calculated, using the combined average of weeks 3 and 5 for the difference in outcome between the two treatments. These difference data were tested for (normal) distribution before being analysed for the statistical difference from zero using a one sample T-test. Additionally, for data that were recorded in a comparable way in both Trial A and Trial B (i.e. stool frequency, consistency, flatulence, bloating, cramping, rumbling), the overall trial average difference for each volunteer were analysed together, combining all volunteers in both trials. The values were analysed using ANOVA (General Linear Model in Minitab). This analysis distinguished between volunteers who during week 1 of their placebo period met the criterion of \u2265 two days without bowel movements per week i.e. \u2018low initial stool frequency\u2019, and those who did not meet this criterion, thereby had less than two days without bowel movements i.e. \u2018high initial stool frequency\u2019. Due to the run-in dosing schedule in week 1 and anticipated increasing effect with inulin treatment over time, the bowel habit data recorded during week 1 were not used otherwise. The \u2018low initial stool frequency\u2019 criterion was met by 10 volunteers from Trial A and 6 from Trial B. The model factors were initial frequency (either low or high), and site (either Trial A or Trial B), nested within initial frequency, to determine the mean and standard deviation and significance corresponding to the hypotheses: (1) that the overall effect differs from 0; (2) whether the outcome differed among volunteers with low or high initial frequency (interaction with initial frequency); and (3) whether the outcome was affected by site among volunteers with low initial frequency. Where the outcome showed a significant interaction with the initial frequency, an additional one-sample T-test was used to analyse the data from volunteers with low initial frequency only. A Bonferroni correction was applied to the p-values for the 6 secondary outcomes (other than the primary outcome of change in stool frequency) resulting in \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.008, rather than the 0.05 for the primary outcome, The analysis and visualisation of bacterial communities was conducted using R (R-Core-Team., 2014). The phyloseq package was used to import data and calculate alpha and beta diversity metrics (Mcmurdie & Holmes, 2013). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used when comparing three or more categories. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess between-group differences for changes in relative abundance of bacteria at pre and post intervention. Correlations between two continuous variables was analysed using linear regression models, using p-values to indicate the probability that the slope of the regression is zero. Differences in beta diversity (weighted and unweighted Unifrac and Bray Curtis were assessed using PERMANOVA. All p-values presented were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the FDR algorithm (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). The effect size and significance of each covariate were determined using the \u2018envfit\u2019 function in \u2018vegan\u2019 comparing the difference in the centroids of volunteer, gender, inulin and time-point relative to the total variation (Oksanen et al., 2015). All p-values derived from envfit were adjusted for multiple comparisons using FDR adjustment. Ordination was performed using NMDS based on Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity. The significance value was determined based on 10,000 permutations. Data obtained from the PAC-SYM questionnaire (Trial B only) were added up into domain scores (abdominal, stool, rectal, overall) and changes in scores between weeks 1 and 5 were calculated. As data were not numeric, a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test was then conducted to compare the change from baseline scores between treatments.",

For these volunteers all remaining samples were removed from Inulin and Placebo arms periods of the study, giving a final sample size of 20 for Inulin and Placebo. Compositional analysis showed that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla at baseline in the stool microbiota and following both arms of the intervention, with no significant differences (p\u202f>\u202f0.05) between the inulin and placebo at pre or post each arm of the intervention. Volunteers had a mean of 33% and 32% for Bacteroidetes, and 55% and 56% for Firmicutes prior to consuming the placebo or inulin, respectively (Fig. 5). At genus level in both the placebo and inulin periods of the study, the dominant bacteria were Bacteroides, Alistipes, Faecalibacterium and Subdoligranulum (Fig. 6). Following the 5 week intervention there was a marginal increase in Alistipes (p\u202f=\u202f0.61) and Bifidobacterium (p\u202f=\u202f0.33), which were not present in the placebo arm of the study, and a larger increase in Faecalibacterium (p\u202f=\u202f0.61), following inulin consumption (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 3). Following 5 weeks intervention, there were no significant changes at phylum or genus level (p\u202f>\u202f0.05) in either the placebo or inulin consumption arm of the study. We also compared the differences between pre and post inulin and placebo periods in the change from pre to post (effect size), however, none of the effects were significant (all p\u202f>\u202f0.05; Supplementary Table 3).",

This criterion was challenging to achieve. In Trial A, there was a significant increase of greater than 1 additional bowel movement per week in stool frequency between the subjects consuming inulin versus the placebo; all these subjects had low initial stool frequency. In Trial B, there was no overall effect of the inulin on stool frequency, however, many subjects in Trial B did not report a low stool frequency during the trial, notably also not for the placebo. The recorded number of stools per day for the Trial B subjects was substantially higher in the first week of the trial, in fact the average exceeded one bowel movement per day, irrespective of treatment. There are several possible explanations for this. One is a possible strong placebo effect from participating in this study (Staudacher, Irving, Lomer, & Whelan, 2017). In addition, some volunteers had very variable bowel movements during Trial B, with multiple stools on some days and none on others. This may create an impression to the subject of frequently being unable to pass stools, even though the total frequency of successful attempts was not particularly low. Prolonged screening of this parameter for 2\u20133 weeks prior to commencing the trial is recommended for future studies, preferably with all volunteers receiving a placebo product during this stage.",

This may be explained if volunteers pass fewer larger stools rather than several smaller ones, an outcome which has been previously shown upon inulin consumption (Castiglia-Delavaud et al., 1998; Causey, Feirtag, Gallaher, Tungland, & Slavin, 2000). In future studies this may be monitored using measurements of faecal output to assess if stool size is increased following inulin consumption. Irrespective of the reasons for the high initial frequency in some volunteers, we report that following inulin consumption stool frequency was marginally increased. These data suggest that volunteers with variable stool frequency may benefit from inulin in terms of improving regularity.

Irrespective of the exact aetiology, altered intestinal transit is associated with altered bacterial composition and gut microbiota dysbiosis (VAN Felius et al., 2003). Inulin has been shown to improve bowel movements, GI symptoms, quality of life and increase faecal output in various adult populations (Castiglia-Delavaud et al., 1998; Den Hond et al., 2000; Marteau et al., 2011; Vandeputte et al., 2017a). These improvements have generally been associated with modest changes in gut microbiota composition, specifically Bifidobacteria, but also with Bilophila, Anaerostipes and Clostridium in constipated subjects amongst others (Dewulf et al., 2013; Kim, Lee, & Meyer, 2007; Linetzky Waitzberg et al., 2012; Vandeputte et al., 2017a). These changes are likely due to the ability of inulin to reach the colon where it is fermented by bacteria, producing short chain fatty acids, which are recognised as health promoting metabolites (Kau, Ahern, Griffin, Goodman, & Gordon, 2011).",

This could ultimately affect the delivery of nutrients to the gut microbiota, influence luminal pH and environmental conditions. In contrast to previous studies (Schaafsma & Slavin, 2015; Vandeputte et al., 2017a), we did not report any significant changes in specific bacterial taxa, notably Bifidobacterium, or changes in alpha or beta diversity. This outcome may be due to the small number of subjects, population selected, geographical location, inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or other aspects of the study design. There is evidence in animal studies to show that the response to inulin may be dependent upon the gut microbiota composition at study commencement (Rodriguez et al., 2018). Here we reported non-significant increases in Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium and Alistipes, all of which are associated with gut health, including increased bacterial diversity, reduced triglycerides (Zhernakova et al., 2016), metabolic control and short chain fatty acid production (Varela et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2015). In contrast to previously published studies (Dewulf et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2007; Linetzky Waitzberg et al., 2012; Vandeputte et al., 2017a) we did not report any significant changes in gut microbiota composition, despite the improvements in stool frequency. The present study may not have been sufficiently powered to detect these differences, in particular considering the effect of the initial gut microbiota composition as previously suggested (De Preter et al., 2008; Bouhnik et al., 2004). For example De Preter et al. (2008) reported that the relative increase in Bifidobacteria were dependent on the initial concentrations of Bifidobacteria following inulin consumption in healthy volunteers. However from the perspective of contributing data to future meta-analyses on this subject, it is noticeable that the directions of the observed trends generally correspond well with the significant effects in other studies.
