Stool samples were collected without additives, refrigerated in an insulated container, processed within 24 hours, and stored frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until sequencing. DNA extracted from fecal samples was subjected to amplification of the V4/V5 variable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA genes using barcoded primers targeted to conserved sequences.9,10 Purified polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, and 16S paired-end reads were merged and demultiplexed. The UPARSE pipeline was used to perform quality and error filtering using maximum expected error (Emax = 1), and reads with >97% identity were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs).11 A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a sequence alignment of all OTUs. All analyses were performed using R (version 3.5.0; R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and the phyloseq software package.12 We used the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method to analyze relationships between microbiota and MRD status using autologous stem cell transplantation as a subclass parameter.13 LEfSe output was filtered for species present in 10 patients with average relative abundance >0.01 and subjected to Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Taxa with FDR <0.10 were considered sufficiently promising. Comparison of \u03b1 diversity metrics was assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

We performed a differential abundance analysis of these selected taxa in MRD+ and MRD\u2212 patients at the genus and species levels. Relative abundances of genus Eubacterium and genus Faecalibacterium were higher in MRD\u2212 compared with MRD+ patients (Eubacterium: MRD\u2212: median, 4.71%; IQR, 2.88%-6.98% vs MRD+: median, 3.17%; IQR, 1.44%-3.84%; Faecalibacterium: MRD\u2212: median, 1.43%; IQR, 0.77%-6.43% vs MRD+: median, 0.003%; IQR, 0%-2.55%; Figure 1B). Both E hallii and F prausnitzii were enriched in MRD\u2212 compared with MRD+ patients (E hallii: MRD\u2212 : median, 3.16%; IQR, 2.11%-5% vs MRD+: median, 1.01%; IQR, 0%-2.16%; F prausnitzii: MRD\u2212: median, 1.43%; IQR, 0.77%-6.43% vs MRD+: median, 0.003%; IQR, 0%-2.55%). Covariates associated with differential abundance of E hallii and F prausnitzii revealed an association with age <65 years and sex, respectively, for the 2 species (Figure 1C). Sex hormone levels were not assessed on study. In a post hoc analysis, relapsed vs postinduction status was not associated with differential abundance of these 2 microbes (data not shown). We did not observe an association with treatment type, immunoglobulin isotype, or serum immunoglobulin concentrations.",

We additionally identified F prausnitzii as another microbe potentially associated with MRD\u2212 status after initial therapy for MM. Our results are novel and support the concept that intestinal microbiota composition is associated with deep treatment response. Future studies are needed to confirm our findings in larger cohorts and enable additional characterization of the relationships between disease characteristics (eg, isotype or cytogenetics) vs overall health status in microbial composition in the gut as it relates to treatment response. More broadly, preclinical studies are needed to better understand the molecular relationship between microbiome signature and clinical outcome in myeloma as well as other hematologic malignancies.",
