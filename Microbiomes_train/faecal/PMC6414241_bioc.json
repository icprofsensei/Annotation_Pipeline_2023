The objective of this study was to compare the gut microbiome composition between young adult and geriatric nonhuman primates (marmosets) as a model of human health and disease. Stool samples were collected from geriatric (8+ years) and young adult males (2\u20135 years). Stool 16s rRNA V4 sequences were amplified and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units and classified via mothur\u2019s Bayesian classifier referenced against the Greengenes database. A total of 10 young adult and 10 geriatric marmosets were included. Geriatric marmosets had a lower mean Shannon diversity compared to young marmosets (3.15 vs. 3.46; p=0.0191). Geriatric marmosets had a significantly higher mean abundance of Proteobacteria (0.22 vs. 0.09; p=0.0233) and lower abundance of Firmicutes (0.15 vs. 0.19; p=0.0032) compared to young marmosets. Geriatric marmosets had a significantly higher abundance of Succinivibrionaceae (0.16 vs. 0.01; p=0.0191) and lower abundance of Porphyromonadaceae (0.07 vs. 0.11; p=0.0494). In summary, geriatric marmosets had significantly altered microbiome diversity and composition compared to young adult marmosets. Further studies are needed to test microbiome-targeted therapies to improve healthspan and lifespan.",

Trillions of microorganisms live commensally within the gut and serve several important physiological functions, including protection against pathogens, immune response regulation, nutrient and energy extraction, and hormone biosynthesis (Belkaid & Hand, 2014; Lynch & Pedersen, 2016). Intestinal microbial diversity in nonhuman primates has been found to be tightly linked to the host phylogeny (Yildirim et al., 2010), to the social group that the individuals are interacting with (Amato et al., 2017), and to the components of their dietary intake (Hicks et al., 2018).",

Evaluations of nonhuman primates in captive settings have revealed significant loss of microbial diversity for animals maintained in captivity when compared to the same species in wild, or semi-captive settings (Clayton, Gomez, et al., 2018; Clayton et al., 2016). This shift in diversity appears to be associated with changes in dietary components. Red-shanked doucs in captivity have been found to have increased dysbiosis associated with significantly reduced Firmicutes: Bacterioidetes ratios associated with increased risk of wasting syndrome, gastrointestinal disease, and mortality (Clayton, Al-Ghalith, et al., 2018). An evaluation of a macaque model of obesity revealed that the dam\u2019s dietary intake and not her status as obese or lean significantly altered the infant\u2019s developing intestinal microbiome (Ma et al., 2014). In humans, dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cardiovascular disease, and frailty (Barlow, Yu, & Mathur, 2015; Jackson et al., 2016; Komaroff, 2017). In many cases, it remains unclear whether changes in the microbiome are a result of the disease or whether alterations in the microbiome leave the host vulnerable for physiological changes contributing to the disease state.",

A shift in the microbiota toward a Bacteriodetes dominated population is associated with frailer older humans (Jeffery, Lynch, & O\u2019Toole, 2016). Centenarians have been found to have significantly increased populations of pathobionts including Bacteriodetes and Proteobacteria and shifts in Firmicutes diversity (Rampelli et al., 2013). However, these shifts in the gut microbial community are also associated with changes in the diet to low fiber diets with less macronutrient diversity typical of nursing home meals. Therefore, it is unclear whether the microbial shift is a result a dietary change, or whether the microbial shift is associated with the aging process and leads to inflammation and disease. These confounders make the study of the microbiome in aging humans particularly challenging.",

The marmoset offers a unique nonhuman primate in which to evaluate hypotheses associated with both aging and healthspan. Marmosets have a short lifespan when compared to other primates; they reach sexual maturity between 12\u201318 months and full adult weight by 24 months (Tardif, Mansfield, Ratnam, Ross, & Ziegler, 2011). They are considered young adults from 2\u20135 years of age and are considered geriatric over the age of 8 years. Marmosets are relatively inexpensive to house, and they are not zoonotic hosts making them easier and safer to handle for experimentation than many other nonhuman primate biomedical models. Furthermore, the recent expansion of phenotypic assessments of aging have found that marmosets display many aging characteristics that mimic human aging, including cardiovascular changes, inflammatory disease, and cognitive decline (Ross, Davis, Dobek, & Tardif, 2012) (other manuscripts in this special issue). Therefore, our study objective was to compare the gut microbial diversity and composition between young adult and geriatric marmosets. We hypothesized that geriatric marmosets would have significantly less diverse and compositionally different microbiomes than young adult marmosets independent of differences in diet or housing.",

The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UT Health San Antonio, and follows guidelines set forth by the American Society of Primatologists. Marmosets housed at the Barshop Institute are primarily a breeding colony of animals maintained in barrier (Ross et al., 2017) or semi-barrier conditions (isolated from other nonhuman primates) specifically for aging related research with husbandry protocols following those outlined in (Layne & Power, 2003). The marmosets are maintained on a daily standardized base diet consisting of a mix of commercial products (Harlan Teklad marmoset purified diet, Purina Mazuri, and Zupreem marmoset diet; Table 1). Marmosets in the colony receive limited dietary enrichment items including cheerios, marshmallows and peanuts. Eligibility criteria for the study included animals that were not receiving intervention including probiotics, antibiotics, or rapamycin treatment, and had no recent medical concerns. At the time of the study the Barshop colony consisted of 5 males and 3 females over the age of 10, and 7 males aged 8\u20139 that met the eligibility criteria. The colony also had 23 males and 23 females that were considered young adult age (2\u20135) that met eligibility criteria. Given the limitation in number of geriatric female marmosets in our population, this analysis focused on determining whether geriatric male marmoset microbiomes differed from young marmosets. While there is no evidence in the human literature that male and female gut microbiota populations differ significantly, potential sex differences have not been explored in geriatric populations and it remains unclear what effects the changes in sexually specific endocrine cycles might have on the microbiome (Duncan, Colman, & Kramer, 2012; Ja\u0161arevi\u0107, Morrison, & Bale, 2016). In this analysis, we assessed 10 geriatric males (8+ years; mean (\u00b1 SD) age was 10.2 (\u00b12.03) years) and 10 young adult males (2\u20135 years; mean 3.1 (\u00b10.7) years) which were randomly selected from the available animals to assess intestinal microbial diversity. None of these animals had a history of disease, diarrhea or dietary shift; all known medical history is outlined in Table 2. A fresh stool sample was collected from each animal, placed in a sterile collection tube and frozen at \u221280\u02da C until shipment for analysis.",

First, sequenced paired-end reads were merged and resulting sequences were compared to a reference database at Second Genome (StrainSelect) using USEARCH (Edgar, 2010). All sequences matching to a unique strain with an identity \u226599% were assigned a strain OTU, which represents \u226599% identical match to a biological sequence within the database. A difference of \u22650.25% between the identity of the best hit and the second best hit was required (e.g., 99.75 versus 99.5). For each strain OTU, one of the matching reads was selected as representative and all sequences were mapped by USEARCH against the strain OTU representatives to calculate strain abundances. The remaining non-strain sequences were quality filtered and de-replicated with USEARCH. Sequences that did not match the reference database then underwent de novo OTU clustering using the UPARSE clustering algorithm, which clusters sequences at 97% similarity (Edgar, 2013). The 97% threshold was derived from a study that found that most strains had 97% 16S rRNA sequence similarity (Konstantinidis & Tiedje, 2005). The UPARSE clustering algorithm comprises a chimera filtering and discards likely chimeric OTUs. All non-strain sequences that passed the quality filtering were mapped to the representative consensus sequences to generate an abundance table for de novo OTUs. All generated OTU sequences were assigned taxonomic classification via Mothur\u2019s bayesian classifier,(Schloss et al., 2009) trained against the Greengenes reference database of 16S rRNA gene sequences clustered at 99% (McDonald et al., 2012). Removal of spurious OTUs was completed by independent filtering, such that OTUs that were seen in at least 10% of the dataset were kept.",

Abundance-weighted sample pair-wise differences were calculated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (Bray & Curtis, 1957). PERMANOVA was used to determine if age significantly contributed to beta diversity of samples. Univariate differential abundance of OTUs was tested using a negative binomial noise model for the overdispersion and Poisson process intrinsic to these data, as implemented in the DESeq2 package (Love, Huber, & Anders, 2014), and described for microbiome applications (McMurdie & Holmes, 2014).

Investigating causality and associations of microbiome change within the human population, or in wild primate populations, is broadly confounded by the inability to control for these environmental and dietary exposures. Further, it is difficult to determine the associations of microbial dysbiosis with human disease due to the inability to control for, or often account for pharmaceutical treatments. In order to determine whether changes in microbial diversity are associated with phenotypic aging, it is necessary to examine microbiome diversity in an animal model, preferably a closely related nonhuman primate species, which can be evaluated in captivity in a somewhat controlled exposure environment. This cross-sectional analysis of young adult and geriatric male marmosets identified significant differences in gut microbiome diversity and composition, with partial clustering of samples by age. Specifically, we found a less diverse microbiota that favored expansion of Proteobacteria and a reduction in the dominant Firmicutes phylum in geriatric marmosets compared to younger adult marmosets. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effect of old age on the microbiome in a nonhuman primate.",

In healthy human adults, the gut microbiota measured at the bacterial phyla level is relatively stable, though bacterial species can greatly differ between individuals (Yatsunenko et al., 2012). Despite this variation, the overall functional capacity of the microbiome is similar across healthy persons (Qin et al., 2010). In contrast, the microbiome becomes less diverse in the elderly, with microbiota composition significantly correlated with measures of frailty, comorbidities, and inflammation (Claesson et al., 2012). Increasing populations of pathobionts have been found in the gut microbiota of centenarians with increased prevalence of Bacteriodetes and Proteobacteria in comparison to young adults (Rampelli et al., 2013) (Biagi et al., 2010).",

                    "text": "The etiology of age-related microbiome changes is not well-defined; however, associations seen between dysbiosis and inflammatory conditions suggest a possible explanation. First, commensal bacteria are a critical regulator of the inflammatory response to acute injury and infection (Belkaid & Hand, 2014). Numerous animal studies and some human studies have noted increased inflammatory markers, as well as inflammatory conditions due to dysbiosis (Buford, 2017). Inflammatory conditions, like inflammatory bowel diseases, are associated with a reduction in species diversity and change in the abundance of bacterial taxa; obligate anaerobes from Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes decrease in abundance while facultative anaerobes from the Proteobacteria phyla are enriched (Buford, 2017). These changes could potentiate the inflammatory response. On the other hand, age-related changes, ranging from gut motility and cellular function to broad shifts in environmental exposure, could contribute to dysbiosis. Exposure to medications, like antibiotics, can also severely disrupt the microbiota and it may never fully recover to its original composition (Dethlefsen, Huse, Sogin, & Relman, 2008; Dethlefsen & Relman, 2011). Broad-spectrum antibiotic use has increased among older adults in recent years, which could contribute to alterations in the microbiome seen in this group (Lee GC, 2014). Physical activity and diet, including dietary preference and nutrient availability, may also change with age, both of which can impact microbiome composition (Blaser & Falkow, 2009). These environmental confounds make it particularly difficult to determine the causal links between microbiome health and healthy aging in human aging populations. Evaluating microbial health in a nonhuman primate model in association with aging is the first step in determining whether evaluations of microbial health may serve as a biomarker for increased risk of unhealthy aging.",

                    "text": "While it is impossible to control for all environmental factors in a study examining nonhuman primates, this study examined animals that had lived in the same stable environment for several years, had the same diet that did not change with age, and had known medical exposure over the course of their lifetime. The males in this study were housed singly or with female pair-mate, none of the lived with each other, and none were closely related to each other. The males in this study had no previous exposure to oral antibiotics throughout their lifetime. While the geriatric males had almost all undergone vasectomy several years prior to this study, antibiotics are not standardly given during this procedure. The males examined originated from different colonies but had been in the Barshop colony for at least one year prior to sampling. Only one male had a medical history that included exposure to probiotic treatment, which was provided to the entire family group that he was housed with at the time. Three young males had participated in a study that included dosing with acarbose for two weeks one year prior to this microbiome study. Given the medical histories for the animals that were sampled and the fact that we found a significant alteration in the microbiome associated with age it suggests that changes in microbial diversity in aging subjects may be independent of changes associated with environmental and lifestyle shifts. There are no known husbandry, housing or dietary components that can be used to explain why three geriatric animals clustered more closely with the younger animals. As a short-term cross sectional study that only examined male marmosets, it is possible that the differences found between these young adult and geriatric marmosets do not reflect longitudinal microbiome changes, and it might not be generalizable to female subjects, which will need to be evaluated in the future as geriatric female marmosets become available. However, these findings strongly suggest that further work is needed to evaluate microbiome diversity in geriatric populations of nonhuman primate models in order to determine the causes of declining microbial diversity in aging individuals and to determine how shifts in diversity relate to measures of healthspan. Of particular importance for marmoset aging will be the ability to evaluate the associations between changes in microbial diversity and gut functionality associated with digestibility. Microbiome shifts with age may be a precursor biomarker for age related health decline, and the ability to identify specific targets for changes in diversity may help us to identify individuals at risk for more rapid decline. In summary, geriatric marmosets had significantly altered microbiome diversity and composition compared to young marmosets. These findings indicate a potential role of the gut microbiome in aging nonhuman primate and human health. Further studies are needed to test microbiome-targeted therapies to improve healthspan and lifespan. This work broadens our knowledge of microbial diversity and its association with aging, aside from environmental confounds. This is particularly important for the development of biomarkers for healthy aging as well as potentially offering therapeutic targets for healthy aging interventions.",
