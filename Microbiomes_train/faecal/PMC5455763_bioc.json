These are all members of the family Eubacteriaceae. An additional 15 OTUs were identified as Peptococcus niger, a member of the related family Peptococcaceae. In the whole cohort, the majority (67%) of the abundance of crOTU 1614 was attributable to E. limosum, with lesser contributions from A. stercorihominis and P. niger (15% each; Data Supplement). The OTU sequences that define the composition of this cluster are presented in FASTA format (Data Supplement). Thus, in this cohort of allo-HCT recipients, a cluster of species predominantly comprising E. limosum and other related bacteria was associated with a decreased risk of relapse/POD.",

To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of allo-HCT patients assembled for this type of analysis to date. A discovery-validation approach was used to identify an association (Fig 2) between the abundance of a particular subset of intestinal bacteria and a decreased risk of relapse/POD after allo-HCT. In contrast, the overall diversity of the intestinal microbiota was not associated with relapse/POD. (Data Supplement). This is consistent with our previous observation in a much smaller cohort that diversity of the intestinal flora measured at the time of posttransplantation neutrophil engraftment was not associated with relapse-related mortality.24",

In an exploratory subset analysis, the association of the microbial biomarker with a lower risk of relapse/POD was strongest among recipients of grafts containing T cells and other mature lymphocytes (Fig 4). In these patients, there is a greater role for donor-cell\u2013mediated GVT activity compared with recipients of T-cell\u2013depleted grafts, which suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota could modulate GVT activity. This interpretation is interesting in light of an emerging appreciation of interactions between the intestinal microbiota and systemic immunity,38 which include antitumor immune reactions.25-31",

In fact, when standard taxonomic classifications were evaluated, neither the family Eubacteriaceae as a whole, nor the genus Eubacterium, had a significant association with relapse/POD (data not shown). Of note, the main OTU that represented E. limosum was itself associated with reduced risk of relapse (Data Supplement).
