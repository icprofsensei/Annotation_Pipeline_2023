Studies have identified a strong genetic component with disease. Several genetic variants have been located within genes of the HLA region, in fact, 85\u201395% of CeD subjects carry at least one variant of the HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 allele.However, carriers of these variant do not necessarilydevelop the disease. Indeed, although about 40% of the general population are thought to carry the HLA risk allele, only 2\u20135 % of healthy carriers will develop CeD over time. Recent findings suggest that the microbiota is a contributing factor toward the onset of CeD, however no preexiting celiac microbial signature has been identified.",

Genotyping was performed using the HumanCoreEXOME chip and imputed to the 1KG genome imputation panel. Seven subjects had bacterial 16S rDNA from stool sequenced using MiSeq Illumina platform after amplification of the V4 hypervariable region. Closed reference operational taxonomic unit picking was performed against GreenGenes database (v 13_8) using QIIME (v1.9) pipeline.Four controls matched for Age, gender, and DQ2.2, DQ2.5, DQ4, and DQ8 allele. The relative abundanceof 230 taxa were compared using a conditional logistic regression. Covariates of the model included total number of reads per sample.",
