Our primary findings showed that the overall species richness (alpha diversity indexes) of the microbiota was higher in patients than in controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Distance\u2010based community analysis revealed that the microbiota differed substantially within all subgroups of patients and controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The relative abundance of species heatmap showed a tendency toward depletion for some commensal genera, such as Prevotella_6, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and other short\u2010chain fatty acid (SCFA)\u2010producing bacteria. Additionally, our results showed that all subgroups had a distinct bacterial species, with an increase in the genus Fusobacterium in the acute phase group and the genera Streptococcus and Parabacteroides in patients with relapse. However, the genus Bacteroides was very abundant in patients without relapse. Although the findings regarding the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratios across the four comparison groups were not statistically significant, the F/B ratio gradually increased in patients from the acute phase group (0.87), to the disease remission group with relapse (1.06), to the group without relapse (1.28), to the healthy group (1.63).",

However, the genus Bacteroides was more abundant in patients in the AE3 group.

Although the healthy controls were enrolled with matched age, sex, BMI, eating habits, and geographical space, and we further used diet data to control for the microbiome findings, there was no global differences in the overall composition of the gut microbiota between patients and controls (see Figure \u200bFigure4)4) but rather on the level of microbiota abundance in our study (see Figure \u200bFigure6),6), which is an interesting phenomenon, since this clustering profile distincts from most other systematic (auto)immune diseases.13, 14 In this study, fecal microbial diversity was unexpectedly somewhat greater in anti\u2010NMDAR encephalitis patients. Although a greater bacterial diversity could be potentially beneficial to human health,15 increased gut microbe diversity and richness were also detected in some disease situations, for example depression16 and autism.17 The precise role of the microbiota in central nervous system diseases remains open to debate. The remarkable deviation in beta diversity in the microbiota composition structure of the AE2 group, which indicates a latent role of hard\u2010to\u2010correct fecal flora dysbiosis, might be associated with susceptibility to recurrence exacerbation and contribute to resistance to immunotherapy.",

Considering that patients with autoimmune disease exhibit intestinal dysbiosis, we wanted to determine whether an altered F/B ratio might be associated with the fecal microbial composition in anti\u2010NMDAR encephalitis patients. We observed the direction of the lowest F/B ratio in the acute disease stage, which is in stark contrast with an earlier study appearing in a significant increase in the F/B ratio associated with immune disorder and obesity\u2010related diseases.18, 19 However, lower F/B ratios were also observed in primary systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus patients.14 Therefore, the precise consequences of a decreased F/B ratio for NMDAR encephalitis remain unclear. We conjectured that dietary differences between Western and Eastern countries and medications taken before the window of our investigation (such as prior usage of steroids and anti\u2010epilepsy or antipsychotic drugs) may have also contributed to differences in bacterial composition. Overall, our findings supported a potential link between a lower F/B ratio and the acute phase of this autoimmune disease.",

It is possible to speculate that during Streptococcus infection, antistreptococcal or anti\u2010neuronal antibodies are generated by mediating the destruction of healthy neurons (via the NMDAR) through a molecular mimicry mechanism.25 Some studies have reported that Parabacteroides have immunoregulatory functions. And, greater abundance of the genus Parabacteroides has been found in mice exposed to social stressors26 and related to abnormalities of depression symptoms and inflammatory cytokines in human.27 Therefore, we presumed that patients with recurrence enrich the genus Parabacteroides might correlate with behavior impairments.",

Our investigation of the gut microbiota in patients with anti\u2010NMDAR encephalitis provides initial insights into the association between the fecal microbiome and this antibody\u2010mediated disease. An altered microbiome due to the presence of disease would contribute to future prognosis and recurrence in some individuals. Nonetheless, our study has certain limitations. First, we cannot simply assign a direct link between the gut microbiome and the etiology of anti\u2010NMDAR encephalitis. The gut microbiota is merely one of the several component risk factors that make people more susceptible to this disease. Conversely, fecal microbiota dysbiosis is likely a presentation of the illness. Second, we used strict exclusion criteria to minimize the effects of confounders and eliminate the potential influence of gastrointestinal condition factors. Medications taken before the window of our investigation (such as prior usage of steroids and anti\u2010epilepsy or antipsychotic drug) may also influence gut microbiota composition. Furthermore, our study cohort is relatively small due to the rarity of the cases, and longitudinal collection of samples will be needed to investigate clinical characteristic and phenotype associations with altered fecal microbiota, such as cognitive function, residual symptoms, severity of disease, and efficacy in immunotherapy. Finally, although phylotype profiles of the fecal microbial were produced using\u2009hypervariable\u2009tag\u2009sequencing\u2009of\u2009the\u2009V4\u2009region of the\u200916S\u2009rDNA\u2009gene, the use of shotgun metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic analyses might further reveal subtle network interference in fecal microbial genes, their expression, and the presence of microbial metabolites, which would elucidate the mechanism of antibody\u2010mediated encephalitis disease occurrence and supplement the phylogenic and taxonomic data. Therefore, future studies are needed to shed light on how the sophisticated \u201cgut\u2010brain\u2010axis\u201d participates in the promotion of anti\u2010NMDAR encephalitis.",
