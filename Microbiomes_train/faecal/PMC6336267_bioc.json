An important reservoir from which bacterial pathogens can acquire resistance is the human gut microbiota. However, thus far, a substantial fraction of the gut microbiota remains uncultivated and has been little-studied with respect to its resistance reservoir-function. Here, we aimed to isolate yet uncultivated resistant gut bacteria by a targeted approach. Therefore, faecal samples from 20 intensive care patients who had received the prophylactic antibiotic treatment selective digestive decontamination (SDD), i.e. tobramycin, polymyxin E, amphotericin B and cefotaxime, were inoculated anaerobically on porous aluminium oxide chips placed on top of poor and rich agar media, including media supplemented with the SDD antibiotics. Biomass growing on the chips was analysed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, showing large inter-individual differences in bacterial cultivability, and enrichment of a range of taxonomically diverse operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Furthermore, growth of Ruminococcaceae (2 OTUs), Enterobacteriaceae (6 OTUs) and Lachnospiraceae (4 OTUs) was significantly inhibited by the SDD antibiotics. Strains belonging to 16 OTUs were candidates for cultivation to pure culture as they shared \u226495% sequence identity with the closest type strain and had a relative abundance of \u22652%. Six of these OTUs were detected on media containing SDD antibiotics, and as such were prime candidates to be studied regarding antibiotic resistance. One of these six OTUs was obtained in pure culture using targeted isolation. This novel strain was resistant to the antibiotics metrodinazole and imipenem. It was initially classified as member of the Ruminococcaceae, though later it was found to share 99% nucleotide identity with the recently published Sellimonas intestinalis BR72T. In conclusion, we show that high-throughput cultivation-based screening of microbial communities can guide targeted isolation of bacteria that serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance.",

A common route through which pathogens can acquire resistance is by genetic exchange with human-associated bacteria, and especially the gut microbiota [1\u20133]. Indeed, it has been shown that the commensal gut microbiota harbours diverse resistance genes [4, 5], that these genes are regularly expressed [6] and that such genes can be acquired by (opportunistic) pathogens [7]. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is considered the main mechanism by which resistance genes are disseminated, and it has been shown that HGT events occur exceedingly more often in the gut microbiota than in other environments with complex bacterial communities [8].",

Recent methodical advances include cultivation inside chambers placed in the native environment [15\u201317], the use of custom-designed media [18, 19], application of multi-well micro culture chips [20], high-throughput identification of isolates [21], and microfluidic cultivation [22]. Furthermore, a recent study by Rettedal and co-authors combined high-throughput sequencing with selective cultivation conditions, allowing cultivation of previously uncultured species from the human gut by a targeted approach [23]. To this end, the authors used, among other criteria, the \u201cmost wanted\u201d list of microbial taxa that has recently been introduced in order to guide efforts towards the cultivation of human gut bacteria [24]. In short, the most wanted list contains human-associated bacterial taxa of which the genome has not yet been sequenced, not considering whether members of these taxa from other environments might already have been sequenced. High priority most wanted taxa were defined as those of which the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) centroid read shared less than 90% identity with either the GOLD-Human or Human Microbiome Project (HMP) strains, and which were detected in at least 20% of samples from any body habitat analysed. Medium priority taxa are those that share between 90% and 98% identity with the same habitat prevalence threshold. Antibiotic resistance has not played a role in the determination of the most-wanted list, though resistance features in these species may be relevant to the dissemination of resistance in the human gut.",

                    "text": "In most Dutch hospitals, patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) receive prophylactic antibiotic therapies, of which selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) is currently the most common treatment. SDD combines the application of tobramycin, polymyxin E and amphotericin B in the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract with a short systemic administration of a third-generation cephalosporin. The therapy aims to eradicate potential pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae and fungi while maintaining the anaerobic members of the microbiota [25]. SDD therapy has been shown to decrease infections and mortality of ICU patients [26, 27]. Although a meta-analysis showed that SDD therapy resulted in a decrease in resistance carriage with respect to cultivable bacteria [28], a recent case study [14] and a more extensive follow-up with 13 ICU patients [29] indicated that prophylactic therapy may in fact increase resistance gene carriage among mostly uncultivated anaerobic gut residents. It was speculated that the expanded resistome, i.e. the collection of all resistance genes in a bacterial community [30], might thereby increase the risk of potential pathogens becoming resistant in the future. Indeed, the risk that pathogens develop antibiotic resistance is a major concern that has prohibited wide implementation of prophylactic therapies [28]. In view of the above, it is clear that the role of uncultivated anaerobic bacteria in the emergence of resistance pathogens merits deeper investigation.",

The forward and reverse primers of each sample contained an identical 8-nt barcode. Therefore, barcodes needed to match in order for reads to be retained. OTUs were picked using the script OTU_picking_pair_end_read.sh with the minimal threshold for detectable OTUs set at 0.1% abundance, the error clustering percentage set at 0.985, and both the length of the forward and the reverse read set at 100. OTUs were filtered for plausible chimaeras according to the principle outlined by the developers of NG-tax [38]. The OTUs were annotated using SILVA release 111 [39] as a reference. The quality of the sequencing was controlled by including a mock community sample in each library. The mock community, which consisted of a fixed ratio of 16S rRNA amplicon DNA of different bacterial species (S3 Table), was developed in-house [38]. The sample preparation for the mock community started at the first PCR step, after which it was treated identical to the other samples. The output OTU table and centroid OTU sequences were used as input for detection of most wanted [24] and novel species. For statistical analyses, we rarefied the OTU table to 2,500 reads per sample with the QIIME [40] script single_rarefaction.py. Samples with less than 2,500 reads were excluded.",

Shannon diversity, richness and phylogenetic diversity whole tree metrics of bacterial communities were also calculated using QIIME. The two-tailed t-test without assuming equal variance was used to investigate if Shannon, richness and whole-tree phylogenetic diversity values of bacterial communities differed significantly when grouped according to experimental variables (e.g. growth medium or supplementation of the medium with antibiotics). The t-test used averaged values for biological and technical replicates. The QIIME script compare_taxa_summaries.py was used to calculate Pearson correlation coefficients of OTU-level taxa between mock communities and their theoretical composition. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) as implemented in Canoco 5 [41] was used to investigate, which variables could best explain the variation in bacterial composition between bacterial communities. Linear mixed-effect models were fitted by the R package \u201clmerTest\u201d (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lmerTest) [42] in order to analyse how media type and addition of antibiotics affected bacterial composition. As input an adapted OTU table was used in which values were log1p transformed to meet normality assumptions. Furthermore, OTUs were removed from the table if they were detected in <5 samples or by <50 reads across all samples. Parameter-specific p-values were obtained by using the Satterthwaite approximation. P-values were corrected for multiple testing by the function p.adjust in the package \u201cstats\u201d, using methods \u201cBonferroni\u201d and \u201cBH\u201d.

Agar media inoculated with the lowest dilution of faecal material and in absence of antibiotics always yielded confluent growth on GAM media, whereas on CP media confluent growth was observed on 34 of 40 PAO chips (S4 Table). Growth on most PAO chips (371 of 480) was confluent as opposed to colonies that could be visually distinguished (Fig 1A). In general, a smaller number of colonies developed on media if the faecal material was inoculated at a higher dilution, if the media contained the SDD cocktail of antibiotics, and if the faecal material was inoculated on CP media.

Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were detected at the highest relative abundance in the corresponding growth communities on GAM and CP media, together comprising on average >80% of the bacterial growth communities. On GAM agar without antibiotics, Proteobacteria on average constituted 5.10% \u00b1 16.7 of the communities whereas on GAM agar with the SDD cocktail (GAM-SDD), proteobacterial relative abundance was 0.03% \u00b1 0.14. Similarly, on CP-SDD media, Proteobacteria showed lower relative abundance (a decrease from 13.6% \u00b1 27.7 to 9.80% \u00b1 2.92) than on CP media without antibiotics. Notably, Cyanobacteria were not detected in the faecal samples or on GAM media, but they were detected on CP media averaging 0.51% \u00b1 6.40 relative abundance. The average Shannon diversity of faecal samples was significantly higher than that of growth communities grouped by medium, addition of antibiotics or dilution (two-tailed t-test, p = <0.01 for all comparisons) (Fig 2B). Lower Shannon diversity values were also observed in growth communities inoculated with more diluted faecal samples. However, this difference was only significant between communities on CP-SDD agar that was inoculated with undiluted and 100-fold diluted faecal sample (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.01). The addition of the SDD antibiotics significantly reduced the Shannon diversity on GAM media (p = <0.01) but not on CP media. Differences in OTU richness and whole-tree phylogenetic diversity between the sample groups followed the same trends as differences in Shannon diversity i.e. higher values were obtained for faecal samples and lower values were obtained if media were inoculated with more diluted faecal material or included antibiotics (S1 Fig). However, surprisingly, a higher dilution of the faecal inoculum did not affect whole-tree phylogenetic diversity on CP media without antibiotics (p = 0.81). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of OTU-level data from all bacterial communities (faecal inoculates and cultivable fractions) indicated that cultivation medium and presence/absence of antibiotics could explain in total 3.69% of the variation in bacterial composition (explanatory variable faeces; 1.36%, GAM agar; 0.89%, GAM-SDD agar; 0.73%, CP agar; 0.71%, p = 0.002). As such, most variation in the compositional data reflects inter-individual differences. However, bacterial growth on CP agar was not found to be significantly affected by the addition of the SDD cocktail of antibiotics. The dilution factor of faecal inocula was also evaluated as explanatory variable but was found to not affect bacterial composition.",

Hierarchical clustering of OTU-level data using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indicated high dissimilarity between individual faecal samples with mutual dissimilarity values being >0.8 in all but two cases (Fig 3). Growth communities derived from only 9 of 20 patients all clustered together indicating that other factors besides inoculum influenced bacterial growth. For example, growth communities of patient 131 all clustered together with mutual dissimilarity values <0.25 whereas for growth communities of patient 236 dissimilarity values exceeded 0.8. Moderate clustering by medium and presence/absence of antibiotics confirmed that cultivation conditions affected growth as was shown before by CCA. We used Bray-Curtis dissimilarity to evaluate to what extent bacterial growth communities differed from the faecal samples from which they were derived (S2 Fig). The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indices ranged from 0.49 to 1.00, with large inter-individual differences. The dissimilarity between faecal samples and their respective growth communities was not significantly affected by the applied medium, antibiotics and/or dilution of the faecal inoculum.",

We fitted linear mixed-effect models on OTU-level data so that differences between individual patients could be taken into account (S7 Table). A total of 35 OTUs were significantly enriched under the different cultivation conditions (Table 1). Considering Bonferroni-corrected p-values, a total of seven OTUs belonging to the families Bacteroidaceae (5 OTUs), Staphylococcaceae (1 OTU) and Enterococcaceae (1 OTU) were present in significantly higher abundance on GAM media as compared to the respective faecal samples. In contrast, on CP media, OTUs belonging to the families Halomonadaceae (2 OTUs), Lachnospiraceae (6 OTUs), Ruminococcaceae (1 OTU), Streptococcaceae (1 OTU), Enterococcaceae (3 OTUs), Porphyromonadaceae (2 OTUs), and Oxalobacteraceae (1 OTU) were enriched. A significantly lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae spp. (1 OTU), Enterobacteriaceae spp. (6 OTUs) and Lachnospiraceae spp. (4 OTUs) was detected on media supplemented with the SDD antibiotics in comparison to media without antibiotics, indicating that the antibiotics inhibited the growth of these bacteria.",

Thirteen high priority most wanted OTUs were detected in the growth communities; however, none of these OTUs was present at a relative abundance of >0.8% (S8 Table). Furthermore, three medium priority most wanted OTUs (OTUs 236, 172 and 288) were detected in the cultivable fraction with 1\u20133% relative abundance. Nevertheless, members of medium priority OTUs were not considered candidates for isolation because they shared 100% identity with strains that were previously isolated from non-human sources. Comparison of OTUs with the SILVA database of type strains yielded 16 OTUs with >2% relative abundance of which the OTU representative read shared <95% identity with the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the closest type strain (Table 2). Therefore, these OTUs were considered to i) potentially represent novel species, and ii) to be sufficiently abundant for isolation by colony picking. Among these 16 OTUs, OTUs 3088, 322, 3797, 2642 and 2024 were considered prime candidates for targeted isolation based on their relative abundance on the PAO chips (>5%) and novelty. OTU3088 shared 93.4% identity with the closest type strain, that is, Ruminococcus torques, and was present on GAM-SDD agar at 49.8% relative abundance (S8 Table). OTU3088 was also detected on GAM, CP and CP-SDD agar media, albeit at a lower relative abundance. We detected three additional OTUs (OTUs 3067, 3103 and 3070) at >2% relative abundance of which the closest type strain was also Ruminococcus torques. Since these three OTUs were always detected in samples that contained OTU3088, and since their representative reads shared high nucleotide identity with OTU3088 (>99%), we considered that they may be derived from the same bacterial strains. The best hits in the SILVA type strain database of OTU322 and OTU3797 were Hydrogenoanaerobacterium saccharovorans and the chloroplast of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, respectively, and both were detected at >10% relative abundance (OTU322, max. 23.9%; OTU3797, max. 13.2%). Both OTU322 and OTU3797 were only detected at >1% relative abundance on CP agar media in the absence of the SDD antibiotics. The representative read of OTU2642 shared 94.7% nucleotide identity with the 16S rRNA gene of Bacteroides ovatus. OTU2642 was only detected on GAM media at a maximum of 7.4% relative abundance. Finally, the closest type strain of OTU2024 was Oscillibacter ruminantium, and it was detected at >1% relative abundance exclusively on CP-SDD media.",

Furthermore, the fact that these OTUs grew on media containing the SDD antibiotics suggested they may be antibiotic resistance reservoir species. We prepared dilution series of the growth fractions in which these OTUs were most enriched and subsequently inoculated the diluted samples under the exact conditions that previously yielded enrichment of the target OTUs. This experiment, however, did not yield isolation of the target OTUs. Therefore, the protocol was repeated using the original faecal samples as inocula instead of the enriched growth fractions. By this method we isolated a member of OTU3088, which was demonstrated by the fact that the representative read of OTU3088 shared 100% identity with the 16S rRNA gene Sanger read of our isolate (Fig 1B). BLASTn of the 16S rRNA gene read of the isolate against the NCBI ribosomal 16S RNA sequences database showed that closely related strains (98\u201399% nucleotide identity over 1,399 nucleotides) have recently been isolated in four other laboratories. One closely related strain that was isolated from human faeces was recently published as a novel species named Sellimonas intestinalis BR72T [49]. As such, our isolate was named S. intestinalis HF3088. Antibiotic susceptibility profiling using the ATB ANA EU (08) panel showed that S. intestinalis HF3088 was resistant only to metrodinazole (4 \u03bcg/ml) and imipenem (8 \u03bcg/ml) according to the CLSI guideline. The strain was not resistant to any of the 14 other antibiotics in the panel that also included cefotaxime (10 \u03bcg/ml) (S9 Table). In addition, microdilution testing yielded MIC values of 4 \u03bcg/ml for metronidazole and 64 \u03bcg/ml for imipenem. The MIC values for the other antibiotics tested by microdilution were 16 \u03bcg/ml for tetracycline, 0.5 \u03bcg/ml for ampicillin, and 16 \u03bcg/ml ceftriaxone (S9 Table), indicating that the strain was susceptible to these antibiotics.",

We did not detect high priority taxa at >1% relative abundance in the growth communities. Medium priority taxa were detected at 1\u20133% relative abundance but they shared 100% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with strains for which the genome has been already sequenced. Therefore, due to the low relative abundance and/or high similarity to previously genome-sequenced bacteria, the detected medium and high priority taxa were not further considered prime candidates for isolation. In our second attempt, we compared the OTU centroid reads of cultivated bacteria with cultured strains in the SILVA type strain database. This yielded 16 OTUs that shared <95% nucleotide identity with type species, all of which exceeded 2% relative abundance. Based on their novelty, members of these OTUs were considered candidates for isolation. Although their prevalence in the gut microbiota is expected to be <20%, i.e. they are not on the most wanted list, understanding the biology of such populations might be highly relevant in a more personalized approach, where individual-specific microbiota signatures are considered key to success [50].",

Notably, the remaining novel OTU (OTU3797) was detected on CP agar at a maximum relative abundance of 13.2%, and shared 85.9% nucleotide identity with the best hit in the SILVA type strain database, namely the chloroplast of T. pseudonana. Chloroplasts are thought to have originated from Cyanobacteria [51], and this finding might suggest the growth of a eukaryote capable of photosynthesis. This OTU was detected in five growth communities, exclusively on CP agar without antibiotics, and exclusively on PAO chips inoculated with faecal sample from two patients. While this strengthens the case for microbial growth, we cannot exclude (environmental) contamination. T. pseudonana has been shown to grow at a wide range of salinities and temperatures [52], and to have anaerobic capabilities [53].",

Furthermore, on one PAO chip OTU3088 was detected in the presence of the SDD antibiotics at a relative abundance of 49.8%. As such, it was selected for targeted isolation, which was achieved on GAM-SDD media (Fig 1B). After isolation, the 16S rRNA gene of the isolate was found to share 99% nucleotide identity with the recently published S. intestinalis BR72T [49], and high identity (98\u201399%) with three other strains recently isolated from the human gut (accessions KT156811, LN828944 and AY960564). Therefore, even though a close relative of our isolate has been recently described, these results demonstrate that high-throughput cultivation-based screening can be used to isolate novel antibiotic resistant bacteria by a targeted approach.",

As such, the strain is a candidate to be further analysed as resistance reservoir (e.g. by genome sequencing). S. intestinalis HF3088 in pure culture was not resistant to cefotaxime. This is unexpected considering that both during initial cultivation as well as during resistance testing of the pure isolate, the concentration of this antibiotic in the medium was 10 \u03bcg/ml. However, it should be noted that antibiotics may be broken down by adjacent bacteria on the PAO chip, and hence not all bacteria that grow are by definition resistant. For example, cefotaxime may be degraded through the secretion of a \u03b2-lactamase [54, 55]. We could hypothetise that the PAO chip acts as a buffer between the agar medium and the chip surface, thereby reducing the effective concentration of the antibiotic.",

We showed that the composition of bacterial growth communities was significantly impacted by medium and by supplementation of media with antibiotics. The cocktail used in SDD therapy contains antibiotics that are predominantly active against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi [58], and was designed in order to eradicate potentially pathogenic bacteria from the gut without harming the anaerobic microbiota [25, 29]. Indeed, we found that six OTUs belonging to the genus Escherichia, one of the SDD target taxa, was present at significantly lower relative abundance on media containing the SDD cocktail. However, we also found that five OTUs belonging to the families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae was present at significantly lower relative abundance in the presence of the SDD antibiotics. Members from these families are Gram-positive and lack aerobic respiration [59], and are therefore collaterally affected by the application of the SDD antibiotics that aim to lower the risk of infection with Gram-negative aerobic opportunistic pathogens [25]. We found that the similarity between the communities in the faecal inocula and the associated growth communities varied extensively between patients. We cannot exclude that this resulted from differences in viability between cryo-preserved faecal samples. Alternatively, it may have resulted from inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition.",
