For example, the guinea pig contained considerably more of the mucin-degrading Akkermansia, as well as of the methanogenic archaea Methanobrevibacter than found in humans. Most microbiome functional categories were less abundant in guinea pigs than in humans. Exceptions included functional categories possibly reflecting dehydration/rehydration stress in the guinea pig intestine.

However, there are certain human medical conditions for which guinea pigs constitute better models than other rodents. For example, unlike that of mice and rats, the E-cadherin on the intestinal surface of guinea pigs is homologous to that of humans. This renders these animals one of the most suitable models in studies of infections with the important human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, because E-cadherin serves as the primary receptor interacting with this bacterium upon initiation of intestinal invasion \n[11], and they are frequently used as such \n[12-14]. However, only few studies exist, which describe the intestinal microbiota of guinea pigs, and none of these use a metagenomic sequencing approach \n[15,16]. As recent research indicates that the composition of the intestinal microbiota plays a role in susceptibility to intestinal infections (for a recent review, see \n[17]), we aimed to elucidate the differences between the microbiota of these commonly used infection models and the humans they are meant to simulate in more detail.",

Chao1 richness estimates confirmed these results on the above mentioned phylogenetic levels. Functional richness analysis showed the same trends, average COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) and KO (KEGG Orthology) richness per sample were lower in the human microbiome, however this was only significant for COG level (P\u2009<\u2009.001).

However the distribution of the phyla was quite different in the two hosts, as most of the less abundant phyla were more abundant in guinea pigs than in humans. Only 4 of the 26 significantly different phyla were more abundant in the human gut microbiota than in the guinea pigs (Figure\n\u200b(Figure2).2). These included the two most abundant phyla, Bacteroidetes (q\u2009=\u20090.00018) and Firmicutes (q\u2009=\u20090.02). Actinobacteria were also more abundant in humans, although this was only suggestive (P\u2009=\u20090.052, q\u2009=\u20090.062). This phylum includes the genus Bifidobacterium, that was also most abundant in humans (q\u2009=\u20090.000213) and believed to be important for human health \n[18]. A complete list of phyla with significantly different abundances in the two hosts is given in Table\n\u200bTable1.1. Thus, in guinea pigs most phyla were more abundant, while in humans the gut microbiota is dominated by fewer phyla. Specifically, the fraction of the total population constituted by Verrucomicrobia was five times more abundant in guinea pigs (2.0%) than in humans (0.37%). Furthermore, of the Verrucomicrobia found in guinea pigs, 83% were identified as bacteria belonging to the genus Akkermansia, while this was true only for 2% of the Verrucomicrobia in humans, thus the guinea pig microbiota contains considerably more Akkermansia than the microbiota of humans.

A similar clear separation between human and guinea pig samples was observed on all phylogenetic levels (data not shown). In total we found 320 of 376 genera to be significantly different between human and guinea pig microbiota (Additional file \n4: Table S1). Of these, 225 were more abundant in guinea pig, including genera such as Methanobrevibacter, Desulfovibrio, while some of the genera known to be important for butyrate formation in the human gut \n[19] including e.g. Roseburia and Faecalibacterium were less abundant in guinea pigs. Additionally, many of the genera known to contain human pathogens (Salmonella, Klebsiella, Treponema, Yersinia, Haemophilus) were also overrepresented in guinea pigs, although low in abundance. This was true also for Listeria, mainly due to an overrepresentation of L. innocua (data not shown). ",

On Subcategory level, lipid and central metabolism were overrepresented in human hosts, and this was also the case for amino acid and most other metabolic pathways (Figure\n\u200b(Figure4b).4b). Noteworthy was that mineral and organic ion transport systems as well as phenylpropanoids, pyrimidine and lipopolysaccharide metabolisms were more abundant in guinea pigs, while monosaccaride transport systems were higher in humans (Additional file \n5: Table S2). Among the functional categories covered by SEED, most of the significantly different categories were more abundant in humans than in guinea pig hosts, including mostly metabolic categories. Only few categories were more abundant in guinea pigs, including e.g. \u201cCell wall and Capsule\u201d, and \u201cDNA metabolism\u201d (Additional file \n5: Table S2, Figure\n\u200bFigure4c).4c). Of the SEED families, 73 out of 112 significantly different ones were more abundant in the human gut microbiota (Additional file \n5: TableS2). Most of the human prevalent function were thus related to metabolism, while the functions overrepresented in guinea pigs were more diverse and often related to secondary metabolisms, membrane related and/or transport systems. Of special note is that 6 out of 8 significantly different families belonging to the \u2018virulence\u2019 categories were lower abundant in the guinea pig microbiome (Additional file \n5: Table S2). In the Metacyc database most pathways were overabundant in human microbiomes (i.e. 27 out of 34 significantly different functions), however, methanogenesis and chemoautotrophic-energy-metabolism involved in hydrogen oxidation, are both overrepresented in guinea pigs. Both these pathways involved in removing H2 end-products resulting e.g. from fermentation of polysaccharides, and their overabundance could be a consequence of increased numbers of Methanobrevibacter as well as Desulfovibrio in guinea pigs (Additional file \n4: Table S1).",

Human samples as well as guinea pig samples had a fair amount of read matches to reference genes (66.7% and 60.2%, respectively) within the databases specifically created for each environment, however the fraction of assembled reads matching a cross-species database were minor at best (9.2% and 6.8% respectively, Additional file \n1: Figure S1 b). This came as a surprise to us, as it shows that the range of strains within the human and guinea pig GI system is fairly restricted and specific to each of these two species. Given that the human samples were obtained from a heterogeneous population spanning two countries (Spain and Denmark), this selectivity of the gut environment across a wide geological range for specific commensal strains is notable. This was further confirmed on species level where we were able to assign 42% of human gut microbiota reads to a reference genome database, but could only assign 10% of guinea pig gut microbiota to genomes within this database. In fact, the human gut microbiota samples did not contain a single sample with as many unassigned reads as any guinea pig sample. While we expected a certain bias in our taxonomic reference database towards gut bacteria within human hosts due to the efforts of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP, \nhttp://www.hmpdacc.org/) and the targeted genome sequencing of several typical gut microbes from humans that were included in our reference database, we were surprised by a significant bias also on all functional levels. Not only were we unable to assign the same fraction of assembled guinea pig microbiome reads to KO\u2019s, but these KO\u2019s were more often also not assigned by general purpose functional pathway databases (KEGG, metacyc, SEED).

The guinea pig microbiota is probably more specialized in degrading a more homogenous type of food than the microbiota of the omnivore human host, thus a lower diversity is needed \u2013 e.g. the human microbiome may be more diverse because it meets more diverse types of nutrients. When looking at only the two highest level KEGG functional categories, we found that metabolism, but not information processing was overrepresented in the human samples, supporting that the two types of microbiotas differ with respect to the type of materials they metabolize.",

Since guinea pigs practice coprophagy (re-ingestion of feces), the gut bacteria will have undergone repetitive cycles of dehydration/rehydration selecting for these traits, as well as for bacteria that can sustain the hostile environment of the stomach and digestive system. However, it should be noted that the SEED family containing traits directly related to desiccation stress was not overrepresented in guinea pigs.",

Specifically, guinea pig faecal samples contained a much higher fraction of bacteria belonging to the phylum Verrumicrobia, most of which (83%) were seen to be represented by Akkermansia. This genus is known to contain the species Akkermansia muciniphilia[24], which grows preferably on mucin, while only very few other carbohydrates supports its growth \n[25]. Therefore, Akkermansia muciniphila has been suggested to be useful as a biomarker for mucin degradation, and the high amount of Akkermansia present in guinea pig faeces might indicate a high turnover of mucins in these animals, perhaps partly resulting from the ingestion of fecal pellets enveloped in mucus gel. If the mucus coating the epithelium is more abundant in guinea pigs, this is relevant in relation to the widespread use of guinea pigs as models for intestinal Listeria infections \n[26,27], since the integrity and thickness of the intestinal mucus layer is known to affect the susceptibility to intestinal infection \n[28-30]. Additionally, it may be relevant for the design of such studies that Listeria were significantly more abundant in guinea pigs than in human samples (P\u2009=\u20091.4*10-7) due to an overrepresentation of the non-pathogenic L. innocua, probably originating from the commercially available feed given to these animals \n[13], which was primarily based on plant material likely to be containing L. innocua.",

Therefore, guinea pigs may represent a suitable model for humans in some types of investigations of microbiota-dependent effects including e.g. studies of bacterial gene transfer in the intestinal environment or studies addressing effects of specific feeds or foods on the presence of specific bacterial taxons. However, three major issues have been identified in this study that should be addressed in future studies using guinea pigs as models: Firstly, the huge differences existing between human and guinea pig microbiomes on genus level, as well as the significant differences in the metabolic function of these ecosystems should be taken into account when applying guinea pigs as models for humans in such studies. Secondly, particularly the large amount of Akkermansia, probably indicating a large relative amount of mucin in these animals, should be kept in mind when guinea pigs are used as human models in studies where the integrity of the intestinal barrier is of importance, and thirdly, the larger phylum diversity observed in guinea pigs should be taken into consideration when relevant.",

Then, the high-quality reads of each DNA sample were assembled by the SOAP de novo assembler \n[31] to contig level. Sequences were processed one by one and the de Bruijn graph data format was used to store the overlap information among the sequences. Overlap paths supported by a single read were unreliable and were removed. Short low-depth tips and bubbles that were caused by sequencing errors or genetic variations between microbial strains were trimmed and merged, respectively. Read paths were used to solve the tiny repeats. Subsequently, we broke the connections at repeat boundaries, and outputted the continuous sequences with unambiguous connections as contigs. The metagenomic special model was chosen, and parameter \u2018-K 23\u2019 were used for 75 bp reads. The statistics for this assembly are given in Additional file \n6: Table S3.",
