To explore a potential impact of electrochemically reduced alkaline (pH\u2009\u2248\u20099) versus neutral (pH\u2009\u2248\u20097) drinking water (2\u2009L/day) on human intestinal microbiota and host glucose metabolism we conducted a randomized, non-blinded, cross-over study (two 2-week intervention periods, separated by a 3-week wash-out) in 29 healthy, non-smoking Danish men, aged 18 to 35 years, with a body mass index between 20.0 to 27.0\u2009kg m-2. Volunteers were ineligible if they had previously had abdominal surgery, had not been weight stabile for at least two months, had received antibiotic treatment within 2 months, or had a habitual consumption of caloric or artificially sweetened beverages in excess of 1\u2009L/week or an average intake of alcohol in excess of 7 units/week. Microbial DNA was extracted from faecal samples collected at four time points, before and after each intervention, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Illumina MiSeq, V4 region). Glycaemic regulation was evaluated by means of an oral glucose tolerance test.No differential effect of alkaline versus neutral drinking water was observed for the primary outcome, overall gut microbiota diversity as represented by Shannon\u2019s index. Similarly, neither a differential effect on microbiota richness or community structure was observed. Nor did we observe a differential effect on the abundance of individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or genera. However, analyses of within period effects revealed a significant (false discovery rate \u22645%) increase in the relative abundance of 9 OTUs assigned to order Clostridiales, family Ruminococcaceae, genus Bacteroides, and species Prevotella copri, indicating a potential effect of quantitative or qualitative changes in habitual drinking habits. An increase in the concentration of plasma glucose at 30\u2009minutes and the incremental area under the curve of plasma glucose from 0 30 and 0 120\u2009minutes, respectively, was observed when comparing the alkaline to the neutral intervention. However, results did not withstand correction for multiplicity. In contrast to what has been reported in rodents, a change in drinking water pH had no impact on the composition of the gut microbiota or glucose regulation in young male adults. The study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02917616).",

The pivotal feature of T2D is hyperglycaemia caused by hepatic- and peripheral insulin resistance, accompanied by progressing beta-cell dysfunction. However, etiologically and pathophysiologically T2D is a heterogeneous disorder with several genetic and environmental factors affecting the risk of developing the diabetic phenotype. Among environmental factors lifestyle-related variables such as physical inactivity and energy-dense dieting have long been recognized as important determinants of T2D development, but other potentially modifiable risk factors have recently been identified, including gut microbiota dysbiosis2,3 and dietary acid load4.",

While many claims of health promoting effects of alkaline water are scientifically unsubstantiated, changes in drinking water pH have been reported to affect both gut microbiota composition and host metabolism as evidenced by two recent studies in diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice14,15. A study by Wolf and colleagues showed that neutral water (pH\u2009\u2248\u20097) compared to acidic water (pH\u2009\u2248\u20093) increased the incidence of diabetes14. Acidic water also decreased the abundance of Firmicutes and increased the abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Contrastingly, a study by Sofi and colleagues found that changing the drinking water from acidic (pH\u2009\u2248\u20093) to neutral (pH\u2009\u2248\u20097) decreased diabetes incidence and rate of disease progression, accompanied by a reduction in the abundance of the genus Bacteroides and some species of Prevotella (P. oris, P. melaninogenica, P. loescheii, and P. copri), whereas other species of Prevotella (P. multiformis and P. shahii) were increased along with species of Parabacteroides (P. goldsteinii and P. distasonis)15. Differences in baseline gut microbiota, along with difference in other environmental circumstances, have been proposed as an explanation for the conflicting results regarding diabetes incidence and rate of progression16,17. Importantly, both studies showed substantial differences in the gut microbiota of mice drinking acidic and neutral water, demonstrating that drinking water pH can have a profound impact on the gut microbial community. NOD mice are the most commonly used rodent model of autoimmune diabetes18. Interestingly, a recent study has shown that NOD mice develop insulin resistance, with hepatic insulin resistance being present already in the pre-diabetic phase and muscle insulin sensitivity being impaired as early as three days after onset of diabetes19. Taken together these observations suggest that the effects of changes in drinking water pH reported by Wolf et al. and Sofi et al. may in part be influenced by mechanisms affecting insulin resistance in addition to augmented autoimmune insulitis.",

Treatment effect was estimated by a post-hoc t-test as the average difference between pre- and post-intervention visits within a period.

Model assumptions were checked visually by inspection of residual plots (homoscedasticity) and normal probability plots (Gaussian distribution). Logarithmic transformation of the dependent variable was applied where appropriate.

Prior to alpha- and beta-diversity analyses samples were rarefied to an equal sequencing depth of 10,306 reads. For analysis of between-intervention effect at OTU level, a set of core OTUs with a mean relative abundance \u22650.05% and present in at least one sample in \u226550% of participants were selected. Similarly, genus level analyses included all genera present at least once in \u226550% of participants. Between-intervention effect on richness, alpha-diversity indices and relative abundance of individual OTUs and genera was tested using linear mixed models (as for physiological outcomes), following logarithmic transformation. When testing the treatment effect on a given taxa, a pseudo count equal to the lowest detected relative abundance of that taxa was added prior to logarithmic transformation. Participants in which a given taxon was not present in any of the samples were excluded from the analyses of that taxon in order to minimize the effect of zero-inflation. Between-intervention effect on community structure was assessed by principal coordinate (PCoA) ordination using Bray-Curtis, unweighted- and weighted UniFrac metrics, and analysed using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) as implemented in the vegan R package v2.4.0. Analyses of within-intervention effect was analysed in a mixed linear model framework contrasting pre- and post-intervention measurements with a random effect of subject and adjusted for intervention sequence. For analyses considering interventions as technical replicates (as if participants received the same intervention twice) we applied a mixed linear model contrasting pre- and post-intervention measurements adjusted for intervention sequence, with a random effect of subject within period.",

Importantly, none of the observed effects on plasma glucose withstood correction for multiplicity at a predefined FDR of 5%.

They reported a significant decrease in glycoalbumin, as well as an increase in the relative abundance of the families Christensenellaecae, Dehalobacteriaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Rikenellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Oxalobacteraceae and a decrease in Bifidobacteriaceae following consumption of 500\u2009ml of bicarbonate rich water for 1 week. Of notice, the concentration of bicarbonate was 100-fold higher in the bicarbonate rich water compared to tap water, yet pH was lower (7.07 compared to 7.58 in tap water). This highlights important aspects regarding the potential effects of variation in drinking water pH. The pH as a measure of hydrogen ion activity of an aqueous solution says nothing about the buffering capacity of said solution. For instance, a solution of sodium bicarbonate is many times more efficient in buffering the acidic environment in the stomach than a solution of sodium hydroxide with the same pH. Given recent results showing an increase in families Streptococcaceae and Micrococcacaea associated with the use of proton pump inhibitors29,30, it is reasonable to assume that the potential effect of drinking water on the gut microbiota is linked to the buffering capacity. Mineral composition of the water may also have an effect on gut microbiota composition, irrespective of the acid-base properties. Divalent cations affect the stability of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria31 and are involved in motility, transport, and cell differentiation processes32. In the present study, we used an electrochemical process to produce water with neutral and alkaline pH. Due to financial limitations, the mineral content of the experimental water consumed by individual participants was not assessed systematically.",

Thus, our findings are exploratory and it cannot be ruled out that a larger sample size would have shown a significant difference between the two interventions. For instance, post hoc analyses indicated that the present study had 19.5% statistical power to detect (paired t-test) a significant decrease in alpha diversity (Shannon\u2019s index) at a two-tailed \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05 given the observed effect size34. Consequently, a study designed to test the specific hypothesis of an effect of alkaline vs. neutral drinking water on alpha diversity would require a sample size of 180 individuals to have 80% statistical power at an \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05.",

No significant effects were observed during the alkaline interventions. Of the OTUs that were significant during the neutral water intervention five were among the OTUs with P-values below the 10th percentile during the alkaline intervention, two of which were nominally significant. Consequently, when analysing samples from the two interventions as technical replicates we observed nine OTUs that became more abundant when changing from regular tap water to experimental water. A possible explanation for this apparent effect could be that participants drank more during intervention periods than they usually did, because a minimum daily intake of 2\u2009litres was required. Another possible explanation is that regular beverages were substituted by water during intervention periods. Seventy six percent of participants in the present study were habitual coffee drinkers. The effects of coffee (decaffeinated as well as caffeinated) on gastro-intestinal physiology include increased gastric acid secretion, gall-bladder contraction and rectosigmoid motility35. Parallel to these stimulatory effects coffee consumption has been shown to alter the gut microbiota composition in high-fat-fed rats36 and increase the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. in humans37. Change in coffee consumption during interventions was not recorded and any effect of beverage substitution is speculative only. It is also possible that the observed compositional change is caused by a machine effect irrespective of the chosen pH; however, the exact nature of such an effect is unknown.",
