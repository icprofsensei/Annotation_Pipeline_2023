Alpha and beta diversities were assessed using QIIME, and comparisons of gut microbiome profile were performed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) to examine differences between groups and subgroups.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 is the dominant genetic risk factor for AS (6), and is present in as many as 90% of individuals with AS. Although it is almost necessary to have HLA-B27 for the development of AS, it is not sufficient. Less than 5% of HLA-B27 carriers are affected (7). Interestingly, in HLA-B27/\u03b22-microglobulin-transgenic (\u03b22m-Tg) rat, one of the most important animal model of SpA (8), animals remain healthy in an environment completely free of known microbes, while reintroduction of normal commensal gut bacteria is sufficient to trigger colitis and arthritis (9). More recently, HLA-B27/\u03b22m-Tg rats were shown to have different gut microbiota with an increase in the abundance of Prevotella spp. and a decrease in the abundance of Rikenellaceae when compared with wild-type rats (10) and accompanied by perturbed mucosal immunity (11). In AS patients, as many as 40\u201360% of them were present with subclinical intestinal inflammation, and 5\u201310% of these cases will progress into clinical established IBD during their disease course (12). Increasing studies showed evidence for the link between gut dysbiosis and IBD. So, from the above perspectives, it is reasonable for us to consider that gut dysbiosis maybe one of important factors contributing to the pathogenesis of AS. A study of 10 AS patients and 9 healthy controls (HCs) by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing analysis showed dysbiosis in terminal ileum biopsy specimens of AS patients (13). And a more recent study based on shotgun sequencing using gut microbial DNA from fecal samples of 211 Chinese individuals also shown alteration of gut microbiome in AS patients (14).",

Nearly 50% of AS patients have peripheral manifestation such as peripheral arthritis, enthesis or dactylitis, and these peripheral symptoms seem to contribute to higher level of disease activity in AS patients (15). Sulfasalazine (SASP) is a sulfa antimicrobial used to treat IBD in clinic for years (16), and also applied in AS patients who have concomitant peripheral manifestations (17,18). SASP showed no efficacy for AS patients with only axial joints involved (19). Of note, in rats with experimental colitis, SASP alleviated colitis through modulating the gut microbiome composition and function (20). This may suggest that gut microbiome might be associated with the distinguished efficacy of SASP in AS patients with different phenotype. However, no research has investigated the features of the gut microbiota in patients with different phenotypes of AS. And whether there are differences in gut microbiome between AS patients with only axial involved and concomitant peripheral joints involved remain to be determined.",

To define more precisely the taxa that were driving the differentiation for the microbiota of the groups, we performed analysis using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe, an algorithm for high-dimensional biomarker discovery which exploits LDA to robustly identify features statistically different among classes) (32) based on a web-based tool Microbiomeanalyst (a tool for comprehensive statistical, visual and meta-analysis of microbiome data) (33). Random forest algorithm and a stratified 10-fold cross-validation approach (34) were used to set up a gut microbiota-based model for predictive diagnosis of AS and its subtypes with random forest package (v3.4.4). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted and the area under the curve (AUC) was used evaluate the performance of the random forest classifier.",

Alloprevotella, Prevotella_9, Collinsella, Dialister and Eubacterium_ruminantium_group were identified as discriminative bacteria in both axAS and pAS patients when compared to those in HCs. However, differences of Prevotella_2 and Ruminococcus_gnavus_group were identified only in comparison axAS with HCs; differences of Streptococcus, Comamonas, and Lachnospira were identified only in comparison pAS with HCs. As expected, discriminative bacteria were identified between axAS and pAS subgroups. Between the two AS subgroups, Prevotella_2 was enriched in axAS patients, while Comamonas, Streptococcus and Collinsella were enriched in pAS patients (Figure 2C,D,E).",

We carried out 10-fold cross-validation to evaluated the importance of indicator bacterial genera. The cross-validation error curve became stable when the 8 most relevant genera were used. Thus, we defined these 8 genera as biomarker taxa, including Alloprevotella, Acidominococcus, Holdemanella, Allisonella, Dialister, Collinsella, Streptococcus and Comamonas (Figure 3A). All these 8 genera were identified with significantly different abundance between AS patients and HCs with the above mentioned LEfSe analysis. We could accurately differentiate AS patients from HCs using this model, as the value of the AUC the ROC curve was up to 0.950. No difference was found when the predictive model was applied only to distinguish axAS patients or pAS patients from HCs (AUC =0.958 and 0.925, respectively; P=0.85; Figure 3B). However, we obtained poor performance when discriminating between axAS and pAS using the same method to construct a model based on the gut microbiota (data not shown).",

For instance, Wen et al. found an increased abundance of Prevotella and decreased abundance of Bacteroide in AS patients (14) based on shotgun sequencing using gut microbial DNA from fecal samples of 211 Chinese individuals also shown alteration of gut microbiome in AS patients. And Tito et al. (36) reported an association of carriage of Dialister with disease activity in a study of 27 SpA patients (i.e., not necessarily AS) and 15 HCs using 16S rRNA profiling in ileal or colonic mucosal biopsies. In our study, we observed a decrease abundance of Ruminococcus_gnavus in AS patients, especially in patients with axAS. However, Breban et al. reported that SpA patients possess a decrease abundance in Ruminococcus_gnavus (35). Ruminococcus_gnavus was reported with an association with IBD in previous study (37). The different finding between our study and the Breban\u2019s remains an open question because that there is difference in gut inflammation status between the two study cohorts. Comamonas, a possible pathogen that may cause intestinal infection such as appendicitis (38), showed a higher abundance in AS patients.",

In addition, a gut microbiota-based model shows low accuracy to classified the two subgroups of patients. Despite that, we found that Prevotella_2 was enriched in axAS patients, while Comamonas, Streptococcus and Collinsella were more enriched in pAS patients. Of note, these 4 genera show significant difference not only between AS patients and HC, but also between patients with axAS and pAS. Comamonas, Streptococcus and Collinsella are opportunistic pathogens that might trigger the proinflammatory factors and induce chronic inflammation. Patients with pAS were more common to suffer uveitis, psoriasis and IBD, which were also reported to be associated with gut dysbiosis. So, we suppose that SASP, a sulfa antimicrobial, may work by targeting these unfavorable bacteria. However, it needs to go further study.",

In the meantime, classification criteria for axSpA have been established with the intention of improving the sensitivity for an early diagnosis of AS and reducing diagnostic delay (39). However, the duration for diagnostic delay has not markedly improved (40) and there remains a high prevalence of undiagnosed axSpA in patients with chronic low back pain (41). One method to solve this problem is to find out new specific diagnostic biomarkers. Our study formulated a gut-microbial-based classification model including 8 genera with an accuracy of 0.95 for classification AS from healthy people. Wen et al. also reported a classifier with 35 microbial gene markers with an accuracy of 0.96. This suggested that the gut microbiota biomarkers may be helpful for improving the early diagnosis for AS. Yang et al. found Rifaximin (a gastrointestinal selective antibiotic) can reduce the inflammation activity by changing the gut microbiota composition with increased Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes phylum ratio, as well as selectively promoted some probiotic populations. This implicated that gut microbiota might not only be useful for diagnosis but also novel treatment target for AS. But it needs further study. A longitudinal study of gut microbiome in a multicenter and larger cohort with AS could be the next research step.",
