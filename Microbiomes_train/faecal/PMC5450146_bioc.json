Analysis can proceed at that level, associating clinical outcomes with the presence or absence of a given OTU, calculating microbial alpha-diversity (richness and evenness) of the community, or beta-diversity (distance) between communities, with the OTU as a marker. Researchers often proceed to a classification step to identify each OTU as representing a given already-known organism in a shared reference database. This process can connect the OTU sequences to the larger body of microbiological research, converting associations into a deeper understanding of the members of the community and their capabilities.

To test how well each classifier estimates diversity, for each community we calculated a Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient when comparing the true diversity of the community to that estimated for a given pipeline as a test of monotonicity. Monotonicity is allows for systematic under or overestimation of true diversity, but retains the ability to accurately compare communities\u2014and thus is a realistic and meaningful means of evaluating the pipeline output. Figure\u00a03 graphically shows the results as scatter plots for MiSeq data with simulated error.

Again, as a comparator, ideally the estimated pairwise distance between communities would be monotonic as compared to the true pairwise distance. Some means of calculating distance consider the relationships between organisms phylogenetically when weighting the differences in their abundance, such as UniFrac [23] (weighted or not) and double principle coordinate analysis (DPCoA) [24]. The rationale is phylogenetically-related organisms contribute similar functions to communities and the functional similarity should be considered as part of a distance between communities. Weighted UniFrac has become the dominant method in the field for pairwise distance measurement.",
