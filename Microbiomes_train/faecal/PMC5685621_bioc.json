Traditionally, sequence alignment has been used for phylogenetic inference. However, alignment-based approaches come with significant challenges and limitations when massive amounts of data are analyzed. In the recent decade, alignment-free approaches have enabled genome-scale phylogenetic inference. Here we evaluate three alignment-free methods: ACS, CVTree, and Kr for phylogenetic inference with 16s rRNA gene data. We use a taxonomic gold standard to compare the accuracy of alignment-free phylogenetic inference with that of common microbiome-wide phylogenetic inference pipelines based on PyNAST and MUSCLE alignments with FastTree and RAxML. We re-simulate fecal communities from Human Microbiome Project data to evaluate the performance of the methods on datasets with properties of real data. Our comparisons show that alignment-free methods are not inferior to alignment-based methods in giving accurate and robust phylogenic trees. Moreover, consensus ensembles of alignment-free phylogenies are superior to those built from alignment-based methods in their ability to highlight community differences in low power settings. In addition, the overall running times of alignment-based and alignment-free phylogenetic inference are comparable. Taken together our empirical results suggest that alignment-free methods provide a viable approach for microbiome-wide phylogenetic inference.",

Traditional analysis pipelines for such data involve alignment-based methods such as BLAST [2], PyNAST [3], NAST [4], and SINA [5]. The ability to perform high-throughput sequencing of marker genes, such as 16S rRNA gene, has enabled en masse microbial community surveys. The studies in this area have yielded valuable information for characterization of the human microbiome and for understanding its role in many diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [6], obesity [7, 8], diabetes [9], psoriasis [10], cancer [11], and depression [12]. From the sequencing-informatics perspective, sequence alignment has remained an important algorithmic approach in microbiomics. The challenge of alignment-based approaches is in dealing with the volume of the data in terms of computation time and data management. Many analyses have reduced the severity of the problem by clustering individual sequences into operational taxonomical units (OTUs). Doing so significantly reduces the number of sequences that need to be aligned and have their phylogenetic relationships inferred, typically from millions of raw sequences to a few thousand representative sequences for the OTUs. However, many concerns still exist about the ability to infer reliable pairwise alignments, and subsequently to infer multiple sequence alignments necessary for phylogenetic inference.",

A majority of these models deal with quantitation of specific k-mer words, which are treated as unitary traits. The idea of k-mer, or perfectly matched strings of selected length, have been used by groups such as Blasdell and Gibbs et al in tree inferences for proteins and nucleotides [16].

The average length of these longest common substrings is calculated as a reflection of similarity between X and Y. For example, given two sequences X = \u2018TCTGA\u2019 and Y = \u2018CCTGT\u2019, the length would be 3. ACS is normalized to account for the sequence lengths, resulting in a similarity measure between X and Y. To convert it to a distance, the inverse is taken and a correction term is subtracted to ensure that the distance between identical sequences is 0.

The collection of frequencies and probabilities can be thought of as the result of mutations and selection forces with each k-string as a unit. While mutations happen randomly at the molecular level, selections are the forces that drive evolution. Neutral mutations account for some randomness found in the k-string composition. They are referred to as the random background and must be subtracted from the simple counting results to find the selective changes. After counting for all strings of k-1 mers and k-2 mers, the probability of appearance of k-string can be predicted using a Markov assumption. The difference between the actual counts and predicted counts is then used as the component of a new \u201cnormalized\u201d CV, and pairwise distances between the new CVs are computed to generate a dissimilarity matrix.",

It uses the Jukes-Cantor or generalized time-reversible (GTR) models of nucleotide evolution.

The final branch lengths have been computed as the average branch length for ACS, Kr and CVTree. Similarly, we also obtained consensus trees for the alignment-based methods. We created a consensus for each alignment method (such as a consensus with MUSCLE-based alignment, namely MUSCLE + FastTree and MUSCLE + RAxML) and for each tree inference (such as a consensus with FastTree inference, namely MUSCLE + FastTree and PyNAST + FastTree).

At sacrifice the fecal and cecal contents of these mice have been analyzed. We computed pairwise distances between all samples using weighted Unifrac distances with phylogenies obtained by each of the alignment-free methods considered here and the FastTree with PyNAST tree used to analyze these data originally. We have used PERMANOVA to associate the location (cecal or fecal) from which the sample has been obtained, and the location in conjunction with the treatment type. Table 1 summarizes the estimated effect sizes and significance values for this analysis. We note that the estimated effect size based on FastTree weighted Unifrac distances is higher than for any of the alignment-free methods or their consensus. However, when the treatment effect is considered, the estimated effect is larger for the alignment-free methods, and largest for the alignment-free consensus. This results holds regardless of which effect size measurement is used\u2014the coefficient of determination (R2) or omega squared (\u03c92), which has been shown to be superior for microbiome studies [30]. All of the results are statistically significant.

In terms of running time, CVTree is the fastest method, which takes only approximately 5 minutes to generate the distance matrices while maintaining similar accuracy to the slower alternatives. The fact that ACS and Kr are slow in building distance matrices reflects on potential algorithmic and implementation inefficiencies, rather than inferior computational complexity. This inefficiency should be possible to overcome with additional software engineering. Creating the consensus tree from the individual trees requires a relatively short running time. While the total time for building the consensus tree (including building the individual trees) is significantly longer than for PyNAST/FastTree, the accuracy achieved may make it a worthwhile endeavor. It is also worth noting that while PyNAST and FastTree were considerably faster than the alignment-free methods, the other combinations took significantly longer times. In particular, MUSCLE took about three hours longer than PyNAST and RAxML, averaging about 24 hours (versus only an hour for FastTree). The result of PyNAST/FastTree, as noted above, was also better than any other alignment-based combination.",
