Our method leverages a database of more than 30,000 bacterial reference genomes that we clustered into species groups. These cover the majority of abundant species in the human microbiome but only a small proportion of microbes in other environments, including soil and seawater. We applied MIDAS to stool metagenomes from 98 Swedish mothers and their infants over one year and used rare SNPs to track strains between hosts. Using this approach, we found that although species compositions of mothers and infants converged over time, strain-level similarity diverged. Specifically, early colonizing bacteria were often transmitted from an infant\u2019s mother, while late colonizing bacteria were often transmitted from other sources in the environment and were enriched for spore-formation genes. We also applied MIDAS to 198 globally distributed marine metagenomes and used gene content to show that many prevalent bacterial species have population structure that correlates with geographic location. Strain-level genetic variants present in metagenomes clearly reveal extensive structure and dynamics that are obscured when data are analyzed at a coarser taxonomic resolution.",

However, different strains of the same species can differ significantly in their gene content (Greenblum et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2015) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Schloissnig et al. 2013; Kashtan et al. 2014; Lieberman et al. 2014). These strain-level differences are important for understanding microbial evolution, adaptation, pathogenicity, and transmission. For example, strain-level differences have shed light on ecological differentiation of closely related bacteria (Shapiro et al. 2012), uncovered the presence of ancient subpopulations of marine bacteria (Kashtan et al. 2014), and highlighted extensive intra-species recombination (Snitkin et al. 2011; Rosen et al. 2015). Strain-level variation is also important for understanding microbial pathogenicity. Differences at the nucleotide level can lead to within-host adaptation of pathogens (Lieberman et al. 2014), and differences in gene content can confer drug resistance, convert a commensal bacterium into a pathogen (Snitkin et al. 2011), or lead to outbreaks of highly virulent strains (Rasko et al. 2011).",

However, limitations of existing computational methods and reference databases have prevented most researchers from obtaining this level of resolution from metagenomic data. Assembly-free methods that map reads to reference genomes to estimate the relative abundance of known strains (Francis et al. 2013; Tu et al. 2014) are effective for well-characterized pathogens like E. coli that have thousands of sequenced genomes. However, such methods cannot detect strain-level variation for the vast majority of known species that currently have only a single sequenced representative. Other assembly-free approaches have been developed that use reads mapped to one or more reference genomes to identify SNPs (Schloissnig et al. 2013; Lieberman et al. 2014) and gene copy number variants (Greenblum et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2015; Scholz et al. 2016) of microbial populations. These approaches have not been integrated together and/or made available as software. Recently, several software tools have been developed (Luo et al. 2015; Sahl et al. 2015) that use SNP patterns to phylogenetically type strains, but these methods do not capture the gene content of these organisms and may not be able to resolve strains in communities with high population heterogeneity. Additionally, existing methods do not provide comprehensive up-to-date genomic databases of bacterial species, thus limiting their utility across different environments. Assembly-based methods (Nielsen et al. 2014; Cleary et al. 2015) that seek to reconstruct microbial genomes without using reference genomes are a powerful alternative to assembly-free methods. However, these often require many samples, struggle to deconvolve closely related strains, or require manual inspection.",

We accurately clustered these genomes into species groups to avoid inconsistent, erroneous, and incomplete annotations that afflict some microbial taxonomies (Mende et al. 2013) and to expand and improve upon previous efforts to systematically delineate bacterial species (Mende et al. 2013; Schloissnig et al. 2013; Varghese et al. 2015). Toward this goal, we hierarchically clustered reference genomes using the average pairwise percent identity across a panel of 30 universal genes (Fig. 1A) that we selected from a panel of 112 candidates (Supplemental Fig. S1; Supplemental Table S2; Wu et al. 2013). We found that the best gene families for identifying bacterial species were less conserved and more widely distributed across the tree of life relative to other genes we tested (Supplemental Fig. S2). For example, many ribosomal gene families were too conserved to differentiate closely related species (Supplemental Table S2). We applied a 96.5% nucleotide identity cutoff, which produced genome clusters that were highly concordant with a gold standard definition of prokaryotic species based on 95% genome-wide average nucleotide identity (Supplemental Table S3; Konstantinidis et al. 2006; Richter and Rossello-Mora 2009). Our procedure clustered the 31,007 bacterial genomes into 5952 genome clusters, representing distinct bacterial species (Supplemental Tables S4, S5). We inferred the phylogenetic relationships of these species using a concatenated alignment of the 30 marker genes (Supplemental Fig. S3). Because our algorithm uses a small set of highly informative marker genes, rather than genome-wide sequence comparisons, it will be efficient to update these genome clusters as additional genomes are sequenced.",

Supporting our species definitions, we found that the bacterial species we identified tended to have distinct functional repertoires, with only 0.05% of FIGfam protein families (Meyer et al. 2009) shared between genomes from different species on average compared to >80% for pairs of genomes from the same species.

Previous work has shown large gaps in diversity between sequenced reference genomes and environmental microorganisms (Wu et al. 2009). To explore how well current genome sequences cover diversity present in metagenomes from various environments, we developed a novel approach that estimates the proportion of microbial genomes (including archaea and eukaryotes, but excluding viruses) in a metagenome that contain a sequenced representative at the species level in a reference database (Methods). This proportion, which we call \u201cdatabase coverage,\u201d indicates the degree to which species in a sample are known versus novel.",

This included high database coverage of samples from the skin (mean = 83%), nasal cavity (mean = 63%), urogenital tract (mean = 62%), mouth (mean = 55%), and gastrointestinal tract (mean = 49%). The human gut communities with highest database coverage came from individuals in the United States, Europe, and China that live urban lifestyles, which is consistent with a previous report (Sunagawa et al. 2013). In contrast, gut microbiomes of individuals from Tanzania and Peru that live hunter-gatherer and agricultural lifestyles had much higher levels of novel species with no sequenced representative in our database. This finding extends the previous discoveries of elevated levels of novel genera (Schnorr et al. 2014) and functions (Rampelli et al. 2015) in the gut microbiome of African hunter-gatherers. Our analysis points to specific phylogenetic gaps in the set of currently sequenced bacterial genomes. Gut communities with lower database coverage tended to have higher levels of several genera including Coprococcus, Subdoligranulum, Dorea, and Blautia, whereas communities with higher database coverage tended to have higher levels of the genus Bacteroides (Supplemental Fig. S4). We conclude that there is a clear bias of genome sequencing to date toward species associated with hosts from industrialized countries.",

MIDAS also called SNPs at a low false-discovery rate, but required between 5\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 coverage to identify the majority of SNPs present (Fig. 2D).",

More specifically, we believed this approach could be used to shed light on the extent and timing of mother-to-infant (i.e., vertical) transmission of gut bacteria. An understanding of vertical transmission is critical for determining the extent to which the microbiome\u2014and by extension microbiome-mediated phenotypes\u2014are inherited. Recent studies have found significant overlap in species between mothers and their infants over the first year of life (Backhed et al. 2015; Bokulich et al. 2016), and many microbial taxa that are heritable (Goodrich et al. 2016). These studies did not examine whether strains are vertically transmitted, and recent work has shown that species-level analyses alone can be insufficient to resolve transmission events (Li et al. 2016). Mother-to-infant transmission of specific taxa has been resolved using culture-based techniques (Tannock et al. 1990; Mart\u00edn et al. 2012; Makino et al. 2013; Milani et al. 2015), but it is not clear whether these results are generalizable across microbiome species. Other studies have examined the development of the infant gut microbiome (Koenig et al. 2011), including at the strain level (Luo et al. 2015; Yassour et al. 2016), but did not assess vertical transmission. Thus, the extent and timescale of vertical transmission and the stability of transmitted stains are currently not well established.",

We found that bacterial species alpha diversity was lowest in newborns and increased over time, species beta diversity was highest in newborns and decreased over time, and samples clustered by host age based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between species relative abundance profiles (Fig. 3A; Supplemental Fig. S7). Compared to infants, mothers had more diverse microbiomes that tended to harbor more unshared (i.e., unique to host) species (77% versus 48%, t-test P < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216). Despite this, we found a large number of shared species between infants and their mothers, which increased over time as diversity increased in the infants (Fig. 3B). These species-level trends agree with the results of the original study that used different methods to identify species (Backhed et al. 2015). Surprisingly, we found nearly as many shared species between permuted mother\u2013infant pairs in which vertical transmission did not occur (Fig. 3C), suggesting that increased similarity of species in a mother and her infant over its first year is unlikely the result of direct transmission.",

The fact that allele sharing was <100% in the technical replicates and >0% in the nonreplicates likely results from a combination of factors, including read sampling variation, small sample sizes, and sequencing errors. For example, marker alleles may be found in other individuals when sample sizes are increased. To define a transmission event, we selected a marker allele sharing cutoff of 5%, which clearly separated the positive and negative controls (sensitivity = 99.8%; specificity = 96.6%).

Furthermore, of the 111 high-coverage species present in mothers and newborns, 101 (91%) had >5% marker allele sharing, indicating extensive vertical transmission of gut microbiota shortly after birth. Commonly transmitted species included Bacteroides vulgatus (25/28 mother\u2013infant pairs with >5% marker allele sharing), Parabacteroides distasonis (10/11), Bifidobacterium adolescentis (8/10), and Escherichia coli (10/10) (Fig. 4A).

Specifically, strains of species with low abundance at 4 d but high abundance at 12 mo, like Blautia wexlerae, tended to be distinct from strains found in the mother. In contrast, strains of species with high abundance at 4 d and high abundance at 12 mo, like Bacteroides vulgatus, were similar to strains found in the mother (Fig. 4A,B).

To address this issue, we quantified the temporal stability of strains in 157 healthy adults from the HMP over a time period of 300\u2013400 d (Supplemental Fig. S10). We found high marker allele sharing (mean = 77.0%) and \u201ctransmission rates\u201d (96.2%), which suggest that maternal strains may be quite stable over time, in agreement with previous work (Faith et al. 2013; Schloissnig et al. 2013). Together, our results suggest that bacteria are transmitted from mother to infant at birth, but bacteria from the environment increasingly colonize the infant gut over time.",

To investigate this, we obtained a genomic signature of sporulation for many of the bacterial species found in mother\u2013infant pairs from a recent study (Browne et al. 2016). The sporulation score was based on 66 genes in which values greater than 0.4 indicate true spore-formers. Strikingly, we found that species with low vertical transmission rates tended to have high sporulation scores, which supports the hypothesis that these bacteria are transmitted to the infants from the environment (P = 0.0013) (Fig. 4C). In contrast, bacterial species with high vertical transmission rates had low sporulation scores, suggesting that these species may be transmitted via direct physical contact. One of the exceptions to this pattern was the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli, which was vertically transmitted early but transmitted from a different source later (Fig. 4A). To broadly characterize these patterns, we found the class Bacteroidia was enriched in vertical transmission events (\u03c72\nP = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u221218), whereas the class Clostridia was depleted (\u03c72\nP = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221222) (Supplemental Table S11). These results highlight differences in the inheritance of gut microbiota that may be linked to distinct modes and timing of transmission between hosts.",

Yet genomes of a given species sampled near each other can differ significantly in their gene content (Kashtan et al. 2014). To explore the extent of population structure across different marine bacterial species on a global scale, we used MIDAS to quantify pan-genome gene content for prevalent species in 198 marine metagenomes from 66 stations along the Tara Oceans expedition (Supplemental Table S12; Sunagawa et al. 2015). Because we found that our database had relatively low coverage of the cellular organisms present in ocean samples (Fig. 1C), we first estimated relative abundance and coverage of bacterial species in each metagenome to identify marine species in which gene content could be reliably estimated (i.e., coverage greater than 3\u00d7 across a high percentage of samples) (Fig. 5). Among these species were several members of the genera Pelagibacter, Alteromonas, Synechococcus, and Marinobacter, a large group of closely related Prochlorococcus species, and several unnamed Alphproteobacteria species. Reference pan-genome sizes for these species ranged from 1047 to 1311 genes in the streamlined genomes of SAR406 and SAR86 (each with one genome) to 6427 genes in the largest Prochlorococcus genome cluster (N = 26 genomes) and 7819 genes for Alteromonas macleodii (N = 4 genomes).",

We next quantified the percentage of genes that were different between samples using the Jaccard index and found that on average 19% of genes differed between samples. This level of genomic variability was higher than the 13% recently reported for human gut communities (Zhu et al. 2015), although this may be due to methodological differences. Regardless, our estimate of 19% is almost certainly an underestimate of the true level of gene content variation between populations, because MIDAS cannot measure the variation of genes that are present in strains but absent from sequenced reference genomes.",

For example, populations of one Pelagibacter species formed three discrete clusters corresponding to the Mediterranean Sea, South Atlantic Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean, and each cluster contained samples from multiple water layers. Similar results were obtained for many other species (Supplemental Fig. S11). Furthermore, we found that the population structure of the marine bacteria examined was highly consistent, regardless of the percent identity threshold used for defining pan-genome gene families (75%\u201399% identity) (Supplemental Figs.

A previous study found season to be a major driver of biodiversity patterns in the global ocean (Ladau et al. 2013). To explore whether season or other environmental variables were associated with strain-level population structure, we compared correlations of the first principal component of gene content (PC1) with geography and environmental variables (Supplemental Fig. S14). For 20/30 species tested, longitude (17/30) or latitude (3/30) was the strongest predictor of gene content, and each explained a significant proportion of gene content variation (22% and 8% on average). In contrast, day length (an indicator of season) explained less variation (4% on average) and was the most predictive covariate for only one Prochlorococcus species.",

The most striking example of this was an unnamed Alphproteobacteria species which contained two genomes in our database obtained via single-cell sequencing (Stepanauskas 2012). This species was predominantly found in the mesopelagic layer (below 200 m) and increased in relative abundance with decreasing depth (Supplemental Fig. S15). Looking only at mesopelagic samples, we found that the first principal component of gene content (PC1) was strongly correlated with depth (R2= 0.59), suggesting little mixing of strains across depth. When we included samples from all marine layers, we found that samples from the mesopelagic and epipelagic zone formed separate clusters based on gene content, and there was still a strong correlation between PC1 and depth (R2= 0.57) (Supplemental Fig. S15). Our results could indicate that the populations at different depths contain genes for adaptation to the range of temperatures and nutrients across which this species is found. Supporting this hypothesis, we found hundreds of functions and pathways with gene copy numbers that were significantly correlated with depth (Supplemental Table S14).",

Because it currently relies on bacterial reference genomes, MIDAS cannot quantify variation for novel species, novel genes, or known species from other groups of microbes (e.g., archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses). To accurately quantify strain-level gene content and SNPs, MIDAS requires greater than 1\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 sequencing coverage, respectively. This biases analyses toward the most abundant and prevalent species in an environment. MIDAS was nonetheless able to capture the majority of microbial species abundance across human body sites, making it well suited for uncovering strain-level variation of human-associated bacteria. In contrast, other environments appeared to be dominated by microbes missing from our reference database. For this reason, it will be important to update the database as the number (Land et al. 2015) and diversity (Wu et al. 2009) of microbial reference genomes continues to rapidly grow, as new experimental (Rinke et al. 2013) and computational (Nielsen et al. 2014) approaches uncover genome sequences of uncultured microbes. It will also be useful to incorporate genomes from other domains of life. Based on the design of our database and algorithm, MIDAS should scale with this growth of reference data.",

Based on this analysis, we found extensive vertical transmission of early colonizing bacteria, which largely persisted in the infant for one year. Although significant attention has been paid to transmission of Bifidobacterium spp. (Mart\u00edn et al. 2012; Makino et al. 2013; Milani et al. 2015), we found high transmission rates for many Bacteroides spp. We also found that late colonizing bacteria, including Blautia, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium, and Facelibacerium, were rarely transmitted from the mother. Instead the mother was colonized by a different strain of these species. Comparing these species to a recent study of sporulation in the human gut (Browne et al. 2016), we found that late colonizers tended to be spore-formers capable of surviving in the environment, whereas early colonizers were non-spore-formers. Together, these results suggest that only certain taxonomic groups of bacteria may be vertically inherited, whereas others are acquired from the environment. Our results build upon previous infant microbiome studies (Koenig et al. 2011; Backhed et al. 2015; Bokulich et al. 2016; Yassour et al. 2016) by showing that early and late colonizing species likely derive from different sources, which may be linked with their ability to form spores and survive in the environment. When the same metagenomes were analyzed at the species level, these patterns of transmission were missed, and a false signal of increasing transmission over time was detected due to convergence of the infant microbiome toward a more diverse and adult-like species profile. We conclude that species sharing frequently does not reflect direct transmission.",

For example, we estimated low vertical transmission for strains of Blautia, but Goodrich et al. (2016) found that the abundance of Blautia is highly heritable. Conversely, we estimated high vertical transmission for strains of Bacteroides, but this was one of the genera whose abundance was least heritable in the UK twins. Heritability does not require vertical transmission if related individuals are colonized by similar taxa that they acquire from the environment. On the other hand, the abundance of vertically transmitted taxa may not be heritable for extremely common taxa such as Bacteroides. Alternatively, strains vertically transmitted at birth could be lost as the infant ages, although we found them to be mostly retained over the first year of life.",

One intriguing issue is the source of the strains that colonize the infant but are not present in the mother's stool microbiome at 4 d after birth. It is possible that some strains colonize the mother's gut later in the year and are then passed along to the infant, although this is unlikely based on the temporal stability of strains in the adult microbiome. The new strains could also derive from other sites on the mother's body, such as skin and breast milk, other people, food, or the environment. One caveat of our analysis is that we did not distinguish which strains were transmitted to the infant from the mother in cases in which mothers harbored multiple strains. Instead, we treated the transmission events as binary, whereby a transmission was defined as at least one strain being transmitted. It would be interesting to explore transmission as a quantitative variable in future work, including elucidating how the strain composition and genetic diversity of bacterial populations change as they are passed from mother to offspring and potentially undergo bottlenecks and selection.",

Based on these results, we found that the gene content of many species in the epipelagic water layer (0\u2013200 m) was structured geographically. This contrasts with previous work at the species level, which found that depth and temperature were the strongest predictors of community structure (Sunagawa et al. 2015). However, the gene content of other species found in the mesopelagic layer (200\u20131000 m) was structured by depth. As more genomes are sequenced from marine ecosystems, it should be possible to determine how generalizable these patterns are. Additionally, future work is needed to understand the extent to which these gene-level patterns are driven by adaptation to different environments in the ocean or are attributable to neutral processes, like genetic drift and/or migration.",

Importantly, this level of resolution is not only revealing associations that are missed by analyses conducted at coarser taxonomic levels, but also patterns that oppose those inferred from species abundance distributions. A striking example is our discovery that infants share more gut bacterial strains with their mothers at birth than later in their first year of life, despite the fact that the species composition of their microbiomes becomes more similar as the infant ages. Without conducting a strain-level genomic analysis, one might incorrectly infer that vertical transmission of the gut microbiome is constant or increasing during the first year of life. Similarly, the high level of gene content variation that we observe in Tara Oceans bacteria and its strong correlation with geography in surface waters emphasizes functionally important differences in strains across global oceans that are missed when metagenomes are analyzed at the species level. It is clear that additional genome sequencing of environmental microbes is critical to advance these types of strain-level analyses in the future. Our analysis of database coverage points to specific environments and phylogenetic groups that are highest priority these efforts.",

Next, we built a database of 15 universal single-copy gene families (Supplemental Table S7) to use for estimating the abundance of the species from a shotgun metagenome. Gene families were selected based on their ability to accurately recruit metagenomic reads as well as being universal and single copy. The 30 gene families used for clustering genomes and the 15 gene families used for quantifying species abundance were in some cases different because of different selection criteria. Next, we used USEARCH (Edgar 2010) to identify the set of unique genes at 99% identity across all genomes within each species, which are used by MIDAS for metagenomic pan-genome profiling. This procedure clustered 116,978,184 genes from the 31,007 genomes into 31,840,245 gene families. We further clustered these genes at different levels of sequence identity (75%\u201395% DNA identity) to identity de novo gene families of varying size and diversity for downstream analyses. Functional annotations for all genes were obtained from PATRIC and include FIGfams (Meyer et al. 2009), Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al. 2000), and KEGG Pathways (Kanehisa and Goto 2000).",

These 15 gene families were selected from a set of 112 phylogenetically informative bacterial gene families (Wu et al. 2013) for their ability to accurately recruit metagenomic reads to the correct species. To evaluate how informative different gene families are for estimation of abundance, we simulated 100 100-bp reads from each of the 112 gene families in each of the 5952 species and used HS-BLASTN (Chen et al. 2015) to map these reads back to a database that contained the full-length gene sequences. To simulate the presence of novel species and strains, we discarded alignments between reads and reference sequences from the same genome. Each read was assigned to a species based on its top hit. Recruitment performance was measured using the F1-score. Based on this experiment, we identified 15 universal single-copy gene families that were best able to accurately assign the species from which metagenomic reads derived. Additionally, we identified the optimal percent identity cutoffs for mapping reads to the database, which ranged from 94.5% to 98.0% identity, depending on the gene family (Supplemental Table S7).",

Marker allele sharing was computed as the percentage of marker alleles in mother strains that were also found in her infant. To minimize variation in marker allele sharing due to sampling, we excluded individuals with fewer than 10 identified marker alleles for a species. We applied this procedure to 66 species found in stool metagenomes from 98 Swedish mothers and their infants (Backhed et al. 2015) and 123 American individuals from the HMP (The Human Microbiome Project Consortium 2012). We included the HMP samples to increase sample sizes and therefore improve the specificity of marker alleles identified in mothers and their infants. As a positive control (i.e., to assess the sensitivity), we quantified marker allele sharing for each species between pairs of technical replicates from the HMP. As a negative control (i.e., to assess specificity), we quantified marker allele sharing for each species between pairs of unrelated individuals from the HMP, which were not used to identify marker alleles.

Geographic distances were computed using the great-circle distance with the R package geosphere (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geosphere/index.html). Mantel tests were computed using the R package vegan (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html) to correlate the PCA distances to the geographic distances. At each water layer, we only included one metagenome per sampling location and only included species observed at more than five sampling locations. Up to 1 million permutations were performed to assess significance.",
