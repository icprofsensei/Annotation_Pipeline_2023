To address this notion, we compared the gut microbiota of urban (n = 17) and rural (n = 28) school-aged children in Thailand in association with their dietary habits. Dietary records indicated that children living in urban Bangkok tended to consume modern high-fat diets, whereas children in rural Buriram tended to consume traditional vegetable-based diets. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes amplified from stool samples showed that children in Bangkok have less Clostridiales and more Bacteroidales and Selenomonadales compared to children in Buriram and bacterial diversity is significantly less in Bangkok children than in Buriram children. In addition, fecal butyrate and propionate levels decreased in Bangkok children in association with changes in their gut microbial communities. Stool samples of these Thai children were classified into five metabolotypes (MTs) based on their metabolome profiles, each characterized by high concentrations of short and middle chain fatty acids (MT1, n = 17), amino acids (MT2, n = 7), arginine (MT3, n = 6), amino acids, and amines (MT5, n = 8), or an overall low level of metabolites (MT4, n = 4). MT1 and MT4 mainly consisted of samples from Buriram, and MT2 and MT3 mainly consisted of samples from Bangkok, whereas MT5 contained three samples from Bangkok and five from Buriram samples. According to the profiles of microbiota and diets, MT1 and MT2 are characteristic of children in Buriram and Bangkok, respectively. Predicted metagenomics indicated the underrepresentation in MT2 of eight genes involved in pathways of butyrate biosynthesis, notably including paths from glutamate as well as pyruvate. Taken together, this study shows the benefit of high-vegetable Thai traditional diets on gut microbiota and suggests that high-fat and less-vegetable urban dietary habits alter gut microbial communities in Thai children, which resulted in the reduction of colonic short chain fatty acid fermentation.",

It aids in nutrient metabolism as well as conditioning the gut environment for host health. Notably, some commensals benefit the host by fermenting dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Morrison and Preston, 2016; R\u00edos-Covi\u00e1n et al., 2016). SCFAs play pivotal roles in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis by serving as an energy source for colonic epithelial cells and also as signals for host receptors involved in regulation of immune cell proliferation and lipid and glucose metabolism (Furusawa et al., 2013; Kimura et al., 2013; Canfora et al., 2015). Furthermore, among SCFA, butyrate plays a crucial role as a histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitor involved in epigenetic regulation of regulatory T-cell development and maintenance (Smith et al., 2013). An abnormal imbalance in the gut microbiota, called \u201cdysbiosis,\u201d is associated with deprivation of SCFAs in the intestine, resulting in the loss of the above benefits notably leading to a leaky gut and subsequent metabolic endotoxemia (Shen et al., 2013; Llorente and Schnabl, 2015).",

However, modern diets tend to hamper the gut microbiota ecosystem, which may explain the recent increase in the incidence of certain non-communicable diseases such as inflammatory bowel, allergy, and metabolic diseases, as well as colorectal cancer (Ou et al., 2013; West et al., 2015; Statovci et al., 2017). Indeed, African children and Italian children were found to have distinct gut microbial compositions and different concentrations of SCFAs (De Filippo et al., 2010). Further, the change from a native African to an African American diet increased the expression of genes involved in butyrate biosynthesis in intestines of participants and also reduced the levels of their mucosal biomarkers of cancer risk (O\u2019Keefe et al., 2015). In addition, our previous study on the gut microbiota of children in Leyte island in the Philippines indicated that children living in urban and rural cites have distinct microbial compositions that correspond to those in African and Western people (Nakayama et al., 2017).",

Particularly, the Thai traditional diet has been relatively high in vegetables and low in fat (Kosulwat, 2002). A study that investigated traditional Thai foods showed that 22 recipes were associated with lower rates of carcinogenic mutations (Kangsadalampai and Plaingam, 2008). Furthermore, it was reported that a wide variety of traditional Thai food ingredients such as lemon grass and galangal root have powerful anti-tumor properties (Murakami et al., 1994). However, Thai food culture is changing rapidly, i.e., becoming westernized, with an increase in fat, sugar, and animal protein content (Kosulwat, 2002). Sugar consumption among Thais, for example, increased nearly threefold, from 12.7 to 33.2 kg per person per year, between 1983 and 2006. Some surveys have shown that an increase in fat consumption is associated with an increase in the incidence of heart disease and that high sugar consumption is linked to diabetes (Wibulpolprasert, 2008) One report indicated that the expenditure by Thais on Western-style fast food increased by 40% from 1999 to 2005 (United States Department of Agriculture [USDA], 2009). These data indicate that Western-style food has come to play a significant role in Thai food culture.",

Among Asians, Thai people have shown unique distribution pattern of enterotypes, which are a summary measure of the gut microbiota. Enterotypes of Thai children differ by city, whereas children in other countries examined tended to be colonized by one enterotype across cities (Nakayama et al., 2015). In fact, Prevotella-types represent the majority of children in Khon Kaen, whereas Bacteroides-type represents the majority of children in Bangkok. Furthermore, guts of adult vegetarians were mostly colonized by Prevotella-type, whereas those of non-vegetarians were mostly colonized by Bacteroides-type (Ruengsomwong et al., 2016).

In addition, some recent studies have shown the transition of gut microbiota as a contrast between urban and rural within country (De Filippo et al., 2017; Nakayama et al., 2017). The present study aims to deepen our insight into the value of traditional local diet and the impact of modern diet on the gut microbiota of young Asians in developing countries in South\u2013East Asia. To this end, we conducted a comparative cross-sectional study in urban and rural cites in Thailand (Figure \u200bFigure1A1A). Among rural cities, we chose Buriram city, located in the Isan region, which is a geographically contiguous area in North\u2013Eastern Thailand. The population is largely Thai and consumes traditional Thai (Isan) diet. Notably, many local Isan dishes are low in fat and high in vegetable and herbal content (Seubsman et al., 2009a). Furthermore, a survey targeting youth in Isan indicated that they show cultural resistance to modern diets (Seubsman et al., 2009b). Bangkok which we chose as urban city is cosmopolitan where residents are affected by urbanized environment, notably dilution of their traditional foods by Western or modern diets. The structure and functionality of their gut microbiota were monitored in terms of fecal microbiome and metabolome configurations.",

Using the simulated matrices, the PERMANOVA powers were calculated for varying effect sizes (\u03c92) and sample sizes (Supplementary Figure S1). As a result, 10 subjects per group afford 80% power to detect an \u03c92 of 0.10 which corresponds to the difference between the Bangkok children and children in Khon Kaen, a rural city in Thailand. Ten subjects per group afford 80% power to detect an \u03c92 of 0.05 which corresponds to the effect observed in a controlled-feeding study (Wu et al., 2011) and 15 subjects per group afford 100% power to detect the same effect size.

To determine the statistical significance of differences in the amounts of certain metabolites in the metabolotype groups, a pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed with or without Bonferroni adjustment in R ver. 3.3.2. Pearson\u2019s correlation between each metabolite and bacterial abundance was determined by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient test in Stata SE12. To examine the confounding effects of age and gender, we performed the multivariate regression analysis in Stata SE12 using butyrate or propionate concentration as dependent variable and age and city, or gender and city as the independent variables.",

Buriram children consumed more rice and vegetables, whereas children in Bangkok consumed more bread, meat, and beverages. Notably, consumption of vegetables in Bangkok children was considerably reduced corresponding to 1.0% of total calorie intake, whereas Buriram children consumed them almost every day corresponding to 7.3% of total calorie intake. All of the participating children in both cities consumed rice, particularly steamed rice, almost every day, suggesting that rice was the main carbohydrate source for Thai children. However, its frequency and amount consumed were much greater in Buriram children (10.2 times per week, 207.1 kcal/day) than in Bangkok children (6.3 times per week, 140.8 kcal/day). Furthermore, Buriram children consumed more glutinous rice (101.4 kcal/day), served in the traditional Isan style, than Bangkok children (13.1 kcal/day). On the other hand, Bangkok children consumed more single-dish rice (94.4 kcal/day), such as fried rice (see Supplementary Table S2-1), than Buriram children (40.3 kcal/day). Total calorie intake was slightly higher in Bangkok children, although the difference between their intake and that of children in Buriram was not statistically significant.",

A PCA using the log-ratio transformed nutrient matrix data showed a significant differences of dietary habits between children in Bangkok and Buriram (p < 0.001 in PERMANOVA analysis, Supplementary Figure S2). Indeed, children in Bangkok consumed significantly more fat and sugar and less beta-carotene than children in Buriram (Figures 1C,D and Supplementary Table S2-3). The fat consumption ratio among Bangkok children was statistically higher than among Buriram children (35.9 \u00b1 5.9% vs. 29.7 \u00b1 5.3%, p = 0.0017 in Student\u2019s t-test). The statistical power for this comparison was 0.92 at p = 0.05 in the post hoc analysis, indicating sufficient power of this study to address the difference in the dietary habit between these two groups. The difference in the fat consumption ratio was a result of the higher intake of fried rice, cooked breads, and processed meats by Bangkok children (Supplementary Table S2-2) and the difference in the intake of beta-carotene reflects a lower rate of vegetable consumption in Bangkok children than in Buriram children (Supplementary Table S2-1). In summary, dietary habits of participating children in Bangkok were significantly modernized and westernized, whereas Buriram children had more traditional Thai dietary habits.",

As unanticipated, there was no statistical differences in the community structures between Bangkok and Buriram groups, even though the statistical power reached adequate level to detect a large and middle effect size such as enterotype differentiation or impact by controlled-diet feeding (Kelly et al., 2015). Therefore, we profiled the bacterial community at family level by the PCA (Figure \u200bFigure2A2A). Three enterotype-like variations were observed, although they were not entirely discrete: the first one, localized in the PC1-positive region, was defined by a high abundance of Bacteroidaceae; the second one, localized in the PC1-negative region, was defined by a high abundance of Prevotellaceae; and the third one, localized in the PC2-negative region, was defined by a high abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae. Although there was no obvious relationship between the city of residence and the enterotype-like cluster, Bangkok and Buriram samples tended to be driven in PC2-positive and -negative directions, respectively (Figure \u200bFigure2B2B).",

As shown in Figure \u200bFigure5A5A, Bangkok children were more highly colonized by classes Actinobacteria and orders Selenomadales and Bacteroidales, whereas Buriram children were more highly colonized by some taxonomic groups belonging to the order Clostridiales, such as families Peptostreptococcaceae and unclassified Ruminococcaceae. In Figure \u200bFigure5B5B, the relative abundance of taxonomic groups showing an LDA score greater than 103 (taxa indicated by bold letters in Figure \u200bFigure5B5B) was summed for the Bangkok type (Negativicutes + Bacteroides+ Porphyromonadaceae + Bifidobacterium) and the Buriram type (Peptostreptococcaceae + unclassified Ruminococcaceae), and the ratio of the sum of the Buriram type to the sum of the Bangkok type was calculated for each child (henceforth, the ratio is called the BR/BK taxa ratio). The BR/BK taxa ratio was significantly different between children in Bangkok and Buriram, as shown in Figure \u200bFigure5C5C (p < 0.001 in Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The statistical power for this comparison was 0.88 at p = 0.05 in the post hoc analysis, indicating sufficient power of this study to address the alteration in the gut microbial community between Bangkok and Buriram children.",

This type was characterized by high concentrations of choline, betaine, and carnitine, which are generally abundant in red meat and dairy products, and also a series of biogenic amines such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and putrescine. A number of previous studies have shown that these meat-derived amines are converted to trimethylamine by gut bacteria and further metabolized by a liver enzyme to trimethylamine N-oxide, which is associated with metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, and cancer (Velasquez et al., 2016). In the stool samples from Thai children, trimethylamine concentrations were positively correlated with amine levels and were significantly more abundant in participants in the MT5 group (Supplementary Figure S4). The microbiota associated with MT5 samples was characterized by a high abundance of the genera Haemophilus and Sutterella (Figure \u200bFigure8A8A) and low alpha diversity (Figure \u200bFigure8C8C).",

The abundance of each KEGG pathway group was compared among the metabolotypes. As a result, KEGG pathways involved in \u201cmetabolism\u201d and some other subcategories were shown to be overrepresented in MT2 group compared with other groups, particularly MT1 (Supplementary Figure S5). Therefore, we compared the abundances of all KEGG annotated genes between groups MT1 and MT2, and genes overrepresented in the MT1 group were mapped in the KEGG pathway (Supplementary Table S6). The results showed that MT1 was enriched in genes involved in the metabolism of plant-related compounds, such as flavonoid, carotenoid and limonene. MT2 was enriched in nitrogen metabolism including amino acid metabolism, as well as lipid and energy metabolism, whereas MT1 was enriched in ketone body metabolism and phosphotransferase system as well as butanoate metabolism. Notably, 8 genes were overrepresented in butyrate biosynthesis pathways in MT1, including paths from glutamate as well as pyruvate (Figure \u200bFigure99). Those genes involved in the paths from glutamate are mainly encoded by bacteria in the genus Romboutsia, family Peptostreptococcaceae, whereas those in the paths from pyruvate are encoded by various genera, although Romboutsia is one of major contributors. Further, 19 genes involved in phosphotransferase system, including cellobiose phosphotransferase, were overrepresented in MT1, suggesting that higher capacity of MT1 microbiome to ferment a variety of sugars. There was no statistical difference in the total abundance of propanoate metabolism between MT1 and MT2. However, 8 genes, including propionate CoA-transferase [EC:2.8.3.1] gene, were statistically enriched in the pathway of propanote metabolism of MT1 group (data not shown).",

As a result, we found a signature of urbanization in the intestinal microbiome and metabolome configurations of Bangkok children. In fact, participants from these two cities showed distinct dietary habits: Buriram children more or less retained Isan traditional dietary habits, which include foods low in fat and high in vegetables, whereas Bangkok children consumed more sugar and fat, perhaps reflecting the urbanization of their dietary culture. The average total fat intake in Bangkok children was more than 35% of total energy intake, the upper level recommended for children by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2010). The dietary records in this study indicate that the higher amount of fat intake in Bangkok children depends on cooking style more than raw materials: for example, many fried meals were served to Bangkok children. The consumption of less vegetables by children in Bangkok, particularly those with an MT2 metabolotype, was remarkable. This is reflected in the low consumptions of beta-carotene.",

These results suggested that low-fat and vegetable-based diets promote the colonization by Prevotella-type microbiota. The Prevotella/Bacteroides trade-off was also found in a study comparing the gut microbiota of children from Burkina Faso consuming a rural African diet rich in dietary fiber and Italian children consuming a modern Western diet (De Filippo et al., 2010). Further, recent studies have observed the Prevotella/Bacteroides trade-off within a country (De Filippo et al., 2017; Nakayama et al., 2017), suggesting that the enterotype shift is ongoing in developing countries. Unexpectedly, however, we did not observe the enterotype shift between Bangkok and Buriram children. Preliminary data showed that the enterotypes were not consistent in this Thai cohort across samplings with a 1-month interval, while most Japanese children were consistently colonized by a Bacteroides-type enterotype. This could suggest that the gut microbiota of Thai children is now being influenced by modern diets and are in a state of transition.",

The F/B ratio is known to be positively correlated with high-fat diet-induced obesity (Ley et al., 2006; Turnbaugh et al., 2008, 2009; Hildebrandt et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012). In this study, however, Bangkok children, who tended to consume a high-fat diet and to be overweight, showed a lower F/B ratio. This agrees with a line of studies suggesting that species, community, or functional level studies are required to understand the causation between diets and microbiota (Duncan et al., 2008; Schwiertz et al., 2010; Daniel et al., 2014). Indeed, some families or genera, such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Porphyromonadaceae, are commonly higher in children in Italy (De Filippo et al., 2017) as well as children in Bangkok, suggesting a niche established in the gut environment of urban children.",

A line of African children gut microbiota studies have commonly indicated the high level of the series of SCFAs (De Filippo et al., 2010, 2017). Although acetate was not measurable in our CE-TOF-MS system, the rural children in Thailand also showed higher level of propionate and butyrate than Bangkok children. The line of studies on Africans and Asians demonstrated that their rural microbiomes have higher capacity to accept a variety of sugars, including overrepresentations of phosphotransferase genes and carbohydrate-active enzyme genes (Rampelli et al., 2015). These results suggested that human gut microbiome primarily evolved to utilize a wide range of carbon source and was then narrowed down under the excessive intakes of simple sugars.",

The dietary habits of MT2 children were characterized by high-fat and remarkably low-vegetable consumption. Although there is no direct evidence, this suggests that their urbanized dietary habit altered the gut microbial communities of Bangkok children and reduced the microbial production of SCFAs. Whereas SCFAs in the intestine benefit the host, overrepresentation of amino acids in the gut has been found to associated with gut dysbiosis in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) (Ni et al., 2017). This paper reported an 15N flux study in mice that showed bacterial urease releases ammonia by hydrolysis of host urea and allows the transfer of host-derived nitrogen to the gut microbiota as a source of amino acid biosynthesis.",

It is notable that the BMIs of these MT4 subjects were lower than those of the other groups, except for those in the MT1 group, which might be related to their unusual gut microbiota and environments. On the other hand, MT5 was characterized as rich in metabolites, especially amines and amino acids. It is interesting that the CD patients in the aforementioned paper were also abundant in fecal amines, similar to patients with inflammatory bowel disease reported elsewhere (Ni et al., 2017; Santoru et al., 2017). Furthermore, a high abundance of Haemophilus belonging to potentially pathogenic bacteria in MT5 subjects was also common in CD patients (Ni et al., 2017). Although numerous studies have shown, in terms of physiology as well as toxicology, the diverse activity of biogenic amines, those in the intestine should be further investigated. It should be noted that the same contrast in fecal amino acids and biogenic amines was observed in Italians and Hadza hunter-gatherers (Turroni et al., 2016), suggesting that dysbiosis-like metabolomic changes are a sign of stress in gut microbial communities under the urbanization of diets.",

As a number of previous studies have demonstrated that plant-based diets promote colonic fermentation of SCFAs and have a profound effect on human health, the high-vegetable Thai traditional diets appears to benefit children in Thailand and the lower level of fecal SCFAs appears to be a risk marker of dietary urbanization in Thailand. A larger scale community-based cohort study is warranted to monitor the impact of urban diets on the health and disease of youngster in developing countries in South\u2013East Asia.",
