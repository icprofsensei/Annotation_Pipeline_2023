However, they are not routinely used in clinical or industrial applications, due to the length of time required to generate and analyze omics data. Here, we applied a novel integrated omics pipeline for the analysis of human and environmental samples in under 48\u00a0h. Human subjects that ferment their own foods provided swab samples from skin, feces, oral cavity, fermented foods, and household surfaces to assess the impact of home food fermentation on their microbial and chemical ecology. These samples were analyzed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing, inferred gene function profiles, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics through the Qiita, PICRUSt, and GNPS pipelines, respectively. The human sample microbiomes clustered with the corresponding sample types in the American Gut Project (http://www.americangut.org), and the fermented food samples produced a separate cluster. The microbial communities of the household surfaces were primarily sourced from the fermented foods, and their consumption was associated with increased gut microbial diversity. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that human skin and fermented food samples had separate chemical ecologies and that stool was more similar to fermented foods than to other sample types. Metabolites from the fermented foods, including plant products such as procyanidin and pheophytin, were present in the skin and stool samples of the individuals consuming the foods. Some food metabolites were modified during digestion, and others were detected in stool intact. This study represents a first-of-its-kind analysis of multi-omics data that achieved time intervals matching those of classic microbiological culturing.",

Omics methods, such as 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics, and metabolomics, can provide a more complete picture of a microbial community and its metabolite production, without the biases and selectivity of microbial culture. However, these advanced methods have not been applied to clinical or industrial microbiology or other areas where complex microbial dysbioses require immediate intervention. The reason for this is the length of time required to generate and analyze omics data. Here, we describe the development and application of a pipeline for multi-omics data analysis in time frames matching those of the culture-based approaches often used for these applications. This study applied multi-omics methods effectively in clinically relevant time frames and sets a precedent toward their implementation in clinical medicine and industrial microbiology.",

However, generating, processing, analyzing, and interpreting the data typically takes months and requires substantial technical expertise in large multidisciplinary teams, in part, due to the rapidly evolving nature of the component techniques. The speed of mass spectrometry and nucleic acid sequencing (the tools required to generate omics data) has increased rapidly in the last decade, and they have separately been applied to clinical diagnostics in a targeted fashion. For example, high-throughput sequencing for the detection and typing of single pathogens in complex samples has achieved turnaround times of hours to days (1,\u20135), and mass spectrometry analysis of metabolites has been performed in the clinic and laboratory in essentially real time (6, 7).

The subjects in this study are tightly linked to their microbial partners through their active involvement with fermented foods. This mutualistic relationship is believed to have existed since the Paleolithic era (17) and continues around the globe today. Modern human evolution is intertwined with the influence of microbial fermentation processes in the foods we eat and within our own bodies. Depending on the type of food and conditions used during fermentation, different types of microbial communities form, composed of various bacterial and fungal species (18), and the metabolic products of these communities can impact human health (19). Previous studies found that species originating from microbially diverse fermented foods, such as cheese and salami, are able to colonize the gastrointestinal tract (19). Furthermore, with the significant effects of antibiotics and a processed food-based diet on our microbiomes (13, 20, 21), there is an interest in the health benefits of fermented foods as alternatives. Here, we present the results from a simple, robust multi-omics platform integrating analyses of human, environmental, and animal samples in the clinically relevant time frame of less than 48\u00a0h. This pipeline is now possible because of rapid advances in the development of software for the analysis and integration of omics data and standardized protocols that allow streamlined insertion of matched samples into multi-omics pipelines. We demonstrate how individuals commonly exposed to fermented foods show influences of these microbes on and in their bodies.",

The AGP is an IRB-approved citizen science project comprising more than 7,000 samples from more than 6,500 individuals. Consenting participants received an AGP sampling kit after they gave consent and took a survey online, and the data were stored in a secure database. The deidentified metadata were then immediately downloaded into a file formatted for use in Qiita (https://qiita.ucsd.edu/). Due to the infrastructure surrounding the process, participant consent and sample-associated metadata were obtained before the samples arrived in the laboratory, facilitating immediate preparation for sample processing upon arrival. Notably, the metadata can be used for both 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics analyses, further streamlining the multi-omics approach. Samples were collected by cotton swab and subjected to DNA and metabolite extraction to describe the composition and activity of the corresponding microbial communities. Samples were subjected to a streamlined, high-throughput process involving preparation for 16S rRNA gene (variable region 4 [V4]) sequencing via the Earth Microbiome Project protocols (22, 23) and for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (24). The first description of both the microbial communities and molecules, including alpha and beta diversity, and specific effects of fermented foods on the microbial and chemical ecology of the subjects, occurred within 48\u00a0h after samples were delivered to the laboratory (Fig.\u00a01). Computational resources, including the Barnacle cluster available through the UCSD center for microbiome innovation connected to the Comet supercomputer located at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, allowed >50 central processing unit (CPU) h of processing in <11\u00a0h of wall time (note that some of the component steps are not parallelized), giving results back to the researchers fast enough to interpret the data in a timely manner.",

First, subjects easily and efficiently enrolled themselves as part of an already existing, IRB-approved project (the AGP), enabling the use of on-the-spot informed consent and standardized metadata collection. Second, the protocols used to collect metadata and process samples have been extensively benchmarked and standardized (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/), allowing rapid assimilation with existing datasets and facilitating meaningful comparisons with other cohorts. Third, community analysis infrastructures, including Qiita, the microbial analysis infrastructure that houses microbiome analysis tools, and GNPS, a crowdsourced analysis infrastructure and public metabolomics knowledge repository (http://gnps.ucsd.edu), allowed rapid data processing and interpretation. And fourth, the servers that host Qiita and GNPS are linked, enabling normalization, processing, and cross-platform analysis of multi-omics data in an integrated fashion. Both these analysis platforms enable rapid comparisons to existing data in the public domain and are publicly available, facilitating data upload and analysis from any sequencer or tandem mass spectrometer, so long as the file formats are compatible. Linking the two platforms limits the need to move gigabytes or terabytes of data, making local analysis on one\u2019s own computer and integration with existing knowledge possible, rather than needing to download public data and new data to a personal computer first (e.g., the AGP data repository contains over 216 million reads). Tools available through this pipeline and utilized in this study include operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering of reads and generation of tables for multivariate statistical analysis of microbiome data, including alpha diversity, principle component analysis (PCoA) visualization through EMPeror, cluster significance testing with analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), and others. This pipeline also allows immediate integration of data with the data in the AGP repository to visualize the relationships of samples with a large reference data set, which can provide context to the microbiome data generated. Metabolomics tools include library searching of the GNPS libraries (the largest currently available in the mass spectrometry field) (25), molecular network visualization to allow metabolite tracking, and metabolome abundance matrix generation to allow similar multivariate statistical analysis, including PCoA and EMPeror-based visualization of sample relationships.",

The three most diverse samples were pickles, beet kvass, and port wine (PD values of 23.0, 16.6, and 16.2, respectively), while dairy kefir and \u201csymbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast\u201d (SCOBY) samples were the least diverse (average PD values of 2.21 and 1.91, respectively). The average PD of all fermented foods in the data set was 9.89, compared to 21.6, 11.9, and 18.5 for human skin, oral, and fecal samples, respectively. Surface microbiomes were also rich, with an average PD of 11.5. The unweighted UniFrac matrix (27) visualized via principle component analysis (PCoA) using EMPeror clustered the samples closely by type (ANOSIM R statistic = 0.477, P = 0.001; see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material), and the human sample types matched their corresponding AGP sample types (Fig.\u00a02a). While mouth, stool, and right and left hand samples each formed relatively tight clusters, as expected (28), fermented food and indoor surface samples formed a looser cluster together, largely distinct from human sample clusters, although a few food and surface samples clustered near hand and fecal samples (Fig.\u00a02a). Combining these samples with a subset of the AGP cohort revealed that there was an increase in gut bacterial diversity that correlated with an increase in fermented food consumption (R2 = 0.034, P = 0.02373) (Fig.\u00a02b). Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests corrected for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate [FDR]) identified 219 OTUs differing significantly in relative abundance across sample types. No OTU was significantly higher in fermented food samples than in any other sample type, though several were higher (FDR corrected P < 0.05) in stool (including OTUs classified as Blautia, Varibaculum, Bacteroides, Peptoniphilus, and Corynebacterium), hand (Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Rothia), and mouth (Prevotella, Neisseria, Lautropia, and Leptotrichia) samples. SourceTracker (29) analysis revealed that the microbial communities of items on or in which fermented foods were prepared (i.e., from surfaces, such as cutting boards, to containers, such as fermenters) were largely sourced from the foods and specific to the location in which the foods were prepared. Except for one household, where small percentages (9 to 30%) of hand microbial communities were sourced from food, no obvious patterns linked microbial source communities to human skin, mouth, or fecal microbiomes (Fig.\u00a02c).",

While fermented food and surface samples still formed a loose cluster, with body types more tightly clustered, oral samples clustered close to fecal samples based on KEGG pathways but not 16S marker gene data (Fig.\u00a02d). Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests corrected for multiple comparisons (FDR) identified 119 KEGG pathways differing significantly across sample types. KEGG pathways that were significantly higher (FDR-corrected P value of <0.05) in fermented foods than on surfaces included aminosugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, RNA transport, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and methane metabolism; KEGG pathways that were significantly higher on surface samples than in food samples included bacterial secretion systems, phenylalanine metabolism, fluorobenzoate degradation, aminobenzoate degradation, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and caprolactam degradation. Several KEGG pathways were also differentially abundant between fermented foods and stool or mouth samples. For example, aminobenzoate degradation, retinol metabolism, naphthalene degradation, ethylbenzene degradation, tyrosine metabolism, and butanoate metabolism pathways were all significantly higher (FDR-corrected P value of <0.05) in fermented food samples than in stool samples, while glycosaminoglycan degradation, other glycan degradation, methane metabolism, transcription machinery, sporulation, sphingolipid metabolism, and sporulation pathways were significantly higher in stool samples than in fermented food samples. In mouth samples, n-glycan biosynthesis, translation factors and proteins, amino acid-related proteins, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and biosynthesis proteins were significantly (FDR-corrected P value of <0.05) higher than in fermented food samples. Conversely, chloroalkane degradation, ethylbenzene degradation, aminobenzoate degradation, tyrosine metabolism, bisphenol degradation, naphthalene degradation, benzoate degradation, xylene degradation, butanoate metabolism, and several other pathways were significantly higher in fermented food samples than in mouth samples.",

This 1.3% match rate is similar to the 1.8% match rates for all metabolomics data in GNPS (32). Most spectral matches were plant natural products associated with the fermented foods, including flavonoids, lipids, and plant sterols. Other, non-plant-related molecules were observed, including cholesterol and its derivatives on skin and avobenzone, an active ingredient in sunscreen. Gingerol, the spicy flavorant in the ginger root (Zingiber officinale), was found in samples of fermented foods and the indoor surfaces of two households. Similarly, the spicy pepper plant (Piper nigrum) alkaloid piperine was found in fermented food, stool, indoor surface, and skin samples. The metabolite polanrazine B, isolated from Leptosphaeria maculans, a fungal pathogen of canola and rapeseed plants (Brassica spp.) (44), was prevalent in two of the four households sampled, including in food and stool samples. Spectral matching also identified the flavonoid procyanidin B2 (m/z 579.149), an antioxidant associated with many plants, such as apples, beans, grapes, and tea, and molecular networking detected an altered form with an additional pentose sugar (neutral loss of m/z 132.04 [33] [Fig. 4a]). Procyanidin B2 was present in the biofilm, fermented food, indoor surface, human skin, and stool samples. This metabolite was present in all sample types from a single subject, including the foods the person ate, surfaces in the household, the person\u2019s body, and stool (Fig.\u00a04b). Although fermented foods from all four households contained procyanidin B2, only two of them had this molecule in their stool, indicating differential metabolism in different individuals. The modified form of procyanidin (m/z 711.189) was found in the same sample types except stool, suggesting that consumption of this metabolite from a fermented food resulted in removal of the sugar or the absorption of the molecule as it passed the digestive tract. Pheophytin A, chlorophyll a without its metal ion, was only detected in samples of fermented foods of vegetable origin (except beer), their containers, and stool, indicating that this molecule remained intact through digestion (Fig. 4a and \u200bandb).b). Related metabolites, including bacteriopheophytin and pyropheophytin, were detected only in kimchi (Fig. 4a). In sum, analysis of metabolites from human samples revealed molecules from fermented foods modified by human or microbial enzymes, molecules produced by organisms pathogenic for components of the fermented food, molecules from fermented food that passed completely through the volunteers\u2019 digestive tracts without alteration, and differential metabolism of fermented food metabolites in different people.",

A major advantage to this pipeline is the ability to compare data to large data repositories, such as the AGP and GNPS, for sample relationships and metabolite identification. This more easily facilitates the identification of microbiome dysbiosis or metabolome changes that indicate disease. Context is required in any clinical or industrial application of multi-omics data, to better determine how the current structure of a microbial community compares to previous states or sample types, enabling diagnosis of an active dysbiosis. The present study focused on fermented foods and their effects on the people who prepared and consumed them. These foods are of enormous medical importance given that yogurt, a fermented food, is the single food most correlated epidemiologically with weight loss in the U.S. population (35), and they are of economic importance due to the billions of dollars per year that fermented foods contribute to the economy. Although this sample cohort did not require rapid data analysis, such as that required in a medical emergency or the potential loss of a large industrial fermentation, this study shows that consent could be obtained, samples collected, and data generated on microbiome-related samples collected from people located up to 100 miles away from the laboratory in a time frame matching that of classic microbiological culturing of common pathogens (approximately 2\u00a0days). The ability to do rapid-response multi-omics analysis and systems biology will have far reaching implications, from monitoring industrial fermentation processes, to guiding oil and gas drilling and fracking decisions, to providing rapid molecular analysis for patient care in infectious diseases and guiding the use of microbiome-based therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) (36) and probiotics. The combination of standardized protocols for subject recruitment and consent, sample collection, metadata capture, DNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, molecular networking, and data analysis and visualization now puts this technology in the hands of a broad spectrum of users. Broader and more rapid use of multi-omics methods will begin a sea change towards their implementation in clinical medicine.",

Participants willing to sample their own bodies, their fermented foods, and the surfaces that their foods are prepared on or in (i.e., kitchen counters, cutting boards, and fermenters) consented to be a part of the American Gut Project (AGP), the largest crowd-sourced, crowd-funded citizen science project in existence today. A total of seven people (two families and two individuals, designated households 1 to 4) received barcoded, dual-headed sterile cotton sampling swabs (BD Swube; Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and were instructed to sample their skin (right and left hands), mouths, stool, their fermented foods, and the surfaces touched by those foods. Some participants chose to sample alternative body sites (i.e., vagina and forehead), and one participant sampled the mouth of a pet cat. The food samples collected included beer, port wine, pickled cucumbers, pickled jalapenos, cottage cheese, curtido, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, beet kvass, and fermented soda (see Table\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material). The surface samples collected included cutting boards, countertops, refrigerator surfaces, skillets, kegerator parts, and fermentor parts.

Samples from six participants were delivered by hand to the laboratory, while one participant mailed their samples to the laboratory via overnight priority mail (FedEx). All samples were received in the laboratory by 1:07\u00a0p.m. on 27\u00a0January 2016 (Fig.\u00a01). Upon arrival, one swab head from each dual-headed swab was immediately placed into a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit bead plate (MoBio, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) for bacterial DNA extraction.

The methanol extract was then dried down in a centrifugal evaporator and redissolved in 100% methanol. Samples were transferred into 2-ml vials with inserts and diluted 1:2. MS analysis was performed on a QExactive (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) probe source, controlled by Xcalibur 3.0 software. MS spectra were acquired in positive ion mode over a mass range of 100 to 1,500\u00a0m/z. An external calibration with Pierce LTQ Velos electrospray ionization (ESI) positive ion calibration solution (Thermo Scientific) was performed prior to data acquisition, with an error rate of less than 1\u00a0ppm. The following probe settings were used for flow aspiration and ionization: spray voltage of 3,500\u00a0V, sheath gas (N2) pressure of 53\u00a0lb/in2, auxiliary gas (N2) pressure of 14\u00a0lb/in2, ion source temperature of 270\u00b0C, S-lens radio frequency (RF) level of 50\u00a0Hz, and auxiliary gas heater temperature at 440\u00b0C. Data acquisition parameters were as follows. Minutes 0 to 0.5 were sent to waste. Minutes 0.5 to 12 were recorded with data-dependent MS/MS acquisition mode. Full scan at MS1 level was performed with resolution of 35,000 in profile mode. The 10 most intense ions with 1\u00a0m/z isolation window per MS1 scan were selected and subjected to normalized collision-induced dissociation with 30\u00a0eV. MS2 scans were performed at 17,500 resolution with maximum injection time of 60\u00a0ms in profile mode. The MS/MS active exclusion parameter was set to 5.0\u00a0s. The injected samples were chromatographically separated using a Vanquish ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) instrument (Thermo Scientific) controlled by Thermo SII for Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific), with a 30- by 2.1-mm, 2.6\u00a0\u00b5M, C18, 100-\u00c5 Kinetex chromatography column (Phenomenex) with 40\u00b0C column temperature, 0.5\u00a0ml/min flow rate, mobile phase A consisting of 99.9% water (LC-MS grade; J.T.
