The Shannon Diversity Index was generally assumed to be normally distributed and Student\u2019s t-test was used to assess differences in mean Shannon indices when data were normally distributed and Welch\u2019s correction was employed given that equal standard deviations were not assumed. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test for differences if the normality assumption was not met. For changes in specific genera, only mapped genera >1% in abundance were analyzed (a total of 29 genera). The Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery rate was applied to account for multiple comparisons when testing changes in individual taxa. Correlations were determined using Pearson\u2019s \u03c1 value, and significance was determined using standard rank correlation tests. Change over time was assessed via a linear mixed-effects model with random slope and intercept terms for each patient, employing an unstructured covariance. The model fit of fitted models versus alternatives (e.g. with respect to a random intercept linear mixed effect model with exponential covariance structure) was assessed using residuals QQ-plots and scatterplots, inspection of the individual patients\u2019 residual autocorrelation functions, and also by fitting a simple linear regression between the fitted and observed values and then calculating that regression's R2.26 Statistical significance in the linear mixed-effects was determined by computing P values using Satterthwaite\u2019s approximation for the degrees of freedom as well as a bootstrap confidence interval for the grand mean slope parameters across patient samples.27 Relationships between two categorical variables were analyzed using \u03c72 or Fisher\u2019s exact test in the case of 2\u00d72 contingency tables.

When patients were classified into two groups: 1) the infection group which included patients with MDIs and CDIs; and 2) the non-infection group which included patients with FUO, NIF, and no infection/no fever, we found that the \u03b1-diversity of baseline stool samples from the infection group was significantly lower than the non-infection group (P = 0.047, Fig. 2A). To ensure our findings were not limited to one measurement of \u03b1-diversity, we repeated our analysis using four additional diversity measurements and found that the patients in the MDI + CDI group had statistically significantly lower initial stool values compared to the non-infection group for three of the four indices (Supporting Information). As FUO patients could be considered as having an unrecognized infection, we also reclassified the FUO patients to the infection group and found that a significant difference remained between these two groups in terms of baseline \u03b1-diversity of the stool samples (P = 0.05, Fig. 2B). Regardless of how patients were classified, no statistically significant relationships were identified between baseline \u03b1-diversity of the oral samples and subsequent infectious episodes (data not shown). Interestingly, neutropenia prior to IC initiation was significantly associated with low baseline oral (P=0.002) and stool (P=0.007) \u03b1-diversity (Fig. 2C and D). However, neutropenia prior to IC was not an independent risk factor for infection during IC (data not shown). Additionally, morphologic complete remission was not associated with baseline \u03b1-diversity at either site (Supporting Information). Thus, baseline \u03b1-diversity of the stool, but not oral, samples was associated with the development of infectious complications during IC.",

Nineteen genera accounted for 90% of the domination events (Fig. 4A) and were divided into common causes of bacteremia in neutropenic patients and typical commensal microbiota (Supporting Information).1, 33 We removed Streptococcus spp. from this analysis because of its common role as a commensal in healthy hosts and as an invasive pathogen in neutropenic patient.33 We discovered that the rates of domination shifted such that by the completion of IC nearly 50% of the domination events were caused by common causes of bacteremia (e.g. Staphylococcus, Enterobacter, Escherichia, etc.) as compared to ~20% prior to or in the first week of IC (P=0.002) (Fig. 4B).",

Nine out of 28 fully evaluable patients developed a MDI (primarily bacteremias) in the 90 days post longitudinal sampling (longitudinal sampling typically ceased upon IC neutrophil recovery) (Supporting Information). Although the Shannon Index was lower in both the final stool and oral samples in patients who subsequently developed an MDI, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.50 and 0.12, respectively, Table 2). Similarly, we observed a greater decrease in the Shannon Index between the initial and final stool and oral samples in the patients who went on to develop an MDI, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.24 and 0.45, respectively, Table 2). Notably, patients who had a decrease in the Shannon diversity index of both oral and stool samples had a significantly higher rate of MDI in the follow-up period compared to patients who did not experience a decrease in diversity (P = 0.04) (Table 2). Given the known relationship between antibiotic administration and loss of microbial diversity, we analyzed and determined an association between the number of antibiotics administered during IC, and the occurrence of infections in the 90 days post longitudinal sampling (P=0.02) (Supporting Information).",

One of our key findings was that a low baseline \u03b1-diversity in stool samples is associated with development of infection during IC (Fig. 2). Similar to healthy adults, patients entering into leukemia IC have a wide range of \u03b1-diversity, although the factors driving this variability are not fully understood and may include previous antibiotic exposure, diet, and genetics, among others. We did observe a significant relationship between pre-IC neutropenia and low baseline stool \u03b1-diversity, although neutropenia itself was not a risk factor for subsequent infectious episodes in our cohort. Given that we do not have pre-IC antibiotic administration data on these patients, as they were often referred to our center, it is possible that neutropenic patients were more likely to have received antimicrobials which could have lowered their \u03b1-diversity or the neutropenia itself may have affected the microbiome given the close relationship between the human immune system and the GI flora. If corroborated with larger studies, baseline \u03b1-diversity could help delineate patients into high- and low-risk infection groups therebyfacilitating targeting of prophylactic and empiric antimicrobials.",

We additionally found that the overall oral microbiome \u03b1-diversity also decreases during leukemia treatment (Fig. 3A). However, the loss in diversity was not universal, and some patients actually gained diversity during IC (Fig. 3B; upper right quadrant). A statistically significant proportion of the patients that decreased in \u03b1-diversity in both the oral and stool samples over the course of IC contracted MDIs in the 90 days post longitudinal sampling. Additionally, we found that the greater number of antibiotics received during IC was significantly associated with increased risk of infection post-IC. Thus, an increased understanding of the factors that allow patients to maintain microbial diversity during IC, such as diet or antibiotic exposure, could assist in designing interventions to mitigate post-IC infections. Similarly, comparisons of baseline and final \u03b1-diversity measurements may prove useful in deciding the intensity of post-IC infection monitoring strategies.",

The mechanism by which Blautia might protect HSCT patients from GVHD is not currently known, but Blautia species are known to induce regulatory T-cell proliferation which in turn may assist with limiting GI epithelial inflammation.35, 36 Nearly 60% of our cohort received a carbapenem, and receipt of a carbapenem was associated with a significant percentage of patients losing \u03b1-diversity in both stool and oral samples which was not statistically significant for pipericillin-tazobactam and cefepime. As we did not isolate a single infection causing bacteria for which a cabapenem may offer increased activity compared in the two other major treatment antibiotics, these data provide increasing impetus to better understand the trade-off between broad-spectrum antimicrobial administration and the collateral damage on the microbiome caused by such agents, especially in hematologic malignancy patients who are at prolonged risk for infection due to multiple rounds of intensive chemotherapy or HSCT.",

Additionally, low numbers of bacteremia/other MDIs limited our ability perform further statistical analyses of infections. However, our study is strengthened by a large number of longitudinal samples (averaging 14 samples per patient), sampling at two sites, and the depth of sequencing (average of 33,645 sequence reads per specimen) which provided an improved ability to fully characterize the microbiome compared to previous longitudinal studies in treated cancer patients.
