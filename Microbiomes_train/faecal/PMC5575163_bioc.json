The precise causes of FC are still unknown and are most likely multifactorial. Growing evidence indicates that alterations of gut microbiota composition contribute to constipation symptoms. Nevertheless, many discrepancies exist in literature and no clear link between FC and gut microbiota composition has as yet been identified. In this study, we performed 16\u2009S rRNA-based microbial profiling analysis of 147 stool samples from 68 FC individuals and compared their microbial profiles with those of 79 healthy subjects (HS). Notably, the gut microbiota of FC individuals was shown to be depleted of members belonging to Bacteroides, Roseburia and Coprococcus 3. Furthermore, the metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiomes of five FC and five HS individuals were evaluated through shotgun metagenomics using a MiSeq platform, indicating that HS are enriched in pathways involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid and lipid metabolism as compared to FC. In contrast, the microbiomes corresponding to FC were shown to exhibit high abundance of genes involved in hydrogen production, methanogenesis and glycerol degradation. The identified differences in bacterial composition and metabolic capabilities may play an important role in development of FC symptoms.",

These encompass metabolic, nutritional, physiological and immunological processes that are vital to maintain the host\u2019s health status1, 2. In this context, alterations in the gut microbiota composition have been linked to certain common human intestinal diseases, such as pseudomembranous colitis (CDI)3\u20138, ulcerative colitis (UC)9\u201311 and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD)9, 12, 13. However, changes in the gut microbiota composition are also considered to play a crucial role in the establishment of gut related disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)14\u201316. Functional constipation (FC) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with a prevalence between 5% and 20% of the general population17, 18, provoking a significant impact on quality of life19. In fact, it can result in discomforts such as abdominal distension, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness and loss of appetite20. Despite its high prevalence, only a small number of studies have investigated its possible correlation with particular gut microbiota alterations. Additionally, most of these studies relied on culture-based methods that are unable to assess the unculturable portion of the gut microbiota21, 22. Moreover, the functional implications of these alterations and their impact on host physiology have never been assessed. Recently, two metagenomic studies compared the microbial population of stools collected from constipated and healthy individuals, highlighting an altered fecal microbiome associated with constipation23, 24. However, these studies were limited by the small sample size and heterogeneity of participants (including women or obese children). Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the observed differences in microbiota composition among healthy and constipated patients suffer from a number of discrepancies20.",

More specifically, we obtained 68 samples from individuals affected by functional constipation (FC), while 44 samples were collected from healthy subjects (HS). The HS dataset was supplemented with data from 35 samples that we published previously8, 25. Notably, these samples had been collected and processed using the same protocols as followed for the 112 samples sequenced in the current study (see below for details). Moreover, analysis of variance of beta-diversity was performed between each pool of samples processed in different sequencing runs, and the obtained data showed absence of any batch effects (Fig.\u00a0S1a). In order to identify microbial biomarkers of functional constipation across all age ranges, we selected individuals with an age ranging from 4 to 94 (average age: 42\u2009\u00b1\u200922 years) (Table\u00a0S1). Remarkably, beta-diversity and PERMANOVA analyses displayed absence of age-related clustering of the samples (Fig.\u00a0S1b). Moreover, the enrolled individuals were not taking prebiotics and/or probiotics, not undergoing antibiotic treatment or any other medical therapy (including those specific for functional constipation such laxatives for one week prior sampling) and not suffering from acute or severe intestinal diseases such as ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn\u2019s disease, acute inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), intestinal cancer and enteritis. Notably, functionally constipated individuals also reporting symptoms typical of IBS-C, such as abdominal pain, were excluded from this study. The selected individuals affected by functional constipation fulfill the ROME-III criteria and manifested infrequent bowel movements that are defined as three or less defecations per week26. Notably, statistical assessment of diet homogeneity of FC and HS groups revealed absence of statistically significant differences (Table\u00a0S2). In order to avoid discrepancies in the in silico data, all newly sequenced as well as previously published datasets included in this study were subjected to bioinformatic analysis using the same pipeline based on a custom script for the Qiime software suite and the same 16\u2009S rRNA database (see Methods for details).",

Therefore, in all cases the retrieved sequencing data is considered adequate to cover the vast majority of biodiversity contained within the samples (Fig.\u00a01). Interestingly, average rarefaction curves revealed a difference between FC and HS samples in that, on average, the former samples were shown to exhibit a higher level of gut microbiota complexity compared to the latter samples. Statistical analysis, calculated for the highest sub-sampling point reached by all samples, i.e. 30,000 reads, showed that the two curves significantly differ based on a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). The observed dissimilarity of the alpha-diversity between FC and HS is in accordance with a previous study24, being indicative of differences in bacterial composition and corresponding metabolic potential (see below). In order to evaluate the inter-individual differences between FC and HS samples in more detail, we assessed the beta-diversity28 by means of unweighted UniFrac29 and represented the results through a 3-Dimensional Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). The PCoA plot shows that the majority of the samples are grouped as two different clusters that correspond to FC or HS individuals, thus highlighting an intriguing difference in microbiota composition between individuals that suffer from functional constipation and healthy individuals (Fig.\u00a01).

Interestingly, the comparison between HS and FC datasets showed that profiles obtained from HS individuals are characterized by a statistically significant over-representation of Bacteroides (% absolute 1.28%, p-value\u2009<\u20090.01), Roseburia (% absolute 1.28%, p-value\u2009<\u20090.01) and Coprococcus 3 (% absolute 0.14%, p-value\u2009<\u20090.01) and a statistically significant under-representation of genera belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family such as Faecalibacterium (% absolute \u22123.54%, p-value\u2009<\u20090.01) (Fig.\u00a02). The depletion of the Bacteroides genus in FC samples may be correlated with alterations of the intestinal motility and secretory functions due to changes in the amount of available physiologically active substances in the metabolic environment of the gut20, 30. In fact, the higher abundance of butyrate-producing taxa, such as Coprococcus and Roseburia, observed in HS samples may explain a faster colonic transit due to the motility-stimulating effect exerted by butyrate in the gut1. In this context, previous studies have reported that butyrate-producing taxa may stimulate colonic motility by induction of serotonin release or by facilitating cholinergic pathways by means of butyrate production31, 32. In contrast, despite being a butyrate-producer, Faecalibacterium is significantly more abundant in FC samples. Interestingly, this genus has been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of constipation via several mechanisms, such as inhibition of mucin secretion and reduction of stool volume24.\n",

                    "text": "A total of 10 individuals were selected among the two clusters obtained from the PCoA analysis (Fig.\u00a01b) as representatives of the FC and HS groups, and total bacterial DNA extracted from corresponding fecal samples was subjected to Illumina shotgun sequencing. These samples were selected on the basis of their microbial profiles that were shown to be closer to the average for each group. Collected read pools ranged from 8,656,289 to 2,885,092 after quality filtering, with an average number of reads per sample of 6,130,802 (Table\u00a0S4). These data were then utilized for the reconstruction of metabolic pathway profiles in the analyzed microbiomes by means of a custom script based on the MetaCyc database33. A comparison between the averages of functionally constipated and the averages of healthy samples showed a significant difference in 629 pathways (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). Of the latter, 327 and 302 pathways were more abundant in FC and HS samples, respectively (Table\u00a0S5). Interestingly, the HS samples exhibited a higher abundance of genes (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) involved in carbohydrate (increase of 21.15%) and fatty acid metabolism (increase of 25.93%) as compared to FC individuals (Fig.\u00a03b). These pathways are implicated in production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and may play a role in stimulating ileal propulsive contractions through an enteric cholinergic reflex, thereby counteracting functional constipation20, 34\u201336. Moreover, FC samples were shown to contain a higher abundance of genes involved in methanogenic pathways (increase of 24.96%, p-value\u2009<\u20090.01) and a predicted higher capability to produce hydrogen (increase of 113.69%, p-value 0.05) as compared to HS (Table\u00a0S5, Fig.\u00a03b). Thus, our data are consistent with previous observations and suggest that the (abundant) presence of methanogenic and H2-consuming populations influence colonic motility and visceral sensitivity, and generate chronic constipation along with several correlated symptoms, such as flatulence and abdominal distension37, 38. Interestingly, datasets obtained from functionally constipated individuals showed lower abundance of genes involved in methylglyoxal degradation as compared to healthy samples (decrease of \u221225.18%, p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a03b). Methylglyoxal is produced by intestinal bacteria and it is reported be a potential toxic metabolite that can be involved in many gut diseases, including functional constipation39. Furthermore, comparison between HS and FC samples highlights a significant difference in pathways implicated in glycerol degradation (decrease of \u221258.93% in HS, p-value\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a03b). Glycerol is known to cause an osmotic effect in the rectum and for this reason is used to treat constipation40. Therefore, the increased ability to degrade glycerol by FC samples may induce and promote the symptoms of constipation. Nevertheless, despite the fact that the use of laxatives in the week before sampling was considered as a exclusion criterion, this observation may be linked to previous and prolonged use of PEG or glycerol suppositories.\n",

These results reflect the putative beneficial role played by Bacteroides to counter FC as also suggested by the higher abundance of this genus in HS with respect to FC samples (see above). Notably, an in depth analysis of 16\u2009S rRNA OTUs of HS samples revealed that 17.33% of the reads belonging to the Bacteroides genus correspond to unknown species, followed by Bacteroides vulgatus (13.83%), Bacteroides uniformis (4.21%) and Bacteroides fragilis (1.74%), thus indicating that further genomic analyses are still needed to shed light on the biological role of this genus in protecting against or in preventing FC.",

Despite the high worldwide prevalence of FC, a clear anatomical or physiological cause for this disorder has yet to be identified, thus pointing at a possible role exerted by the gut microbiota. Here, we confirm preliminary findings regarding gut microbiota compositional shifts in individuals affected by FC as compared to healthy controls, which are concurrent with a statistically significant increase of the gut microbiota biodiversity. Moreover, statistical analysis revealed alterations in relative abundance of specific taxa, such as Bacteroides and Feacalibacterium. Disregarding the fact that the cause of such taxonomic changes can\u2019t be linked to a specific physiological cause and may simply reflect altered transit time or diet, these taxa will be pivotal for diagnostic and prophylactic purposes as statistically-supported microbial biomarkers of constipation. Intriguingly, identification of taxa typically associated to a healthy gut status, e.g. the anti-inflammatory genus Feacalibacterium, as a biomarker of functional constipation, highlights that increased relative abundance of certain taxa in the presence of a gut disorder may not reflect a taxa-specific role in pathogenesis but may be linked to a global alteration of gut microbiota\u2019s homeostasis. Notably, the taxonomic profiles retrieved from faecal samples include both the autochthonous as well as the allochthonous microbiota, and may thus not be fully representative of the resident gut microbial population. In contrast, the use of biopsies from mucosal samples would be ideal to provide information on the indigenous microbiota41. Nevertheless, collection of fecal samples is less invasive and does not require specific clinical procedures. Thus, for a rapid screening aimed at the identification of biomarkers associated with specific disorders, e.g. functional constipation, the use of stool samples does not suffer from the aforementioned problems associated with collection of biopsies.",

To overcome this gap, we profiled metabolic pathways of microbiomes corresponding to functionally constipated and healthy individuals. The here reconstructed gut microbiome of individuals affected by functional constipation revealed for the first time that the FC microbiome is characterized by a high abundance of genes involved in hydrogen production, methanogenesis and glycerol degradation. In contrast, the microbiomes of HS samples showed an increase of pathways implicated in carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism, and in methylglyoxal degradation. Alteration of these metabolic pathways appears to impact on functional constipation and related symptoms, thus highlighting the key functional role exerted by the gut microbiome in maintaining the health status of the host. Nevertheless, due to the limited number of samples that were analysed by shotgun sequencing, additional experiments are needed to validate these observations.",
