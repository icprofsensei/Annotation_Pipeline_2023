Our lab is part of a team investigating the efficacy of FMT for patients suffering from ulcerative colitis, and we have previously shown preliminary success in using FMT for treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis. Microbial engraftment in fecal transplant studies has been very difficult to demonstrate, especially given the low DNA sequence resolution provided in 16SrRNA amplicon sequencing and the challenges in refinement of the high-quality genomes from metagenomic samples.",
