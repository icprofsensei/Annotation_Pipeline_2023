Little consensus exists as to the best, standard methods to collect fecal samples for future microbiome analysis. We evaluated three distinct populations (N = 132 participants) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data to investigate the reproducibility, stability, and accuracy of microbial profiles in fecal samples collected and stored via fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards, fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) tubes, 70% and 95% ethanol, RNAlater, or with no solution. For each collection method, based on relative abundance of select phyla and genera, two alpha diversity metrics, and four beta diversity metrics, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to estimate reproducibility and stability, and Spearman correlation coefficients (SCCs) to estimate accuracy of the fecal microbial profile. Comparing duplicate samples, reproducibility ICCs for all collection methods were excellent (ICCs \u226575%). After 4\u20137 days at ambient temperature, ICCs for microbial profile stability were excellent (\u226575%) for most collection methods, except those collected via no-solution and 70% ethanol. SCCs comparing each collection method to immediately-frozen no-solution samples ranged from fair to excellent for most methods; however, accuracy of genus-level relative abundances differed by collection method. Our findings, taken together with previous studies and feasibility considerations, indicated that FOBT/FTA cards, FIT tubes, 95% ethanol, and RNAlater are excellent choices for fecal sample collection methods in future microbiome studies. Furthermore, establishing standard collection methods across studies is highly desirable.",

While immediately freezing samples at -80\u00b0C is widely viewed as optimal,[5\u20139] for large epidemiologic studies this may be highly infeasible. For example, previous large microbiome studies, such as the American Gut Project,[10, 11] relied on samples collected by participants in the comfort of their home, and as a result, fecal samples spent several hours to days stored in home freezers and/or at room temperature during shipping. Ideally, the sampling method of choice should be one that preserves the microbial profile, especially under suboptimal conditions that are typical of field studies, and furthermore, that can be used for other -omics, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics studies.",

We flagged all replicate samples with an outlier index larger than 1.4 as suspicious outlier candidates. As the threshold was quite lenient some normal samples could also be flagged, so we further investigated flagged samples with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots and genus-level abundance bar plots.

We also calculated ICCs/SCCs for fecal genera with a prevalence in the population >80% and a mean relative abundance >0.2%. For the four beta diversity metrics, to reflect the preservation of the inter-sample relationships, we used a distance-based ICC, for which the within-subject squared distances and between-subject squared distances were used to calculate the biological and technical variance.[15] SCCs were calculated using all pairwise distances. For the relative abundance metrics, ICCs were calculated based on square root transformed relative abundance to reduce the influence of extremely high abundances and to make the data roughly meet the normality assumption under the mixed effects model for ICCs. To address the compositional nature of microbial data, we also calculated relative abundance based on the centered log-ratio transformation.[25]",

As shown by the stability ICCs in Fig 3A (see Table B in S1 File for exact ICCs and 95% CIs and S4 Fig for forest plot of ICCs) stability was excellent for all microbiome metrics in samples collected via FOBT/FTA cards and RNAlater (ICCs \u2265 75%). Samples co1lected via FIT tubes and 95% ethanol generally had excellent stability for alpha diversity and most beta diversity measures; however, stability of phyla and select genera ranged more widely from fair to excellent (ICCs ranging from 0.50\u20130.91 for FIT tubes and 0.67\u20130.89 for 95% ethanol). For no-solution and 70% ethanol samples, the ICCs for all metrics were generally lower than the other collection methods, with fair to good stability for the alpha/beta diversity metrics, but poor stability (all ICCs <0.25) for relative abundance of the four most abundant phyla in 70% ethanol samples and for the Proteobacteria phylum in no-solution samples (ICC = 0). There were similar patterns in stability across collection methods for select genera (Fig 3B; e.g., good to excellent ICCs for FOBT/FTA cards, FIT tubes, 95% ethanol, and RNAlater, and generally poor to fair ICCs for 70% ethanol samples and no-solution samples). As shown in S5 Fig, the ICCs for stability of the centered-log ratio transformed top four phyla and select genera were similar to their square root transformed counterparts. For example, ICCs for no-solution samples and 70% ethanol samples were similarly poor to fair for centered-log ratio transformed abundances.",

We found that for most collection methods, SCCs for concordance with the gold standard were generally good to excellent for alpha and beta diversity estimates (Fig 5A and 5B; see Table D in S1 File for exact SCCs and 95% CIs and S6 Fig for forest plot of SCCs), but that weighted UniFrac SCCs were generally lower (fair to good SCCs). Furthermore, for most collection methods, the relative abundances of dominant phyla were generally poorly to fairly concordant with the gold standard, except for Actinobacteria, which was excellently concordant for all collection methods.

Each collection method has advantages and disadvantages pertaining to the stabilization of DNA, prevention of bacterial growth, and preservation of a microbial profile comparable to the immediately-frozen, no-solution gold standard. As demonstrated by our findings and previous findings, no solution and 70% ethanol are less stable collection methods compared to others when stored at ambient temperature, likely explained by the total lack of (or dilution of in 70% ethanol) DNA-stabilizing and anti-microbial properties. For example, while some studies found microbiome metrics were stable in samples stored in no solution up to three days at ambient temperature,[30, 31] others found alterations in relative abundances of major taxa,[5, 9, 32] lower alpha diversity and lower bacterial counts after 8\u201324 hours[33, 34] or three days,[5] and greater weighted UniFrac, unweighted UniFrac, and Bray-Curtis distances from immediately-frozen samples.[32, 35] Furthermore, we observed a drastic growth of Gammaproteobacteria in no-solution samples after 4/7 days at ambient temperature, which may be concerning in gut health analyses because of the association of Gammaproteobacteria with inflammatory bowel disease.[36] However, as described previously, these taxa tend to grow well at room-temperature and may result from contaminated storage conditions, but importantly can be filtered using Deblur.[36] Fecal samples stored in FIT tubes were previously found to be moderately to excellently well-preserved at ambient temperature and comparable to immediately-frozen, no-solution samples.[37, 38] However, some studies found differences in relative abundances of phyla and genera,[37] lower Shannon diversity with longer storage time at ambient temperature,[38] and compared to the gold standard, lower numbers of observed OTUs and differences in overall composition based on Bray-Curtis distance.[39] Multiple studies found that microbial profiles of fecal samples from FOBT/FTA cards were moderately to excellently stable at ambient temperature over the course of multiple days[7, 39\u201342] and comparable to the gold standard;[43] although, one study found a lower DNA yield among fecal samples from monkeys collected on FTA cards after 8 weeks.[44] Fewer studies investigated the stability/accuracy of human fecal samples stored in 70% and 95% ethanol. A study of tissue samples stored in 95% ethanol and another of gorilla fecal samples stored in 96% ethanol both found a lower DNA yield than fresh samples;[45, 46] whereas, another study of monkey fecal samples found that 100% ethanol preserved bacterial composition and diversity well compared to fresh fecal samples.[38, 44] Previous findings were mixed for RNAlater stability and accuracy.[5, 7, 13, 40, 43, 45, 47\u201350] For example, Flores et al.[51] found that microbial profiles of fecal samples collected in RNAlater were generally stable up to 7 days at ambient temperature prior to freezing; however, other studies found relatively large bacterial community shifts after just 3 days at ambient temperature[50] or lower alpha diversity and DNA purity after 3 days to a week at ambient temperature.[5, 7, 49]",

The variability we observed in the genus-level relative abundances across collection methods indicates that it is optimal for researchers to coordinate the use of at least one collection method commonly used in other studies; however, we also observed that inter-individual differences explained a much higher percentage of microbial variability than collection method. Pooling microbial data from fecal samples collected via different methods could theoretically be acceptable with careful methodological consideration (e.g., when appropriate, ensuring case and control samples are collected via same collection methods, adjusting for collection method in multivariable regression models, etc.); however, the power to detect and interpretation of microbiome-disease associations may be affected since effect sizes of microbiome-disease and microbiome-collection method associations may be similarly moderate. For example, Shah et al. meta-analyzed microbial data from multiple studies to identify microbial markers associated with colorectal cancer and found that samples clustered primarily by their original studies rather than colorectal cancer case/control status due to differences between studies in sample collection and DNA extraction methods/16s rRNA sequencing region, reducing their ability to detect certain microbiome-colorectal cancer associations.[52]",

For example, in this study, the fecal samples in RNAlater were collected in 2.5 mL of solution, which some researchers previously indicated may not be adequate volume for microbial stability and accuracy;[53] however, microbial profiles of RNAlater samples were generally excellently stable and accurate, and compared to larger volumes, 2.5 mL is likely more feasible for both cost and storage requirements in large cohort studies.[54] But better yet, FOBT/FTA cards are widely used for colorectal cancer screening, are easily transportable and storable, and are less than half of the cost of RNAlater. In terms of use for other -omics, RNAlater cannot be used for metabolomics,[55] but can be used metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies as it was previously found to maintain similar metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles to gold standard samples, along with 95% ethanol samples.[12, 47, 49] Both 95% ethanol and FOBT/FTA cards were found to be reproducible, stable, and accurate in metabolomics studies[43, 55]\u2013more so than FIT tubes.[55]",

Second, Mayo 1 and Knight laboratories used different DNA extraction and amplification protocols, which produced variability in microbial metrics; however, we conducted stratified analyses by lab and found no meaningful differences in conclusions for each sample collection method. Third, overall there was large variance between studies, especially for phylum- and genus-level analyses; however, the conclusion for each sampling method remained consistent across study populations.",

As the gut microbiome becomes increasingly recognized for its role in the etiology of gut and systemic health, it is imperative to characterize microbial profiles using the best available methodologies, and to move toward standardization of fecal sample collection across study populations. Future studies should further investigate the long-term stability (over the course of years) of these collection methods, similar to those samples stored in biobanks, and continue to explore the stability, accuracy, and reproducibility of each fecal collection method for other -omics, such as shotgun metagenomics.",
