Given their commitment to antimicrobial mucosal immunity, we investigated mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and V\u03b17.2+CD161- T-cell frequency/function and their possible associations with MT and gut dysbiosis, in chronic HIV and/or HCV infections. We enrolled 56 virally infected (VI) patients (pts): 13 HIV+ on suppressive cART (HIV-RNA < 40cp/ml), 13 HCV+ naive to DAA (direct-acting antiviral) anti-HCV agents; 30 HCV+/HIV+ on suppressive cART and naive to anti-HCV. 13 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. For V\u03b17.2+CD161++ and V\u03b17.2+CD161-CD8+ T cells we assessed: activation (CD69), exhaustion (PD1/CD39), and cytolytic activity (granzymeB/perforin). Following PMA/ionomycin and Escherichia coli stimulation we measured intracellular IL17/TNF\u03b1/IFN\u03b3. Markers of microbial translocation (Plasma LPS, 16S rDNA, EndoCAb and I-FABP) were quantified. In 5 patients per group we assessed stool microbiota composition by 16S targeted metagenomics sequencing (alpha/beta diversity, relative abundance). Compared to controls, virally infected pts displayed significantly lower circulating V\u03b17.2+CD161++CD8+ MAIT cells (p = 0.001), yet expressed higher perforin (p = 0.004) and granzyme B (p = 0.002) on CD8+ MAIT cells. Upon E. coli stimulation, the residual MAIT cells are less functional particularly those from HIV+/HCV+ patients. Conversely, in virally infected pts, V\u03b17.2+CD161-CD8+ cells were comparable in frequency, highly activated/exhausted (CD69+: p = 0.002; PD-1+: p = 0.030) and with cytolytic potential (perforin+: p < 0.0001), yet were poorly responsive to ex vivo stimulation. A profound gut dysbiosis characterized virally infected pts, especially HCV+/HIV+ co-infected patients, delineating a Firmicutes-poor/Bacteroidetes-rich microbiota, with significant associations with MAIT cell frequency/function. Irrespective of mono/dual infection, HIV+ and HCV+ patients display depleted, yet activated/cytolytic MAIT cells with reduced ex vivo function, suggesting an impoverished pool, possibly due to continuous bacterial challenge. The MAIT cell ability to respond to bacterial stimulation correlates with the presence of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, possibly suggesting an association between gut dysbiosis and MAIT cell function and posing viral-mediated dysbiosis as a potential key player in the hampered anti-bacterial MAIT ability.",

Indeed, an impaired interaction between intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system is associated with the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and ankylosing spondylitis (Mazmanian et al., 2008; Hevia et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Costello et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). Similarly, during chronic HCV and HIV infections a marked dysbiosis has been described, which is not reverted by anti-HCV or anti-HIV treatments (Bajaj et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2016), highlighting the need to explore the function of microbiota in such diseases.",

Thus, in a cohort of chronically infected HIV+ and/or HCV+ patients, we aimed to investigate MAIT cells and V\u03b17.2+CD161- T-cell phenotype and function and the associations with microbial translocation and gut dysbiosis.",

Virally infected patients were preferentially men (p = 0.031, Table 1), with a higher proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) and intravenous drug users (IVDU) (p < 0.0001). With regard to HIV-related features, HIV+ and HCV+/HIV+ patients were comparable in terms of CD4 nadir and % of CD4 count at time of analysis, duration of infection and suppressive cART (Table 1). With regard to HCV infection, HCV+/HIV+ patients showed significantly higher levels of circulating HCV-RNA (p = 0.007, Table 1) compared to HCV+, yet similar duration of infection, liver fibrosis, as assessed by ultrasound transient elastography and HCV genotype distribution (Table 1). As expected, HCV+ infected patients (mono-infected and HIV+ co-infected) showed higher serum transaminases compared to both healthy controls and HIV+ individuals (p < 0.0001, Table 1).",

Given that CD8+ MAIT cells represent the majority of circulating MAIT, we decided to focus our attention on this specific subset. We first identified circulating V\u03b17.2+CD161++CD8+ (MAIT) by flow cytometry (gating strategy shown in Figure 1). Compared to healthy individuals, virally infected patients displayed a significantly lower proportion of peripheral MAIT cells (p < 0.0001; Figure 2A), with no differences in IL18R-expressing V\u03b17.2+CD161++CD8+ (p = 0.061; Figure 2B). No differences in PD-1- (p = 0.236; Figure 2C), CD39-expressing V\u03b17.2+CD161++CD8+ (p = 0.774; Figure 2D) and activated CD69+V\u03b17.2+CD161++CD8+ (p = 0.414; Figure 2E) were shown in virally infected subjects when compared to HC. Conversely, virally infected patients displayed significantly higher perforin+ (p = 0.004; Figure 2F) and granzyme B+ MAIT cells (p = 0.002; Figure 2G), with no differences between the three groups of infected patients. Comparable MAIT frequency and phenotypes were shown in patients stratified according to liver fibrosis (F0\u2013F2 vs. F3\u2013F4) (data not shown). Similar data were shown with regard to total CD3+ MAIT cells: virally infected patients were confirmed to display a lower V\u03b17.2+CD161++CD3+ frequency (p = 0.003) with a similar proportion of activated/exhausted MAIT, yet higher cytolytic activity (granzyme B: p = 0.007) versus healthy controls (Supplementary Figures S1a\u2013g). Furthermore, virally infected patients presented lower frequency of CD4/CD8 double negative MAIT (HIV\u2013: 6.14% vs. HIV+: 0.36% vs. HCV+: 0.22% vs. HCV+/HIV+ 1.56%; p < 0.0001), yet higher level of PD-1-expressing (HIV\u2013: 5.53% vs. HIV+: 4.07% vs. HCV+: 5.52% vs. HCV+/HIV+ 42.1%; p = 0.010), Granzyme B-expressing (HIV\u2013: 0.19% vs. HIV+: 15.4% vs. HCV+: 19.3% vs. HCV+/HIV+ 3.7%; p = 0.003) and Perforin-expressing CD4/CD8 double negative MAIT (HIV\u2013: 0.37% vs. HIV+: 1.12% vs. HCV+: 2.3% vs. HCV+/HIV+ 27.8%; p = 0.0027).",

The residual MAIT cells are functionally exhausted and display higher cytolysis markers, possibly indicating continuous antigen exposure. Given that microbial translocation may stimulate innate immune cells via TLR pathways, leading to systemic immune activation (Ussher et al., 2016), we explored the association between activated/exhausted MAIT phenotypes and microbial translocation. Interestingly, while LPS plasma levels negatively correlate with perforin-expressing MAIT cells, supporting the role of endotoxin in hampering MAIT function, EndoCAb levels were positively associated with exhausted/activated (CD39/PD1) and granzyme B-expressing MAIT cells, suggesting the effort of the immune system to fight continuous microbial threat. Some studies suggested that rather than being depleted, MAIT cells have an altered phenotype, namely, the down-regulation of CD161; Leeansyah et al. (2013) suggested that continuous exposure to bacterial products in HIV disease may lead to MAIT cell exhaustion and loss, with concomitant expansion of the CD161neg population originated from the MAIT cells. Similarly, Freeman et al. (2017) showed that in immune failure patients, the reduction in peripheral MAIT cells seems to be due, at least in part, to a loss in CD161 expression, and not merely the result of trafficking into mucosal tissues or cell death. By contrast other studies, argued that V\u03b17.2+CD161-CD8+ are not MAIT cells (Leeansyah et al., 2013; Sandberg et al., 2013; Fergusson et al., 2014), since they do not retain their functions. In our cohort, we describe a V\u03b17.2+CD161-CD8+ T cell phenotype/function divergent from MAIT T cells, with preserved frequency, inefficient cytokine production, and no association with microbial translocation, altogether supporting the idea of a distinct T-cell population. However, given that the MAIT cell loss is a continuous long-term process, we could not exclude that what we described is the result of different and concomitant mechanisms, such as homing to sites of inflammation, exhaustion, and also loss of CD161 expression late in chronic diseases.",

Interestingly, compared to healthy controls, we found that the ex vivo reactivity of MAIT cells to cells cultured together with bacteria is very weak, with HCV+/HIV+ co-infected patients displaying the lowest cytokine production, implying a defect in MAIT antimicrobial functions, possibly due to tolerance driven by continuous microbial translocation. However, the lack of association between MAIT ability to face bacteria challenge and MT markers, seems to suggest that other mechanisms might be involved, such as continuous MAIT engagement, in turn resulting in functional exhaustion, defects in the triggering and/or in signal transduction or deficiency in cytokine production/release.",

In the last few years, both HIV- and HCV-infected patients have been proven to feature a marked dysbiosis, that is not reverted by antiviral treatments (Bajaj et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2016). The homeostasis between microbiota, intestinal epithelium and innate and adaptive immunity favors the predominance of regulatory networks that prevent inflammation or immune-mediated disease (Duerkop et al., 2009; Maynard et al., 2012; Powell and MacDonald, 2017). Recently, some authors have reported a direct link between MAIT cells and gut microbiota. Indeed, MAIT cells have been demonstrated to discriminate and categorize complex human microbiota through computation of TCR signals and to shape their phenotypes and responses according to local environment-driven microbial metabolism (Schmaler et al., 2018; Tastan et al., 2018). Thus, we hypothesized that MAIT disruption might be associated with a decreased frequency of bacteria involved in epithelial barrier health and immune-regulation, and increased abundance of bacteria with known pro-inflammatory potential in the setting of chronic viral infections.",

                    "text": "To test this hypothesis, we first investigated gut microbiota composition, confirming a profound dysbiosis in virally infected patients, mainly in HCV+/HIV+ co-infected individuals, delineating a Firmicutes-poor/Bacteroidetes-rich microbiota. Indeed, the Firmicutes phylum comprises some commensal bacteria with immune regulatory properties, while by contrast the Bacteroidetes phylum includes bacteria with proinflammatory properties (Eckburg et al., 2005). In view of this, our finding of a shift toward lower Firmicutes, such as Clostridia, might support the role of gut dysbiosis in sustaining immune activation as a consequence of regulatory function loss, possibly leading to clinical progression. The factors associated with HIV and/or HCV-driven dysbiosis still remain to be fully elucidated, whether it is elicited by the viruses themselves, or rather it is a consequence of differences in lifestyle (i.e., MSM vs. heterosexual), co-morbidities and the use of chronic therapies. Interestingly, our results seem to closely link gut dysbiosis and MAIT compartment. Indeed, we found a positive association between MAIT frequency and Bacteroides spp., some of which are reported to be inducers of regulatory T-cell function (Troy and Kasper, 2010), leading us to hypothesize a role of certain bacteria in modulating MAIT cells, probably improving the anti-bacterial properties of the immune system. A reduced diversity of the gut microbiota has been associated with immune dysfunction and reduced CD4 T-cell counts (Nowak et al., 2015), our observation of an inverse correlation between exhausted MAIT and alpha diversity suggests an important role of low microbiota diversity in weakening the efficiency of the host immune system.",

Despite the fact that the small number of samples tested might limit the statistical power of the findings, our data altogether seem to suggest a link between gut dysbiosis and inflammation, supporting the hypothesis of a direct effect of altered microbiota composition on immune function, possibly posing viral-mediated dysbiosis as a central player in the hampered anti-bacterial MAIT capability. As intriguing and interesting as it is, we acknowledge that the few samples tested do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn and need to be confirmed in larger cohorts.",

Likewise, microbiota analyses on larger cohorts with extensive evaluation of microbial community function, might have provided broader pathogenic insight. Similarly, the study of bacteria composition, gut damage and MAIT cells directly at mucosal sites, might have shed light onto the causal relationship between mucosal adherent microbiota. Furthermore, given the limited sample size we were forced to merge the patient groups in the correlative analyses. Thus, we could not exclude that by mixing cohorts of patients with markedly different viruses we might have lost some differences. Finally, the availability of CD4 count in HIV non-infected groups might have helped us in explaining some of our finding.",
