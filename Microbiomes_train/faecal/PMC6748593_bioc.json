We hypothesized that dietary content of sulfur-containing amino acids (SAA) leads to variation in the relative abundances of intestinal SRB, which include Desulfovibrio and Bilophila taxa. To test this hypothesis we performed a pilot crossover study in four healthy volunteers, who consumed two interventional diets for 10\u201314\u00a0days, containing high or low SAA content. The total energy intake was similar between the two dietary extremes. Microbial communities were characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun next-generation DNA sequencing. While the relative abundance of Desulfovibrio differed among participants (ANOVA P=\u00a00.001), we could not detect a change with dietary treatments. Similarly, no differences in Bilophila abundance were observed among individuals or dietary arms. Inter-personal differences in microbial community composition and functional gene categories differed between subjects and these differences were maintained over the course of the study. These observations are consistent with re-analysis of two previously published dietary intervention studies. Finally, we found that inter-personal differences in the taxonomic composition of fecal microbiota, including the relative abundances of SRB, were maintained over time in 19 healthy individuals in our stool donor program. These results suggest that the use of dietary interventions alone may be insufficient for rapid therapeutic targeting of SRB. Nevertheless, these pilot data provide a foundation to inform future, statistically powered, studies.",

One mechanistic premise of dietary therapy is its capacity to change the composition and activity of intestinal microbiota. However, the potency and efficiency of dietary interventions, a critical issue in clinical practice, in inducing such changes is unclear. David et al. reported rapid changes in fecal microbial community structure in individuals alternating between diets composed entirely of animal or plant products, which overwhelmed inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression.5 In contrast, in a highly controlled short-term feeding experiment, Wu et al. observed that switching between high-fat/low-fiber and low-fat/high-fiber diets over 10\u00a0days did not overcome individual variation, although some changes in microbiome composition were detectable within 24 h.6 These investigations did not focus their analyses on diet-induced responsiveness of microbial groups competing for hydrogen, which include the SRB, methanogens, and acetogenic bacteria.7",

The baseline measurement of H2S production was 0.003, 0.018, 0.020, and 0.006 mL H2S per gram of dry weight feces, for study participants 01 through 04, respectively. Mean dietary intake for each study interval is presented in Table 1. Total energy intake (kcal) was not significantly different between High-S and Low-S diet interventions. However, intake of carbohydrates, fiber, and vegetable protein were higher in the Low-S intervention as compared to High-S intervention. Intakes of total protein, animal protein, methionine, and cysteine were higher in the High-S intervention as compared to the Low-S intervention.",

In fact, two of the participants (01 and 02) had barely detectable or undetectable levels of Desulfovibrio. There was no correlation between diet and relative abundance of Desulfovibrio in any of the individuals (P\u00a0=\u00a00.677). Similarly, no differences in relative abundances of Bilophila were observed among any of the individuals or dietary arms (P =\u00a00.850). The relative abundances of Desulfovibrio and Bilophila were significantly and positively correlated in this cohort (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.347, P=\u00a00.031).",

Given our hypothesized importance of the relative abundance of SRB in the selection of stool donors for FMT treatment of patients with IBD, we evaluated the distribution of members of the sulfate-reducing genus Desulfovibrio and the sulfite-reducing Bilophila in 19 pre-screened, healthy stool donors who have participated in our FMT donor program. We performed 16S rRNA gene profiling of bacterial communities in 350 fecal samples collected over time from the individual donors (Figure S4). Different numbers of samples per donor reflect differences in the frequency of donation for each donor, and samples were evaluated without respect to time between donations. While Desulfovibrio was not detected in samples from five donors (numbers 3, 6, 13, 47, and 51, with 13, 1, 11, 3, and 18 samples, respectively), Bilophila was almost always present and was undetectable in only Donor 16. The majority of healthy individuals had bacterial communities comprised of only a small (<0.1%) proportion of Desulfovibrio. Five donors had greater proportions of this genus, which was consistently present at \u22650.1% of the community, but never exceeded 1.0%. In contrast, Bilophila comprised, on average, \u22640.2% of communities. Moreover, abundances of Desulfovibrio and Bilophila were weakly negatively correlated with each other (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.213, P <\u00a00.0001). Ordination by PCoA revealed independent clustering of communities by an individual (Figure S5), and ANOSIM revealed significant differences in community compositions among all individuals (r\u00a0=\u00a00.978, P <\u00a00.001).",

In contrast, the abundances of Bilophila differed significantly among individuals and dietary treatment arms (P <\u00a00.0001) and were present at significantly greater abundances in samples collected while on the animal-based diet (P <\u00a00.0001). The abundances of Desulfovibrio and Bilophila were weakly negatively correlated in this cohort (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a0-0.307, P <\u00a00.0001), in contrast to data obtained from our intervention cohort.",

David and colleagues also observed significantly greater abundances of several OTUs within the genus Bacteroides in samples obtained during the plant-based diet, relative to that seen during the animal-based diet in the study5. However, similar to what was found our dietary intervention, few significant differences in alpha diversity were observed among dietary arms (i.e., baseline, diet, or washout; Table S1). Despite this, the Shannon indices were lower when on an animal-based diet (4.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09), relative to that seen at baseline or washout from either diet (means 4.27\u20134.30; post-hoc P \u2264\u00a00.019). More importantly, no significant differences (r\u00a0=\u00a00.015, P =\u00a00.272) in community composition related to diet were observed among all samples, and microbial communities from the same individuals did not differ between the animal- and plant-based dietary arms (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.029 to 0.244, P \u2265\u00a00.001; Bonferroni-corrected \u03b1\u00a0<\u00a00.001), except in one case (r\u00a0=\u00a00.277, P <\u00a00.001).",

The dominant SRB in the human colon is thought to be members of the genus Desulfovibrio, in the \u03b4 subdivision of the class Proteobacteria. However, we found no changes in relative abundances of Desulfovibrio with our dietary interventions, which tested reasonable extremes of sulfur intake. Similarly, we saw no impact on the relative abundances of Desulfovibrio on our re-analysis of data from the David, et al. study of microbiome responses to animal- versus plant-based dietary extremes.5 Similar to the prior study by David, et al., we noted an increased relative abundance of Bilophila in the animal-based diet, but these short-term dietary changes did not lead to major changes in the overall fecal microbial community structure. Rather, bacterial community compositions remained distinct among individuals by taxonomic and gene content analysis. These results are consistent with the conclusions reached by Wu and colleagues in the CAFE study.6",

Changes in the abundance of Desulfovibrio between high- and low-S diets among all participants had a moderate effect size of 0.40, while the effect size for Bilophila was smaller (0.14). As a result, a sample size of 49 individuals was calculated to provide statistical power (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.80, \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05) to detect significant differences in Desulfovibrio abundances, while n =\u00a0374 is necessary for powered analysis of changes in Bilophila abundances.",

Similar to many studies, we did see some OTUs that segregated by High-S and Low-S dietary interventions. However, the biological significance of these changes in our study is unclear due to an underpowered sample size. All such findings require confirmation in much larger validation cohorts. It is also likely that functional activity of microbial communities, which may be measured by transcriptomics and metabolomics, is more likely to reflect short-term dietary changes than strictly taxonomic analyses, which provided insufficient sequence depth to characterize most genes likely involved in sulfate reduction pathways.",

We did observe differences in baseline SRB relative abundances among healthy stool donors in our program; however, extrapolation of these data to FMT outcomes will require further investigations. The responsiveness of the relative abundances of SRB was the main focus of the study. While we could not detect an effect of dietary extremes on the abundance of SRB or the individuality of microbiomes in participants, fluctuation among different taxa was noted in the course of the study and samples during the wash-out were not identical to baseline. It is possible that other taxa or functional microbial groups are more responsive to changes coincident with sulfur content extremes, such as fiber content or the sulfur compounds present, but could not be identified given the small size of the study.",

We did observe considerable heterogeneity among healthy individuals with respect to the relative abundances of SRB examined. Future, large cohort studies will be necessary to more accurately characterize shifts in these low-abundance members of the community in response to dietary changes. Moreover, it may be that other SRB are involved in intestinal sulfur metabolism that needs to be defined by multi-omics and newer culture-based studies.",
