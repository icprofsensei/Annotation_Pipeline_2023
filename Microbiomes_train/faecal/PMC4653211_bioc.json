Many factors likely contribute to these issues including small cohort sizes, sample collection, and handling and processing differences. The field of microbiome research is moving from 16S rDNA gene sequencing to a more comprehensive genomic and functional representation through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of complete communities. Here we performed quantitative and qualitative analyses comparing WGS metagenomic data from human stool specimens using the Illumina Nextera XT and Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free kits, and the KAPA Biosystems Hyper Prep PCR and PCR-free systems. Significant differences in taxonomy are observed among the four different next-generation sequencing library preparations using a DNA mock community and a cell control of known concentration. We also revealed biases in error profiles, duplication rates, and loss of reads representing organisms that have a high %G+C content that can significantly impact results. As with all methods, the use of benchmarking controls has revealed critical differences among methods that impact sequencing results and later would impact study interpretation. We recommend that the community adopt PCR-free\u2013based approaches to reduce PCR bias that affects calculations of abundance and to improve assemblies for accurate taxonomic assignment. Furthermore, the inclusion of a known-input cell spike-in control provides accurate quantitation of organisms in clinical samples.",

Since the publication of the first human microbiome study in 2006 (1), there has been an explosion of human microbiome studies for both healthy and disease conditions; the great majority of these studies now routinely use NGS technologies. Several recent articles have raised alarm about a lack of data robustness and reproducibility among published 16S rDNA and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) metagenomic studies between sequencing runs and laboratory cores (2\u20135). Finucane et al. (6), for example, compared several obesity microbiome publications and suggested that no simple taxonomic signature could be found and that several groups did not agree about the microbiome association with body mass index. A similar picture evolves in the analysis of microbiome samples of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, for which conflicting microbial signatures exist (7). In addition, experimental variation remains a significant hurdle in many published studies. For example, researchers recently published evidence of variation in 16S rDNA gene profiling from microbiome specimens processed using several nucleic acid extraction protocols (8, 9). Franzosa et al. (10, 11) further revealed the impact of sample collection on the stability of the metagenome and metatranscriptome of stool specimens.",

To maintain unbiased comparison among different libraries, postsequencing quality analysis and annotation were based on equivalent numbers of raw reads. For taxonomy profiling, 4.85 million paired-end reads (minimal yield among the samples) were used for all the samples. For assembly, ORF prediction, and functional annotation, where additional depth was desired, 11 million paired-end raw reads were used for the analysis (Dataset S1, Table S1). Two stool sample libraries generated by TSF did not reach sufficient coverage. The two technical replicates for these two samples were pooled together to achieve 11 million raw reads. XT libraries generated an average of 28% low-quality reads, a duplication rate of 1.38%, and a contig N50 length of 10,727 bp. Sequence data generated from KP libraries had an average of 6.41% low-quality reads, a duplication rate of 1.29%, and a contig N50 length of 30,814 bp. Libraries generated using the KF approach resulted in sequence data with an average of 15.39% low-quality reads, a duplication rate of 0.07%, and an N50 of 32,864 bp. Last, sequence data produced from TSF libraries resulted in an average of 15.41% low-quality reads, a duplication rate of 0.04%, and an N50 of 45,707 bp (Dataset S1, Table S1). In summary, the TSF libraries produced the longest contigs; KP produced the largest total contig length; and XT libraries resulted in significantly shorter individual contig length and total contig length (Fig. S1 and Dataset S1, Table S1).",

Hierarchical clustering of the four libraries based on the relative genome abundance (RGA) profiles of the constituent microbes revealed two major groups: XT and KF in one group and KP and TSF in the other (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, cluster analysis indicates that KF matches more closely with XT than with TSF, pairing a PCR-free sample more closely to a PCR-amplified sample than to another PCR-free sample and suggesting that the low-cycle PCR amplification step did not result in any bias. Cluster analysis also illustrated closer grouping between platforms rather than within platforms, as demonstrated closer clustering between XT and KF and between KP and TSF, rather than between XT and TSF or between KF and KP, indicating that library chemistry does not equate with clustering similarity. Using one-way ANOVA analysis to compare the relative abundance measurements of the members of the mock community across the four mock-community libraries revealed significant variation based on library preparation (Dataset S1, Table S3). Among the largest variations were the relative abundances of Helicobacter pylori, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with SDs from 1.16\u20131.61% or \u223c4,000\u20136,000 reads.

Because predicted ORFs tend to be more fragmented, multiple predicted ORFs may be aligned to a single true ORF. Overall, around 96% of true ORFs were recovered by 95% of predicted ORFs for the 20 strains in the mock community across four libraries; XT showed slightly but notably worse performance than the other libraries. XT data also resulted in more fragmented ORFs than did KP, KF, and TSF. Most of the 20 individual strains demonstrate a pattern very similar to the combined data from the 20 strains. Among the 20 mock genomes, Clostridium beijerinckii exhibited more significant differences between XT and other libraries: XT resulted in approximately fivefold more unmapped ORFs (840 vs. \u223c140), approximately threefold more missing genes (237 vs. \u223c60), and a 20% higher fragmentation ratio (1.23% vs. 1.03%) than the other libraries. This analysis agrees with our observations regarding the assembly status and genome coverage. We did not identify significant differences in functional annotation between KP, KF, and TSF in all 20 mock genomes.

Using the mock community, we analyzed the relative measurements of species abundance for each library protocol with respect to %G+C. Consistent with the cluster analysis of the mock community, XT and KF have a similar pattern of higher representation of organisms with a low %G+C and a corresponding lower representation of organisms with a high %G+C, as marked by yellow and red boxes, respectively, in Fig. S5. To examine the possible relationship between read coverage and genome %G+C by method, we calculated both the %G+C of the bin and the mean read-depth coverage (from nonoverlapping 10-kbp windows across the genome) (Fig. 2B). Coverage patterns are very comparable across methods, with equivalent region-specific depth spikes and valleys. Examination of sequences underlying the most extreme spikes per genome revealed repetitive genomic elements. This analysis is consistent with recent observations that the annotated 16S rRNA gene copy number of many organisms is incorrect (16). Of note, the Rhodobacter sphaeroides coverage plots show large stretches of increased coverage at the end of the circle plots (Fig. 2A). These regions correspond to the boundaries and regions of plasmids found in this organism, suggesting that these plasmids are multicopy. Similar evaluations were made for Escherichia coli and C. beijerinckii (Figs. S6 and S7). To examine read depth coverage biases, we simulated the sequencing of each genome to an average read depth ranging from 0.1\u201320 and calculated the expected proportion of the genome expected to have at least one read when sequenced at that depth. Although the specific effect seems to vary slightly from genome to genome, there is a general trend for TSF, KP, and KF preparation methods to behave nearly identically, whereas XT requires a deeper average sequencing depth to capture an equivalent fraction of the genome with reads.",

Three genes unique to each of the 20 members of the mock community were identified and used to develop organism-specific qPCR assays (Dataset S1, Table S12). Genomic DNAs were used to optimize reaction conditions and to establish a standard curve for quantitation of strain-specific DNA concentrations within the mock-community DNA and to serve as a positive control. When possible we used at least two independent qPCR measurements and corresponding primer-specific standard curves to determine percent composition for each organism in the mock community. The percent delta between RGA from the sequencing data generated from the four library preparations and the average qPCR quantification measurements demonstrates the impact of library strategy and sequencing on the accurate representation of individual mock-community organisms (Table 1). We observed over- and underrepresentation of strain DNAs, with a deviation of 2.0% or more or of \u22122.0% or less, compared with qPCR measurements, for mock-community organisms in all the library strategies tested based on RGA (10/20 XT; 12/20 KF; 7/20 KP; and 7/20 TSF). To determine if the bias should be attributed to library preparation or downstream clustering/sequencing, qPCR was performed on the XT and KP library preparations using strain-specific primers for representative organisms in the mock community. Direct comparison of qPCR measurements of the mock-community DNA and the XT library revealed an underrepresentation of \u22651.9% in two (D. radiodurans and R. sphaeroides) of the three organisms with high (\u226560%) G+C content, and in the KP library R. sphaeroides and Propionibacterium\nacnes were underrepresented by \u223c4% (Table 2). To determine which library protocol had the greatest similarity to the starting DNA composition of the mock community, we computed a Pearson correlation matrix between samples (Dataset S1, Table S13). We observed that the qPCR measurements of the mock-community DNA were more similar to the generated libraries than to the resulting sequencing data. Specifically, the mock-community DNA had greater similarity with the XT library (0.58) than did the KP library (0.20).",

Data revealed that S. oneidensis represented 2.21\u20133.14% of the total extracted DNA in samples as determined by the equation: number of copies = [amount of DNA (in nanograms) * 6.022 \u00d7 1023] / [length (in base pairs) * 1 \u00d7 109 * 650] (Table 3). qPCR analysis indicates that S. oneidensis DNA is present at \u223c5 \u00d7 103 GU per nanogram of total extracted spiked specimen DNA. The percentage of reads uniquely mapped to S. oneidensis from the total mapped reads strongly agreed with the calculated percent RGA. We calculated the number of mapped reads that correlate to one GU for a 4.9-Mb genome, based on calculated GU, total mapped reads, unique reads mapped to S. oneidensis, and the amount of library loaded for clustering. We estimate that 33\u201340 125-bp reads represent one S. oneidensis GU as determined by the equation: reads to GU = [(number of S. oneidensis mapped reads per GU) * percent of sequenced library]. We propose, based on these calculations and calibration standards, an estimation of approximately eight 125-nt mapped reads per genome size (in million base pairs) per 10 \u00d7 106 reads, which equates to 1 GU.",

Eight years since the beginning of the HMP, and despite efforts by many investigators to set standards for many aspects of microbiome research, great variability in approach, methodology, results, and interpretation are routinely reported. These inconsistencies have resulted in significant misinterpretation of data and confusion in the field. DNA sequence generation is fundamental to all metagenome projects; however, although there has been benchmarking for 16S rDNA sequencing, there has been no benchmarking of NGS platforms or library preparation methods for metagenomic sequencing using established controls. Here we quantified the biases associated with four available library preparation methods for the Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Version 4 reagents) platform using a publicly available synthetic DNA mock community (BEI Resources HM-276D) and a DNA extraction spike-in control of S. oneidensis cells. The Illumina HiSeq platform was selected because the technology is estimated to account for the majority of all microbiome WGS studies that currently are under way. We also performed a qualitative comparison of a WGS metagenomic analysis of stool specimens using several library methods. Two of the methods were PCR-free: TruSeq DNA PCR-Free (TSF) and Kapa PCR Free (KF), and two include PCR amplification steps: Nextera XT (XT) and Kapa PCR (KP). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was also used to validate the mock-community and library preparations.",

Both PCR-free methods generated very long contig N50s (150\u2013178 kb) for the mock-community DNA, low duplication rates, and low numbers of low-quality reads. The PCR-based systems had much higher duplication and error rates, but the KF libraries also had a high contig N50 (\u223c142 kb) for the mock-community DNA. The XT libraries had the poorest performance, with 28% low-quality reads, 1.4% duplication rate, and a contig N50 of 35 kb for the mock-community DNA. Comparison of contig N50s for the clinical specimens showed that the TSF had the longest average contig N50s: 12.9 kb compared with 4.2 kb for XT, 3.5 kb for KF, and 2.9 kb for KP. RGA calculations of the mock-community control demonstrated an average RGA SD of <1% across all library preparations in 16 of 20 (80%) of mock-community organisms (Table 1). Direct comparison of RGA data with the qPCR measurements of the input mock-community DNA did demonstrate over- and underrepresentation of strain DNAs with a deviation of 2.0% or more or 2.0% or less compared with qPCR measurements for mock-community organisms in all the library strategies tested based on RGA (10/20 for XT; 12/20 for KF; 7/20 for KP; 7/20 for TSF). Direct comparison by qPCR of the XT and KP mock-community libraries with the pure mock-community DNA demonstrates that the XT library has greater similarity to the original starting sample than the KP library (Dataset S1, Table S13). The level of quantitative variability of RGA compared with qPCR measurements is extremely interesting and alarming. Numerous publications report a change in abundance of \u223c0.1% as significant. Although statistically significant based on study design, the biological significance/relevance of a reported \u223c0.1% change in abundance in microbiome studies may be questioned. Our observations and other reports indicate that multiple factors can influence sequencing accuracy and quantitation and also account for chemistry-to-chemistry variability using the same template DNA molecule. Previous reports have demonstrated the introduction of significant bias based on genome amplification enzymes (17). Furthermore, the level of genome fragmentation can bias flowcell clustering efficiency, with smaller DNA fragments clustering more efficiently than longer fragments. This difference in clustering efficiency may explain the RGA deviation between XT tagmentation- and Covaris fragmentation-based libraries. Furthermore, the variability in the efficiency of platform-specific polymerase enzymes and in enzymatic performance in DNA with high %G+C content is well known. Given the multiple influential variables (i.e., DNA fragmentation, library amplification, and size selection, among others), we strongly suggest the inclusion of a calibration control for microbiome studies.",

Our analysis revealed a strong correlation between the percent of S. oneidensis DNA in the total extracted stool sample (2.21%, 2.45%, and 3.14% in technical replicates) and the corresponding RGA (3%, 2.8%, and 1.7%). We are able to estimate the number of raw mapped reads equating to a GU. The calculated number of S. oneidensis GUs in the DNA mixture is \u223c5 \u00d7 103. S. oneidensis DNA represents \u223c2\u20133% of the total extracted DNA, based on qPCR measurements. Using the same ratio of S. oneidensis DNA to total extracted DNA, we calculate that in stool DNA [assuming an average genome size of 1.5\u20134 Mb (18, 19)] there are \u223c2.32 \u00d7 105 to 6.18 \u00d7 105 GU per nanogram of DNA. We calculate a range of 41\u201371 (average \u223c43) 125-nt reads equate to one GU, based on the total number of reads and number of mapped reads. Assuming average genome sizes of 1.5, 3.9 Mb, 4.9 Mb, and 5.5 Mb, we estimate that 19, 50, 62 and 73 125-nt reads correlate to one GU, respectively. With these calculations we can begin to estimate the actual number of GUs per nanogram of DNA per milligram of specimen and establish an individual\u2019s personalized microbiome baseline per organism. Our analysis indicates that both PCR and PCR-free based systems can introduce bias into the downstream analysis. PCR-free systems offer the ability to increase contig length without the potential bias that PCR-based systems may introduce. The KF systems appear to be the best solution for specimens in which \u223c500 ng of high-quality DNA is available for library preparation. For metagenomic samples, a PCR-free system potentially would give the user the ability to measure considerably more potential GUs [\u223c1.68 \u00d7 108 GUs; GU number of copies = (1,000 ng * 6.022 \u00d7 1023)/(5.5 Mb * 1 \u00d7 109 * 650)].",

We also have identified methods that can provide high contig N50s that may better predict single genome assemblies within metagenomic samples. As with all methods, the use of benchmarking controls has revealed critical differences between methods that impact sequencing results and later would impact study interpretation. Standardization to one system is not feasible, because technology continues to advance, amounts and availability of microbiome samples are highly variable, and scientific budgets are constrained. We propose standardization based on sample type and material abundance and the inclusion of a cell spike-in for DNA extraction controls. In the majority of cases, stool specimens provide sufficient material (i.e., \u223c250\u2013500 ng of DNA or more) to use in a PCR-free system. We propose that the community use PCR-free\u2013based approaches (such as Kapa Hyper Prep PCR-free and TruSeq DNA PCR-free) to reduce PCR bias in calculations of abundance and to improve assemblies for accurate taxonomic assignment. Furthermore, the inclusion of a cell spike-in control will permit a more accurate quantitation of organisms based on a known input value. In the case of precious, low-abundance material, we propose the use of a low-cycle (three to five cycles) PCR-based approach in parallel with the cell spike-in control. These findings suggest that, until standardized platforms and practices are adopted, the microbiome community will be at risk of over-interpreting datasets, generating conflicting results, and hindering progress in the field.",

Individual pure genomic DNAs that were component members of the mock community were used to create a standard curve to quantify the strain-specific makeup of the mock community and to establish a melting-curve profile. All qPCR reactions using purified or mock-community DNAs were interrogated by melting-curve analysis for amplification artifacts. Purified S. oneidensis genomic DNA also was used to quantify the composition of S. oneidensis in spiked specimens. Organism-specific, specimen, and mock-community genomic DNAs were diluted to 2 ng/\u00b5L and then were serially diluted to 0.02 pg/\u03bcl.
