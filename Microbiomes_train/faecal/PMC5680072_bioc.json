We examined the influence of C4B gene number on intestinal microbiota and in\u2010vitro serum complement activation by intestinal microbes in PIBD patients. Complement C4A and C4B gene numbers were determined by genomic reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) from 64 patients with PIBD (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis). The severity of the disease course was determined from faecal calprotectin levels. Intestinal microbiota was assessed using the HITChip microarray. Complement reactivity in patients was analysed by incubating their sera with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Akkermansia muciniphila and determining the levels of C3a and soluble terminal complement complex (SC5b\u20109) using enzyme immunoassays. The microbiota diversity was wider in patients with no C4B genes than in those with one or two C4B genes, irrespective of intestinal inflammation. C4B and total C4 gene numbers correlated positively with soluble terminal complement complex (TCC, SC5b\u20109) levels when patient serum samples were stimulated with bacteria. Our results suggest that the C4B gene number associates positively with inflammation in patients with PIBD. Multiple copies of the C4B gene may thus aggravate the IBD\u2010associated dysbiosis through escalated complement reactivity towards the microbiota.",

The symptoms of these chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract include severe abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. The diseases are multi\u2010factorial and are associated with genetic predisposition, environmental factors, changes in the intestinal microbiota and their interactions with the surroundings 1. Genomewide association studies have identified common variants in more than 160 genes that contribute to the genetic susceptibility to IBD 2. Many of the contributing genes code for proteins involved in innate immune responses, which are initiated by the complement system 3, 4. Disease aetiology is therefore thought to involve perturbed host\u2013microbiota interactions, due either to abnormal reactions to the normal microbiota or aberrant microbiota development eliciting inflammatory host responses 5.",

Complement C4 is an important component of the classical and lectin pathways, which are involved in tissue clearance and microbial elimination. C4 genes locate in the centre of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region (6p 21.3). There are two different C4 genes (C4A and C4B) that vary in number between individuals. In most cases an individual has two C4A and two C4B genes, four in total 6. C4B participates in the host defence against intestinal microbes, and C4B deficiencies have been associated with susceptibility to infections caused by, e.g. encapsulated bacteria 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. C4A deficiencies have been associated mainly with susceptibility to inflammatory 12 and autoimmune diseases 13, 14. We recently discovered a novel association between the MHC\u2010haplotype (HLA\u2010A*03; HLA\u2010B*07; 1 C4A gene; 1 C4B gene; HLA\u2010DRB1*15) and paediatric IBD (PIBD). We also found that PIBD patients deficient in C4B (fewer than two C4B genes) recovered poorly after surgery 15.",

Reduced levels of butyrate producers and Akkermansia muciniphila have been detected in patients with IBD (mainly ulcerative colitis) 19, 20. A. muciniphila is a bacterium specialized to mucin degradation and a key organism at the mucosal interface between the lumen and host cells 21. Both butyrate producers and A. muciniphila are considered important for healthy gut barrier function and have anti\u2010inflammatory effects. An altered balance of beneficial and aggressive bacteria within gut microbiota is often connected to damage of the intestinal barrier (\u2018leaky gut\u2019) 22. Increased amounts of aerobic Gram\u2010negative bacteria, which produce highly inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have often been found in IBD patients. One of these is Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Y. pseudotuberculosis), a food\u2010borne Gram\u2010negative pathogen related to gut commensals, but can be aggressive and cause intestinal gastroenteritis in humans 23. In the present study we used these two bacteria, A. muciniphila and Y. pseudotuberculosis, as examples to stimulate complement activation in patient sera and studied the influence of C4 gene number (indicating the number of C4A or/and C4B genes) and protein amount on the complement activation capacity. In addition, the influence of C4 gene numbers on intestinal microbiota and inflammation was assessed in PIBD patients. Addressing the gene copy number variation, and particularly that occurring in the MHC region, is important and needs to be performed separately, because it is not usually analysed in genome\u2010wide association studies.",

The physicians' global assessment was assessed at the same time that faecal and serum samples were collected, as described previously 24. At this point the patients were all in good disease control (classes 1 and 2). Levels of inflammation at the time of faecal sample collection were assessed by measuring faecal calprotectin levels using a quantitative enzyme immunoassay (PhiCal Test; Calpro AS, Oslo, Norway). A calprotectin result of <\u00a0100 \u03bcg/g in stools was considered normal, whereas results of >\u00a01000 \u03bcg/g were considered to be exceedingly high 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.",

Briefly, the index was an average of the correlations between the microbiota of a patient and with subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a026) with healthy intestine, determined by low calprotectin levels 18. Composition of the intestinal microbiota was analysed with a phylogenetic microarray, the HITChip 31, consisting of oligonucleotide probes, the intensities of which were summarized using the Robust Probabilistic Averaging (RPA) for probe\u2010level analysis method 32 as 1038 species\u2010level bacterial phylotypes.

Y. pseudotuberculosis (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107) and A. muciniphila (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107) were mixed first with 60 \u03bcl of PBS with 20 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (complement\u2010inhibited) or PBS only (complement activation permitted), and thereafter with 60 \u03bcl of PIBD patient serum. In addition, to boost complement activation by the classical pathway, we added serum from a Y. pseudotuberculosis\u2010infected patient that contains antibodies against Y. pseudotuberculosis together with Y. pseudotuberculosis bacteria to induce activation of complement system. Fifty \u03bcl of Y. pseudotuberculosis (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107) in PBS was mixed with 10 \u03bcl of serum from the Y. pseudotuberculosis\u2010infected patient and 60 \u03bcl of PIBD patient serum. To establish the background levels of complement activation products in the patient sera, samples were mixed (1\u00a0:\u00a01) with 20 mM EDTA in PBS and stored at \u221270\u00b0C. To activate complement the patient sera were incubated for 20 min at +37\u00b0C with shaking at 500 rpm. The reaction was stopped by transferring the tubes into ice and adding EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mM. Bacterial cells were separated from sera by centrifugation at 5900\u00a0g for 3 min and the sera were stored at \u221270\u00b0C for subsequent C3a and soluble terminal complement complex (SC5b\u20109) analysis.",

The more C4B genes are expressed, the stronger is the complement activation response at the terminal pathway (TCC) and the more aberrant is the microbiota composition in PIBD patients. This finding indicates that while C4 is needed for complement\u2010mediated clearance of microbes and cell debris, the activity of C4, and particularly of C4B, can be related to complement over\u2010reactivity under pathological inflammatory conditions, such as IBD, leading to tissue injury. The potential mechanisms for the link between complement C4 and inflammatory bowel disease include microbe\u2010mediated complement activation, complement\u2010activation response to injury and disturbed regulation of complement activation. C4B is known to have a role in binding to hydroxyl groups of foreign carbohydrate antigens and in the activation of the classical and lectin C pathways, leading to the formation of the membrane attack complex 40. Thus, an excessive response, especially to microbial lipopolysaccharides carrying hydroxyl groups, could lead to inflammation. Similarly, injured tissue structures could activate complement and lead to increased contacts of microbes with the complement system. The responses would be excessive, particularly if the ability to control complement activation at the local sites is compromised. The reason for increased complement activation response is due probably to a quantity effect: more C4B leads to more activation. This may, however, not be the whole truth. Another possibility could be that, in the absence of C4B genes, the activation is diverted towards a less inflammatory pathway against bacteria via the C4A\u2010protein. This is suggested by the fact that the number of C4A genes was not related to the examined inflammation parameters.",

The observed association between genotype, host response and microbiota composition is in line with the paradigm of microbiota\u2010dependent genetically determined inflammation in IBD 17.

C4 deficiency can lead to insufficient complement activation and impaired removal of not only microbes, but also of other unwanted material, including apoptotic cells and extracellular debris from the body.

Limited correlation between C3a and TCC levels may thus be due possibly to spontaneous C3a formation via alternative pathway amplification in the serum 42. The benefit of TCC is that it also indicates C5 activation, which is otherwise difficult to measure directly in patient samples. C5a is a more potent mediator of inflammation than C3a. C4 gene products are involved in the classical and lectin pathways, but not in the alternative pathway activation 6. This could explain why we did not see differences in C3a levels between groups of patients with different C4 gene numbers. 6 The alternative pathway is important in protection against microbes, but it also acts as an amplifying cascade for the classical and lectin pathways. In this study we did not distinguish whether complement became activated via the classical or the lectin pathway. Antibodies are needed for the specific recognition of microbes and activation of the classical pathway. Also, both the classical and the lectin pathways contribute significantly to the direct recognition of microbes via their sensor molecules C1q and the ficolins, and to a certain extent by mannose\u2010binding lectin (MBL) (especially for yeast).

A high C3a level could have been generated via the alternative pathway that does not include C4. Low C4B and low total C4 gene numbers and high diversity in microbiota associated with lower levels of terminal pathway complement activation after bacterial stimulation. This may indicate two issues. First, complement C4 is needed for efficient complement activation up to the terminal stages.

In a larger context, this information could be utilized to provide better and individually tailored treatment for paediatric patients. The data confirm the genetic heterogeneity of the patients and suggest that the presence of complement components could have a role in determining the inflammatory status and diversity of microbiota in the IBD patients. Also, genetically determined complement activation status may play a role in therapeutic responses. The level of plasma complement activation via the classical pathway was reduced after treatment of Crohn's disease patients with infliximab 43. A potential link between C4 and TNF genes exists, because they are both located in the MHC class III region 44. In future, analyses of the role of complement in IBD subtypes and studies with larger study populations could provide further important information for the development of complement\u2010modulating therapy for these patients.",

                    "text": "Overall, the results suggest that C4B, but not C4A, is involved in the aberrant inflammatory response of the host towards the microbiota in PIBD. C4A is thought to be more important in immune clearance 46, while C4B is used more specifically in defence against microbes 40. The biochemical background for this is the stronger reactivity of C4A towards amino groups in proteins and of C4B towards hydroxyl groups prevalent, for example, in carbohydrates such as microbial capsules and lipopolysaccharides 47. Reduced complement attack against bacteria, as seen in C4B\u2010deficient patients, appears to dampen the inflammatory response of the host towards the microbiota and to allow a wider diversity of microbiota composition. The observation of a \u2018normal\u2010appearing\u2019 microbiota in C4B\u2010deficient IBD patients suggests that the disease aetiology is related to aberrant host responses to normal microbiota driving the microbiota into a dysbiotic, inflammation\u2010tolerant state, rather than the other way around. We have shown previously that the clinical outcome of anti\u2010TNF\u2010\u03b1 therapy is dependent upon the microbiota composition: patients with normal\u2010appearing microbiota are likely to respond to the treatment 15. Together, these results suggest that the C4B genotype, which is associated with microbiota composition, may associate with anti\u2010TNF\u2010\u03b1 responses.",
