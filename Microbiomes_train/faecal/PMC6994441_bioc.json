This may be particularly important for older adults who may require higher-protein diets to preserve muscle mass or for restoration in times of recovery from unintentional weight loss, illness, or injury (2). Increased intakes of protein from animal-based foods, devoid of naturally occurring fiber, may displace plant-based foods containing fiber, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and thus may further support the need for fiber fortification. However, fiber ingredients, such as fructans (e.g., fructo-oligosaccharides and inulin), commonly added to foods in North America have been shown to contribute to gastrointestinal complaints including flatulence, bloating, and abdominal pain (3, 4), symptoms that may negatively impact quality of life in older adults. In addition, there is some evidence that higher intakes of fructans may suppress appetite and decrease body weight (5, 6). As appetite suppression and its possible effects on food intake and body weight may be contraindicated in older adults at nutritional risk, exploration of the physiological effects of alternative fibers for the purpose of fortification is needed.",

Prebiotics such as fructans, given their specific carbohydrate structure, require unique enzymes for hydrolysis and thus, by definition, have specific effects on the gut microbiota or its activity (7). Although these effects, such as the enhancement of Bifidobacterium, are considered positive, isolated fructans have not been shown to impact diversity of the microbiota (8). This is an important consideration, as microbiota diversity is associated with stability\u2014protection from disruption by dietary changes (9) and other stressors (10). As decreased diversity is associated with the onset of frailty (11) and increased risk of Clostridium difficile diarrhea (12), a potentially fatal disease more common in older adults (13), maintaining microbiota diversity is particularly important for older adults. Diets high in complex plant fibers such as whole grains are associated with higher microbial diversity (14, 15). Added fibers such as brans, containing a variety of indigestible polysaccharides, also may support microbial diversity (16). It is not known if hull fibers (pulse seed coats) have the potential for such effects. Of note, the nondigestible polysaccharides contained in the complex dietary fiber fractions of brans and hulls may be more slowly fermented than purified, soluble, and highly fermentable oligosaccharides and, thus, may produce less noticeable bloating and flatulence and, perhaps, improved acceptance and feasibility while still inducing beneficial shifts in the microbiota.",

Given its complex dietary fiber constituents (i.e., cellulose, pectin, and hemicelluloses), it potentially may enhance gut microbial diversity and profile. As slow transit, suggestive of constipation, negatively impacts the gut microbiota and its metabolism (19), the potential of PHF to modulate stool form, a proxy for transit time, and stool frequency is also of interest. In addition, given that some older adults may be at risk of weight loss and malnutrition, the impact of PHF fortification on appetite requires exploration. The aims of the study were to determine the effects of daily consumption of snacks fortified with PHF on stool form, stool frequency, gastrointestinal symptoms, and appetite in community-dwelling older adults. As appetite may be impacted by the sensory acceptability of the food vehicle used for fiber fortification, sensory evaluation of the study snacks was carried out prior to the trial.

The study snacks provided \u223c200\u00a0kcal/d, but the intake of the snacks did not result in differences in energy intake during the intervention periods, suggesting participants substituted instead of adding study foods to their usual diet. Appetite as assessed by SNAQ category (23) did not change during the PHF intervention, suggesting no increased risk of unintended future weight loss in this older cohort; and the daily reporting of appetite was similarly unaffected. In most previous studies, consuming PHF-fortified foods did not affect appetite, food intake, or body weight (18, 32\u201334). In contrast, a study in overweight/obese adults (aged 44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015 y) showed weight loss with the consumption of 15\u00a0g/d of PHF in the form of wafers over 12 wk and decreased food intake in a single-meal study (35). However, appetite and sensory acceptance were not reported and, thus, it is possible that the wafers were somewhat unappetizing and, as such, food intake may have been negatively impacted independent of any metabolic effect resulting from any PHF fermentation. It may also be possible that age confounds appetite response to foods with added fiber. As SNAQ is validated to predict the future risk of weight loss (23) and poor outcomes in older adults (36), this tool may be useful to assess the appropriateness of added fibers for supplementation of foods intended for older adults. PHF did not suppress appetite; thus, it may be an appropriate fiber for fortification of foods for older adults at risk of unintended weight loss.",

Stool form was used as a proxy for transit time, and participants reported primarily normal transit stools at baseline, which remained unchanged with PHF. Participants reported the proportion of slow transit stools at 11%, somewhat higher than a representative sample of the US population considered to have normal bowel habits at 6% slow transit (37), but lower than we have previously reported in younger women (38). The PHF used in this study was finely processed (200 mesh) and, thus, its high surface area compared with intact hulls may have facilitated fermentation by the colonic bacteria, thus lessening its laxative effects, a mechanism that has been previously suggested (39). It has been reported that coarse wheat bran decreased transit time, whereas the same dose of finely ground wheat bran did not (40). Similarly, finely ground oat hull fiber did not impact transit time in young male subjects with relatively fast transit time (41). Although stool form is strongly associated with microbiota profile (19), the changes in the microbiota observed in some of the participants in the present study are likely due to the fermentation of PHF rather than an effect of altered transit time.",

Although in the present trial an insoluble dietary fiber versus functional fiber was examined, stool frequency did not change. This finding may not be unexpected given that the participants exhibited normal stool frequency (37) at baseline and displayed no symptoms of constipation. In addition, in nonconstipated individuals, stool frequency is not associated with transit time (43). The results of this study add to the significant literature that refutes stool frequency as an appropriate outcome for the evaluation of fiber supplementation in individuals with normal bowel habits. As increases in stool frequency are more often seen as a response to fiber in those with infrequency (e.g., <3 stools/wk) (44) and functional constipation (45), it is possible that if PHF was tested in community-dwelling older adults with low baseline stool frequency and symptoms of constipation, an increase may have been seen, as has been demonstrated in older adults residing in long-term care (18). Similarly, in a small study in older adults with chronic kidney disease, stool frequency increased with an intake of 10\u00a0g/d of PHF (46). These conflicting findings may, in part, be due to the length of the intervention. The studies that have shown an increase in frequency with PHF tested it with intervention periods of 4 wk versus 2 wk in the present trial. Further, differences in resident microbiota, extent of fermentation, and transit time may have affected the outcomes. Beyond stool frequency, quantitative measurements such as stool bulk and examination of in vivo fermentability require exploration.",

                    "text": "The participants\u2019 baseline microbiota showed significant intraindividual variation, which was not surprising given the diversity that has been shown in the human microbiome (47) and its response to differing dietary patterns (9). The results of this study did not provide evidence for PHF as a means to increase microbial diversity or any modulation of microbiota in most participants. It has been suggested that a higher-fiber diet may not have remarkable effects on the microbiome profile in the short term (48) unless an extreme change is made in dietary intake, such as the elimination of fiber and other carbohydrates from the diet (49). A longer-term exposure to the fiber source may be necessary to significantly impact microbiota. However, in the present study, a subgroup analysis revealed significant differences in the microbiota of those individuals exhibiting increased flatulence (fermenters), suggesting fermentation of PHF by gas-generating microorganisms. Methanobrevibacter, Coprococcus, and Peptostreptococcaceae were higher in fermenters. A higher abundance of methanogens, primarily Methanobrevibacter, may be unfavorable as methane production has been associated with constipation (50); however, it has been suggested that certain methanogens, at least theoretically, may suppress trimethylamine production and, thus, that of trimethylamine-N-oxide, which is associated with cardiovascular disease risk (51). Legume intake has been shown to depress proteolytic bacteria (52). Consuming snacks containing PHF resulted in decreased abundance of Clostridiales compared with controls in the fermenters subgroup, specifically a suppression of Clostridia, which are implicated in protein fermentation (53). Recently, a suppression of unclassified Clostridiales after feeding vegetables high in fructans (artichokes and leeks) was reported (54). In contrast, feeding 15\u00a0g/d of PHF over a 12-wk period showed no treatment effect on the limited number of taxa evaluated (33). In a secondary analysis, Lachnospira increased with PHF (55). However, as subjects also lost weight in the PHF intervention arm, it is possible that the change in Lachnospira was due to weight loss instead of the PHF specifically, as a similar enrichment has been seen in bariatric surgery (56) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients (57) following weight loss. Increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus have been commonly reported in fiber studies, but most often in response to oligosaccharide (e.g., galacto-oligosaccharide, fructo-oligosaccharide) supplementation (8) versus a complex fiber source with cellulose as the major indigestible polysaccharide constituent, such as PHF (58). We saw no changes in these genera. Diets higher in fiber, including legumes, support diversity of gut microbiota and these diets are associated with enhanced Bacteroidetes, specifically the genera Prevotella (59, 60). In addition, consumption of a Mediterranean diet has been associated with increased Prevotella (61). In the present study, no enhancement of Prevotella was seen with the PHF, although the subgroup of fermenters exhibited higher relative abundance of Prevotella, which may reflect habitual higher fiber intake and possibly legume intake. However, the baseline fiber intakes of the fermenters did not differ from those of nonfermenters and long-term intake was not examined.",

As other research has shown, it is difficult to demonstrate change and conclude improvement in gastrointestinal function in individuals with normal bowel habits (62).

However, the comparisons of microbiome profiles seem to confirm the adequacy of the 2-wk washouts as they differed from baseline only by Lactobacillus abundance.",

Foods with added fiber may improve intakes (1); however, given the high burden of gastrointestinal symptoms in the United States (66), added fibers that do not substantially contribute to gastrointestinal discomfort are needed. The findings of the present study using snacks fortified with PHF, a primarily insoluble dietary fiber, showed that only a minority of individuals experienced an increase in daily symptoms of flatulence, bloating, and abdominal noise, suggesting differential fermentation or perhaps differing sensitivity to gas production. Thus, in older adults with normal bowel habits, PHF at 10\u00a0g/d is well tolerated. Future trials should test PHF in individuals with low stool frequency and slow transit stool form. Snacks fortified with PHF did not suppress appetite; thus, PHF may be an appropriate fiber source for older adults at risk of unintended weight loss and subsequent malnutrition.",

We have shown that the baseline microbiome profile, particularly the predominance of methanogens, may be predictive of gastrointestinal symptom response to, and potentially health benefits of, PHF. It is not known if microbiome profile also may be predictive of response to whole pulses and other high-fiber ingredients. As has been suggested, individuals may exhibit individualized bacterial population responses to foods (9), and fiber specifically, and our results support this premise. The results of the present study confirm that baseline microbiome profile confounds symptom outcomes and, thus, also may influence health outcomes related to a fiber source. Further research is needed to explore the potential health effects of Clostridia suppression. As the impact of fiber on health is thought to be largely related to its modulation of microbiota and its metabolism (67), and possibly transit time (19), the effects of added fibers on these outcomes in community-dwelling older adults presenting with constipation and dysbiosis, specifically low baseline diversity, require investigation.",
