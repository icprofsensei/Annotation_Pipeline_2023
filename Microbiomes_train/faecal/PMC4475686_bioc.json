Symptoms can be severe, or even life-threatening, in immunocompromised individuals, and chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis is an AIDS-defining illness (1). Similarly, giardiasis is generally a self-limiting illness, which may result in diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, bloating, weight loss, and malabsorption (3). There are also emerging data to suggest that the added energetic burden of enteric protozoan infections (including asymptomatic non-diarrhoeal infections which can often be persistent) may lead to an increased risk of environmental enteropathy and undernutrition and, ultimately, to worse neurocognitive outcomes and school performance (4,5). Although initially found in children in resource-limited countries, this phenomenon of environmental enteropathy has also been well described in indigenous children in Australia with Cryptosporidium infections in particular being implicated (6,7). This may also be relevant in Inuit communities where food insecurity has been shown to be associated with shorter stature (8), and where the incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness appears to be much higher than other developed country settings (9).",

While the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis is thought to be only slightly higher in the north than the Canadian average, the residents of Canada's 3 territories have a considerably higher per capita rate of giardiasis than the Canadian average (10). Several older studies have reported Giardia in humans in northern Canada, with a prevalence ranging from 2 to 29% (10). None of these studies, however, identified the species or genotypes of the parasites. Using nanolitre real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we recently identified Cryptosporidium spp. in 19.8% (17/86) and G. duodenalis in 1.1% (1/86) of diarrhoeal stools collected from patients in Nunavut (11). This Cryptosporidium spp. detection rate was amongst the highest ever reported in non-HIV-infected populations (12).",

Transmission may also occur indirectly through faecally contaminated drinking water and is much more common in regions where water treatment is limited. Very few studies have reported on the levels of contamination of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in water sources in the Canadian North. In the Yukon Territory, remote, pristine water samples were found to be contaminated with Giardia cysts in 32% of samples but none were contaminated with Cryptosporidium oocysts (13). These authors also reported Giardia cyst contamination in 17% of drinking water samples in 1 community in the Yukon, and Cryptosporidium oocysts were found to contaminate 5% of samples. With the limited data available, it is not clear whether these water sources may be contaminated with human sewage or with the faeces of infected animals, or both. Zoonotic and foodborne transmission are also of concern in the Canadian North and may occur through direct contact with dogs and wildlife, or indirectly through faecally contaminated foods. As raw meat and organ tissue from marine and terrestrial mammals, fish, and shellfish are regularly consumed in the north, the risk to consumers in these regions is generally higher, due to potential cross-contamination with intestinal contents during butchering. Dried intestines from ringed seals, for example, are commonly consumed, and these animals have been reported to be infected with both Cryptosporidium and Giardia\n(14\u201316). A few other northern marine mammals have also been reported as hosts for G. duodenalis or Cryptosporidium spp., including bearded seals and bowhead whales (16,17). There have been several reports of Giardia in terrestrial animals in northern Canada. Giardia cysts have been reported in faeces from dogs and a variety of wild animals including caribou, Dall's sheep, muskoxen, coyote, grizzly bear, wolf, beaver, and muskrat (10). The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in terrestrial animals is, however, thought to be relatively low in the north, and Cryptosporidium oocysts have only been reported in caribou and dogs in these regions (10). Cryptosporidium and Giardia have also been reported in blue mussels harvested in the Nunavik region of Quebec (17).",

The Giardia amplicons that were sequenced showed a 100% homology to G. duodenalis Assemblage B (accession nos. HQ179642 and HQ616612). Results based on the amplification of both the 16S rRNA gene and the gdh gene were generally in agreement, although the latter occasionally picked up positives that tested negative by 16S rRNA, justifying the use of multiple genes in studies such as this. Four of 5 (80%) samples were positive by PCR using the gdh gene, which is a species-specific marker. PCR products of Giardia-positive samples were sequenced, prior to RFLP analysis, to compare the genotyping results obtained by DNA sequencing and by RFLP of the gdh gene. Amplicons that exhibited Assemblage B profiles were digested with Rsa I, and 2 profiles were identified as subgroups BIII and BIV based on banding patterns. There was a 100% agreement between the genotyping results obtained by sequencing and by RFLP.",

This study represents one of very few such studies on the detection of Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis in humans in the Canadian North, and is the first to report on the molecular characteristics of these parasites. Interestingly, the number of cases of Cryptosporidium infection (15.7%) was higher in these patients than that of Giardia (4.6%), which was unexpected given that Giardia infections are thought to be much more common in the north than Cryptosporidium\n(10). Co-infections were not identified in the present study, possibly due to the relatively small sample size. However, a limitation of this study was that we only tested samples that were submitted by clinicians for bacterial culture as part of clinical care. Samples submitted for parasitology (microscopy) were in fixative and, therefore, could not be tested with PCR. A prospective study would be required to determine the true incidence of infection with Cryptosporidium and Giardia in people with and without diarrhoea.",

Human infections with C. parvum genotype family IIa are commonly seen in areas with intensive animal production, such as the UK, Portugal, Slovenia, southeastern Australia and rural areas of the North America (38\u201343). The relatively high occurrence of zoonotic infections in these areas is likely because cattle and sheep are commonly infected with C. parvum of the genotype family IIa. Furthermore, some of the sub-genotypes within this family have been reported in both humans and animals in the same area (40,41). The most common C. parvum IIa sub-genotype in the present study (IIaA15G2R1) is a common sub-genotype and has been widely reported from various regions in the UK and in the United States, as well as in Canada (Ontario) (31,33,38\u201340,42,44\u201346). The high occurrence of this sub-genotype in Nunavut is interesting as the typical livestock reservoirs are absent. Further molecular epidemiological work will be required to determine if this sub-genotype is transmitted human-to-human or if wildlife reservoirs may exist in this region.",

The exclusive presence of G. duodenalis Assemblage B in diarrhoeic patients in this study, therefore, is suggestive of zoonotic or foodborne transmission. However, since RFLP analysis demonstrated the presence of the subgroups BIII and BIV, which are generally associated with human infections (25), the source of infection is unclear and, as with Cryptosporidium, further work is required to fully understand the transmission patterns of Giardia in this region.",

The present study represents the first molecular characterization of these parasites in humans in the Canadian North and provides some evidence for possible zoonotic or foodborne transmission. To fully understand the public health significance of the different Cryptosporidium and Giardia species and genotypes in diarrhoeic patients, it will be imperative to determine the extent of genetic diversity within these parasites through comprehensive studies of the burden and molecular epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in Nunavut and other northern regions.",
