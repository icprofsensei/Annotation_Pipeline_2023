                    "text": "Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) is traditionally divided into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). UC is a relapsing non-transmural inflammatory disease that is restricted to the colon and is characterized by flare-ups of bloody diarrhea. CD is a chronic, segmental localized granulomatous disease that can affect any part of the entire gastrointestinal tract. Ileo-anal pouch is a procedure restoring functionality of the rectum after a colectomy. IBD is a multifactorial disease and flares of IBD are probably triggered by changes in the intestinal microbiota followed by an abnormal immune response. In this study, we aim to analyze the intestinal bacterial diversity in IBD patients during various stages of disease compared with healthy controls. Permission for human experiments and recruitment of participants was obtained from the Ethic Committee for Copenhagen County hospitals (Permission no. KA-03019, Permission no. KA-20060159). Stools from 26 healthy controls, 42 CD, 38 UC and 18 pouch patients were collected. Stool DNA extraction was performed using Qiagen, DNA mini stool kit Denmark. DGGE-PCR amplifying the V2-V3 region of 16S-rDNA gene of the bacteria was amplified by universal primers HDA1 and HDA2. Analysis of DGGE was performed blinded using BioNumerics version 7.5. After normalization, a DGGE gel band matching was performed. The similarities between profiles were calculated with a ranked Pearson correlation coefficient based on the band matching results using band intensities. Simpson's index of diversity and Pielou's species evenness were calculated. Based on the Shannon Diversity Index, UC patients had lower species diversity and bacterial evenness in comparison to healthy persons, p < 0.05. However, only CD and disease pouch patients had lower species diversity compared to those with inactive disease and healthy controls. Well-functioning pouch patients had decreased species evenness in comparison to diseased pouch patients and control group. During the active disease stage in CD and pouch, the patients have a low bacterial diversity in their gut when compared to the inactive stage. In UC patients, a generally low diversity was observed at all stages of the disease compared to healthy controls.",

As a result, the immune system is less able to tolerate exposure to environments rich on microbiota resulting in an inappropriate immune activation (6). Humans live in a symbiotic relationship with the gut microbiome, in which humans provide the ideal environment for the microbiota to flourish and bacteria in return ferment the food carbohydrates to short fatty acids, synthesize certain vitamins and degrade dietary oxalates (2\u20135).",

                    "text": "Studies show that IBD with active disease is strongly associated with an overall increased prevalence of proteobacteria (9, 10) and drop in intestinal species richness, more specifically a significant drop in firmicutes (11, 12), Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales (13) of Clades IV and XIVa (13). Decreased prevalence of butyrate-producing bacteria such as Clostridiales species in the gut explains the decreased amount of short chain fatty acids in fecal samples from IBD patients (14, 15). Butyrate serves as a major source of energy for colonic epithelial cells (16) and as an inhibitor of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the intestinal mucosa through a mechanism that involves hyper-acetylation of histones and suppression of NF-\u03baB signaling (17). Butyrate reinforces the mucosal barrier by inducing production of mucin and antimicrobial peptides, and by strengthening epithelial barrier integrity through directly increasing the expression of tight junction proteins (18). More recent studies indicate a link between IBD and a decreased prevalence of butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (firmicute), belonging to Clostridia cluster IV species (19, 20), increased prevalence of adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) in ileal CD (21, 22) and increased prevalence of E. coli with extra intestinal pathogenic E. coli properties (23\u201325). It has been shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment of UC, indicating that colon microbiota play an essential role in UC (26). A subdivision of IBD into three phenotypes as ileal CD, colonic CD, and UC according to genetic composition has been suggested (27).",

However, during the last decades, the main focus has been on an imbalance in the intestinal microbiome in IBD patients that might cause or trigger the disease activity. Next generation sequencing investigation of the gut microbiome provides large amounts of data, which can be difficult to interpret, and it is still quite costly. The advantages of using DGGE (34) compared with next generation sequencing is that DGGE detects highly prevalent (high concentration) intestinal bacteria, while next generation sequencing is random and detects all DNA. Sequencing is biased by the primer annealing, and even small amounts of DNA will be amplified. In this study, we investigated the intestinal microbiota in IBD using 16S rDNA PCR and DGGE enabling the discovery of overall differences in intestinal bacteria community within different IBD groups and controls. When discussing the concept of diversity of a microbial community, the terms species evenness and richness are used. Bacterial richness, also known as the Shannon diversity index is a measurement of the total number of species in the community, while evenness expresses how evenly the individuals in the community are distributed over the different species (35). As the colon contains two-thirds of the total amount of bacteria in the human body (36), it is an exceptional environment, and a perfect symbiosis plays a key role in colon health. UC is localized in the colon and is linked to intestinal bacterial dysbiosis and reduced biodiversity (37). This is also confirmed in our study, where UC patients with and without active disease had significantly reduced Shannon diversity indices and reduced fecal bacterial evenness in comparison with healthy persons (Figure \u200b(Figure1).1). LDA and cluster analysis (Figure \u200b(Figure2B)2B) confirm this result, showing a separation between UC patients and healthy controls. Yet, the question of what triggers the disease activity in UC patients remains. If bacteria in the colon are responsible, what are the differences in the intestinal bacteria community in the UC patients with and without active disease? As we see an overall reduced biodiversity in UC patients, the flares of UC might be triggered by the shift between the different bacterial communities in UC patient. The studies using next generation sequencing reveal that a reduced amount of F. praustnitzii (38) and an increased number of Proteobacteriae (39, 40) might have an effect on UC relapses. In order to restore the biodiversity, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed and it was shown to be effective to promote remission in UC patients with active disease, confirming the role of the colon microbiota in UC (26).",

Colonic CD has been identified in 60% of the CD patients (41), which often present with diarrhea and an aggressive course of the disease. Intestinal dysbiosis is also linked to colonic CD, with increased prevalence of Faecalibacterium (Firmicutes) and two unidentified genera of Clostridiales and Ruminococceae (42), while ileal patients have a higher prevalence of Proteobacteria compared to healthy subjects. Our results show that CD patients with active disease have a significantly reduced Shannon diversity index in comparison with CD patients with inactive disease and healthy controls (Figure \u200b(Figure3A).3A). Decreased species evenness was found in CD patients with and without active disease compared to healthy persons; however, these differences were not significant, p = 0.08 (Figure \u200b(Figure3B).3B). Interestingly, a metanalysis performed on FMT in CD, reveals that FMT promotes remission in only 60% of the CD patients (43), as only 60% of the CD patients had colonic CD (41). Reduced bacterial diversity in children with CD was reported previously (40, 44, 45).",

Studies show that 40% of patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis develop pouchitis during the first year after surgery (46). Furthermore, antibiotic and probiotic treatment appears to be effective to diminish pouchitis (47). Evidence suggests that an abnormal mucosal immune response to altered microbiota in the pouch leads to acute chronic inflammation (48). Our analysis of bacterial diversity in pouch patients in comparison with healthy persons shows that diseased pouch patients (PA) have a significant decreased microbial diversity in comparison to well-functioning pouch patients and healthy persons, p < 0.05 (Figure \u200b(Figure5A).5A). Reduced diversity was shown in well-functioning pouch patients in comparison to healthy controls; however, the differences are not significant (Figure \u200b(Figure5A).5A). Additionally, our results reveal significantly decreased fecal bacterial evenness in well-functioning pouch patients suggesting that the microbiota in these patients is dominated by just a few species. Maharshak et al. (49) show that pre-pouchititis patients have significantly decreased intestinal bacterial diversity 1 year before pouchitis in comparison to pouch patients, who did not develop pouchitis. The possibility of subclinical inflammation 1 year before pouchitis was confirmed using histological scores, endoscopics and fecal calprotectin (49). This study supports our results showing that well-functioning pouch patients have significantly decreased fecal bacterial evenness and reduced Shannon diversity indices in comparison to healthy persons, which was also confirmed by our LDA analysis (Figure \u200b(Figure6B).6B). It could be speculated whether most of the well-functioning pouch patients in our cohort are in the stage of pre-pouchitis, shown by reduced intestinal bacteria evenness in these patients. Increased relapses in pouch patients might be explained by the surgical treatment where the pouch has a \u201ccolon like\u201d function, which creates a good environment for bacteria to overgrow and cause infections. This supports the finding that FMT does not promote remission in pouchitis patients (50) as antibiotics do.",
