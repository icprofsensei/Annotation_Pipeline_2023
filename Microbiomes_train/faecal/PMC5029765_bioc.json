The GA\u2010map Dysbiosis Test (GA\u2010test) is based on advances in DNA profiling using probes targeting variable regions (V3 to V7) of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to characterise and identify bacteria present (Figure\u00a01). The probes comprise a highly selective and specific bacterial probe set that is used with a unique algorithm to facilitate determination of dysbiosis level. The method provides a rapid, high\u2010throughput analysis of a large number of individual faecal samples. The breadth of knowledge gained from microbiome projects was used to develop a test aimed at characterising dysbiosis by deviation from a normobiotic state for use in a clinical diagnostic setting. For this purpose, the test was technically documented in accordance with EU requirements for an in\u00a0vitro diagnostic test comprising the following intended use claim: \u2018The GA\u2010test is intended to be used as a gut microbiota DNA analysis tool to identify and characterise dysbiosis\u2019.",

From a combined dataset of 496 16S rRNA gene sequences (consensus sequence[s] for each species, chosen from all available long 16S rRNA sequences and purified to avoid sequences errors) from 269 bacterial species, probes were designed to cover major bacterial observations made from the literature. All probes were designed according to Veb\u00f8 et\u00a0al.22 with a minimum melting temperature (T\nm) of 60\u00a0\u00b0C by the nearest\u2010neighbour method23 for the target group where the nucleotide 3\u2032 end of the probe is a cytosine; nontarget group probe requirements were a T\nm of 30\u00a0\u00b0C or absence of a cytosine as the nucleotide adjacent to the 3\u2032 end of the probe. Each probe was designed to target a bacterial species or group, i.e. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (species), Lactobacillus (genus), Clostridia (class) and Proteobacteria (phylum), based on their 16S rRNA sequence (V3\u2013V9). Probes that satisfied target detection and nontarget exclusion in silico were evaluated for cross\u2010labelling, self\u2010labelling and cross hybridisation before final validation was performed against bacterial strains in\u00a0vitro.",

The variables (probes) were selected based on their ability to distinguish between samples isolated from healthy individuals and IBS patients. A final panel of 54 probes was selected covering the sites across V3 to V7 on the 16S rRNA sequence (Figure\u00a01). Bacterial target specificity, tested with the 54\u2010probe set against 368 available single bacterial strains (Data S4), was performed to define the target bacteria for each probe. The probes detect bacteria within the six phyla; Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Tenericutes and Verrucomicrobia, covering 10 taxonomic bacterial classes and 36 genera (for more details on the bacterial targets for the 54 probes see Data S5).",

The boundary between nondysbiotic and dysbiotic was determined by calculating confidence regions for the values of Hotelling's T\u2010square and Q statistics given by PCA scores in the model. Geometrically this corresponds to a rectangle with one corner located at the origin which classifies samples located within the rectangle as nondysbiotic and\u00a0samples located outside as dysbiotic. Analysis of T\u2010square and Q statistics scaled by the confidence limit showed that the Euclidian distance from the origin had a log\u2010normal like distribution (data not shown). Euclidian distance from the origin was used to merge the two dimensions, and weighting was performed to capture the effect of T\u2010squared and Q statistics as appropriate. A single numeric representation of the degree of dysbiosis, defined as the Dysbiosis Index (DI), was derived from a log\u2010normal distribution by assigning estimated portions of the distribution to different values on a scale set from 0 to 5. A DI value of 2 was defined as class separation represented by the identified confidence limits; a DI of 2 or lower being the nondysbiotic region and a DI of 3 or higher being the dysbiotic region. The higher the DI above 2, the more the sample is considered to deviate from normobiosis, e.g. sample A with DI\u00a0=\u00a04 is farther away from the normobiotic reference cohort in the Euclidian space than sample B with DI\u00a0=\u00a03, thus A is more dysbiotic than B. The scale was optimised with emphasis on reducing technical variation between replicates, meaning that the integer part of the numeric output is decided by pre\u2010determined levels of the Euclidian distance.",

The results in the validation cohort are given in Table\u00a03. Of the 43 samples from healthy volunteers included in the validation cohort, seven (16%) were determined as being dysbiotic, with the distribution of DI scores for validation cohort shown in Figure\u00a03. Among the IBS patients, 80 of 109 (73%) were determined as being dysbiotic. In the IBD cohort, 100 of 135 (74%) were determined as being dysbiotic, including 56 of 80 (70%) treatment\u2010na\u00efve IBD patients, and 44 of 55 (80%) IBD patients in clinical remission. The distribution of DI between IBS and IBD patients was significantly different (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and more IBD patients than IBS patients had a DI >4 (Figure\u00a03). Furthermore, both in treatment\u2010na\u00efve IBD patients and in IBD patients in remission, the frequency of dysbiosis was higher in CD (80% and 89% respectively) than UC (64% and 75%), with significantly higher DI values in CD than UC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03).",

The scores for the first two principal components (PC), accounting for 48% of the variance in the data, showed a tighter cluster for healthy subjects in the bottom right corner compared with a more diverse spread for subjects with IBD and IBS (Figure\u00a04a). The sample distribution in the scores plot was found to be linked to the degree of dysbiosis, with a central cluster of nondysbiotic samples surrounded by samples with weak dysbiosis (DI\u00a0=\u00a03), and the samples with the most severe dysbiosis (DI\u00a0=\u00a05) scattered outside this cluster (Figure\u00a04b). Both the first and second PC each separate the samples from healthy volunteers from IBS and IBD samples to a certain degree. The scatter of DI values implies that different bacteria dominate dysbiosis for different samples. To further investigate which bacterial groups were the main contributors to dysbiosis in IBD and IBS, differences in overall mean normalised signal between dysbiotic and nondysbiotic status for each of the 54 probes were calculated. The pre\u2010dominant bacteria contributing to dysbiosis within the IBS cohort were Firmicutes (Bacilli), Proteobacteria (Shigella/Escherichia), Actinobacteria and Ruminococcus gnavus (Figure\u00a05a). Similarly, the pre\u2010dominant bacteria within the IBD cohort were Proteobacteria (Shigella/Escherichia), Firmicutes, specifically F. prausnitzii, and Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and Prevotella) (Figure\u00a05b). Interestingly, Proteobacteria (Shigella/Escherichia) was among the top five dysbiosis\u2010contributing bacterial groups for both IBS and IBD, implying similarities in dysbiosis between IBS and IBD. However, all bacterial groups that contributed most to dysbiosis in the IBS cohort showed increased probe signal intensity compared to nondysbiotic patients, while for the IBD cohort, both reduced (F. prausnitzii) and increased probe signal intensities were the main contributors to dysbiosis.",

The probe targets Firmicutes (Streptococcus), and this signal was found to be elevated in the Spanish samples compared to the Scandinavian cohort. Figure\u00a06 shows the pre\u2010dominant bacteria contributing to dysbiosis within the Spanish samples. As expected, Proteobacteria (Shigella/Escherichia) is again found to be a contributing bacteria in dysbiosis. In addition, Bacteroides stercoris and Bifidobacterium contribute to dysbiosis, which potentially could be linked to differences, in e.g. diet between Scandinavian countries and the Mediterranean region.",

The variation between sampling time points was not significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.26), with explained variances based on sums of squares of 0.11.

In\u00a0general, we found strong correlations between the GA\u2010technology signals and Qiime taxonomically assigned\u00a0MiSeq reads (Table\u00a04), where Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Dialister, Lactobacillus/Pediococcus, R. gnavus and Shigella/Escherichia all had a Pearson correlation of r\u00a0>\u00a00.85. For some species the correlation was moderate, e.g. B. fragilis (r\u00a0=\u00a00.38), Ruminococcus albus/bromii (r\u00a0=\u00a00.31) and Streptococcus sanguinis/thermophilus (r\u00a0=\u00a00.49). However, since MiSeq sequencing did not allow for detection at species level, a direct comparison to the specific probe signals can be complicated if the specific species is not the dominating species in a genera. Interestingly, no correlation was found between the two methods for the species Mycoplasma hominis (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.05). Using MiSeq sequencing, Mycoplasma genus was only detected in one sample, implying that MiSeq sequencing does not allow for the selective detection of this genus at all. In contrast, M. hominis was detected in a majority of the 188 samples with the GA\u2010technology. The highly specific GA\u2010technology probe detecting M. hominis binds to V6 on the 16S rRNA gene, a variable region not covered by MiSeq Illumina sequencing (Figure\u00a01).",

This DI is an indicator of the degree to which an individual's microbiome deviates from that of a healthy reference collection and could potentially be highly relevant in clinical diagnosis and monitoring of the progression of conditions such as IBD and IBS. The stability of the human gut microbiota is another important feature if microbial characterisation is to play a role in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease.

A limitation to this technology is the relatively short read\u2010lengths used for sequencing, only allowing for a limited region of the 16S rRNA gene to be exploited (usually V3 and/or V4) (Figure\u00a01); thus, less than 50% of obtained sequences can be annotated at genus level.32 The lack of detection of Mycoplasma with MiSeq Illumina sequencing, detected in a majority of the samples using a probe targeting V6 with the GA\u2010map test, further illustrates the limitations of using only limited variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Moreover, since MiSeq sequencing does not allow for detection at species level, a direct comparison to the specific probe signals can be challenging if the specific species is not the dominating species in a genera. Even so, it is possible to gain important insights to an individuals' gut microbiota using high\u2010throughput sequencing. Compared to the GA\u2010technology, this technology is superior towards exploring novel bacterial biomarkers, and gaining in\u2010depth information regarding all bacteria present in a sample. However, in terms of the human gut microbiota, the main patterns have been explored,32 and GA\u2010technology has consolidated on this information in designing 54 highly specific DNA probes exploiting a broad range of gene variability (V3\u2013V7). These 54 probes have further been converted into a diagnostic test but without the laborious data\u2010analysis required following high\u2010throughput sequencing. Therefore, the GA\u2010technology provides a unique opportunity to study changes in gut\u00a0microbiota profiles potentially associated with gastrointestinal\u2010related disorders. Our results show agreement between the two technologies regarding determining dysbiosis, as well as strong correlations in detecting several bacteria. However, results also show weak correlations for some specific species, possibly due to lack of selective species detection by MiSeq Illumina sequencing.",

FMT is now regarded as the most effective treatment in relapsing Clostridium difficile colitis,18, 39 and is currently being studied in phase I to IV clinical trials in many of the aforementioned conditions (CD, phase II/III NCT01793831; UC, phase I NCT01947101, phase II NCT01896635, phase II/III NCT01790061; IBD including CD and UC, phase IV NCT02033408). A key barrier in the interpretation of FMT data has been the variability in bacterial composition of donor microbiota, not only related to pathogenic organisms but also to the composition of the normally occurring microbiota, further highlighting the importance of identifying a method to sufficiently characterise both pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes. The ability to characterise an individual's microbiome and monitor alterations may allow for the prediction of therapeutic outcome or even relapse in such conditions.17 It may also help to explain why a patient is refractory to particular therapeutic regimens and aid adaptation of the regimen accordingly. Furthermore, rapid and reproducible detailed bacterial profiles from normobiotic and dysbiotic individuals may aid the continuation of innovative therapeutic approaches such as FMT.18 Thus, use of the test could prove clinically useful in determining dysbiosis, not only in IBS and IBD patients, but also in other conditions where knowledge about the microbiota profile might prove clinically useful, in the subsequent monitoring of prescribed treatment regimens, and in the evolution of new therapeutic approaches.",

The diagnostic applicability of the test will have to await further clinical experience, also from international studies, as one might expect geographical deviations related to microbial patterns. Nevertheless, the present standardised and reproducible method represents, in particular, a step forward as a combined practical, ready to use, clinical and research tool. The method will allow us to gain more knowledge on the microbial component of intestinal disorders, and in general, provide the possibility of increasing our understanding of the part played by the microbiome in the disease process.",
