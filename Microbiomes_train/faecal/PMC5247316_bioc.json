The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers (F515/R806) targeted the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, with the reverse primers including a 12-bp Golay barcode.23 Thermal cycling was performed in an MJ Research PTC-200 (Bio-Rad, Inc, Hercules, CA) with the following parameters: 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 20 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds; and 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. PCR products were purified using the MinElute 96 UF PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA). Clusters were created using template concentrations of 1.9 pmol/L and PhiX at 65 K/mm2. Sequencing primers targeted 101 base pair reads of the 5\u2019 end of the amplicons and 7 base pair barcode reads.23 Reads were filtered using the following parameters: minimum Q-score, - 20; maximum number of consecutive low-quality base calls allowed before truncating, - 3; and maximum number of N characters allowed, - 0. All filtered V4 reads had a length of 101 bp. The number of sequences per sample ranged from 17,946 (an outlier; the second lowest sequence depth was 478,168) to 848,638, with a mean of 620,720. Raw 16S rRNA sequence data were deposited under National Center for Biotechnology Information BioProject ID PRJNA324147. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were picked in QIIME 1.8.0 against the May 2013 version of the Greengenes database (http://greengenes.secondgenome.com), prefiltered at 97% identity.24 The number of reads assigned to 97% OTUs ranged from 445,985 to 805,639, excluding the lowest depth sample (16,941).",

Consistent with previous studies, CD patients had lower microbial diversity than both UC patients and healthy individuals as measured by 3 metrics: Chao1 (richness), Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity, and the Shannon index (evenness) (CD vs non-IBD, P < .0001 for all measures; CD vs UC, P < .05\u2013.005). Differences in microbial composition across samples were visualized using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Samples formed a gradient by IBD status and microbial diversity, both of which were highly significantly associated with overall composition using Adonis, a nonparametric method of analysis of variance (Figure\u00a01A). These findings were confirmed using Bray\u2013Curtis or unweighted UniFrac distances (data not shown). CD patients and healthy relatives mostly occupied distinct regions of the PCoA space but had substantial overlap; UC patients were interspersed throughout. A subset of Crohn\u2019s patients in this cohort had increased fecal calprotectin levels to greater than 2000 \u03bcg/g despite being in clinical remission, but calprotectin was not associated with overall microbial composition. Microbial composition was found to vary across families (Adonis, P < 10-5) (Figure\u00a02A and B).",

                    "text": "It has been reported that the human fecal microbiome can be divided into discrete community types.21, 29 To investigate whether variation in microbial composition in this cohort could be represented by microbial community types, we classified individuals using a conservative, rigorous method based on Dirichlet multinomial mixture modeling of OTUs at the 97% sequence identity threshold, roughly corresponding to species.28 This model best fit the data when the cohort was divided into 2 groups that we termed OTU types, which were detectable at a sequence depth of 10,000 reads or more per sample (Figure\u00a03A, and data not shown). These OTU types did not correspond to the 3 enterotypes reported in a genus-level analysis of European, American, and Japanese fecal microbiota that were differentiated by abundance of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus (Figure\u00a03C).21 OTU type 2 was associated strongly with IBD, particularly CD (Figure\u00a01B). Nineteen of the 21 families included at least 1 individual with IBD who carried OTU type 2, indicating that the association of this microbial community state with IBD was not a family-specific trait. Although most healthy relatives had OTU type 1, 10 carried OTU type 2. In PCoA plots, OTU type 1 encompassed a region with high microbial diversity whereas OTU type 2 mapped to a lower-diversity region (Figure\u00a01A). The difference in microbial \u03b1 diversity between OTU types was observed in separate comparisons of CD subjects and healthy relatives, and confirmed using phylogenetic diversity and the Shannon index (data not shown). However, within the same OTU type, differences in microbial diversity between CD and non-IBD did not reach significance (Figure\u00a01C). Hence, OTU type 2 represents a low-diversity microbial state independent of IBD status. Two families contained 5 of 10 of the healthy relatives with OTU type 2, although the relationship between OTU type and family among healthy relatives did not reach statistical significance (Fisher exact test, P\u00a0= .08) (Table\u00a02).",

At the genus level, microbial community type was associated with shifts in the abundance of 40 microbial genera compared with 21 for CD and 15 for UC (Figure\u00a04). Similarly, far more OTUs were differentially abundant between the 2 OTU types (752) than between non-IBD individuals and either CD (162) or UC (44) patients (Figure\u00a01D and Supplementary Table 1). Rarefaction analysis showed that the number of differentially abundant microbial taxa increased with greater sequence depth, whereas \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity comparisons were largely unaffected by sequence depth greater than 3000 (data not shown). OTU type 2 was enriched in abundant members of the Blautia (Ruminococcus), and Bacteroides genera and depleted in an abundant member of the Ruminococcus genus (Figure\u00a01E). Some OTUs, including Veillonella dispar, Veillonella parvula, Blautia producta, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and multiple Enterobacteriaceae, were associated independently with both OTU type and CD. The CD-specific microbial signature included increased Bifidibacterium adolescentis and Parabacteroides distasonis and decreased F prausnitzii and\u00a0Bacteroides fragilis. OTU type 2, CD, and UC were associated with decreased Akkermansia mucinophila (Figures\u00a01E and \u200band44).",

This classifier was highly accurate in 10-fold cross-validation, with an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 (Figure\u00a05A). The relative contribution of OTUs to the classifier was expressed as importance scores, which measure the loss in accuracy of the random forest classifier when that feature is permutated randomly. The OTUs that had the greatest impact on the random forest classifier for OTU types were [Ruminococcus] gnavus (increased in OTU type 2), an unidentified Bacteroides (increased in OTU type 1), 2 unidentified members of the Lachnospiraceae family (1\u00a0associated with each OTU type), and Roseburia faecis (increased in OTU type 1), of which only R faecis was associated independently with IBD (Figure\u00a05B). The classifier then was applied to stool samples in the RISK cohort from patients (n\u00a0= 177) and controls (n\u00a0= 28) to identify OTU types in this independent cohort. These stool samples formed a gradient by microbial diversity similar to that of the stool samples from the family cohort (Figures\u00a01A and \u200band55C). As in the family cohort, predicted OTU type 2 in the RISK cohort was associated with CD as well as with lower microbial diversity irrespective of disease status (Figure\u00a05D and E).",

Our pipeline detected 4626 spectral features across 2 acquisition modes. Differences across samples in the intensities of these spectral features were visualized by PCoA. Healthy relatives and CD patients mostly separated to opposite ends of the PCoA space with an area of overlap between the two, although UC patients were found in both regions (Figure\u00a06A). Metabolomics signatures also varied by family (Adonis, P < 10-5), showing that shared genetic and/or environmental factors within families influenced the composition of the metabolome (Figure\u00a02C and D). A random forests classifier was trained on the metabolomics data to determine the discriminative power of fecal metabolites to predict CD from non-IBD. Differences in metabolomics profiles between CD and non-IBD were sufficient for the classifier to have an AUC of 0.89 in 10-fold cross-validation (Figure\u00a06B). We then used multivariate models to identify specific spectral features associated with CD or UC, adjusting for covariates including sex, anti\u2013tumor necrosis factor therapy, Jewish ethnicity, mode of delivery, and calprotectin. CD patients had altered abundance of 123 spectral features whereas UC patients showed comparatively little change: 20 spectral features, of which 5 were\u00a0shared with CD and 2 were validated as mesalamine (a common treatment for UC in this cohort) (Figure\u00a06C). Hierarchical clustering of differential spectral features in CD showed that most Crohn\u2019s patients and a subset of healthy individuals grouped together whereas other non-IBD individuals had a distinct profile. CD-associated metabolites included amino acid derivatives (phenylethylamine and N-acetylcadaverine) and bile acids (cholic acid, 7-ketodeoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid sulfate, and 3-sulfodeoxycholic acid) (Figure\u00a06D). Metabolites that were increased in non-IBD individuals included a heme degradation product (stercobilin), a glutamate derivative (acetyl-glutamic acid), and a product of steroid catabolism (boldione).",

A random forest classifier for metabotype was trained with an AUC of 1.0, indicative of the robust difference between the 2 metabotypes (Figure\u00a07C). We then used multivariate models that included metabotype to identify IBD-associated spectral features independent of metabotype (Figure\u00a07D and Supplementary Data File 2). CD and UC were found to have a limited metabolic signature with only 9 differential features each, whereas metabotype was associated with 516 spectral features. This suggested that metabotype accounted for much of the variation in the metabolome that had been attributed to disease status without considering metabotype. Metabotype 2 was characterized by increased levels of the same bile acids and amino acid derivatives previously attributed to CD as well as taurine, tryptophan, serinyl tryptophan, and an omega-6 fatty acid (adrenic acid) (Figure\u00a07E). Metabotype 1 had increased levels of steroid hormones (estradiol, androstenedione, and boldione), products of heme catabolism (stercobilin and mesobilirubinogen), azaleic acid, and acetyl-glutamic acid. Estradiol and androstenedione abundance was higher in females than in males, but in both sexes increased levels of these hormones were seen in metabotype 1 (data not shown).",

We investigated whether OTU type was associated with an increased risk of subclinical intestinal inflammation as evidenced by increased fecal calprotectin.35 The majority of samples had calprotectin levels below the limit of detection. We selected 100 \u03bcg/g as a cut-off value for increased fecal calprotectin based on a meta-analysis of the use of calprotectin to differentiate IBD from healthy controls or irritable bowel syndrome.36 Only 3 of 44 healthy relatives (7%) with OTU type 1 and 3 of 10 relatives (30%) with OTU type 2 had increased calprotectin levels (Figure\u00a09B). This corresponded to an odds ratio of 5.9 (confidence interval, 0.9\u201337.9) for the association of OTU type 2 with increased calprotectin level, with a P value of .05.

We found that variation in the microbiome and metabolome among disease-quiescent IBD patients and their first-degree relatives can be represented by 2 intestinal OTU types and metabotypes. The existence of an IBD-associated OTU type and metabotype in healthy relatives suggests that dysbiosis with its associated metabolic products may be a pre-existing trait that precedes the acquisition of disease. The bacterial taxa characterizing the IBD-associated OTU type included multiple OTUs identified as Enterobacteriaceae and 2 putatively identified as Prevotella copri. This parallels studies of Toll-like receptor 5 knockout mice and NLRP6 inflammasome knockout mice showing that colitis susceptibility was associated with blooms of Enterobacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae, respectively.5, 37 Although unaffected family members were not evaluated endoscopically for IBD, the study design included clinical assessment at\u00a0recruitment and periodic monitoring for acquisition of\u00a0clinical disease. Healthy individuals with the IBD-associated OTU type and metabotype were found predominantly in several families. Such states may have arisen owing to shared founder effects, dietary factors, and genetic variants between patients and some of their family members that influence host\u2013microbiome homeostasis.11, 12, 38",

                    "text": "The metabotypes identified in this cohort may be driven by shifts in bacterial metabolism of host-derived factors such as bile acids due to altered microbial community structure, explaining the close correlation of metabotype with OTU type. Metabotype 2 showed increased levels of cholic acid (a primary bile acid) and a sulfated derivative (7-sulfocholic acid), as well as taurine-conjugated and sulfated derivatives of the other primary bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid. These findings parallel a study that reported increased conjugated and sulfated bile acids in the feces of CD patients attributed to reduced capacity of the CD microbiome to deconjugate and desulfate bile acids.39 The increased levels of cholic acid may reflect reduced conversion to other bile acid metabolites. The other validated bile acid associated with metabotype 2, 7-ketodeoxycholic acid, has not been reported previously to be increased in CD or UC patients and may reflect altered bacterial metabolism of deoxycholic acid (a secondary bile acid).40, 41 The bile acid shifts in metabotype 2 likely are relevant to the development of dysbiosis and IBD given the considerable evidence that bile acid signaling through farnesoid X receptor and TGR5 is critical for maintaining the epithelial barrier and promoting antibacterial defenses.42, 43, 44 There also are recent data indicating that bile acids including cholic acid can induce enterochromaffin cells to secrete serotonin, a neurotransmitter shown to promote experimental colitis.45, 46 This could be potentiated by the increased levels in metabotype 2 of tryptophan, an essential amino acid that is the precursor to serotonin and that also can be metabolized by microbes into immunomodulatory metabolites including kynurenines and an aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand, indole-3-aldehyde.47, 48 The possible causal link between OTU type and metabotype, with its associated alteration of bile acid metabolism, warrants mechanistic investigation in models of germ-free mice colonized with feces of each OTU type/metabotype. Interestingly, 19 of 90 subjects had discordant OTU type and metabotype, suggesting that other factors besides the microbiome such as diet\u00a0also could influence the metabolome.49",

The second cluster was associated with abscess, suggesting that it was driven by CD patients with penetrating disease. A second study used genus level fecal microbiome data to group CD patients with active disease into near and far clusters to reflect their closeness to the microbiome of healthy controls.10 The far cluster was characterized by lower microbial diversity and differential abundance of 30 genera, of which 7 had concordant differences between the 2 OTU types defined here (Figure\u00a04). The present study builds on these observations by showing that microbial community types found in IBD patients also are present in healthy relatives. Furthermore, microbial community types were associated with metabolomics profiles and subclinical intestinal inflammation, indicating functional relevance of this community structure. A limitation of this study was the small number of high-risk families and their lack of ethnic and racial diversity. However, we are not aware of other published family based or longitudinal cohorts analyzed for microbiome and metabolites. Their availability will be important to validate the present observations and refine them in broader populations that include other racial or ethnic groups.",

                    "text": "The microbial state defined by OTU type 2 was associated not just with diagnosed IBD but also with a potential subclinical disease state defined by increased fecal calprotectin in healthy first-degree relatives. Nevertheless, most individuals with the IBD-associated OTU type and metabotype had normal calprotectin level. This suggests that these microbial changes are not simply the result of subclinical inflammation, although we cannot rule out that OTU type and metabotype are more sensitive biomarkers for low-grade inflammation than calprotectin. We speculate that healthy individuals with an IBD-associated microbial community type and metabotype have a predisease state that increases the risk for the future development of both subclinical and overt IBD. Validating this interpretation will require prospective longitudinal studies to assess the incidence of IBD in individuals stratified by OTU type, metabotype, and calprotectin, and to assess the stability of OTU types and metabotypes across time and diet. Analytically, it also will require bioinformatically fastidious methods to refine and simplify the definition of microbial community types that robustly are preserved between independent cohorts and data sets, and illuminate and resolve the methodologic and ecologic questions raised by prior studies of intestinal microbiome clustering.50 Future cohort studies would need to incorporate known genetic and epidemiologic risk factors to determine the risk for IBD attributable to OTU type and metabotype after adjusting for these other factors. In addition, studies of germ-free mice colonized with feces from healthy relatives stratified by OTU type and metabotype are warranted to investigate whether these microbial states influence susceptibility to experimental models of IBD. If validated, prospective identification of healthy individuals with a high-risk microbiome/metabolome creates the opportunity to prevent disease development by targeting the dysbiosis and/or its metabolic consequences in the intestine.",
