Despite the role that the human gut microbiota plays in health and diseases, little is known about its composition and functional capacity during prolonged fasting when the external nutrient supply is reduced or suppressed. We analysed the effects of a 10-d periodic fasting on the faecal microbiota of fifteen healthy men. Participants fasted according to the peer-reviewed Buchinger fasting guidelines, which involve a daily energy intake of about 1046 kJ (250 kcal) and an enema every 2 d. Serum biochemistry confirmed the metabolic switch from carbohydrates to fatty acids and ketones. Emotional and physical well-being were enhanced. Faecal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that fasting caused a decrease in the abundance of bacteria known to degrade dietary polysaccharides such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. There was a concomitant increase in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (Escherichia coli and Bilophila wadsworthia), known to use host-derived energy substrates. Changes in taxa abundance were associated with serum glucose and faecal branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), suggesting that fasting-induced changes in the gut microbiota are associated with host energy metabolism. These effects were reversed after 3 months. SCFA levels were unchanged at the end of the fasting. We also monitored intestinal permeability and inflammatory status. IL-6, IL-10, interferon \u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 levels increased when food was reintroduced, suggesting a reactivation of the postprandial immune response. We suggest that changes in the gut microbiota are part of the physiological adaptations to a 10-d periodic fasting, potentially influencing its beneficial health effects.",

Fasting happens on a daily basis, usually during night hours, but also during short or longer periods of time, e.g. in humans without access to technologies of food conservation(1) or for religious reasons(2). Humans also voluntarily fast because it has been documented to safely enhance well-being and to have therapeutic benefits(3,4). Most scientific investigations in the last decade were, however, focused on intermittent fasting, a recurrence of 16 to 48\u00a0h energy restriction alternating with food intake(3). By contrast, very few studies have examined human physiology during a periodic fast lasting from 2 to 21\u00a0d or more, such as in the empirically based Buchinger Wilhelmi fasting programme, described in peer-reviewed therapeutic fasting guidelines(5).",

This increase in the rate of lipolysis and ketogenesis is reflected by a decrease in blood glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, concomitant to an increase in glucagon, growth hormone, NEFA, ketone bodies and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 levels(4,7\u20139).",

The reduction of the external nutrient supply to the gut microbiota, and the associated remodelling of the gastrointestinal tissues of the host, have been qualified as a \u2018microscopic energy crisis\u2019 coupled to a \u2018housing crisis\u2019 for the gut microbiota(13). The gut microbiota relies almost entirely on host diet composition as well as on host food processing capacity to obtain metabolic substrates, and to cover its energy requirements of 150\u2013450\u00a0kcal/d (628\u20131883\u00a0kJ/d)(14).

This has been demonstrated in laboratory animals, already. In mice, intermittent fasting prevents diabetic retinopathy by restructuring the gut microbiota(22). Other publications link therapeutic effects of fasting to changes of gut microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis(23,24). Only one study performed in human subjects showed that after 1 week of fasting, followed by 6 weeks of refeeding and probiotic supplementation, an increase in abundance of lactobacilli, Enterobacteriaceae and Akkermansia could be observed within the gut microbiota(19). However, the gut microbiota composition was not measured at the end of the fasting period.",

They stayed under daily supervision of nurses and physicians specialised in fasting therapy. On the day of admission in the BWC the participants received a standardised low-carbohydrate vegetarian dinner. On the next day before the beginning of the fast, the participants were given a 600\u00a0kcal (2510\u00a0kJ) vegetarian diet consisting of rice and vegetables divided in three meals. During fasting all subjects were asked to drink 2\u20133\u00a0litres of water or non-energy herbal teas on a daily basis. Additionally, all participants received a portion of 20\u00a0g honey. Furthermore, an organic freshly squeezed fruit juice (250\u00a0ml) was served at noon and a vegetable soup (250\u00a0ml) in the evening. On average, the total daily nutrient composition is described in Table 1. With the beginning of fasting the subjects entered a standardised programme of physical exercise alternating with rest. The exercise programme consisted of outdoor walks and gymnastic groups. The whole programme was supervised by certified trainers. To initiate the 10-d fasting period, the intestinal tract was emptied through the intake of a laxative (20\u201340\u00a0g NaSO4 in 500\u00a0ml water according to body weight). During the fasting period an enema (1\u00a0litre water at 37\u00b0C) was applied by a certified nurse every second day. This procedure, whose effects remains to be investigated in a clinical study, is assumed to remove intestinal remnants of the last meals, desquamated mucosal cells from the gastrointestinal walls and basal secretions both occurring during fasting. Based on clinical and empirical observations, it facilitates the transition to the fasting mode, leads quicker to the fasting-specific absence of hunger, and prevents common symptoms observed at the beginning of the fasting like headaches and fatigue. Although the safety of enemas is still debated, their use for more than 60 years at the BWC has never been linked to clinical complications. From the tenth day of fasting on, food was stepwise reintroduced during the following 4\u00a0d. The food consisted of an ovo-lacto-vegetarian organic diet with a progressive increase of energy from 3347 to 6694\u00a0kJ/d (800 to 1600\u00a0kcal/d) (Supplementary Table S3). The third faecal sample was obtained from the first defecation after refeeding, varying between the first and fourth refeeding day.\n",

However, the comparison of Bray\u2013Curtis distances revealed that the composition of the microbiota changed during the course of the intervention (Fig. 3(C)). Even if fasting had large effects on the gut microbiome composition, Bray\u2013Curtis distances of the samples for a given individual remained lower than distances across individuals, showing that gut microbiomes remained individualised even after fasting. We then used linear mixed models to identify the bacterial species which were the most affected (Fig. 3(D)). A total of thirty-one sequence variants had their abundances significantly changed by the intervention (Supplementary Table S1). There was an inversion of the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio (Fig. 3(D)). Bacteroidetes (40\u00b77\u00a0%) became the dominant taxa after the fasting period due to a large decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes (39\u00b79\u00a0%). This included bacteria known to degrade dietary plant polysaccharides such as the Lachnospiraceae family (Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, Lachnospira pectinoschiza, Coprococcus_2 eutactus, Pseudobutyrivibrio spp., Roseburia faecis) and from the Ruminococcaceae family (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus_1 bicirculans, Ruminococcus_2 bromii). There was a concomitant increase in Bacteroides abundance (Bacteroides nordii, Bacteroides fragilis) and in Proteobacteria abundances (E. coli, Bilophila wadsworthia). Following food reintroduction (days 10 to 14, from 3347 to 6694\u00a0kJ/d (800 to 1600\u00a0kcal/d)) the gut microbiota composition reflected a partial recovery (Fig. 3). After 3 months, subjects' gut microbiotas had returned to a basal level in comparison with the baseline established on the day of arrival at the clinic.",

In contrast, the levels of SCFA significantly increased 3 months after the fasting in comparison with pre-intervention levels.

Although our relatively small sample size only allowed us to draw limited conclusions, the bacterial species which were significantly associated with biochemical parameters were also the bacterial species mainly affected by fasting (Fig. 4). The abundance in Lachnospiraceae (Coprococcus_2 eutactus, Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, and Lachnospira pectinoschiza) was positively associated with plasma glucose levels and negatively associated with BCAA levels. By contrast, Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides dorei/fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron), as well as a Proteobacterium (Bilophila wadsworthia), presented the opposite trend and were negatively associated with plasma glucose levels and positively associated with BCAA levels.\n",

Here we document that periodic fasting in humans has major effects on biochemical markers such as blood lipids, glucoregulation, enhancement of emotional and physical well-being, and the faecal microbiota. We observed a major decrease in the relative abundance of the Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, concomitant to an increase in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. This profile correlates well with known effects of fasting in hibernating animals(17,18) and with daily cyclical fluctuations in the composition of the mouse gut microbiome according to feeding/fasting rhythms(35). When mice are eating, usually during the night, Firmicutes are proliferating and become the dominant phylum while Bacteroidetes rise during fasting (daytime).",

This reversibility in healthy subjects does not rule out the potential of this fasting protocol to change over the long term the gut microbiota composition of ill subjects. A large number of studies have indicated that unhealthy individuals tend to have a lack of microbial diversity in their gut(34). Since more diverse microbial environments are known to be more resilient(36), we hypothesise that the gut microbiome of unhealthy individuals with a loss of diversity may have a different resilience to the fasting intervention. Prolonged fasting is known to be an efficient therapy in humans to manage metabolic disorders like obesity or high blood pressure(37) and rheumatoid arthritis(38,39). Yet, the present study was performed on healthy subjects and further studies are therefore needed to determine the effects of fasting, and their persistence, on the gut microbiome of patients with specific disorders. Furthermore, fasting can be considered as a metabolic training switching from glucose to fat and ketose and back(7). Healthy subjects gain confidence that fasting is safe and may be used in the case of weight gain, metabolic disorders and other diseases which can be improved by periodic fasting as well as intermittent fasting. When used with a therapeutic goal a special focus is made on the maintenance phase fasting to consolidate the results. Our study lays the foundation for future studies to investigate the impact of fasting on the microbiota of ill persons and their relationship with metabolic and inflammatory mediators.",

During periodic Buchinger fasting, almost no nutrients are ingested and consequently absorbed by the small intestine. Therefore, a significant postprandial increase in gut permeability does not occur. This is reflected by the lack of changes in gut permeability markers in our study population in accordance with earlier data(40). However, effects of a periodic fasting on gut permeability may differ between healthy subjects and patients with metabolic disorders. In a previous study, a 4-week energy restriction (800\u00a0kcal/d (3347\u00a0kJ/d)) in twenty obese women reduced gut permeability(41). Additionally, the gut barrier protects the host from influx of bacterial components such as LPS, components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. A biomarker for the translocation of LPS is the LBP(41). In our cohort LBP decreased significantly during fasting, probably reflecting the decreased food intake. Interestingly, although we observed no changes of further inflammation markers during the fasting period, all inflammation markers, except for LPS increases significantly after food reintroduction. This suggests that food intake reactivated the postprandial immune response.",

                    "text": "In our cohort, we observed a decrease in blood leucocyte count. This was associated with an initial autophagy triggered by fasting, followed by the activation of bone marrow stem cells(42). The modulation of the immune response by fasting is also shown by the increase in faecal lysozyme during fasting and refeeding, indicating migration of leucocytes into the gut. This is corroborated by the increase in secretory IgA (sIgA), known for their protective action on the mucosal surface(43). An increase in sIgA levels was also demonstrated in a previous study after 17-d Buchinger fasting, and correlated with enhanced immune status(44). Changes in bacterial antigens are described in rheumatoid arthritis(45) concomitant to improvement of the symptoms associated with fasting(24). The association between E. coli and sIgA levels detected in our study suggests that the increase in sIgA levels during fasting is due to the increased abundance in bacteria causing an adaptive humoral local response. This is corroborated by recent studies which have shown that commensal Proteobacteria promote a T cell-dependent increase in serum IgA in mice, conferring protection against sepsis(46). In mice, intermittent fasting increases resistance to Salmonella infection(47). Since sIgA are known to be the principal eosinophil mediator at mucosal surfaces, causing eosinophil degranulation(48), we could hypothesise that the migration of leucocytes into the gut can also explain the increase in EDN levels during fasting. Altogether, general aspects of the communication between micro-organisms of the digestive tract and the immune system are well described(49).",

For instance, the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 strain can protect against the invasion by adherent-invasive E. coli B2 strains(52). It is thus not possible to definitely attribute beneficial or detrimental health effects to the increase in Proteobacteria abundance observed in our study since the method we used does not allow the determination of gut microbiome composition at the strain level. We recommend new investigations using shotgun metagenomics(53) Moreover, the absence of food intake and thus of digestive processes and absorption during fasting should be taken into consideration when evaluating possible health effects of a bacterial strain. The assessment of physical well-being and gastrointestinal symptomatic outcomes in another study did not indicate a pathological situation(4).",

The mechanisms underlying this mood enhancement might be similar to those by which physical exercise can induce beneficial responses in the brain, leading to improvements in the processes of learning and memory formation(54). A major contributor is the modulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels by the ketone 3-hydroxybutyrate, as shown on cultured cerebral cortical neurons via an effect on mitochondrial respiration(55). Increasing levels of BDNF levels are also linked to 5-hydroxytryptamine serum levels which are known to increase during fasting, and which thus provide an explanation for positive effects on mood(53). It could also be hypothesised that fasting-induced mood enhancement can be linked to changes in the gut microbiota composition. This hypothesis is corroborated by studies showing that the gut microbiota suppresses Bdnf expression in the hypothalamus in mice(56). Moreover, the administration of probiotics is a successful strategy to reduce anxiety and indicates that changes in microbiome profiles have a direct impact on mood(57). As far as well-being during fasting is concerned, additional scientific investigations are needed to understand the role of enemas in preventing symptoms which are often observed at the beginning of the fasting such as headaches and fatigue. Since enemas are known to affect gut microbiome composition(58), it will be important to separate the effects of the enema from the effects of fasting in future studies. Furthermore, an interesting question is whether the observed well-being-enhancing effect of fasting is mainly due to the assumed ability of an enema to remove intestinal remnants, desquamated mucosal cells and fasting basal secretions from the gut or if it results from an effect of the enema on gut microbiota composition.",

                    "text": "The gut microbiota may also contribute to weight loss. In our study, the taxonomic group which was most affected by the reduction of nutrient supply was Lachnospiraceae, which is a bacterial family known to have the highest energy-harvesting properties(59,60). Studies demonstrated that a 20\u00a0% increase in Firmicutes (i.e. Lachnospiraceae) was associated with an increased energy harvest of about 150\u00a0kcal (628\u00a0kJ)(61). Since the intrinsic production of energy from the Firmicutes comes in addition to the general energy intake, it can be hypothesised that shutting down Lachnospiraceae-mediated increase of energy uptake had an influence on the weight decrease measured in this study. This is corroborated by the association between Lachnospiraceae abundance and glucose levels. The micro-organisms inhabiting the human gastrointestinal tract have the ability to ferment indigestible complex carbohydrates and produce energy substrates such as SCFA which are then taken up by the host. Up to 5 to 10\u00a0% of human energy requirements are covered by SCFA(62). In general, SCFA concentrations remained stable during fasting which is surprising since they are mainly produced by fermentation of dietary fibres(63). Furthermore, an increase in SCFA levels was noticed 3 months after the intervention. Whether this is a consequence of the gut microbiota structural changes due to fasting or a change in dietary habits must be confirmed. Food protocols documented an increase in fibre intake 3 months after fasting (Supplementary Table S2).",

The species which have their levels increased during fasting in our study are also those species known to have the highest proteolytic activity in the gut microbiota(64). The clinical significance of this switch in gut microbiome metabolism is unclear. Experiments in mice showed that the gut microbiome starts feeding on host mucins and degrade the colonic mucus barrier when it is deprived of dietary fibres(65). Little is known about the fate of the mucus barrier during fasting in humans. Starved broilers (also deprived of water) have a thinner mucus adherent layer throughout the small intestine(66). However, this might not reflect physiology during prolonged fasting since the gut is known to undertake substantial structural changes(11). It should also be taken into account that the microbial density is severely reduced during fasting. During hibernation, microbial density decreases by 93\u00b77\u00a0% in the caecum of hamsters(15). This cannot be evaluated in our study because the sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons is not quantitative, and because faecal microbiota is not fully reflecting the intestinal microbiota.",
