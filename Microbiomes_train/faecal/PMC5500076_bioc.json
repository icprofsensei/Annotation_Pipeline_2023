This study analyses the fecal microbiome through treatment in newly diagnosed PIBD patients and compares to cohabiting siblings where possible. Patients were recruited on clinical suspicion of PIBD before diagnosis. Treatment-na\u00efve fecal samples were collected, with further samples at 2 and 6 weeks into treatment. Samples underwent 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) gene sequencing and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis, results were analyzed using quantitative-insights-into-microbial-ecology. Six PIBD patients were included in the cohort: 4 Crohn disease (CD), 1 ulcerative colitis (UC), 1 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) unclassified, and median age 12.6 (range 10\u201315.1 years); 3 patients had an unaffected healthy sibling recruited. Microbial diversity (observed species/Chao1/Shannon diversity) was reduced in treatment-na\u00efve patients compared to siblings and patients in remission. Principal coordinate analysis using Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity and UniFrac revealed microbial shifts in CD over the treatment course. In treatment-na\u00efve PIBD, there was reduction in functional ability for amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate handling compared to controls (P\u200a=\u200a.038) and patients in remission (P\u200a=\u200a.027). Metabolic function returned to normal after remission was achieved. SCFA revealed consistent detection of lactate in treatment-na\u00efve samples. This study adds in-depth 16S rRNA sequencing analysis on a small longitudinal cohort to the literature and includes sibling controls and patients with UC/IBD unclassified. It highlights the initial dysbiosis, reduced diversity, altered functional potential, and subsequent shifts in bacteria from diagnosis over time to remission.",

Previous work has suggested a role for specific SCFA as anti-inflammatory agents within the bowel.[26,27] The most common metabolic products of anaerobic bacteria are acetate, propionate and butyrate and these have been suggested to impact on the interaction that the immune system has with bacteria producing these SCFAs, with the overall effect of reducing inflammation through reduction of chemokine production and adhesion molecule expression.[27] The predominant SCFAs in our samples were acetate, propionate and butyrate, including in controls. The relative concentrations of these SCFA over time did not show a consistent pattern with some patients seeing increases and some seeing decreases in both overall and relative concentrations. High concentrations of lactate, which has been implicated in UC were observed in the pretreatment samples for this patient only.[28] It is worth noting that SCFA detection in fecal samples is affected by both production and absorption of SCFAs in the large intestine. During disease remission the intestinal epithelial surface is less inflamed and may absorb more SCFA, so the absence of detectable changes in concentrations may not necessarily mean that bacterial fermentation has not changed.",

Interestingly, children treated with steroids also showed increased diversity from treatment to remission, with a peak in diversity at 6 weeks. The reasons behind this are unclear. There were 3 patients treated with antibiotics in the 2 months before recruitment (patients 2, 4, and 5); antibiotics are known have a significant impact on intestinal bacteria and may amplify intestinal dysbiosis in some cases.[8,31]",

The main limitation is the small patient number and heterogeneity of the population. Despite this, we present detailed analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing data to a level not previously described in patients followed across time during treatment. There is little published data on the microbiome in Ulcerative Colitis or IBDU, Gevers et al[8] included a small number of UC patients in their extended PCoA analysis in 2014 without obvious trends. Here we demonstrate a single patient with IBDU over time, whose microbiome appears to behave differently to patients with CD and UC in this study. The PCoA shift for the patient with UC resembles CD; whilst a previous study indicated substantial dysbiosis in fecal samples from children with severe colitis there have been no longitudinal studies of UC to date.[10]",

The inclusion of sibling controls helps to address differences that may be diet related. It highlights the initial dysbiosis, reduced diversity with dominance of single bacterial genera, and subsequent shifts in bacteria from before diagnosis over time to remission. Further characterization of the SCFA composition of feces would aid understanding of the roles SCFA may play in intestinal inflammation and microbe\u2013host interaction. The functional ability of bacteria at presentation is significantly reduced in several key pathways; however, this returns to normal when remission is achieved, echoing previous findings targeting the mucosal microbiota. Further longitudinal studies on larger pediatric cohorts is required within this area.",
