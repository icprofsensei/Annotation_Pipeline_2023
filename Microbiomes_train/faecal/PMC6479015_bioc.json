Bacterial diversity also varied among cohorts. For example, Shannon diversity was higher in feces from Kenya than Ghana and US-California, and higher in rural Ethiopian than Ghana, Peru, Spain, Sweden, and US-California.

Bacterial communities appeared to be somewhat unique for each woman, although 9 \u201ccore\u201d genera were common all samples. Since the publication of this paper, additional studies have suggested that the primary bacterial taxa in milk vary across populations (Supplementary Table 1). For example, Cabrera-Rubio et al. (8) found that Leuconostoc, Weisella, and Lactococcus were the most predominant genera in milk produced by women living in Finland (n = 18), while Dav\u00e9 et al. (9) reported Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Xanthomonadaceae, and Sediminibacterium were the most abundant taxa in milk produced by Mexican-American mothers (n = 10). In Chinese and Taiwanese women (n = 133), family-level analysis revealed Streptococcaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Staphylococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae as the most abundant taxa (10). Other reports suggest additional differences among populations (11\u201316), although some similarities are notable, such as the dominance of members of the Streptococcaceae and Staphylococcaceae families. It is unknown, however, if this variation is due to genuine differences among populations, differences in location of milk collection (e.g., hospital vs. home), or differences in sample collection methods, storage, processing, and analyses. This is a persistent problem in microbiome research and can only be solved with rigorously controlled studies of representative cohorts of women from diverse populations, including standardized milk collection protocols.",

(17) investigated the influence of geographic location on the milk microbiome by collecting and analyzing milk produced by 80 healthy women (20 each from Spain, Finland, South Africa, and China) at 1 mo postpartum. Substantial differences were found among cohorts, and variation was related to a variety of factors, such as delivery mode. For example, milk produced by Chinese women contained relatively more Streptococcus than milk produced by women in all other cohorts, while milk produced by Spanish women had relatively more Propionibacterium and Pseudomonas than that produced in other locations. This study also demonstrated that milk produced by Spanish and South African women was characterized by relatively higher proportion of bacterial genes involved in lipid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism than that of Finnish women. As such, not only do there appear to be genuine compositional differences in the milk microbiome around the world, but there may also be differences in microbial function.",

                    "text": "Similarly, a substantial and growing literature exists regarding the human fecal microbiome during infancy [for example, (2, 18\u201322)]. These studies also report differences across global populations. For instance, in a study of 6-mo-old Malawian and Finnish infants, Bifidobacterium was the most common genus despite other distinct population differences such as a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes-Prevotella and Clostridium histolyticum in the Malawian infants (23). Murphy et al. (12) found that Staphylococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, and Veillonella were the most abundant microbial genera in infant feces in Ireland. This contrasts with some earlier work. For example, Backh\u00ebd et al. (20) reported that at 4 mo, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Collinsella, Granulicatella, and Veillonella dominated microbial communities in feces of vaginally delivered infants in Sweden, while Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, and Bacteroidetes dominated feces of infants born via cesarean section in the same location. (24) also reported a high relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in feces of Gambian infants over the first 6 mo of life, followed by Streptococcus and members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The common taxa in many of these results suggest that there may be some shared patterns in the bacterial community in infant feces (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Bacteroidetes as the most abundant genera across cohorts). However, it remains unclear whether these commonalities and differences are genuine or are simply due to methodological differences. True differences, as opposed to biases introduced by varying methodology, might indicate that microbial communities are shaped (at least in part) by some combination of genetics, environment, and behavior, and that there may not be a universal or \u201cnormal\u201d infant fecal microbiome representative of health or disease.",

Our hypotheses were that: (1) human milk and infant fecal microbiomes vary among cohorts representing populations from selected geographical regions; (2) there exists a \u201ccore\u201d group of bacteria common to milk across cohorts; (3) there exists a \u201ccore\u201d group of bacteria common to infant feces across cohorts; (4) variation in the milk microbiome is related to variation in the infant fecal microbiome; and (5) milk and fecal microbiomes of mothers and their own infants are more similar to each other than to maternal/infant dyads in other cohorts. Relationships of milk and fecal microbiomes with other important factors such as delivery mode, other milk components, maternal and infant diets, and household composition and childcare parameters will be addressed in subsequent publications.",

Sequence reads without a corresponding barcode and primer sequence were discarded. Sequence reads were also trimmed of their primer sequence. Reads were split into separate sample R1 and R2 files using a custom python script (splitReadsBySample.py; https://github.com/msettles/dbcAmplicons/blob/master/scripts/python/splitReadsBySample.py). Sequence reads were evaluated for quality, trimmed, and filtered using the DADA2 sequence process pipeline (version 1.2.2; (31)). The output from DADA2 infers amplicon sequence variants (ASV) after modeling the errors from a subset of reads (1 \u00d7 106) from the sequencing run. Each MiSeq run was analyzed separately for error estimation. Briefly, sequence reads were truncated to 270 bases with a maxEE setting of 4. Reads were also truncated if the base call reached Q2. Reads with < 270 bases were discarded. Because of loss of reads and little overlap between forward and reverse reads following quality filtering and trimming, only forward reads were used in subsequent analyses. ASV were then assigned taxonomies using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Bayesian classifier (32) and the SILVA 16S rRNA database version 123 formatted for DADA2 (33\u201335). Relative abundances of bacterial taxa at various taxonomic levels were calculated from sequence read count data in R (version 3.4.1) using the phyloseq package (36).",

For example, Spanish women were older than women in ETR, ETU, GBR, GBU, GN, KE, PE, and USW (P \u2264 0.0017); women in SW were breastfeeding younger infants than women in ETR, KE, SP, and USW (P \u2264 0.0328); and there were fewer vaginally-delivered infants in PE than in ETR, ETU, GBR, GBU, GN, and SP (P < 0.0001). Women in GBR and ETR had a higher parity than women in all cohorts except GBU and KE (P = 0.0411). Maternal BMI was higher in women from PE and USC than women from all African cohorts and SP (P \u2264 0.0113), and women in SW were taller than women in ETR, ETU, GBR, GN, KE, PE, and USC (P \u2264 0.0174). In addition, exclusive breastfeeding was more common in ETR, ETU, and GBR than in GN, KE, and PE (P \u2264 0.0052). Kenyan infants were heavier than infants in GBR, GBU, GN, SP, SW, and USW (P \u2264 0.0231); accordingly, infants in KE had a higher weight-for-length z-score than infants in ETR, ETU, GBU, GN, SP, SW, and USW (P \u2264 0.0157), though notably, the average z-score for all cohorts was within the normal range (-2 < z < 2).",

There was a statistical effect of cohort on 8 of the 28 aggregate genera, 7 of which were among the most abundant taxa (Table 2). Differences between cohorts varied by genera. For example, feces from GN, SP, SW, USC, and USW had lower relative abundance of Streptococcus than feces from GBR and GBU (P \u2264 0.0012). Feces from infants in USW had lower relative abundance of Escherichia/Shigella than those in ETU and PE (P \u2264 0.0399). Feces from infants in GN had a lower relative abundance of Veillonella than infants in ETR, GBR, KE, PE, and SP (P \u2264 0.0105). Conversely, GN infants' feces contained relatively more Bifidobacterium than feces from ETR, PE, and USC infants (P \u2264 0.0310). Relative abundance of Bacteroides was higher in feces from infants in USW than GBR, GBU, and KE (P \u2264 0.0403). Feces from infants in the two rural populations (ETR and GBR) had higher relative abundance of Lactobacillus than feces from PE, SP, SW, USC, and USW (P \u2264 0.0122). Relative abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 was higher in SW than GBU (P = 0.0350), and feces from infants in GN had a higher relative abundance of Enterococcus than feces from infants in ETR, ETU, GBR, KE, PE, USC, and USW (P \u2264 0.0347).

Of the 29 genera evaluated, ANOVA indicated that there was an effect of cohort on 19 of them (Table 5). Examples of differences among cohorts include a higher relative abundance of Rhizobium, Achromobacter, and Psychrobacter in milk collected in ETR than all other cohorts (P < 0.0001). Except for ETU, milk collected in ETR also had a higher relative abundance of Corynebacterium 1 than all other cohorts (P \u2264 0.0417). Peruvian milk bacterial communities, on average, were comprised of 50% Streptococcus, which was relatively higher than all African (ETR, ETU, GBR, GBU, GN, and KE) and US (USW and USC) samples (P \u2264 0.0386). Milk from women in USW had relatively more Dyella than all sites except The Gambia (GBR and GBU) (P \u2264 0.0040).",

PE and SP were relatively similar, characterized by high relative abundance of Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Rothia, and low abundance of Corynebacterium 1. It is noteworthy that ETR formed an outgroup characterized by relatively high abundance of Rhizobium and Achromobacter; intermediate abundances of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus; and very little Propionibacterium, Dyella, and Rothia. Samples from GN also formed a unique clade with relatively high levels of Lactobacillus, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus.",

When plotted by cohort, the relationships among the infant fecal and milk taxa appear to be specific to cohort; for example, the relationship (using the first canonical component) between milk and infant fecal microbiomes was strong in PE but diminished in SW. Correlations between milk and infant fecal diversity indices did not reveal significant correlations in any cohort except for KE where richness and Fisher diversity of infant feces and milk were positively correlated with each other (r = 0.31, P = 0.0453; Supplementary Table 4).",

Our hypothesis that fecal microbiomes of infants and the milk microbiomes of their mothers would be more similar within a cohort than to other cohorts was also supported, though the variation among both women and infants within a cohort was only slightly less than the variation among cohorts. This individual variation should be noted, because it is possible that milk and infant fecal microbiomes are tailored to a given environment. Additionally, the possibility exists that both the membership and structure of milk and fecal microbial communities may also be tailored to lifestyle and behavioral factors associated with individual maternal/infant dyads (16, 46, 47). For this reason, these results highlight the need for additional work comparing populations of women and infants globally if we are ever to understand whether a \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d human milk or infant fecal microbiome exists.",

However, due to the high level of individual microbial variation present among these samples, even within a cohort, these data may not be representative of neighboring populations or countries. Indeed, Meehan et al. (16) determined that among foragers and horticulturalist women in the Central African Republic who spend considerable time in in proximity to each other, milk microbial communities vary significantly both within populations and between ethnic groups. In the present study, even though Kenya and Ethiopia are geographical neighbors, substantial differences in microbial communities existed. For example, Veillonella and Lactobacillus were members of the core fecal genera in KE and ETR, but not ETU. Bacterial richness in feces from KE was greater than that from ETU, while diversity of milk from ETR and ETU were generally similar to that of KE. Additionally, milk collected from women in ETR contained relatively more Achromobacter and Rhizobium than all other sites. While these differences are not comprehensive among these cohorts, these examples illustrate that even in close geographical proximity (KE to ETR and ETU) and with genetic similarity (ETR and ETU, and GBR and GBU), there are substantial differences between milk and infant fecal microbial community structures that cannot be ignored, particularly in the framework of recommendations for healthy breastfeeding women/breastfed infants.",

For example, Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, and the family Enterobacteriacae, which includes both Enterobacter and Escherichia/Shigella, were previously reported to be the most abundant taxa in feces from Gambian infants (24). Our data show that infant feces from Gambian infants also contain substantial amounts of Lactobacillus and Veillonella. Consistent with our results, Backh\u00ebd et al. (20) found Bacteroides, Bifidobacteria, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Enterobacteriacae to be abundant in feces of Swedish infants.",

However, RNAlater may introduce biases, such as an increased observation of members of the Bacteroidetes phylum, and a decrease in the members of Actinobacteria relative to unpreserved control samples; this bias has been demonstrated in soil samples and fecal samples (51\u201355). Despite this methodological difference, feces collected in ETR\u2014at least with respect to phyla and the most abundant genera\u2014were similar to those collected at its closest neighboring site, ETU. However, there were differences with respect to the core taxa, and samples from ETU formed a cluster with feces from KE and PE, while ETR was an outgroup in this clade. Further work will be needed to determine if the use of RNAlater does or does not influence bacterial communities identified in infant fecal samples collected across various cohorts.",

(17) reported that relative abundance of Proteobacteria was highest in milk produced by women in South Africa; that produced by Finnish women was highest in Firmicutes; that of Chinese women had the highest Streptococcus; and that produced by Spanish women had the highest Propionibacterium and Pseudomonas. In our study, milk produced in ETR had the most Proteobacteria and Rhizobium, whereas that produced in PE had the highest level of Firmicutes, and that produced in SP the highest Propionibacterium. Despite these differences, most of the dominant taxa present in the study of Kumar and colleagues were also well represented in our study. Nonetheless, it remains unclear as to whether the differences in relative abundance between our present study and that of Kumar are genuine or due to methodologic differences. For example, Kumar and colleagues used the same sequencing platform, but chose primers targeting the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, whereas our primers targeted the V1\u2013V3 region. In this case, we also were only able to use the forward read, which could have been a source of bias in elucidating the microbial genera present.",

Unlike all the others which were frozen upon collection, these samples were chemically preserved. The use of chemical preservatives at this site was necessary because freezing the samples was logistically difficult. While Milk Preservation Solution performed well (as compared to other preservatives) in a test of utility in preserving bacterial DNA for microbial analysis (28), the methods used for extracting the ETR samples are different than those employed on all other milk samples in this study. For this reason, results from ETR should be interpreted cautiously. For example, one notable difference we found was the high richness and diversity in the ETR milk samples as compared to the other sites. While this could be biologically relevant, this also could be an artifact of the method used for these samples.",

Whether milk's microbiome and nutrient compositions are related has not been studied, although data from our group clearly suggests that maternal nutrient intake (which can be related to milk's nutrient composition) is related to milk microbiome (56). One example particularly relevant to the data presented here is related to human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), which vary across populations\u2014including those reported here (26, 57). Because HMO can act as prebiotics, it is possible that variation in HMO profiles might drive variation in both milk and infant fecal microbiomes. This possibility will be explored thoroughly in subsequent publications. We have also analyzed the milk samples described in this report for their complex immune factor profiles, which also vary (25); as with HMO, subsequent publications will evaluate potential relationships among milk's immune factors, the milk microbiome, and the infant fecal microbiome. While the etiology of these population-level differences has not been completely elucidated, the potential importance of these multi-faceted differences in shaping milk's microbial communities should continue to be evaluated.",

For example, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in milk was positively correlated with the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in infant feces. Given the fact that this genus was also determined to be the primary factor that distinguished the first and second canonical axes in our multivariate correlation analyses, it is plausible that human milk may be an important source of Lactobacillus for the developing infant's GI tract, as has been demonstrated through culture-dependent analyses (3\u20135). Future work focusing on the species and strains of Lactobacillus at both body sites is needed to understand these complex communities. Our data support a handful of studies published previously on this topic. For example, Murphy et al. (12) collected milk and infant fecal samples from 10 mother-infant pairs at 1, 3, 6, and 12 wk postpartum. Approximately 70\u201388% of the genera identified in infant feces were also identified in human milk. The most abundant genera in infant feces were Streptococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Bifidobacterium, and Veillonella, which were the 4 most abundant genera in infant fecal samples in our study. Murphy and colleagues also observed that human milk bacterial communities exhibited greater diversity than infant fecal bacterial communities collected at the same time. With the exception of GN, more taxa were identified in milk than infant feces here as well. However, except for KE where bacterial richness of infant feces was positively correlated with that of milk, we found no correlations between the richness of milk and richness of infant feces in the populations we studied.",

                    "text": "There are several important limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings reported here. As previously discussed, we chemically preserved samples collected only in ETR. In addition, for practical and logistic reasons, we also used a combination of methods for collecting the milk (electric pump vs. hand expression). The impact of these methodological differences on milk's microbial composition is unknown. Additionally, limited cohort sample sizes (particularly with respect to USC), restricts the ability to conduct some statistical analyses. Furthermore, because this study is the first of its kind to this scale, we do not know if our results are comparable to other studies on milk and fecal microbial compositions, particularly as it relates to methodological differences. For example, some genera, such as Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, and Coprococcus, are present in higher relative abundances when mechanical lysis (via bead-beating) is used (58) due to the difficulty in cell membrane disruption for these taxa. It is important to note that characterization and analyses of the bacteria at a level lower than their genera here were not performed. Future studies should evaluate these communities at the species (and perhaps sub-species) level. The selection of a hypervariable region to target for 16S rRNA analysis is also a source of potential bias in our study (59). We chose V1\u2013V3 because it has been previously used in our laboratory to categorize and classify the bacterial community structure of both milk and infant feces (16, 30, 56). However, future studies should be designed to determine if this hypervariable region is optimal for this application. Additionally, one important limitation to 16S-based sequencing techniques is the inability to distinguish live bacteria from dead bacteria or residual bacterial DNA that may be present in a sample. As more is understood about the microbial communities in various populations globally and at various body sites, more targeted, culture- or RNA-based approaches can be used in conjunction with 16S sequencing to more thoroughly address these questions of live contributors to the milk and infant fecal microbiomes.",

Data from this study clearly indicate that what is \u201cnormal\u201d in terms of milk and fecal microbiomes of healthy breastfeeding mothers and their infants, respectively, varies around the world. In addition, we provide compelling evidence that the milk microbiome might, at least in part, play a role in shaping the infant's GI microbiome. It is likely that there are many additional factors that play into these findings, such as antibiotic usage, infant age, parity, infant sex, and exclusive breastfeeding status. These factors are likely important to understanding what are normal for milk and infant fecal microbial community structures. The goal of the current study was to present the microbial communities across a broad range of populations, and subsequent studies will focus on parsing the relationships among these factors and the milk and infant fecal microbiomes. For these findings to have impact, however, researchers must strive to better understand the genesis of microbial differences within and among cohorts, and if this variation is related to maternal and infant health.",

Substantial differences in both the composition and relative abundance of specific taxa were present among cohorts. We also found substantial variation among women/infants within a cohort, suggesting that environment alone does not drive variation in milk and fecal microbial community structure. Additionally, relationships present among the genera in milk and the genera in infant feces which vary among cohorts suggest that milk may be tailored not only to infants in a given environment, but also specifically to the needs of individuals. As such, we conclude that what is \u201cnormal\u201d in terms of the fecal microbiome of healthy infants and milk microbiome of healthy lactating women varies by culture and/or location. Further, we posit that bacterial compositions of human milk and feces of breastfed infants are likely specific to a dyad within a culture and location. Future studies should evaluate the bacterial species and sub-species encompassed in these genera, their functionality, and whether or not variation is related to maternal and infant health.",
