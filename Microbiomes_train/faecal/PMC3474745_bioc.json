                    "text": "Natural environments represent an incredible source of microbial genetic diversity. Discovery of novel biomolecules involves biotechnological methods that often require the design and implementation of biochemical assays to screen clone libraries. However, when an assay is applied to thousands of clones, one may eventually end up with very few positive clones which, in most of the cases, have to be \u201cdomesticated\u201d for downstream characterization and application, and this makes screening both laborious and expensive. The negative clones, which are not considered by the selected assay, may also have biotechnological potential; however, unfortunately they would remain unexplored. Knowledge of the clone sequences provides important clues about potential biotechnological application of the clones in the library; however, the sequencing of clones one-by-one would be very time-consuming and expensive. In this study, we characterized the first metagenomic clone library from the feces of a healthy human volunteer, using a method based on 454 pyrosequencing coupled with a clone-by-clone Sanger end-sequencing. Instead of whole individual clone sequencing, we sequenced 358 clones in a pool. The medium-large insert (7\u201315 kb) cloning strategy allowed us to assemble these clones correctly, and to assign the clone ends to maintain the link between the position of a living clone in the library and the annotated contig from the 454 assembly. Finally, we found several open reading frames (ORFs) with previously described potential medical application. The proposed approach allows planning ad-hoc biochemical assays for the clones of interest, and the appropriate sub-cloning strategy for gene expression in suitable vectors/hosts.",

The majority of anti-microbial or anti-cancer drugs have a natural origin [3] and the most disparate environments (sea water, extreme environments, soil) have been studied by metagenomic approaches [4]\u2013[6]. Such studies have led to the discovery of many novel biocatalysts such as lipases or esterases [7]\u2013[10], cellulases [11], [12], chitinases [13], DNA polymerases [14], proteases [15], and a wide range of antibiotics [16]. Symbiotic metagenomes are also promising when it comes to seeking molecules with medical applications given their connection to the healthy status of hosts [17]. Despite this fact, to date no metagenomic library from human symbiotic ecosystems has been screened for novel biomolecules.",

Small-insert libraries (plasmid vectors) are employed to identify bioproducts encoded by a single gene or a small operon. Large-insert libraries (cosmid vectors or bacterial artificial chromosomes) can be used to isolate larger gene clusters, which could encode for complete pathways [1], [4]. One of the possible screening methods is functional-based screening, in which a given metagenomic library is tested against a wide spectra of screening assays, aiming to identify clones possessing interesting features. Sequence-based screening involves the selection of positive clones for a PCR reaction specifically designed for a gene of interest. A third possible method is substrate-induced gene-expression screening (SIGEX), which has been successfully applied to select clones whose expression is induced by a given substrate [19]. However, in spite of the efforts to screen for natural bioproducts, both discovery rate and application have dramatically declined [20].",

A proposed gene therapy is based on the strategy that a non-mammalian gene encoding a certain enzyme is transduced in tumor cells and its expression catalyses the activation of a pro-drug to a cytotoxin that induces tumor cell death [50]. A cytosine deaminase-uracil phosphoribosyltransferase fusion gene has been used in clinical gene therapy trials to improve strong chemotherapeutic agents, in which 5-fluorouracil is catalyzed by cellular enzymes to fluoronucleotides, subsequently inhibiting DNA or RNA synthesis [51]\u2013[53]. Uridine kinase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase are enzymes catalyzing the formation of uridine 5\u2032-monophosphate from uridine and adenine 5\u2032-triphosphate and from uracil and phosphoribosyl-\u03b1-l-pyrophosphate in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, respectively [54]. Uracil phosphoribosyltransferase was also successfully applied in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection where ribavirin (1-b-D-ribofuranosyl-1, 2, 4-triazole), a synthetic nucleoside analog, is currently used in combination with interferon-\u03b1 or peginterferon-\u03b1 [55]. In HCV infection, because the vast majority of replication occurs in hepatocytes, selective delivery of ribavirin into those liver cells would be desirable to enhance antiviral activity and also avoid systemic side effects. In 2008, VirovicJukic showed that human uridine-kytidine kinase-1 recognizes ribavirin and phosphorylates it [56]. Introducing a phosphate group in ribavirin facilitates the preparation of a novel protein conjugate of ribavirin, which has the potential for targeted delivery to specific cell types.",

Greater knowledge of the interactions between humans and their gut bacteria may open up new hypothetical therapeutic approaches based on gene therapy for neurological diseases. For example, we found an ORF in contig 7H8 (Figure 2, panel e) annotated as spermine synthase (HMMPfam) or spermidine synthase (KAAS KEGG). Spermidine synthase converts putrescine into spermidine, and spermine synthase converts spermidine into spermine [67]. Spermine deficiency in human causes the Snyder-Robinson syndrome, an X-linked mental retardation disorder [68]. Wang (2004) suggested that attempts to increase spermine by dietary manipulation, drug treatment or gene therapy may be successful in preventing the Snyder-Robinson syndrome [69].",

Only around half of the patients with CBS deficiency respond to pyridoxine therapy [71]; thus, gene therapy might be an alternative for those that do not respond to this treatment. Oh and collaborators (2004) used three kinds of human CBS cDNA to construct vectors for gene therapy, demonstrating positive effects on homocystinuria affected mice [72]. In our clone library, the ORF 16 of contig GZINT was annotated as cystathionine \u03b2-synthase and ORF 19 as cystathionine \u03b3-synthase (Figure 2, panel f).",

They can also be used to study proteins of unknown function. The screening of a clone library with inserts of 7\u201315 Kb by 454 pyrosequencing enabled us to obtain the annotation information of the genes present in each clone without the need of prior and expensive ad hoc biochemical screening. The approach used in this paper started by analyzing 358 clones and ended up with 316 assembled and annotated contigs. The proposed method is perfectly scalable enabling work to tackle larger clone libraries, proportionally increasing sequencing efforts. This strategy enables the link to be maintained between the information and the living clones, providing annotation of the whole library; thus, particular clones of interest can undergo further testing by the most appropriate biochemical assay and/or sub-cloning for appropriate selection of vectors and/or host, if required.",
