To understand the extent of loss during and after diarrhoea, faecal samples collected from children (n=21) suffering from acute diarrhoea and from their healthy siblings (n=9) were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene-targeted universal primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The gut microbiota decreased significantly as indicated by the number of TTGE bands at day 0 of acute diarrhoea [patients vs healthy siblings: 11\u00b10.9 vs 21.8\u00b11.1 (mean\u00b1standard error), p<0.01]. The number of bands showed a steady increase from day 1 to day 7; however, it remained significantly less than that in healthy siblings (15\u00b10.9, p<0.01). These results suggest that appropriate therapeutic and post-diarrhoeal nutritional intervention might be beneficial for the early microbial restoration and recovery.",

The gut habitat is highly anoxic, and anaerobic bacteria outnumber the aerobic bacteria by a factor between 103 and 105 (1). Evidence suggests that these commensal microorganisms have important metabolic roles, trophic functions, and protective effects. Moreover, these microbiota exhibit a series of important enzyme activities (2). During the onset of diarrhoea, the anaerobic environment is disrupted due to the high rate of purging, and the commensal microbiota are expelled and replaced by aerobic and pathogenic bacteria. Previous studies have examined the gastrointestinal microbiota in acute cholera (3,4) and in acute diarrhoea cases (5-7), using conventional culture techniques, microscopy, and biochemical tests, showing that the faecal anaerobic bacteria were significantly reduced in number during acute disease leading to aerobic bacteria to increase several folds. The major anaerobic bacterial group, including Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, was found 3-4 times lower in acute cholera and diarrhoea patients. Therefore, the restoration of appropriate commensal gut microbiota, which is the key to recovery following acute diarrhoea, is very important.",

Besides, due to the complex nutritional requirements and lack of beneficial effects that they receive from complex host-microbe and microbe-microbe interaction, recent estimates of culturability of bacteria range from only 15% to 58% in the laboratory even when excellent bacteriological culture methods are used (8,9). The metagenomic technique such as temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) is an excellent new tool for the analysis of the gut microbiota diversity without depending on the culture method. In TTGE, the variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene are amplified using universal primer PCR, and the amplified DNAs are then separated based on sequence specificity to determine the microbial diversity in the human gut (10-12). Currently, the molecular techniques are being commonly employed to determine the community dynamics in the diverse ecosystems, such as biofilms (13), soils (14), ocean depths (15), hot springs (16), fermented foods (17), and the gut of humans and other animals (18,19).",

The designing of an appropriate therapeutic intervention involves a clear understanding of the composition of microbiota and their metabolic functions in the gut. In acute diarrhoea, the gut of patients is washed out due to purging and frequent loss of loose stools. As a result, the gut commensal microbiota are likely to be less abundant than those of age-matched healthy children. The aim of the study was to analyze faecal samples of children to determine the extent of loss of gut bacteria during acute diarrhoea and convalescence, using a culture-independent molecular tool\u2014TTGE.",

The previously-described analysis is based on the method of Deplancke et al. who developed the original strategy (21). Comparisons of TTGE profiles were performed using the Dice similarity coefficient (Dsc) based entirely on results of band classification (22). The Dsc values were compared based on the presence or absence of bands. The Dice coefficient is defined as follows: Dsc=[2j/(a+b)]x100, where j is the number of common bands between sample A and B, and a and b are the total numbers of bands in sample A and B respectively. Consequently, the distance between two TTGE profiles was calculated as follows: Distance=100-Dsc. The coefficient ranged from 0 (no common bands) to 100 (identical band patterns).",

Second, the distance between two consecutive samples was calculated between day 0 and day 1, day 1 and day 2, and so on. The mean values of these distances were analyzed to obtain a general picture of the faecal microbiota re-colonization in children with diarrhoea. In the first set of analyses, the TTGE profiles of the patients with acute diarrhoea were compared with the recovering stages (i.e. day 1, day 2, day 3, and day 7), and the average distances were calculated representing the succession of faecal microbiota over these time periods (Fig. 2). In the second set of analyses, the average distances between two consecutive samples were compared to determine the speed of faecal microbiota evolution. The distances in the first analyses were high, indicating that the microbiota were still evolving, and the microbiota profile in the recovery phase was different from that when the patient was experiencing acute diarrhoea. Since the distances in the second comparison (distances between consecutive days) were not very high, these indicate that microbiota during the recovery period were evolving speedily in children leading to a stable microbiota profile.",

Although antimicrobials exert a beneficial effect by eliminating pathogenic agents, thereby controlling infections, the oral administration of antimicrobial agents often causes a shift in the intestinal microbial populations, with a decrease in anaerobic bacteria and a concomitant increase in aerobic bacteria (25,26). In the present study, the bacterial diversity in diarrhoea patients, as reflected by the number of different TTGE bands, did not change significantly even after 24 hours of the initiation of antibiotic therapy. However, when the distance values between day 0 and day 1 were analyzed, significant alterations in the bacterial species pattern were observed, suggesting that the antibiotic therapy might have helped the resistant community to selectively flourish at the same time eliminating those microbiota that were sensitive to the drug used, although such shifting was not corroborated in the overall microbiota diversity in the gut as observed at day 0 and day 1.",

The high inter-individual variation in the banding patterns that we observed at day 0 may presumably be due to the differences in their living conditions, health and immune status, and the genetic make-up. However, the band number at day 0 (acute diarrhoea) was enumerated and considered the baseline, and the changes occurring over time in the following days were taken into account as variation. Although a dominant band (bands parallel to E. coli in the reference lane) reflecting selective proliferation of a particular species was observed during day 1-3, the overall TTGE profiles for the antibiotic therapy period were more or less static, except that the banding positions were not consistent for every patient that we tested. By contrast, this pattern changed again when the antibiotic therapy ended, and a significant bacterial diversity in terms of numbers and positioning of the dominant bands was observed at day 7. One possible reason for this observation could be that fewer bacterial species could have proliferated in the presence of antibiotics during the clinical period when the sensitive population must have been eliminated/suppressed. This supposition is supported by results of a recent culture-based study in which administration of ampicillin to humans was shown to induce \u03b2-lactamase production by various intestinal microorganisms, including Enterobacteriaceae and some members of the Bacteroides fragilis group, which allowed simultaneous multiplication of some otherwise ampicillin-sensitive bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile (27,28).",

These differences in the numbers of bands were in agreement with the values published in an earlier study (29) which analyzed the influence of host genetics on the predominant bacteria in the faecal microbiota of identical twins, fraternal twins, and unrelated pairs, aged four months to 10 years, showing that the numbers of TTGE bands varied from 8 to 28. The data of the present study may be further substantiated by results of another study in which non-cholera control subjects aged 24-32 months possessed TTGE bands that varied from 20 to 24, showing that these values were almost double when compared with the diversity of microbiota in the gut of children suffering from cholera (24).",

Another limitation was the sampling timeframe because one week was not enough for the displaced microbiota to be restored in the gut of post-diarrhoeal children. We believe that follow-up of the patients for an extended period of time would be needed to get a clearer picture of status of the gut microbiota in post-diarrhoeal children. Although the identification of TTGE bands representing different species would be interesting, in the present study, the intensity of the majority of the bands was very low and was not suitable for the purpose of purification of DNA by cutting TTGE bands for sequencing and analyses. Again, the positions of bands varied greatly in day 1 to day 3; so, extensive cloning and sequencing of dominant bands during treatment were also not suitable.",
