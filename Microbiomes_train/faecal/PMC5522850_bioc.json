Altered serum FFA profiles are related to several metabolic conditions, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies have highlighted the link between gut microbiota and host metabolism. However, although most of the studies have focused on different clinical conditions, evidence on the role of these mediators in healthy populations is lacking. Therefore, we have addressed the analysis of the relationship among gut microbial populations, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, FFA levels, and immune mediators (IFN\u03b3, IL-6, and MCP-1) in 101 human adults from the general Spanish population. Levels of selected microbial groups, representing the major phylogenetic types present in the human intestinal microbiota, were determined by quantitative PCR. Our results showed that the intestinal abundance of Akkermansia was the main predictor of total FFA serum levels, displaying a negative association with total FFA and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Similarly, an altered FFA profile, identified by cluster analysis, was related to imbalanced levels of Akkermansia and Lactobacillus as well as increased fecal SCFA, enhanced IL-6 serum levels, and higher prevalence of subclinical metabolic alterations. Although no differences in nutritional intakes were observed, divergent patterns in the associations between nutrient intakes with intestinal microbial populations and SCFA were denoted. Overall, these findings provide new insights on the gut microbiota\u2013host lipid metabolism axis and its potential relevance for human health, where FFA and SCFA seem to play an important role.",

FFA can affect gene expression of macrophages (1), adipocytes (2), or endothelial cells (3). In addition, FFA can modulate the production of chemokines and cytokines (3\u20135), the expression of genes coding for adhesion molecules (6, 7) and they give rise to pro-inflammatory and inflammation pro-resolving lipid-derived species (8).",

Similarly, some FFA have been reported as regulators of systemic metabolism homeostasis in mice (10). Importantly, quantitative and qualitative differences among the effects of individual FFA have been revealed (11). Thus, not only increased levels but also an altered FFA pool composition may be associated with the risk of developing a range of disorders in which the immune system plays a role (12\u201317).

Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota have been related with the development of metabolic disorders both in mice and in human studies (18), whereas some dietary factors are also known to modulate these microbial communities (19). Recent studies indicate that the gut microbiota is also involved in the host energy metabolism by regulating the absorption of nutrients, local production of hormones and immune mediators, fat storage, and gut permeability (20\u201322). However, to what extent host lipid metabolism is associated with the intestinal microbial populations, and whether the gut microbiota could be related to FFA levels, remains largely unknown. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are produced in the gut by the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota as catabolic end-products from the fermentation of undigested dietary components, mainly complex carbohydrates. These compounds are pivotal in the interactions between the host and intestinal microbial populations (23), but their actual links with the metabolism of fatty acids in humans are controversial. In addition, since most studies have been performed with relatively low sample sizes and mainly with a priori established conditions, evidence for their potential relevance in healthy adults is lacking in the literature. However, due to their pivotal role in shaping the host metabolism, it is tempting to speculate that the intestinal microbiota could be related to FFA levels in healthy populations.",

During an interview, subjects were asked item by item whether they usually ate each food and, if so, how much they usually ate. For this purpose, three different serving sizes of each cooked food were presented in pictures to the participants so that they could choose from up to seven serving sizes (from \u201cless than the small one\u201d to \u201cmore than the large one\u201d). For some of the foods consumed, amounts were recorded in household units, by volume, or by measuring with a ruler. Methodological issues concerning dietary assessment have been detailed elsewhere (25). Food intake was analyzed for energy, macronutrients, and total fiber content by using the nutrient Food Composition Tables developed by the Centro de Ense\u00f1anza Superior de Nutrici\u00f3n Humana y Diet\u00e9tica (26).",

Quantification of bacterial groups (Akkermansia, Bacteroides group, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium cluster XIVa, Lactobacillus group, and Faecalibacterium) in feces was performed with a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as previously described (29\u201331). These microbial groups include the main representatives of the human intestinal microbiota, which all together represent over 95% of the total bacteria in the human intestine (32, 33).

For each analysis, dependent and independent variables were indicated and the \u03b2 coefficient, B coefficient with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values were computed. The association between two categorical variables was first studied by \u03c72 tests in univariate models and then was analyzed by multiple logistic regression models to include potential confounders as independent variables. For this analysis, odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were computed. Principal component analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation was performed to reduce sample dimensionality and potential collinearity effects. The number of components retained was based on eigenvalues (>1), and loadings greater than 0.5 were used to identify the variables comprising a single component. For cluster analysis, squared Euclidean distances were calculated, and Ward\u2019s Minimum Variance Method was used to identify clusters minimizing the loss of information.

                    "text": "Next, we aimed to evaluate whether this finding was due to a general effect on total FFA levels or it could be also associated with individual FFA species. To this end, associations between Akkermansia and the levels of individual FFA (\u03b3-linolenic, palmitic, oleic, stearic, linoleic, palmitoleic, linoleic, AA, EPA, and DHA) were assessed. Akkermansia abundance was negatively associated with some FFA [stearic (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.218, p\u2009=\u20090.039), palmitic (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.321, p\u2009=\u20090.002), oleic (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.261, p\u2009=\u20090.013), palmitoleic (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.297, p\u2009=\u20090.004), linoleic (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.272, p\u2009=\u20090.010), and \u03b3-linolenic (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.232, p\u2009=\u20090.028)], but no association was observed with EPA, DHA, AA, or linoleic levels. As important differences among FFA exist, individual FFA were grouped according to their chemical structure: saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), w3-poly-unsaturated (w3-PUFA), and w6-PUFA. Interestingly, Akkermansia exhibited a strong negative association with SFA (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.314, p\u2009=\u20090.003) as well as with MUFA and w6-PUFA to a lower degree (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.266, p\u2009=\u20090.011 and r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.244, p\u2009=\u20090.020, respectively), whereas no association was observed for w3-PUFA (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.104, p\u2009=\u20090.330). Thus, our findings point to a negative association between Akkermansia abundance and levels of SFA, MUFA, and w6-PUFA, all of them pro-inflammatory. Since some collinearity was noted among individual FFA levels, a PCA was carried out to avoid potential biases. PCA was then conducted with the serum levels of specific FFA, given that all of them exhibited communalities higher than 0.5, thus supporting the appropriateness of this analysis. The Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin test provided a good adequacy of the data (0.858) as the Bartlett test of sphericity (p\u2009=\u200910\u2212144) did. PCA identified two main components (explaining 72.4% of the total variance): C1 (including loadings from \u03b3-linolenic, palmitic, oleic, stearic, linoleic, palmitoleic, linoleic, AA; explaining 59.81% of the total variance) and C2 (including EPA and DHA; explaining 13.09% of the total variance). Notably, Akkermansia was negatively associated with C1 (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.308, p\u2009=\u20090.003), thus supporting an opposite relationship between the levels of this microorganism and those of the saturated, monounsaturated, and w6-PUFA retained in this component, whereas no association was found with anti-inflammatory w3-PUFA (C2). These results from the PCA strengthen our previous findings on the separated analysis of FFA according to their chemical structure. Moreover, since PUFA are present in lower levels, and taking into account that nine FFA loaded on C1 whereas only two did in C2, this association was studied by regression analyses including total FFA serum levels as confounder to rule out the possibility that decreased FFA abundance may bias the analysis. Interestingly, Akkermansia levels remained associated with C1 after performing this adjustment (\u03b2 [95% CI], p: \u22120.286 [\u22121.999, \u22120.315], p\u2009=\u20090.008), whereas no association was observed with C2 (\u22120.052 [\u22120.152, \u22120.092], p\u2009=\u20090.625), thereby confirming our previous findings. In addition, the analysis of inflammatory mediators showed that Akkermansia was negatively associated with IL-6 serum levels (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.233, p\u2009=\u20090.032), whereas IL-6 levels and C1 were in turn associated (r\u2009=\u20090.220, p\u2009=\u20090.032). No associations were found for Akkermansia with IFN\u03b3 (r\u2009=\u20090.056, p\u2009=\u20090.604) or MCP-1 (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.028, p\u2009=\u20090.802) serum levels.",

The present study addresses a multilevel analysis of this scenario, by assessing different surrogate biomarkers of the lipid metabolism, in addition to some relevant intestinal microbial groups and SCFA production as well as inflammatory mediators; the study was performed in a sample of adult subjects from the general population in order to gain some insight into the relationship among these parameters and their potential impact on the human health. Our results revealed an association between the abundance of the intestinal microorganism Akkermansia and circulating FFA. This association was restricted to a specific group of FFA species, Akkermansia and serum IL-6. In addition, cluster analyses revealed that imbalanced intestinal microbial groups and levels of SCFA production may be related to an impaired FFA profile, pro-inflammatory and saturated fatty acids mainly hallmarking this group. Interestingly, individuals who exhibit these features were more likely to show metabolic alterations. Therefore, the results herein presented provide valuable information on the gut microbiota-host metabolism axis and its involvement in human health.",

Akkermansia has been reported to participate in the maintenance of gut integrity and energy harvest by the host (34). It has been confirmed that Akkermansia has a causative role in lowering body fat mass and in glucose homeostasis in mice models (35, 36), although evidence in humans is limited. Our results demonstrate for the first time an association between Akkermansia and serum FFA in a cohort of human adults from the general population. Interestingly, we were able to cluster these healthy adults into two independent groups on the basis of serum individual FFA species, one of these groups showing an increased prevalence of subclinical metabolic alterations. In our study Akkermansia was negatively associated mainly with saturated FFA, in line with the differences that have been previously reported by other authors between lard-like and fish oil-enriched diets in the gut microbiota of mice (36, 37). Moreover, differences in Akkermansia abundance found in our study between FFA clusters were associated in turn with striking differences in total FFA levels. This observation supports a gradual relationship between Akkermansia abundance and FFA serum levels and therefore aligns with the concept proposed by other authors (36, 38) that a \u201cthreshold\u201d for Akkermansia levels may exist. In line with this hypothesis, below certain levels of Akkermansia abundance, gut barrier, and other functions developed by this microbe may become insufficient, thus promoting a shift from a healthy toward a pathologic-prone status. As previously commented, different parameters were found to be predictors of total FFA serum levels depending on the Akkermansia levels. Therefore, low Akkermansia levels may render the host metabolism more sensitive to a number of factors which can lead to an imbalanced FFA profile and, potentially, altered metabolism, hence supporting this notion.",

Then, it is feasible that decreased Akkermansia levels may lead to a compromised barrier function and increased gut permeability, hence promoting metabolic endotoxemia, which has been related to the development of obesity and associated disorders (35, 39). Interestingly, we have found that decreased Akkermansia levels were associated with elevated IL-6 serum concentrations and impaired FFA profile, and the subpopulation with such profile exhibited a bias toward the enrichment in pro-inflammatory and saturated fatty acids, as well as an increased prevalence of metabolic disturbances, thus supporting those previous findings. Therefore, these results suggest that Akkermansia may be linked to the inflammatory milieu by modulating the FFA profile in the host.",

Interestingly, a recent study reported decreased counts of Akkermansia in pre-diabetic individuals (42), suggesting an early involvement of this microorganism in metabolic disorders. Thus, we decided to focus on subclinical metabolic features (suggestive of an impaired metabolism), which can be detected in healthy subjects, in order to improve our knowledge on the potential role of Akkermansia as an early marker of impaired metabolic conditions in the general population. These metabolic features were related to an increased risk of metabolic complications in the long-term (43\u201348). Thus, these subjects showing such subclinical alterations could be classified as \u201cat risk\u201d population according to the scientific literature. Based on this approach, it may be hypothesized that imbalanced microbial populations can underlie the subclinical stage of some metabolic conditions. Actually, the lack of association in our study between Akkermansia and other clinical hard end-points, such as obesity or related immune mediators, such as MCP-1 or IFN\u03b3, may support a very early role of these features. However, long-term studies are warranted.",

Although classically regarded as \u201cbeneficial\u201d microbes, some recent evidence highlights a positive association between Lactobacillus and BMI (49, 50) as well as with some pathological outcomes (51\u201353). In fact, a slight increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillales has been reported in the context of the inflammatory condition of Beh\u00e7et syndrome (54), related to an altered SCFA production and aberrant immune responses. Thus, these pieces of evidence point to a Lactobacillus within-group heterogeneity with relevance for the human health, as suggested by other authors (40, 55). In agreement with this hypothesis our findings on the interactions between Lactobacillus abundance and nutrient parameters, evidenced different association patterns as depending on the metabolic \u201chealth\u201d status of the subject. Controversy observed in mice studies and clinical interventions in humans is also consistent with this idea. A recent work shows opposite patterns upon mucin usage as substrate by Lactobacillus and Akkermansia (56), thereby suggesting that trophic interactions may underlie, at least in part, these opposite trends of both microorganisms. Actually, a negative effect on Akkermansia levels in the gut upon administration of a probiotic mixture was observed when Lactobacillus, but not other probiotic bacteria, were added to the mixture (57). Conversely, Akkermansia has been shown to increase the production of the antimicrobial peptide RegIII\u03b3 by colonic epithelial cells (35). This peptide specifically targets Gram-positive bacteria, thus potentially accounting for the opposite trends between Akkermansia and Lactobacillus groups. In sum, it is feasible that Akkermansia may modulate the gut environment and some intestinal microbial populations through several mechanisms (58).",

                    "text": "It has been reported that Akkermansia and Lactobacillus exhibited diverging trends in twins discordant for metabolic syndrome (40). Our results herein presented are in line with these findings and suggest that the altered composition of the intestinal microbiota may be found in subclinical stages in healthy subjects. A recent study in mice revealed that whereas the colonization by Akkermansia muciniphila shifted the intestinal mucosa gene expression profile toward gene pathways involved in immune tolerance and metabolic homeostasis, colonization by Lactobacillus plantarum resulted in an overexpression of genes involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, lipoprotein lipase being one of the most up-regulated genes (59). An enhanced enzymatic activity of this enzyme may contribute to explain the striking increase in serum FFA found in association with increased Lactobacillus abundance in our study. Actually, overexpression of lipoprotein lipase gene has been related to fatty acid accumulation and insulin resistance (60, 61). On the other hand, the balanced immune responses promoted upon Akkermansia colonization may also account for the increased IL-6 levels found in our study in subjects with diminished abundance of Akkermansia. This is also in accordance with the positive effect on the induction of regulatory T cells reported in mice administered Akkermansia (62). It must be noted that IL-6 can promote a number of pleiotropic functions other than triggering inflammation. However, since we have focused our analysis in subjects with no previous diagnosis of chronic or immune-mediated conditions, our approach allowed us to gain insight into the relationships between Akkermansia, IL-6 and low-grade inflammation in healthy states. Nevertheless, these associations cannot be directly translated into pathological frameworks. Therefore, a study of the gut microbiota composition\u2014IL-6 axis in disease stages remains to be elucidated.",

Imbalanced microbial populations can have an impact on SCFA production, which can elicit different responses in the host metabolism and immune system (64). Interestingly, several authors have found increased SCFA in obesity and metabolic syndrome [reviewed in Ref. (65)], acetate and propionate being especially relevant in such alterations (66, 67). The associations found in our study between acetate and IL-6 and that of the total SCFA with FFA serum levels strongly support the cross talk between gut microbiota, host metabolism and immune networks, highlighting a role for SCFA as important elements of this interplay.",

On the one hand, we have performed a targeted analysis of the gut microbial composition instead of a global profiling by 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis. As a consequence, whether a reduced diversity underlies the present findings cannot be concluded. Similarly, a number of selected FFA and the major SCFA species were chosen for the analysis, based on their outmost relevance in several biological processes. In addition, the same concerns apply to the analysis of inflammatory mediators. Finally, a more precise characterization of dietary intakes may be needed to precisely account for the exact contribution of short-term nutrition to the FFA levels.",

Akkermansia and Lactobacillus groups seem to be connected to the health metabolic status of the host, the interplay with nutritional parameters playing a potential role (Figure \u200b(Figure4).4). Finally, our findings provide some evidence on the role of SCFA as mediators of the cross talk in the gut microbiota-host lipid metabolism axis. Although our results point to a very early role of an altered microbial composition in the further development of metabolic disorders, prospective and long-term studies are needed to accurately address this possibility.",
