This in turn might either lead to a critical dysbiotic state being reached, or the presence of specific microbes emerging to initiate the cycle of inflammation observed in disease. For example, altered release of antibacterial peptides from variant-NOD2-expressing Paneth cells, defective Th17 responses, or defective autophagic bacterial processing in the gut mucosa could change gut bacterial burden or species diversity.",

Exclusion criteria for CD patients included antibiotics within the months before recruitment, active CD (by physician global assessment), and presence of an ileostomy. For all CD patients, a household control was approached (usually an unrelated spouse). Healthy volunteers stratified by the same NOD2 variants were recruited from the Cambridge BioResource.21 The Cambridge BioResource is a panel of around 16,000 volunteers, both with and without health conditions, who have previously submitted DNA for genotyping. Participants can be approached for studies on the basis of genotype and phenotypic characteristics. Volunteers from the BioResource had no known gastrointestinal diagnosis and had not taken antibiotics in the preceeding 3 months.

Of note, they were able to identify similar patterns in ulcerative colitis patients with NOD2 mutations, suggesting that the observed effect is not just one of disease phenotype. However, in a network of associations between bacterial taxa, host, and environmental factors, the effect of NOD2 genotype was only modest compared to antibiotic usage, immunosuppressants, biopsy location, and cohort of origin. Li et al reported differences in intestinal biopsy microbial profile related to NOD2 genotype alongside disease phenotype, with an increase in the C. coccoides-E. rectales group in patients with ileal CDcarrying a risk NOD2 allele.44 More recently, Imhann et al reported an interaction between an IBD genetics risk score that included NOD2 variants and the fecal microbiota, although the impact of NOD2 on its own was not described.45",

Establishing the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and IBD remains challenging; intestinal inflammation is well established as a cause of dysbiosis.46 The study excluded participants with either clinical or biomarker evidence of active disease, reducing the possibility of confounding by disease activity. Although the use of patients in remission will have removed one source of variability, it is also possible that the effects of NOD2 are manifest during active disease. With regards to limitations, this study explores only the changes in gut microbiota in the fecal contents, which are unlikely to fully reflect changes at the mucosal level, particularly in the terminal ileum where one might expect NOD2 to exert its strongest effect. This reflects the difficulty in accessing colonoscopic biopsy samples in a cohort of non-IBD controls and patients in remission. Although only a single VOC was significantly different by NOD2 status, this suggests a possibile difference in metabolically active bacteria not well-represented in fecal samples. The patient cohort also had well-established disease, with a history of surgical resection in most participants. This may reflect a higher risk of surgical resection in patients with NOD2 mutations, noting that the wild-type controls were matched using this phenotype among others. Shotgun metagenomic analysis might have facilitated detection of differences at the species or gene level between cohorts that could be missed with 16S rRNA taxonomic analysis.",

Future studies should explore the relationship between NOD2 genotype and ileal-associated bacteria, ideally using either cohorts again stratified by genotype or very large cohorts to generate adequate numbers of individuals carrying 2 disease-associated mutations. Large cohort studies also offer the opportunity to perform more extensive genotype-microbiota-phenotype analyses, which should lead to a better understanding of these complex interactions.",
