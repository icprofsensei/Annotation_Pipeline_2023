Consequently, most studies characterizing the human gut microbiome have relied on culture-independent sequencing methods. These studies have provided insights into the community composition of the gut microbiota in healthy individuals [3], how it changes with environmental perturbation [4, 5], and its potential role in a variety of diseases [6, 7]. However, there are limitations to the information that can be obtained from molecular approaches alone and the isolation of organisms is required to define the roles of specific bacteria in causing or maintaining healthy and disease states. Culture also determines the viable population in a community, while most molecular methods do not distinguish between DNA obtained from live or dead cells. Furthermore, culture using selective media allows for the growth and detection of less abundant bacteria that may be missed by insufficient sequencing depth in culture-independent studies [8].",

Lagier et al. [8] developed a culturomics method, which used 212 conditions for the cultivation of the fecal microbiota. However, bacterial colonies were identified with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, making it difficult to directly compare to OTUs obtained from pyrosequencing in order to determine the culturable proportion of the microbiota [8]. This study identified 174 novel bacterial species, demonstrating that culture is still a valuable method for exploring the gut microbiome. Another study, by Rettedal et al. [11] tested several culture conditions to capture a representative proportion and maintain the overall community structure of the gut microbiota. From ten media, 88\u00a0% of family level taxonomic groups were recovered and, interestingly, 40\u00a0% more OTUs were found by culture than by culture-independent methods, demonstrating the potential advantages of culture for capturing microbial diversity in the gut. Another study has shown that personalized culture conditions, although only representing 50\u00a0% of the phylotypes observed from culture-independent sequencing, could colonize germ-free mice in a similar manner to the complete fecal samples [10].",

Using 66 culture conditions and applying the same 16S rRNA gene sequencing method to both the cultured community and the fecal samples, we demonstrate that the majority of OTUs could be detected through culture-enriched molecular profiling and culture detected greater diversity than culture-independent methods.

IBS samples were included since the culturable bacterial community may be affected by health status and IBS is a common intestinal disorder in which the microbial composition of the gut is altered and implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder [32]. Using a method of culture-enriched molecular profiling [12], anaerobic fecal samples were cultured using 33 media and incubation of plates anaerobically and aerobically resulted in 66 culture conditions (Fig.\u00a01a). The media used were comprised of commercially available components, without the requirement of complex additions like rumen fluid or fecal extracts used in previous studies [8, 33], and were chosen based on previous culture-enriched molecular profiling studies, with additional media added for specific cultivation of the gut microbiota, including Bacteroides Bile Esculin, Bifidobacterium Selective media, Gut Microbiota medium [10], and the addition of prebiotics and resistant carbohydrates [33] (Additional file 1: Table S1). The cultivable portion of the fecal microbiota was determined by pooling all colonies from each type of media (per fecal sample) and performing\u00a016S rRNA gene sequencing on each plate pool individually, referred to as culture-enriched molecular profiling. A portion of the pooled colonies was reserved for future bacterial isolation. Since the same DNA extraction and sequencing methods were used for both the cultured plate pools and the fecal sample, the OTUs from the culture could be directly compared with the OTUs from culture-independent sequencing of the original fecal sample to determine which OTUs were cultured on each type of medium.",

The largest proportion of OTUs cultured was 93\u00a0% from the healthy volunteer 1 (HV1) sample. No obvious differences were observed in the proportions of OTUs cultured between IBS and healthy samples (an average of 79 and 73\u00a0% of all OTUs were cultured, respectively). Using thresholds of 0.01 and 0.1\u00a0% (in the culture-independent sequencing), an average of 81 and 95\u00a0% of OTUs were cultured, respectively (Fig.\u00a01b), indicating that culture-enriched molecular profiling could detect the majority of the abundant members of the fecal community. A comparison of several OTU picking methods, including AbundantOTU [20] and UCLUST [34] against different reference databases, resulted in similar proportions cultured for each sample, indicating that these results were robust to the method of OTU clustering (Additional file 2: Figure S1). However, the proportion of OTUs cultured was affected by culture-independent sequence depth; as the number of culture-independent sequence reads increased, the percent of OTUs cultured decreased (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Shallow sequencing depth (<\u20095000 reads) in culture-independent sequencing, as used in previous studies [10], would artificially inflate the proportion of the cultured microbiota due to incomplete culture-independent sampling of fecal samples. For each sample, ranking the OTUs from culture-independent sequencing by abundance reveals a few highly abundant OTUs and a long tail distribution of lesser abundant OTUs, as expected in human gut microbiota communities [35] (Fig.\u00a01c; Additional file 2: Figure S3). Above 0.1\u00a0% relative abundance, all OTUs from HV1 were recovered by culture and only five OTUs from HV2 were not cultured (Fig.\u00a01c). Uncultured OTUs were of low abundance (<\u20090.8\u00a0% relative abundance) in the culture-independent sequencing. Twelve OTUs with relative abundances greater that 0.1\u00a0% were not cultured from the donor samples and included Cyanobacteria, Clostridia, Mollicutes, and Bacteroidetes. However, 9 of these 12 OTUs were detected by culture in the other fecal samples.",

Comparison of each plate community to the culture-independent fecal samples showed that no single medium accurately represented the composition of the fecal sample, indicating that OTUs detected by culture represent viable organisms and not DNA deposited on plates (Additional file 2: Figure S4a\u2013d). To further demonstrate this, a sterilized fecal sample from the IBS1 donor and DNA extracted from the same sample were plated on two media, representing cultured communities most similar and most different to the composition of the fecal sample (Additional file 2: Figure S4b\u2013d). The composition of the no-growth and DNA controls were very different from either the fecal sample or the pooled plate. Indeed, the negative growth controls from both types of media were most similar to each other, providing evidence that 16S sequencing of plates represent growth of viable cells and not DNA or dead cells deposited from the fecal sample. Goodman et al. [10] have previously shown that sequencing of pooled colonies cultured from a fecal sample diluted 10,000-fold resulted in less than 2\u00a0% of the sequences being derived from non-viable cells.",

Interestingly, 23 of the 33 anaerobic culture conditions were required across the five samples, indicating that most of the media used were non-redundant, and additional fecal samples may necessitate the use of the other media. There was a distinct difference in the bacterial communities recovered from anaerobic incubation compared with aerobic growth (Additional file 2: Figure S5); Escherichia was the most abundant OTU on the majority of aerobic media used so future studies could reduce the number of aerobic conditions.",

All conditions tested showed that the cultured microbiome profile was different after freezing, with Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity distances greater than 0.3 (Additional file 2: Figure S7a, d), while fecal samples were differentially affected by aerobic exposure, with Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity distance ranging from 0.15 to 0.65 (Additional file 2: Figure S7b, c, e). Since the compositions of the fecal samples were different from each other and each medium used selected for different bacteria, no abundant bacterial groups were identified as consistently altered after storage.

Taking into account all OTUs detected in the five samples by both methods, 1051 OTUs (67\u00a0% of the total) were detected only by culture-enrichment, 390 OTUs (25\u00a0%) were found by both methods, and 118 OTUs (8\u00a0%) were detected only by culture-independent sequencing. For each sample, more OTUs were observed by culture-enriched sequencing than culture-independent sequencing (Fig.\u00a02a). This suggests that even with deep sequencing of a fecal sample (average depth\u2009=\u2009206 076 reads), culture detects greater bacterial diversity compared with culture-independent methods. The OTUs that were detected only by culture were mainly distributed across six phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Tenericutes. These low abundance organisms may include bacteria from the colonic mucosa and other sites in the GI tract, where they may be present at higher local abundance but at too low abundance in stool to be detected by the culture-independent sequencing depths used in this study. OTUs that were culture-only or detected by both methods were evenly distributed across the bacterial taxonomy (Fig.\u00a02b), indicating that cultured OTUs represent members of the fecal microbiota and not plate contamination. Uncultured OTUs included a Tenericutes branch and a few Firmicutes clades.",

There is extensive Lachnospiraceae diversity in the human gut microbiota but this prevalent and abundant family is poorly represented by reference genomes [36]. From analysis of the culture-enriched profiling of previous fecal samples, it was determined that communities grown on anaerobic BHI\u2009+\u2009inu and BEEF agar were dominated by Lachnospiraceae (Additional file 2: Figure S5). Consistent with our culture-enrichment results, inulin has been shown to increase growth of butyrate-producing bacteria, including Lachnospiraceae, both in vivo [37] and in vitro [38]. HV3 and IBS4 fecal samples were cultured anaerobically on BHI\u2009+\u2009inu and BEEF and colonies were isolated (as opposed to plate pooling). Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of 146 isolated colonies resulted in the identification of 79 Lachnospiraceae isolates, including representatives of the genera Blautia, Marvinbryantia, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Eubacterium, Anaerostipes, Clostridium, and Coprococcus (Additional file 3: Table S2). Additionally, 18 isolates had less than 97\u00a0% similarity to Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) reference isolates at the genus level [21], as supported by the phylogenetic distance of these isolates to the 107 RDP Lachnospiraceae reference sequences (Fig.\u00a03). These 18 isolates may be novel species not currently represented by the RDP type isolates. Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the Lachnospiraceae isolates to the Human Microbiome Project\u2019s (HMP) Most Wanted taxa resulted in a match to 12 sequences with 100\u00a0% identity, including four organisms of medium priority (Additional file 4: Table S3). The \u201cMost Wanted\u201d taxa represent uncultured but abundant and prevalent organisms from the HMP 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set [39]. Isolation of novel representatives of the gut microbiome and whole genome sequencing of these organisms will add critical information to reference genome collections and lead to more accurate assignments for metagenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomic studies.",

Using significantly fewer and less complex culture conditions than Lagier et al. [8], we were still able to capture the majority of OTUs seen by culture-independent sequencing. Indeed, we believe that this is the first study showing that >\u200950\u00a0% of the OTUs from a fecal sample can be recovered by culture. We also show that culture revealed greater bacterial diversity than detected by culture-independent sequencing. These organisms, absent or underrepresented in culture-independent profiling, may contribute to host phenotypes so methods to detect and isolate this population are critical for future studies. We did not observe a difference in the proportion of OTUs that could be cultured between IBS and healthy fecal samples; however, our sample size was small and further studies should be carried out to confirm this. By applying the data generated from culture-enriched molecular profiling in the first part of this study, we were able to carry out the targeted isolation of Lachnospiraceae. This resulted in the recovery of up to 18 species not represented by a reference database from\u00a0culturing only two fecal samples on two media conditions, demonstrating that culture is valuable for accessing novel members of the gut microbiota.",

Some OTUs were detected only by culture-enrichment or culture-independent sequencing, suggesting that both methods are complementary for studying the gut microbiota since the combination is more sensitive than either method alone. The uncultured OTUs may have been missed due to the following reasons: stochastic sampling if the bacteria were rare in the sample, DNA could have originated from dead cells, slower growing organisms may have been out-competed by less fastidious members of the community, or the media used in this study may have been missing a nutrient required for growth or prevented growth of a bacterial partner critical for survival. This may also explain why some OTUs were not detected by culturing in one fecal sample but recovered from another donor.",

Certain bacterial groups may be under-represented by primers used in 16S sequencing of complex communities, such as stool, since poor primer alignment would result in these sequences being outcompeted during PCR of mixed community DNA [36]. However, these bacteria can be grown using selective media and subsequently detected by culture-enriched molecular profiling since there may be less competing DNA in 16S rDNA amplification of the plate pools. As previously reported, bacteria present at <\u2009106 cells per gram of feces is likely to be missed by sequencing depths used in most microbiome studies [8], but the ability to grow less abundant bacteria on media would increase recovery of DNA for sequencing these rarer members of the population. Additionally, DNA from bacterial spores in stool may be underrepresented by 16S sequencing, depending on the method of DNA extraction [42], but germination of spores during culture would allow for increased detection of spore-forming populations.",

Furthermore, since this method allows for the development of a bacterial community on a plate, it does not exclude syntrophic interactions that may be required for growth of some bacteria [43]. In addition, subsequent culturing of plate pools using combinations of antibiotics and other selective media components can be used to develop more refined culture conditions for specific bacteria [11]. The application of this method for the recovery of novel representatives of the gut microbiota will add to reference databases and lead to more accurate assignment for future \u201comic\u201d studies. To advance the microbiome field beyond correlative investigations and to test hypotheses generated from culture-independent studies, it is critical to isolate bacteria of interest from the gut microbiota and culture-enriched molecular profiling allows for such isolation.",

This method also highlights the ability of culture for recovering low abundance bacteria and for revealing diversity that may be underrepresented by other methods. Isolation of bacteria will allow us to explore the therapeutic potential of bacterial products which may directly affect the host or microbial community. Access to the cultured human microbiota will offer detailed functional characterization of bacteria and will facilitate the discovery of their biological activities during host\u2013bacteria and inter-bacterial interactions in health and disease.",
