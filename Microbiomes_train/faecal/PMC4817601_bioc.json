Newborn piglets were fed with formula alone (FF) or formula supplemented with 4\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 HMO (HMO) or a prebiotic mixture of 9:1 short-chain galactooligosaccharides (3.6\u2009g\u2009l\u22121) and long-chain fructooligosaccharides (0.4\u2009g\u2009l\u22121) (PRE) (n=19\u201321 per group) for 15 days. Piglets (n=7\u20138) in each dietary group were orally infected with porcine rotavirus (RV) OSU strain on d10, and stool consistency was assessed daily. Blood, small intestine and colonic contents were collected at day 15. Serum RV-specific antibody concentrations, intestinal histomorphology, RV non-structural protein-4 (NSP4) and cytokine mRNA expression were assessed. Colonic content pH, dry matter (DM) and short-chain fatty acid concentrations were measured. Ascending colonic microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene v1-3 region pyrosequencing. HMO- and PRE-fed groups had shorter duration of diarrhea than FF piglets. Infection changed intestinal histomorphology, increased serum RV-specific antibody response and intestinal RV NSP4 expression, and modulated ileal cytokine expression. HMO enhanced T helper type 1 (interferon-gamma) and anti-inflammatory (interleukin-10) cytokines in the ileum, while prebiotics promoted RV-specific immunoglobulin M response to the infection. RV infection and HMO supplementation altered intraluminal environment and gut microbiota. HMO increased pH and lowered DM of colonic contents and enhanced the abundance of unclassified Lachnospiraceae, which contains numerous butyrate-producing bacteria. In conclusion, HMO and prebiotics did not prevent the onset of RV infection but reduced the duration of RV-induced diarrhea in piglets, in part, by modulating colonic microbiota and immune response to RV infection.",

Two commercially available RV vaccines effectively prevent RV infections in the developed countries (Giaquinto et al., 2011); however, these vaccines are not widely available and are less efficacious in the developing countries (Babji and Kang, 2012). Breastfed infants have a lower incidence of RV-induced acute gastroenteritis than formula-fed (FF) infants (Plenge-Bonig et al., 2010). A distinctive aspect of human milk is the high abundance (5\u201310\u2009g\u2009l\u22121) and complexity (>200 forms) of oligosaccharides (HMO); whereas oligosaccharides are negligible in bovine milk and infant formula (Kunz et al., 2000). HMO are comprised of both neutral and anionic (acidic) components with a lactose core at the reducing end. Various structures can be formed by elongation of up to 15 N-acetyllactosamine units and by addition of fucose and/or sialic acid (SA) residues at the terminal positions (Kunz et al., 2000; Bode, 2006; Ninonuevo et al., 2006). The ratio of neutral-to-acidic HMO is 70:20, in which lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and 2\u2032-fucosyllactose (2\u2032FL) are the predominant neutral HMO in human milk (Kunz et al., 2000; Tao et al., 2010).",

HMO are fermented by neonatal piglet microbiota to produce short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) in vitro (Li et al., 2012), and HMO may decrease inflammation by reducing neutrophil infiltration and activation (Bode et al., 2004a, 2004b). Finally, due to the structural similarities to mucus glycans, HMO serve to inhibit the adhesion of pathogens to epithelial surfaces (Newburg et al., 2005). SA-containing HMO inhibit RV binding to the host cells in vitro, and both neutral and acidic HMO reduced RV replication in an in situ acute RV infection piglet model (Hester et al., 2013). However, whether dietary HMO reduce RV infectivity and ameliorate clinical symptoms in vivo remains to be determined.",

Due to the challenge of isolating sufficient quantities of HMO from donor human milk for animal feeding, synthetic HMO composed of 75% neutral HMO and 25% acidic HMO were mixed according to their relative proportions in human milk (Kunz et al., 2000; Tao et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012). Although the mixture does not represent the full repertoire of HMO, it contains the most predominant HMO in human milk, several of which have been shown to have anti-microbial and immunomodulatory actions in vitro (Li et al., 2012; Comstock et al., 2013). The HMO diet was also compared with prebiotic blend comprised of 90% short-chain galactooligosaccharides (scGOS) and 10% long-chain fructooligosaccharides (lcFOS), as these have been proven to be beneficial to infant health (Knol et al., 2005; Boehm and Moro, 2008).

Ileal IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 3c) and IL-10 (Figure 3d) expression levels were also greater in the RV-infected piglets, with both diet and infection being significant but no interaction. HMO-fed piglets had greater expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 than the FF group regardless of infection status. IFN-\u03b3 tended (P=0.0508) to be higher in the HMO groups compared with the PRE groups. IL-4 and IL-12 expression levels did not differ among the treatment groups.",

RV-infected piglets had higher relative abundances of Bacteroidetes (53.15\u00b13.80 vs 39.46\u00b12.81, P=0.02) and lower Firmicutes (42.67\u00b13.25 vs 56.70\u00b12.76, P=0.05) than the non-infected piglets (Supplementary Figure 3). At class/order level, the proportions of certain bacterial groups were also impacted by RV infection, with no diet effect. Class Bacilli (P<0.0001), Erysipelotrichia (P=0.0183) and a group of unclassified Firmicutes (P=0.0511) were decreased, whereas class Bacteroidia (P=0.086) tended to increase in the infected piglets. The family abundance of the piglet microbiota was significantly changed by both RV infection and diet. Infection resulted in the significant increase of Bacteroidaceae and Helicobacteraceae and reduction of Porphyromonadaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, unclassified Bacteroidales and unclassified Lactobacillales in the infected piglets, while diet mainly affected on the abundance of Lachnospiraceae, which was exclusively increased in the HMO group regardless of infection (P=0.0003) and Ruminococcaceae, which was lower in the HMO than in the FF and PRE groups (P=0.0133) (Supplementary Table 2).",

The triplot of RDA showed that the RV-infected and non-infected piglets were separated at the first constrained axis (explaining 9.1% of the total variability), while the HMO-fed groups differed from the FF- and PRE-fed groups at the second constrained axis (explaining 2.7% of the total variability) (Figure 5), indicating that both RV infection and HMO supplementation changed the gut microbiota. The significance of the data classification was validated by the Monte Carlo permutation test (P=0.002). The genera that contributed at least 10% of the total variability of the samples were identified as key bacterial groups responding to RV infection and dietary treatment, which was confirmed further by univariate statistics (PROC MIXED) (Table 4). Among the 15 key genera, 6 corresponded to the infection effect alone, including Bacteroides, which was increased in the RV-infected piglets, and Parabacteroides, Blautia, Clostridium IV, Anaerotruncus and unclassified Peptostreptococcaceae, which were decreased in the RV-infected piglets. Two genera were changed by the diet effect alone: Clostridium XVIII and unclassified Clostridiaceae 1, which were both higher in the HMO-fed groups compared with the PRE groups. Unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Clostridium XlVa, Faecalibacterium, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Turicibacter were affected by both infection and diet treatment. The major genus that distinguished the HMO from the FF and PRE groups was unclassified Lachnospiraceae.",

                    "text": "Herein, we have shown for the first time that feeding HMO modulates the gut microbiota, intestinal immunity and shortens the duration of diarrhea following RV infection. We found that neither HMO nor scGOS/lcFOS mixtures prevented the initial RV infection. However, HMO and PRE supplementation shortened the duration of diarrhea by 31 and 27.5\u2009h, respectively, compared with FF-infected piglets. We observed a biphasic diarrheal response. HMO and PRE decreased the overall duration of diarrhea by reducing the incidence of the second wave of diarrhea from 57% in FF to 25%. Previous work in our lab characterized the time course of RV replication in the RV-infected piglet intestine and demonstrated a biphasic response in RV NSP4 mRNA expression; one at 2 days PI and the second at 4 days PI (unpublished data), corroborating the course of diarrhea in the current study. The secondary peak of diarrhea is due to the release of newly synthesized RV particles by infected enterocytes. Furthermore, in an in situ acute RV infection piglet model, we showed that both neutral (LNnT) and acidic HMO decreased NSP4 expression in the loops (Hester et al., 2013). Taken together, it appears that HMO and prebiotics inhibit RV binding and/or replication predominantly during the second phase of the infection. However, a significant difference in NSP4 mRNA abundance among the diet groups was not observed. As RV replication occurs in the cells at the villi tips of the small intestine, the villus blunting caused by the initial infection may have precluded detection of the differences in mucosal NSP4 expression between the diet groups. Thus multiple time point sampling may be needed to determine whether HMO is in fact inhibiting RV replication at earlier time points in infection. The prebiotic effect is consistent with results of similar studies showing that feeding prebiotics or probiotics reduced the duration, severity and incidence of diarrhea in human infants or animals (Shu et al., 2001; de Vrese and Marteau, 2007), suggesting that HMO or prebiotics confers a degree of protection against RV infection in piglets.",

Secretory IgA is associated with protection from infection (Velazquez et al., 2000; Azevedo et al., 2004); however, we did not detect RV-IgA in serum or colonic contents at 5 days PI. Grimwood et al. (1988) found that RV-IgA was frequently undetectable in duodenal fluid or feces in the first week of acute infection in children.

A significant increase in IL-8, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 expression in the ileum of infected piglets was observed, consistent with previous reports of upregulated pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th2 cytokine response in RV-infected gnotobiotic piglets (Azevedo et al., 2006). Additionally, HMO significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 expression in the intestine of both non-infected and infected piglets. IFN-\u03b3 inhibits RV entry into human intestinal epithelial cells (Bass, 1997), while IL-10 is known as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the synthesis of the major pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Opal et al., 1998). Further, acidic HMO were shown to stimulate IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 production in cord blood-derived mononuclear cells in vitro, whereas scGOS/lcFOS had no effect on cytokine production (Eiwegger et al., 2010). Neutral HMO, such as LNnT, also increased IL-10 production in mice (Terrazas et al., 2001). A similar study in which the RV-infected piglets were fed lactic acid bacteria resulted in an increase in both Th1 and Th2 cytokines in piglets (Azevedo et al., 2012). Taken together, we hypothesize that HMO influenced host protective immunity by stimulating a balanced Th1 and Th2 cytokine response, consequently, enhancing recovery from diarrhea, that is, shorten the duration of diarrhea.",

The increase in pH and decrease in DM in the lumen were likely the result of an acid\u2013base and electrolyte disturbance and increased intestinal secretion in response to RV infection (Gennari and Weise, 2008). The infection also reduced gut microbial diversity and increased Bacteroides relative abundance, which is consistent with the greater abundance of Bacteroides fragilis reported in RV-infected children compared with healthy controls (Zhang et al., 2009). B. fragilis is a commensal gut bacteria but is also recognized as an opportunistic pathogen commonly associated with diarrheal disease and clinical infections (Kato et al., 1999). The increase in opportunistic pathogenic bacteria might be caused by the perturbation of the entire microbial community during diarrhea.",

                    "text": "Evidence has shown that probiotics or prebiotics may be promising preventive and curative treatments for diarrheal diseases (deVrese and Marteau, 2007). Due to the prebiotic effects of HMO observed in vitro (Li et al., 2012), we anticipated that HMO would exert a protective effect against RV infection via modulation of the gut microbiota. The sequencing results confirmed that the microbiota of HMO-fed piglets differed from that of the FF and PRE groups. Most interestingly, HMO specifically increased the amount of unclassified Lachnospiraceae. A recent study found that a Lachnospiraceae isolate suppressed Clostridium difficile colonization in the gut of germ-free mice (Reeves et al., 2012). Likewise, clinical studies have linked reduced Lachnospiraceae abundance with chronic intestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Frank et al., 2007). The Lachnospiraceae family contains numerous butyrate-producing bacteria (Cotta and Forster, 2006), which could ferment HMO to SCFA that are beneficial for intestinal morphology and barrier function (Scheppach, 1994) and, hence, protect against RV infection. However, we did not observe a diet effect on SCFA production in the current study; thus, other protective mechanisms also may be considered. There was a consistent increase in IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression and the abundance of unclassified Lachnospiraceae in the HMO-fed groups, and we also observed a positive correlation between IFN-\u03b3 and the abundance of unclassified Lachnospiraceae (Pearson's correlation, r=0.32, P=0.027). Therefore, an interaction between the gut bacteria and mucosal immune system mediated by HMO may contribute to the protection conferred against RV infection by HMO feeding. However, this postulate requires further investigation.",

In this study, the level of Bifidobacterium measured by quantitative PCR was reduced in the infected piglets but was not affected by diet (data not shown). This is likely due to the phenotypic differences in bifidobacteria in humans and pigs (Gavini et al., 1991) and the bifidobacterial species/strain specificity of HMO metabolism (LoCascio et al., 2007; Ward et al., 2007).",

Combined with our previous in vitro study, we concluded that HMO supplementation could protect neonates against RV infection, as evidenced by the shorter duration of diarrhea, by inhibiting RV binding and/or replication, enhancing mucosal Th1/Th2 cytokine response and modulating the composition and, thus, metabolic potential of the gut microbiota. In contrast, the prebiotic scGOS/lcFOS mixture only promoted a systemic antibody response to infection. Therefore, supplementing formula with HMO may represent a novel nutritional approach to protect against RV infection in human infants and animals.",
