The collective genome of all these bacteria is called the microbiome. The intestinal microbiota exerts crucial functions that humans cannot exert themselves while human hosts offer a nutrient-rich environment. In healthy people, a dynamic equilibrium exists. However, environmental factors and host genetic factors all can influence microbiota composition and generate dysbiosis related to carcinogenesis and disturbed metabolism [1\u20133]. Microbiota differences were reported between healthy people and patients with colorectal and gastric cancer [4, 5]. Especially in gastric cancer, the presence of Helicobacter pylori is highly associated with cancer development [4]. A recent study showed that the human intestinal microbiota signature is able to predict in vivo treatment response to antibiotics in patients with Clostridium difficile infections [6]. Another in vivo study used microbiota composition of the female urogenital tract to predict failure of implementation of an embryo in in vitro fertilization (IVF) [7]. The pilot study results of the Erasmus Medical Center showed that IVF fails with 96% certainty in the presence of an unfavorable microbiota profile [8].",

The standard systemic treatment in CRC in metastatic and/or irresectable setting is mostly based on fluoropyrimidine, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), orally administered capecitabine, or TAS-102. Capecitabine is a precursor of 5-FU [9]. Capecitabine is frequently administered in combination with bevacizumab, which is an antibody that binds to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab inhibits angiogenesis and its related tumor growth. TAS-102 consists of cytotoxin trifluridine and thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) tipiracil. Tipiracil prevents rapid metabolism of trifluridine, increasing the bioavailability of trifluridine, which inhibits tumor cell growth [10].",

Response to a systemic therapy also depends on patient\u2019s dihydropyrimidine deficiency (DPD) status [11]. DPD is a molecular determinant of capecitabine efficacy in CRC patients [12]. It is known that patients with DPD experience more chemotoxic effects, since dihydropyrimidine cannot process thymine and uracil [13].

To limit chemotoxicity and prolong and increase effects of systemic treatment, a great need exists to explore the role of the intestinal microbiota. In vitro studies already suggest that intestinal microbiota plays a putative role in colorectal cancer treatment. By exploring the microbiota composition and changes in relation to response and chemotoxicity, the favorable microbiota composition can be detected. In the future, low-burden fecal microbiota transplantation might result in more time and improved Qol for cancer patients.",
