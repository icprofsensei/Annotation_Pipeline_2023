                    "text": "Temporal variation in microbiome measurements can reduce statistical power in research studies. Quantification of this variation is essential for designing studies of chronic disease. We analyzed 16S ribosomal RNA profiles in paired biological specimens separated by 6 months from 3 studies conducted during 1985\u20132013 (a National Cancer Institute colorectal cancer study, a Costa Rica study, and the Human Microbiome Project). We evaluated temporal stability by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Sample sizes needed in order to detect microbiome differences between equal numbers of cases and controls for a nested case-control design were calculated on the basis of estimated ICCs. Across body sites, 12 phylum-level ICCs were greater than 0.5. Similarly, 11 alpha-diversity ICCs were greater than 0.5. Fecal beta-diversity estimates had ICCs over 0.5. For a single collection with most microbiome metrics, detecting an odds ratio of 2.0 would require 300\u2013500 cases when matching 1 case to 1 control at P = 0.05. Use of 2 or 3 sequential specimens reduces the number of required subjects by 40%\u201350% for low-ICC metrics. Relative abundances of major phyla and alpha-diversity metrics have low temporal stability. Thus, detecting associations of moderate effect size with these metrics will require large sample sizes. Because beta diversity for feces is reasonably stable over time, smaller sample sizes can detect associations with community composition. Sequential prediagnostic specimens from thousands of prospectively ascertained cases are required to detect modest disease associations with particular microbiome metrics.",

Advances in low-cost high-throughput sequencing (1) and bioinformatic analyses (2\u20134) now allow the characterization of human microbial communities. Importantly, the human microbiome has been recently shown to be associated with selected health conditions: the fecal microbiota with obesity (5\u20137), colorectal cancer (CRC) (8), estrogen levels (9), postmenopausal breast cancer (10), and inflammatory bowel disease (11); the oral microbiota with pancreatic (12), oral (13), and gastrointestinal (13) cancers; the vaginal microbiota with bacterial vaginosis (14); and the skin microbiota with atopic dermatitis and other skin diseases (15\u201317). Interventions with medications or diet produce alterations in microbial communities (17\u201319). Together, these results demonstrate the potential of microbiome research for elucidating the etiology, prevention, and possibly treatment of complex human diseases. While promising, some important questions need to be answered in order for large-scale epidemiologic studies to clarify the role of microbiota in human health (20).",

Due to cost, compliance, and degree of invasiveness, many exposures are typically measured only at baseline, which works well if the factor is temporally stable. At the community level, the microbiome has been reported to be reasonably stable over time (21\u201323). In contrast, other studies found substantial temporal variability in composition for particular bacteria at different body sites (15, 23\u201326), but between-person variability was still much larger than differences over time. If a variable exposure is measured at a single time point, its temporal instability dramatically reduces the study\u2019s statistical power to detect associations and also can bias the estimate of its effect (27). It is therefore crucial to systematically evaluate the temporal stability of microbiome measures, including the relative abundances of taxa, alpha diversity, and beta diversity, in order to accurately determine sample sizes required for future studies.",

Our objective was to estimate the degree of temporal microbiome variability within individuals and the impact that will have on sample size requirements for future studies. We focused on case-control studies nested within prospective studies, since sequencing the microbiome for an entire cohort would be prohibitively expensive. We estimated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) in these 3 studies; higher ICCs imply larger statistical power and smaller bias in estimating an exposure\u2019s effect.

Briefly, the samples were extracted with a modification of the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN) (9). An approximately 469-base-pair segment of the 16S rRNA gene V3\u2013V4 hypervariable region of the DNA was amplified with primers that included a linker sequence (suitable for the MiSeq 300PE Illumina sequencer; Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California), a 12-base-pair index sequence, a heterogeneity spacer (to minimize bias with low-diversity amplicons), and 16S rRNA gene universal primers 319F/806R. The amplicons were sequenced in a single pool in 1 run on the MiSeq instrument using the 300PE protocol, generating approximately 2.22 GB of data.",

Similar to alpha diversity, beta-diversity metrics were also calculated after rarefying to 1,000 sequencing reads.

The proportions of explained variance of the top 5 PCoA scores are reported in Web Tables 5 and 6. For the stool microbiome (Figure \u200b(Figure1),1), the ICCs had a wide range, from 0.00 for Proteobacteria to 0.84 for unweighted UniFrac first principal coordinates analysis (PCoA1). Higher ICCs (>0.50) were noted for the average of the top 5 PCoA scores based on unweighted UniFrac in all 3 studies. For relative abundance at the phylum level across all 3 studies, 12 ICCs were 0.50 or greater (Web Table 1). However, as Figures \u200bFigures11\u20133 show for each study, ICCs were very low for the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria (ICC = 0.00 and ICC = 0.19, respectively) in the HMP, and in the CRC study, the ICCs for the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria were also low (ICC = 0.03, ICC = 0.16, and ICC = 0.00, respectively).

In contrast, smaller associations (i.e., odds ratio = 1.5) could only be detected in studies that were 6-fold larger (approximately 1,000\u20133,000 cases; Table \u200bTable2).2). As expected, fewer cases are needed for metrics with higher ICCs (i.e., lower within-subject variability), particularly for unweighted UniFrac. The required sample size is also lower when multiple specimens per subject over time would be collected, and the benefit is substantial for low-ICC metrics. Detecting an odds ratio of 1.5 for the relative abundance of Fusobacteria (ICC = 0.18) would require 3,659 cases with 1 specimen, 2,158 cases with a second specimen, and 1,658 cases with a third specimen. Detection of an odds ratio of 1.5 in unweighted UniFrac (ICC = 0.81) would require only 813 cases, which decreases to 735 cases if a second specimen is available and 710 cases if a third specimen is available.

This finding implies that even nominally significant associations with these unstable metrics should be interpreted with caution and that sample sizes need to be quite large for these types of analyses. In contrast, unweighted UniFrac, one measure of beta diversity, was relatively stable not only for stool specimens but also for oral, oropharynx, and vagina specimens. Unweighted UniFrac is the pairwise comparison of the sizes and shapes of each specimen\u2019s phylogenetic tree without consideration of relative abundances. In contrast, weighted UniFrac, which considers the relative abundances of taxa and also utilizes the phylogenetic tree, had lower ICCs. This observation favors unweighted UniFrac as a useful metric for identifying disease associations or predictions based on overall differences in detection of the many different microbes, as compared with the relative abundance of particular phyla. For a single collection with most microbiome metrics, detecting an odds ratio of 2.0 would require 300\u2013500 cases when matching 1 case to 1 control at P = 0.05. Smaller case numbers would be required to detect associations between particular pathogenic bacteria that directly cause disease, as is known for Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Clostridium difficile, since the hypothesized association would be large.",

Technical reproducibility has been reported in some studies for fecal samples (39, 40). In our recent work, we have found that the technical reproducibility in fecal samples is very high (taxa: ICCs >80%; alpha/beta diversity: ICCs >90%) (41, 42). However, temporal stability ICCs have not been systematically investigated across body sites using a large number of subjects.

However, next-day correlations with fiber intake and marked alterations associated with international travel or enteric infection were also noted. Zhou et al. (26) and Ding and Schloss (44) investigated temporal variation of microbiota in the HMP subjects. In the Zhou et al. study (26), the Spearman correlation between 2 vectors of taxon relative abundances corresponding to 2 study visits was calculated for each subject. By averaging across subjects, Zhou et al. concluded that oral and fecal samples were the most stable temporally, whereas skin and vaginal samples were the most unstable. However, their calculations did not reflect the instability of individual microbiome metrics across participants and thus did not provide quantified information necessary for prospective epidemiologic studies. With such limitations, there is concern that these conclusions might be used erroneously to guide the design of epidemiologic studies. For example, it was stated that vaginal samples were very unstable, with Spearman correlations close to zero, suggesting no power for association studies. However, in our analysis, the ICC for unweighted UniFrac was reasonably high (averaged across 3 vaginal sites, ICC = 0.68 for PCoA1), implying only moderate power loss due to temporal variation. In addition, temporal stability evaluated with their approach provides little or no information relevant to the temporal stability of within-subject alpha diversity or community composition (i.e., beta diversity). Ding and Schloss (44) developed a simple Markov model to characterize the temporal stability; however, the inferred model parameters cannot be used directly to calculate the effective sample size for an epidemiologic study.",

One method for improving power is to have more endpoints in the study, which could be accomplished by recruiting a larger cohort or following the cohort for a longer time. The second approach is to collect and test specimens at multiple time points for each subject and to average across the specimens. Our analyses of stability ICCs revealed that a second or third specimen per subject is only moderately beneficial for a stable (high-ICC) metric such as unweighted UniFrac, whereas additional specimens greatly reduce the required sample size for unstable (low-ICC) metrics, such as the relative abundance of Fusobacteria. The multiple-specimen approach also affords the opportunity to detect temporal changes in the metric that may predict disease onset. The optimal design depends on the hypothesis (microbiome metric) to be tested (average vs. change) and the relative costs of microbiome sequencing and subject recruitment and retention. When the cost of recruiting subjects is much higher than the laboratory costs, sequencing of multiple specimens over time is expected to have better power. The third method for improving statistical power is to identify factors that contribute to the instability of a microbiome metric and adjust for these factors in association studies. Except for antibiotic use, which has a potent but unquantified effect, such factors are currently under debate.",

However, if specimens have been collected or analyzed by different methods in various studies, the microbiome metric may not be conducive to being pooled or meta-analyzed. We have found that different methods of collecting samples show bias in the microbiome data (41, 42), and study-specific differences in DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification, and sequencing also contribute to heterogeneity, making it difficult to pool studies (47).

A longitudinal study with multiple sampling over a given time period (months and years) and fixed sampling methods would provide more accurate estimates, especially for unstable (low-ICC) metrics. Second, the number of subjects was low for some body sites (e.g., antecubital fossa and vagina), and subjects originated from only 1 study, the HMP, for many of the body sites. Third, lack of technical replicates prevented the separation of temporal variation from technical variability. However, technical reproducibility is usually high in experienced laboratories, and typical epidemiologic studies are based on single-point sampling with no technical replicates; thus, the ICCs estimated here reflect both technical variability and temporal instability and are directly applicable to statistical power for such epidemiologic studies. However, we have found that the technical reproducibility is very high; thus, the inclusion of multiple aliquots of the same samples will not substantially improve the statistical power for detecting associations (41, 42). Fourth, because we focused on microbial communities, as estimated by 16S rRNA gene amplicons, our work has limited application for research on specific bacterial species or strains or functional pathways that employ other laboratory methods, such as whole-genome shotgun metagenomics. However, because we found that stability ICCs were lowest for the low-abundance phyla, it is highly likely that ICCs for uncommon or rare genera, species, or strains would be as low or even lower.",
