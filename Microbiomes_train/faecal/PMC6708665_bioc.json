The diagnosis of CC is defined by loose stools for more than 3\u20134 weeks, a colonic mucosa that most often has a normal appearance, although minor changes such as edema and erythema might be present, combined with specific histopathologic criteria (1,2). Historically, CC has been considered rare, but epidemiologic studies indicate an increase in the incidence rates during the last decades. In Europe and North America, the annual incidence reaches approximately 5.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (2). The disease mainly affects the elderly female population, with a ratio of 3.8:1, and is a relatively common finding in the investigation of watery, non-bloody diarrhea in an elderly female patient.",

Immunologically, there seems to be an uncontrolled mucosal inflammation, suggesting an aberrant immune response to luminal antigens in genetically predisposed individuals, similar to other chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (1). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that diversion of the fecal stream has led to recovery from inflammation in the colon among patients with CC and reconstruction of the intestinal continuity caused relapse (4,5). Several exposures that have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and smoking, have also been associated with CC (1). Interestingly, CC has been described to convert into IBD or vice versa (6\u201310). These observations suggest that CC and IBD might have pathophysiologic mechanisms in common.",

The histopathologic criteria of CC included a subepithelial collagen band of \u226510 \u03bcm, infiltration with lymphocytes in the lamina propria, and epithelial damage. The characteristic findings had to be present in at least 2 biopsies, supported by inflammatory mucosal changes in additional biopsies and segments (1). The diagnosis of CD and UC was based on the Lennard-Jones criteria (16). All patients signed a written informed consent. Clinical disease activity in patients with CC was defined according to internationally accepted criteria, with remission defined as <3 stools without any watery diarrhea during the last 24 hours (1). In CD and UC, phenotype and disease activity were classified according to the Montreal classification and physician's global assessment (17). Healthy controls, matched by sex and age (\u00b15 years) to the CC group, were identified from the population-based colonoscopy (PopCol) cohort, previously described in detail (18). All individuals were asked to provide a fecal sample and to complete a questionnaire on disease activity and use of drugs, including antibiotics. Exclusion criterion was antibiotic use within 3 months before fecal sample collection. In total, 122 individuals were included (CC: n = 29; CD: n = 32; UC: n = 32; and healthy controls: n = 29).",

Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) was performed to test for dissimilarities between the groups (20). The Benjamini and Hochberg method was used to account for multiple comparisons, based on global P values of all variables compared, with a false-discovery rate of 5%. We used Wilcoxon tests to test for differences in relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa between patients with CC and healthy controls. Only taxa prevalent in >20% of the samples were included in this analysis. To correct for multiple testing, we performed 1,000 permutations stratified for the taxonomic level of classification, i.e., genus and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) at a 97% identity threshold. For each permutation, the diseased and control individuals were randomized and tested against the relative abundance data for all OTUs. The distribution of the P values per OTU provided an exact test (q-value) to estimate the false-discovery rate at 5% for every OTU. We used the q-value obtained from the permutations for each OTU to estimate its significance. We repeated this analysis using the relative abundance per taxa. Comparisons between subgroups of patients with CC and healthy controls were performed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test. Due to the limited number of individuals in each group, patients with CC were categorized in 2 subgroups, patients in remission without corticosteroid therapy and patients with active disease or ongoing corticosteroid therapy. The prevalence of CC-associated taxa was then assessed in patients with CD and UC to explore common microbial signatures. Statistical analyses and data processing were performed in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and SPSS Statistics software (Released 2015; IBM, and IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0.; IBM, Armonk, NY).",

By contrast, the fecal microbiome of patients with CC in remission resembled the microbiome of healthy controls. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed characterization of the microbiome of patients with CC which also identifies the possible common microbial shifts in patients with CC and IBD. Two descriptive reports on small series have been published previously (14,15). Consistent with our findings, Fischer et al. reported a marked reduction of Verrucomicrobia, Akkermansia spp., in 10 cases with CC. Interestingly, in our study, the patients with CC displayed a shift in some taxa, like the Ruminococcaceae family, which resembles the previously described IBD-associated dysbiosis (21,22). This could indicate that the microbiome plays a similar role in CC and IBD and that the pathogenesis of the diseases might have mechanisms related to the gut microbiome in common. The fact that we observed some of these microbial shifts in our cohort of patients with IBD strengthens this theory further.",

                    "text": "Similar to the hypothesis in IBD, it has been proposed that microscopic colitis could result from an aberrant immune response to the commensal gut microbiome (9). This is supported by the observed clinical improvement and histologic restoration in patients with CC after fecal stream diversion due to an ileostomy. Intriguingly, clinic relapse is most often seen at subsequent restoration of intestinal continuity (4,5). An infectious etiology to CC has also been proposed. The epithelial lymphocytosis in microscopic colitis is similar to the histologic findings of \u201cBrainerd diarrhea,\u201d i.e., outbreaks of long-standing acute watery diarrhea (23). Similarly, the reported seasonal variation in the onset of microscopic colitis and possible positive effect of antibiotics might point to the importance of an infectious agent or a microbial component (24,25). In a recent case report on the effect of fecal transplantation, a conversion from UC to CC was observed in a patient who experienced a pronounced change in the gut microbiota due to the treatment (26). In another case report, a beneficial effect of fecal transplantation was reported in a patient with steroid-resistant CC (27). Based on these observations, we aimed to characterize the fecal microbiota of patients with CC comparing with that of healthy controls and to identify possible changes, in common with patients with CD and UC, using 16S rRNA sequencing. We could not show any significant difference in the overall microbial composition, based on the SDI when patients with CC or UC were compared with healthy controls. Consistent with previous studies (11,28,29), patients with CD had a significant lower diversity compared with healthy controls. However, overall diversity might be a too simplified measure of the gut microbiota. In UC, conflicting results with both indifferent and reduced biodiversity have been shown when comparing microbiota in patients with healthy controls (28,30,31). An increasing difference in microbial composition between patients with CC and healthy controls was also observed with the degree of taxonomic resolution, becoming significant when comparing OTUs in our cohort. When specific OTUs were compared between patients with CC and healthy controls, we observed a difference in mean relative abundance of 36 OTUs. For most of these OTUs, a complex pattern was observed when analyzing the data at a family level, with an increased relative abundance for some OTUs but a decreased relative abundance for other OTUs within the same family. However, with respect to the Ruminococcaceae family, a consistent decrease in several OTUs was observed.",

An underrepresentation of species belonging to the family has previously been reported in IBD, especially in CD (22,32). Several species within the Ruminococcaceae family, like Ruminococcus species, are of importance for the maintenance of gut homeostasis, because they produce short-chain fatty acids and primarily butyrate. Butyrate is an important energy substrate for the intestinal mucosa and of importance for intestinal health, resistance to pathogenic microbes, and protection against colitis (11,33,34). Both in vitro and in vivo data indicate that F. prausnitzii, another member of the Ruminococcaceae family, also seem to have anti-inflammatory properties (11,34,35).",

Budesonide, a corticosteroid, is the drug of choice for treating CC, because it is effective in both inducing and maintaining remission (36). However, the relapse rate is high at dose reduction and after discontinuation (37). Therefore, many patients are kept at a minimal dose of corticosteroid to maintain remission. The patients with CC were divided into 2 categories; patients in remission without corticosteroid therapy and patients with active disease or ongoing corticosteroid therapy. For several taxa, a difference in relative abundance was observed in patients with active disease or ongoing corticosteroid treatment only, when compared with healthy controls. Thus, some taxa seem to be associated with disease activity, although our study design does not allow us to confirm causality. Several of the taxa that showed an association with disease activity or ongoing corticosteroid treatment belonged to the Ruminococcaceae family. However, a decreased relative abundance of Collinsella, Clostridiales, Coriobacteriaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae was also observed in this subgroup of patients with CC.",

                    "text": "The thorough clinical characterization of the patients with CC is a major strength of our study, although clinical activity at acquisition of fecal samples was not confirmed by histologic assessment. Comparisons with patients with CD and UC and with healthy controls from the general population strengthen the results further. Even though our study included 122 individuals, the number of patients with CC in each subgroup was limited when stratifying for disease activity and corticosteroid medication. The comparisons of patients with CD and UC with healthy controls were hampered by differences in age and sex, because the matching was performed on the basis of age and sex of the patients with CC. A limitation with the present study was that, in common with many previous studies of the gut microbiome in relation to various diagnoses, samples were obtained at a single point in time. Analyses of sequential samples from patients with CC, including those which cover periods of remission, relapse, and changes in treatment, as well as matched samples obtained over time from healthy controls would be a more powerful design to reveal the influence of the microbiome in CC. The use of fecal samples is another possible limitation, because it can be anticipated that it is the mucosal microbiome that is most important in CC. Further research on mucosal biopsies should be undertaken to investigate host-microbiota interactions in patients with CC. Alterations in the gut microbiota secondary to induced diarrhea and functional diarrhea have previously been described. Some of the shifts in the gut microbiota composition that have been associated with bowel cleansing resemble the alterations that have been seen in IBD (22,38,39). By contrast, the gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea has shown a different pattern. This indicates that diarrhea per se might have an impact on microbial composition and may represent a limitation for this study, even though the previous literature is inconsistent (40,41). Effects of retarded growth of certain species and overgrowth of other species due to environmental factors could have been minimized using a DNA-stabilizing agent. In general, samples are expected to have been shipped within 24 hours, but the fact that the duration of individual shipments was not specifically recorded limits the study further. Intersample differences in the number of obtained reads represent another potential source of uncertainty because we did not normalize the data by randomly picking a fixed number of reads. However, no correlation between the number of reads and number of OTUs or SDI was observed. The use of 16S amplicon sequencing may have negatively affected our possibilities to identify rare taxa, because the technique has limited the ability to detect low abundant taxa. Thus, the absence of CC-specific taxa must be interpreted with caution. Enrichment of antigens prevalent in different species of bacteria may also be of importance, with respect to the pathogenesis of CC. However, such enrichment cannot be detected by the method used, and further shotgun metagenomic sequencing-based studies of individuals with CC are warranted. Other clinical factors such as diet, blood trait, age, sex, BMI, and host genotype have also been associated with gut microbiota composition (42). Especially age, sex, and BMI have been identified as important potential confounders. To rule out that the results were confounded by any of these variables, the impact of age, sex, and BMI was examined by a principal coordinate analysis and an ANOSIM (see Figures 2, Supplementary Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A61). However, no differences were found, except for BMI, where a difference was observed between lean (BMI < 25) and obese (BMI > 30) participants. However, because obese participants were equally distributed in CC group and controls, we do not expect any impact on the observed differences between CC and healthy controls.",
