The luminal microbiota (LM) and the mucosal-associated microbiota (MAM) are 2 distinct ecosystems with different metabolic and immunological functions. Aim: To characterize the intestinal LM and MAM in humans using high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Methods: Fresh fecal samples and distal colonic mucosal biopsies collected from 24 healthy subjects before (fecal) and during (mucosa) a flexible sigmoidoscopy of an un-prepared bowel. High throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to characterize bacterial communities. Sequences were processed using the QIIME pipeline. Results: LM and MAM populations were significantly different (ANOSIM: R = 0.49, P = 0.001). The LM displayed tighter clustering compared to the MAM (average weighted UniFrac distances 0.27 \u00b1 0.05\u00a0vs. 0.43 \u00b1 0.09, P < 0.001, respectively), and showed higher diversity (Shannon diversity index: 4.96 \u00b1 0.37\u00a0vs 4.14 \u00b1 0.56, respectively, P < 0.001). The dominant phyla in the LM and MAM were significantly different: Firmicutes (41.4% vs. 29.1%, FDR < 0.0001, respectively), Bacteroidetes (20.2% vs. 26.3%, FDR < 0.05, respectively), Actinobacteria (22% vs. 12.6%, FDR < 0.0001, respectively) and Proteobacteria (9.3% vs. 19.3%, FDR < 0.0001, respectively). The abundance of 56 genera differed significantly (FDR < 0.1) between the 2 niches. All of the genera in the fecal microbiota were present in the MAM while 10 genera were found to be unique to the MAM. Conclusion: The LM and MAM are distinct microbial ecosystems that differ significantly from each other in microbial diversity and composition. These two microbial niches should be investigated independently to better understand the role of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease.",

The wide variety of the bacterial species in the GI tract exert numerous effects on the host and influence a variety of GI functions including metabolic activity, immune responses and motor-sensory functions.2,3 The intestinal microbiota consists of 2 separate microbial populations, the luminal microbiota (LM) and the mucosal-associated microbiota (MAM).4-6 Studies investigating the intestinal microbiota in humans have often used fecal samples because they are easily collected and only a few studies have investigated the MAM.7-12 Recent studies comparing the two microbial ecosystems demonstrated compositional and diversity differences between fecal microbiota (representing the luminal niche) and MAM in humans4,10,12 suggesting different roles for these two distinct microbial populations within the intestinal microbiota ecosystem. However, the majority of the studies that investigated the MAM in humans were performed on mucosal samples collected from the large bowel following bowel preparation for endoscopic procedures7-15 which has been shown to significantly affect the composition of the mucosal microbiota.15 Furthermore, the majority of studies that specifically investigated the MAM in humans have used non-sequenced based microbiology techniques such as microbial culture, qPCR12,16 and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP).17,18 To our knowledge there has been no study that investigated and directly compared the two microbial populations of the intestinal microbiota from unprepped bowels in humans using deep sequencing technology. Thus the degree to which the composition of the LM differs from the MAM in humans remains unclear.",

Our study included a cohort of healthy individuals that were carefully screened to exclude GI diseases, chronic symptoms, and recent use of interventions (e.g., antibiotics, probiotics, antidiarrheal, pro-motility and anti-inflammatory agents) that can alter their intestinal microbiota.",

                    "text": "In a previous study we used T-RFLP to compare the fecal and mucosal microbiota from unprepped colons of 16 patients with D-IBS and 21 healthy controls.17 We demonstrated a significantly higher level of microbial biodiversity in the fecal microbiota compared to MAM within both, samples collected from the D-IBS patients and samples collected from healthy controls. The increase in biodiversity in fecal compared to mucosal samples was greater in the healthy controls than in D-IBS patients. Another study using T-RFLP compared bacterial diversity and composition from rectal swabs and rectal mucosal biopsies from unprepped colons of 11 healthy volunteers.18 This study also found that the overall microbial diversity was higher in rectal swabs compared with rectal biopsies. Consistent with these studies our current study, using high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, demonstrates higher levels of microbial richness (based on the number of observed species) and diversity (based on the Shannon index of diversity) in fecal samples compared to mucosal samples from healthy individuals (Fig.\u00a01). Additionally, weighted Unifrac distances exhibited tighter clustering within fecal samples compared to the mucosal samples (Fig.\u00a02). UniFrac distances represent the fraction of branch length shared by any 2 samples' communities in a 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree generated by sequence data obtained from all samples. Weighted UniFrac analyses indicate microbiota community differences between sample groups due to differences in relative taxon abundance, whereas unweighted UniFrac analyses indicate community differences between sample groups based on the presence or absence of taxa.19 This suggests that despite high diversity levels, there is also higher similarity of dominant OTUs among fecal samples compared to mucosal samples. Our study also supports the notion that the LM and MAM are distinct niches in terms of bacterial composition (Fig.\u00a03). The dominant genera were different between the fecal microbiota and MAM. Out of 68 dominant genera, the proportion of 56 genera differed significantly between the 2 niches. Interestingly, of the genera that were more abundant in the MAM (n = 26) compared to the fecal microbiota, some were more than 10 fold higher, suggesting that these genera may be of greater importance at the mucosal level where their microbiologic, metabolic and/or immunologic effects may be more pronounced. In addition, it is important to note that while all of the dominant genera that were found in the fecal microbiota were also present in the MAM, certain dominant genera were represented solely at the MAM niche. This suggests that while studying the intestinal microbiota with the current technologies (down to the genus level) sampling and analyzing the fecal microbiota may not be sufficient as additional information can be generated when the MAM niche is studied. This principle was illustrated in determining dysbiosis in newly diagnosed IBD patients.10 Furthermore, our study also suggests that when investigating specific genera within the intestinal microbiota, one of the niches (LM or MAM) may be more informative than the other. For instance all genera belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum are more abundant at the MAM niche. Within this phylum most of the genera (7 out of 9, such as Acinetobacter, Ralstonia and Pseudomonas) were not represented in the LM niche. In contrast, all the genera of the Actinobacteria phylum were more abundant in the LM niche. For instance the relative proportion of Bifidobacterium was more than 5 fold higher in the LM compared to the MAM niche.",

For example, in our study Proprionibacterium (Actinobacteria) was found in 8 mucosal samples and no fecal sample, and Corynbacterium (Actinobacteria) was found in 7 mucosal samples and only 1 fecal sample. Both aerotolerant bacterial groups are not mentioned in Table\u00a01, as we could not report a statistical difference between LM and MAM niches. A potential mechanism for an increase of specific bacteria in the mucosal niche (Albenberg et\u00a0al.)21 includes expansion of asaccharolytic bacteria (bacteria that require proteinaceous substrates, that are thought to be more common in the mucosal niche due to shedding of intestinal epithelial cells) as energy sources. Indeed, the genera Finegoldia, Anaerococcus and Peptoniphilus (all belonging to the Firmicutes phylum- Table\u00a01) and the genus Porphyoromonas (Bacteroidetes phylum) are all significantly more abundant in the mucosal niche compared to the fecal niche and are all asaccharolytic, which is consistent with Albenberg et\u00a0al.'s study.21 Some of these findings were supported by gene functional analysis using the PICRUSt software that predicts gene function according to the 16S rRNA sequences. However, it should be noted that the PICRUSt software is limited in its accuracy (about 80%) for prediction of bacterial metagenomes and their function. Despite the differences between the two niches, 11 genera were common to all 44 samples. However, correlation analysis revealed that out of the 68 dominant genera only 4 genera demonstrate a strong (r=0.70) and significant correlation between the abundance of genera within the fecal and the MAM. This may suggest that these genera may have important dominant functional role at both the luminal and mucosal microbial niches and perhaps fecal studies of these genera may be extrapolated to the mucosal niche.",

Our study limitations include the LM was investigated from fecal samples representing the overall end product of the entire GI tract luminal microbiota. Furthermore, the biostructure of a fecal sample has been previously documented24 and had shown different bacterial composition in the inside and outside layers of the sample. Thus, a homogenized fecal sample is a mix of different microbial niches within the fecal sample while the mucosal biopsy represents a single microbial niche from a single site at the distal part of the colon.",

Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were picked using BLAST and the Greengenes reference database at a level of 97% similarity.30 For \u03b2 diversity (UniFrac distances) we analyzed 1,500 sequences from each sample (losing only one sample with less than 1,000 sequences that was not included in the analysis). This depth was chosen to encompass the majority of samples (n = 43) at an acceptable sequencing depth. UniFrac analysis was used to calculate the distance between OTUs/bacterial communities on a phylogenetic tree and principal coordinates were generated using un-weighted and weighted UniFrac distances for all samples.19,31 Weighted and un-weighted UniFrac distances represent compositional dissimilarity/heterogeneity (often refer to as \u03b2 diversity). However, un-weighted analysis considers only the presence or absence of bacterial groups thus, all bacterial groups have similar impact on the UniFrac distances. In weighed analysis the relative abundance of the bacterial groups within the communities is being accounted for and thus, the more abundant bacterial groups have a greater impact on the UniFrac distances. Principal coordinates Analysis (PCoA) plots were used to visualize the similarities or dissimilarities between the fecal and MAM that best represent the pair-wise distances between sample groups. Statistical differences in weighted and un-weight UniFrac distances between groups (\u03b2 diversity) were tested using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM \u2013 available through QIIME) by permutation of group membership with 999 replicates. The test statistic R, which measures the strength of the results, ranges from \u22121 to 1: R = 1 signifies differences between groups, while R = 0 signifies that the groups are identical.",

Sequences were rarefied at 10 sequencing depths in order to best visualize the change in diversity with respect to sampling depth. Samples that had less reads than the sequencing depth of a group sampled- were not included in that group. For example, if a sample has 1,500 reads, it was not included in the statistical analysis of the rarefied data of samples with 2,293, 4,576 or 7,620 reads. The upper bound of rarefaction is the median number of sequences for all samples (7,620). Ten sampling intervals were used. The number of observed bacterial species and the Shannon index of diversity (a measure of diversity taking into account richness and evenness of OTUs)27 were compared following rarefaction of OTUs using a Student's t test. The proportions of dominant bacterial taxa (taxa that appear in at least 25% of samples of within either fecal or mucosal niche) were normalized as previously described28 and compared using a student's t test. Briefly, to account for variability in depth of sequencing the abundance of each taxon (OTU/Phylum/etc.) in a given sample was normalized by calculating the logged sequence abundance using the following formula: Log10[(Frequency / # sequences in sample)*Average # of sequences per sample +1]. The relative proportions of the abundances were calculated and used for all statistics presented. Normalized taxa abundances from both niches were correlated with each other and using Pearson correlation. All results were corrected for multiple comparisons and were considered significant if false discovery rate (FDR) was <0.1.",
