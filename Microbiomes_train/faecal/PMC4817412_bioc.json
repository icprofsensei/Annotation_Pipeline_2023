Many of these studies including the Human Microbiome Project in the United States have involved obtaining stool samples to characterize the community composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota.7 Fewer studies have involved obtaining tissue samples from the intestinal tract during endoscopy or surgery. Surgical tissues are probably not ideal specimens for the study of the gastrointestinal microbiota in humans, as most if not all patients are expected to receive antibiotics of various kinds and varying intervals before surgical procedures. Antibiotics have been shown to affect the bacterial microbiota community significantly in the gastrointestinal tract.8 Alternatively, the study of the colonic microbiota using endoscopic tissue biopsies typically involves a colonoscopy, which requires a bowel preparation (BP) consisting of large doses of laxatives to evacuate most if not all of the stool from the colon. Typically, such a preparation is taken by the patient overnight before the procedure and results in 10\u201320 bowel movements, most of which are diarrheal stools. When the appearance of the stool is yellow or clear liquid without any solid particles within it, a patient is clinically considered to have taken an adequate BP. Hence, BPs can be considered a major disruptor of the colonic ecosystem, and it is unclear whether specimens obtained during colonoscopy are suitable for the study of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota and whether any bias is being introduced by the BP taken before the colonoscopy in colonic microbiota studies.",

As such, studies of the effects of BPs on the mucosal surface as well as the luminal/fecal compartment are needed.",

Patients who were scheduling for a routine surveillance colonoscopy for colorectal cancer were approached for recruitment. Subjects were recruited from the Rush University outpatient gastroenterology clinics. All subjects gave verbal and written informed consent. IBD subjects were identified and confirmed by chart review, through documented colonoscopy, pathology reports, lab tests, and medical history consistent with IBD. The inclusion criteria were as follows: HC patients who did not have any evidence of IBD were eligible for participation if they did not have any symptomatic organic gastrointestinal disorder other than a hiatus hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or hemorrhoids and were having a colonoscopy for colon cancer screening. IBD patients were eligible for participation if the patient had: (1) documented ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), based on classical medical history, endoscopic and/or surgical findings, and definite documented histopathology consistent with IBD at Rush University; (2) endoscopically inactive or mild disease at the time of the study for at least 2 weeks, as determined by a UC disease activity index of <4 (a modified Powell\u2013Tuck index) or a Harvey\u2013Bradshaw activity index <5 for CD patients. All patients were required to have stable dietary habits over the past 1 year before enrollment. The extensive exclusion criteria are found in the supportive Supplementary Table S1 online and include use of any antibiotics within the past 30 days and many comorbid conditions. While not part of the inclusion or exclusion criteria, review of patient records showed that our patients were not on any probiotics or antibiotics within the past 3 months before the study, and more than 1 year had passed since any of our IBD patients had a BP for an endoscopic procedure. Eight IBD subjects (n=5 for CD; n=3 for UC) and 10 non-IBD asymptomatic healthy volunteers (HC subjects) were enrolled in the study. All UC subjects had pancolitis, 1 CD subject had Crohn's colitis only, and the other 4 CD subjects had ileocolonic disease location. A majority (75%) of the IBD patients were on 5-aminosalicylates, and 5/8 (63%) were on immunosuppressive medications (with one patient on a stable dose of steroids, three patients on purine analogs, and one patient on a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor). Seven of the eight IBD patients were in remission and one subject with CD had mildly active disease. All patients except two had excellent or good BPs: One patient in the IBD group and one patient in the HC group had fair but adequate BPs. One UC subject had mild patchy disease in the descending colon on endoscopy and histopathology. Three CD patients had endoscopic involvement with disease at the time of colonoscopy: one of these patients had moderate ileocolonic anastomotic disease and few aphthae in the rectosigmoid. Of the other two CD subjects who had endoscopic involvement, one had terminal ileal involvement, few punctuate ulcerations in the cecal area, and a few left colon colocolonic anastomotic ulcerations. The other had gross involvement of the terminal ileum only on endoscopy with patchy distortion of vascular pattern and atrophy of the mucosa throughout the colon. Although subjects had mild endoscopic disease, biopsies for this study were obtained from endoscopically normal/non-ulcerated appearing areas of the colon. Additional subject characteristics are shown in Table 1. Clinical characteristics related to IBD subjects are shown in Table 2. Characteristics related to BP and the endoscopic procedures are shown in Table 3. For IBD patients, the histopathological involvement of tissue specimens obtained during colonoscopy is shown in Supplementary Table S2.",

Second, within a week (<7 days) after the first procedure, a prepped colonoscopy was performed to obtain the post-BP samples. The subjects were specifically asked not to alter their diet between the procedures. None of the subjects took any antibiotics in between or during the procedures. During both procedures, mucosal biopsies were taken from the distal sigmoid at 20\u2009cm from the anal verge and fecal samples were also collected. During the flexible sigmoidoscopy, pre-BP biopsies were obtained at about 20\u2009cm from the anal verge in an area of the colon that appeared pink and was grossly devoid of solid or mucoid stool, with a standard sterile 2.2\u2009mm colonic biopsy forceps. Pre-BP fecal samples were collected during sigmoidoscopy with a sterile disposable Roth net. During colonoscopy, post-BP fecal samples were suctioned into a standard sterile Luken's trap (Allegiance Lukens Tube by Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH) via the scope. During colonoscopy, post-BP biopsies were obtained about 1\u20132\u2009in away from the prior sampling area in normal looking mucosa, at about 20\u2009cm from the anal verge, with a standard sterile 2.2\u2009mm colonic biopsy forceps. We made sure to sample normal mucosa and did not sample any areas that are grossly inflamed or ulcerated because of the prior biopsies or because of IBD. Both endoscopic procedures were performed using Olympus video scopes (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA). All samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of collection within minutes in the endoscopy room and then stored in a \u221280\u2009\u00b0C freezer until the time of analysis. Subjects were allowed to use their clinically prescribed BP. At the time of the colonoscopy, after BP, subject's medical and surgical and social and family history, medications (drugs taken within the past 24\u2009h, the past week, the past month, and the past 3 months, along with the duration of use of these), type of BP consumed, and the amount of BP consumed were recorded. The quality of the BP was assessed and documented by the physician performing the procedure using the Aronchick scale.18 Subjects with fair or inadequate BPs were excluded from the study. Disease activity of IBD patients were characterized using the Harvey\u2013Bradshaw index for the CD patients19 and a modified Powell-Tuck index for the UC patients.20, 21 Disease location and behavior was characterized using the Montreal classification for CD.22 Maximal disease extent was characterized using the Montreal classification for UC.23 Additionally, endoscopic findings were also recorded along with the endoscopic appearance of the site of sampling. For IBD patients, the endoscopic involvement of the site where the biopsies were obtained, was graded on a scale from 0\u20133 by the physician performing the endoscopic procedure: 0=no involvement with disease (i.e., normal appearing mucosa); 1=mild colitis (<5 aphthous ulcerations that have a diameter of 5\u2009mm or less, or mild loss of vascular pattern with granularity); 2=moderate colitis (multiple small and large aphthous ulcerations with edema, erythema, loss of vascular pattern, and contact friability); and 3=severe colitis (majority of the mucosa ulcerated with small and large ulcerations, and spontaneous friability).",

The Unifrac metric is a calculation of the branch length of the phylogenetic tree that is shared between two samples. If the value of Unifrac is 1, the two samples compared are as unrelated as they can be in terms of their bacterial composition. As Unifrac values approach zero, the two samples that are being compared get closer and closer in terms of their bacterial composition. Therefore, in general, the higher the Unifrac distance is, the higher the compositional differences between two samples. An unweighted Unifrac calculation gives equal importance to rare and common bacteria within a sample and is similar to a presence/absence type analysis. Unifrac can be weighted based on the percent abundance of bacteria within a sample. A weighted Unifrac calculation gives a higher importance to the most abundant bacteria in the sample.37 Unweighted and weighted Unifrac distance matrices were calculated in QIIME VB1.5.",

The aim is to identify those species that show high fidelity to a particular group or environmental condition, and in our case, to the pre- or post-BP state, and as such serve as an indicator for the latter. ISA was performed at the phylum and genus levels in PC-ORD (MjM Software Design, Gleneden Beach, OR) using the Dufr\u00e9ne and Legendre method and the significance of each indicator value (observed maximum indicator value for each species) was tested by the Monte Carlo randomization test at 4,999 permutations.

We performed three comparisons for each index.

Third, we compared the baseline differences between the HC vs. IBD groups (a secondary analysis), and examined whether the differences between the HC vs. IBD changed after BP, because the effect of BP could differ owing to the inherent differences between a healthy colon or a colon with colitis.",

One important gut ecosystem perturbation, not only clinically but also in terms of obtaining undistorted samples for meaningful research, is that induced by BP. We found that BP causes qualitative and quantitative changes in the bacterial composition in both biopsies and fecal samples, i.e., in both the mucosa-associated and the luminal microbiota compartments of the colon. Such changes in both compartments highlight the need to pay careful attention to sample collection procedures in studies of the colonic microbiome.",

Furthermore, the changes in one sample type (i.e., biopsy vs. fecal samples) did not appear to mirror what was seen in the other sample type in individual subjects. When apparent, the reductions in \u03b1-diversity were seen in composite indices, mostly in the mucosa-associated compartment, and the type of metric that was altered post-BP varied in health and disease: a reduction in PD-WT was seen in the biopsies of HC subjects, and a reduction in the SI was seen in the biopsies of IBD subjects after BP. It appears that in health i.e., when a sample is inherently expected to be highly diverse compared with a disease state,43, 44, 45, 46 changes in \u03b1-diversity can be most noticeable with loss of rare phylotypes at high levels of taxonomy, resulting in reductions in the PD-WT metric. In a disease state similar to IBD, i.e., when a sample is expected to have reduced diversity inherent to the presence of disease,46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 BP-related perturbations appear to be more noticeable in count-based composite diversity indices such as the SI, and only trends are observed in the PD-WT metric. In fecal samples reflecting the luminal component, the direction of change in \u03b1-diversity with BP was highly variable and less consistent compared with the biopsy samples reflecting the mucosa-associated compartment. In fact, in secondary comparisons, subtle reductions in evenness in IBD (compared with HC) noticeable in the fecal samples before BP was not apparent after BP, suggesting that perturbations of the gastrointestinal tract bacteria with BP could adversely affect experiments studying differences in health vs. colitis with fecal samples obtained at the time of colonoscopy, and can potentially lead to false-negative results. Alternatively, one may require larger sample sets to discover differences between IBD and HCs with such samples.",

Examination of the shared OTUs pre- and post-BP samples revealed that there was little overlap between the two time points. This suggests a massive change of 2/3 of the microbial OTUs within the colonic ecosystem after a seemingly temporary and nonselective perturbation of the ecosystem with BP. This change was not only apparent in the fecal samples as expected but also in the biopsy samples reflecting the mucosa-associated compartment. The latter finding suggests that the short-term effect of BP can be profound on the colon ecosystem at the OTU level. This change also appeared to affect more rare taxa, reflected by numerically higher unweighted Unifrac distances vs. weighted Unifrac distances. In HC, the differences post-BP was most apparent in the biopsy samples and in rare taxa. In IBD, the changes were mostly in the fecal compartment after BP, and appeared to affect both abundant and rare taxa, revealing reductions in both the unweighted and the weighted Unifrac distances.",

Additionally in the healthy state, there were notable reductions in families within the Bifidobacteriales order; in Erysipelotrichaceae; in unclassified families and genera from the Clostridiales; and in an unclassified genus from Campylobacteraceae. In IBD subjects, reductions were seen in the Clostridiaceae and in the Bacilli. Studies examining these particular phylotypes should take into account the effects of BPs. For example, our results suggest that studies examining Bifidobacteriales are less likely to find differences between healthy non-colitis patients and a disease state if conducted with samples obtained post-BP. Similarly, studies conducted with relatively rarer bacteria such as those belonging to unclassified taxa are less likely to find differences between cases and controls, if conducted using samples obtained post-BP. Therefore, the short-term effects with BPs mentioned above suggest that the effects and their magnitude in health and disease have to be taken into account when designing clinical translational studies of the lower gut microbiota.",

Additionally, some of the changes that we have observed on the mucosal surface such as trends for reduction in diversity, and loss of rare taxa call into question what can be expected from the practice of colon cleansing to promote gut health. For example, in IBD, it is a well-known clinical fact that severe colitis cases can clinically worsen significantly after administration of BP.56 Our findings demonstrating a loss of separation between the mucosal and luminal compartments post-BP in IBD strongly suggest that a barrage of abundant and rare commensal bacteria that are normally kept in the luminal compartment can gain access to the mucosal surface to worsen the inflammatory reaction in this compartment.",

Similarly, Bibiloni et al.16 compared three specimen types (namely washed biopsy samples after BP, fecal samples obtained during colonoscopy, and fecal samples before BP) from 15 subjects using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis: there were no differences in bacterial fingerprints after BP. Contrary to these, Mai et al.13 examined the fecal microbiota before, at 2\u20134 weeks, and at 6\u20138 weeks after colonoscopy with DGGE in five subjects with various endoscopic findings (including polyps and colonic inflammation) and showed that bacterial fingerprint profiles were similar only in 2/5 subjects pre- and post-colonoscopy. Furthermore, in the latter study, when DGGE, fluorescent in situ hybridization with various bacterial primers, and cloning and sequencing techniques were compared, inconsistent results were observed across examination techniques, highly supporting the notion that the inherent resolution of a particular technique significantly impacts the results obtained. Goossens et al.12 studied the effects of BP on the composition of the fecal samples obtained before and after BP with DGGE in 22 subjects and showed that bacterial profile similarities were high with a mean around 86%, and that overall banding patterns did not change significantly but some changes in individual bands occurred, mainly in the first week after BP, suggesting that BP could have an influence on specific bacterial species. When fecal samples obtained before and after colonoscopy were examined by analysis of DGGE profiles, O'Brien et al.15 found that the similarity coefficients between pre- and post-colonoscopy samples were within the range of normal temporal variation in 11/14 of the subjects, whereas the rest (constituting about 21% of the subjects) had short-term changes.",

In general, the normal temporal variation in fecal samples obtained from \u201cHCs\u201d 3\u20136 months apart appeared similar in magnitude to the changes induced by BP over 1\u20133 months. When the authors sought to determine whether there were any clinical factors that may explain the findings in the patients who had received BPs, three patients with UC showed short-term changes in their microbiota after BP, with two of them showing a lasting effect upto 3 months. O' Brien et al.15 also assessed the OTUs contributing to change in bacterial composition in their samples and did not find any one OTU showing a rise or fall after BP. When the distribution of the two major phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were examined, there were large but inconsistent shifts (>32%) in the relative proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, observed in the cases in which samples over time were dissimilar. Interestingly, 4/5 of the unprepped cases had rises in Firmicutes, which is compatible with our data demonstrating an increase in Bacteroidetes with BP. O'Brien et al.15 also did not note a difference in Jaccard distances (a metric that is based on the presence and absence of organisms) in fecal samples obtained pre- and post-BP. In this regard, their conclusions could be different than ours because of a variety of factors: they did not have a consistent sampling interval between controls who were not prepped and the cases who were prepped; they only examined fecal samples; their shortest sampling intervals in the prepped cases were as high as 2 weeks; their prepped cases were analyzed together and contained a mixture of IBD and non-colitis patients and the effects can vary in terms of disease as well as its activity at the time of sampling, which is not detailed; the Jaccard index used in their study differs from the various metrics that are more frequently used in microbiota studies that we have used and is a presence and absence analysis; and the study had half the number of subjects relative to ours, with three comparison points that could have led to a statistically negative result.",

The latter study clearly demonstrated that terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, the highest resolution technique among fingerprinting techniques, failed to show differences compared with cloning and sequencing. This finding confirms that the false-negative results obtained from low-resolution analyses are because of the limitations of the analysis technique and not because of the lack of differences from BP. In the limited cloning and sequencing part of the latter study, mucosal biopsy samples were obtained a week apart in three subjects who were given a BP and in four subjects who were controls (n=2 controls given a liquid diet and n=2 controls given a general diet); 288 colonies were analyzed per sample, thus the sequencing was limited compared with our study. There was a reduction in richness and the Shannon diversity index on the mucosal surface after BP. Although we did not observe a significant overall reduction in richness, there was also a trend toward reduced richness in our sample set. Harrell et al.57 also studied Unifrac distances in the three prepped samples and their distance calculations are similar to ours, suggesting a mean Unifrac distance around 0.6, which can be interpreted as a similarity of about 30\u201340% between the pre- and post-BP samples. While Harrell et al.57 did not find one particular phylotype to be consistently altered, their sample size and depth of sampling were not adequate to detect these types of changes.",

Technical replicates of two separate nucleic acid extractions from the biopsy and fecal samples were pyrosequenced and Unifrac distances were examined using 400 sequences per sample. Results revealed that the different colonic regions were just as similar as technical replicates within the same colonic region. Contrary to this, technical replicates of fecal samples were found disparate enough to result in significant changes. In unadjusted comparisons, the biopsy samples also differed from fecal specimens, and these differences were most apparent when fecal samples before colonoscopy were compared with colonic biopsy samples after BP, when both rare and abundant taxa were analyzed using weighted and unweighted Unifrac distances. Owing to the limited number of sequences and subjects, this study did not examine any of the taxa that differed pre- and post-BP. Overall, their findings are similar to the results of our study, which is conducted at more than two times the sampling depth, in a much larger sample set of healthy patients and IBD patients, and we have also analyzed alterations in specific phylotypes.",

Therefore, the findings pertain to short-term changes in the microbiome. We also did not control for random drift over the few days of sampling interval in our study; therefore, given our study design, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that variations in the sampling site or random drift within a few days can result in profound differences in microbiome composition. This, however, is unlikely as random drift and sampling site variations and dietary changes were previously studied and the observed effects were significantly smaller compared with the effects of BP.57 Additionally, our findings are limited to sequencing depths in the few thousands.
