However, studies on the eukaryotic component of the intestinal microbiota have just begun and have not yet been conducted in HIV-infected patients. Moreover, eukaryotic community profiling is influenced by the use of different methodologies at each step of culture-independent techniques. Herein, initially, four DNA extraction protocols were compared to test the efficiency of each method in recovering eukaryotic DNA from fecal samples. Our results revealed that recovering eukaryotic components from fecal samples differs significantly among DNA extraction methods. Subsequently, the composition of the intestinal eukaryotic microbiota was evaluated in HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers through clone sequencing, high-throughput sequencing of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers 1 (ITS1) and 2 (ITS2) amplicons and real-time PCRs. Our results revealed that not only richness (Chao-1 index) and alpha diversity (Shannon diversity) differ between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, depending on the molecular strategy used, but also the global eukaryotic community composition, with little overlapping taxa found between techniques. Moreover, our results based on cloning libraries and ITS1/ITS2 metabarcoding sequencing showed significant differences in fungal composition between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, but without distinct clusters separating the two groups. Malassezia restricta was significantly more prevalent in fecal samples of HIV-infected patients, according to cloning libraries, whereas operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were significantly more abundant in fecal samples of HIV-infected patients compared to healthy subjects in both ITS subregions. Finally, real-time PCR showed the presence of Microsporidia, Giardia lamblia, Blastocystis and Hymenolepis diminuta in different proportions in fecal samples from HIV patients as compared to healthy individuals. Our work revealed that the use of different sequencing approaches can impact the perceived eukaryotic diversity results of the human gut. We also provide a more comprehensive view of the eukaryotic community in the gut of HIV-infected patients through the complementarity of the different molecular techniques used. Combining these various methodologies may provide a gold standard for a more complete characterization of the eukaryotic microbiome in future studies.",

The deterioration in host immunity of patients with HIV makes them more susceptible to a variety of opportunistic bacteria, fungi and parasites during their lifetime [2,3]. One major health risk in HIV-infected patients is infection by the intestinal eukaryotic population (i.e., microbial eukaryotic communities living inside the human gut as commensal flora in addition to bacteria and archaea), including fungi and parasites [4]. Therefore, understanding the diversity of these eukaryotes in the gut of healthy individuals as well as in immunocompromised patients is necessary in order to understand their role in both health and disease [5].",

Indeed, many studies have used specific PCR-based methods to detect certain parasitic agents such as Entamoeba histolytica (Amoebozoa), Cryptosporidium spp. (Alveolata), Cystoisospora belli (Alveolata) and members of Microsporidia (Fungi) in feces of HIV/AIDS patients [6,14\u201318]. However, the development of culture-independent molecular techniques, including direct DNA extraction from feces followed by clone sequencing, as well as high-throughput sequencing methods, offers new opportunities to estimate the diversity of eukaryotes in the human gut by providing data on the entire eukaryotic community, particularly on not-yet-cultured or fastidious organisms in healthy individuals [5,19\u201321] and patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, hepatitis B virus (HBV), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), intestinal transplant patients [22\u201324] and children with Hirschsprung disease [25]. Despite their advantages in understanding the normal diversity of our eukaryotic gut microbiota, culture-independent approaches face several challenges and pitfalls associated with the experimental protocol, such as DNA extraction methods, primer choice, sequencing technologies, bioinformatics analysis of the data and lack of perfect reference databases [26\u201328].",

Each method has its individual performance with certain groups of gut eukaryotes [29,30]. Furthermore, the correct choice of the primer binding site is another challenge for better profiling the eukaryotic gut microbiota. To characterize eukaryotic communities, different regions of the eukaryotic genome have been targeted, such as the 18S rRNA gene, nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), or the 28S rRNA gene [5,19,31]. The ITS region is the formal barcode for fungi nowadays [32], which is useful for genus and species assignment. The 18S or 28S rRNA genes can be used as an alternative to the ITS region, but they often lack discriminatory power at the species level and thus cannot provide accurate taxonomic classifications [33,34]. Finally, the methodological variation between different approaches, such as the PCR-cloning library and high-throughput sequencing techniques, represent another challenge towards true characterization of the eukaryote community composition in the human gut, due to the fact that no approach can guarantee the assessment of entire eukaryotic components in the same proportion in which they exist in the gut [5,27,35].",

DNA was analyzed by both conventional clone sequencing and high-throughput sequencing. Finally, as many pathogens with low load could be missed in metagenomic analyses, real-time PCR was used to detect important enteric parasites in the feces of both HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers.",

Then, the DNA was amplified by two universal primers targeting the 18S gene for eukaryotes (Euk 1A and Euk 516r) and ITS sequence for fungi (ITS1F and ITS4R), followed by cloning and sequencing. Overall, 4,992 clones were analyzed from both PCRs using 4 different extraction methods (1248 clones/extraction), resulting in the identification of 51 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) (S1 and S2 Tables). The extraction method E1 resulted in the greatest yield of unique eukaryotic MOTUs (Fig 1) and was thus selected and used for downstream analyses. Forty different MOTUs of eukaryotes (78% of the total recovered MOTUs) were retrieved in both libraries, in which 9 particular MOTUs were uniquely retrieved with this extraction method (S2 Table, Fig 1). Thirty-four fungal MOTUs (67%) were detected using the two libraries in extraction method E2. Among these 34 MOTUs, 6 fungal MOTUs were efficiently detected only with this extraction method (S2 Table, Fig 1). A total of 28 fungal MOTUs were obtained using extraction method E3 (S2 Table, Fig 1). The extraction method E4 was less efficient in extracting eukaryotic DNA from the feces of HIV-infected patients than the other methods, with only 22 sequences belonging to fungal MOTUs recovered in both the fungal ITS and 18S rRNA libraries (S2 Table, Fig 1). Statistical comparison of MOTU richness (Chao-1 index) and alpha diversity (Shannon index) among the extraction protocols showed significant differences (S1 Fig). The Chao-1 and Shannon indices indicated that diversity was significantly higher in the fecal samples extracted using E1 and E2 methods (with a slight advantage for E1) compared to E3 and E4 extraction methods (S1 Fig).",

Although the PERMANOVA (permutational multivariate analysis of variance) test on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices showed significant differences in fungal composition between the two studied groups (p = 0.0007, pseudo-F score = 2.949), no defined clustering of HIV-infected samples versus healthy samples was found (Fig 2). These results indicate that the variation in fungal composition within samples in each group is higher than the variation between the two groups. Finally, gender (in both groups), CD4+ cell count, viral load and antiretroviral treatment (in HIV-infected patients) (S6 Table) had no significant impact on the differences in fungal composition of the samples as determined by the PERMANOVA test.",

However, in contrast to the results obtained with clone sequences, the Shannon diversity was significantly higher in healthy volunteers compared to HIV-infected patients in both ITS1 and ITS2 datasets (p = 0.0034 and p<0.0001, respectively) (S3 Fig).",

                    "text": "Human intestinal eukaryotes have traditionally been studied from parasitological and pathological points of view in the gut of HIV-infected patients using either microscopic or culture-based methods [2,4,6\u201311,13]. Since eukaryotic components of the human gut microbiome remain relatively unexplored in these immunocompromised patients by molecular methods, investigating the composition of the human gut eukaryote microbiota through culture-independent methods was the main objective of this study. Although molecular methods including traditional cloning/sequencing and metagenomics have greatly improved our knowledge in evaluating human gut mycobiome [37], these methods have several limitations with respect to eukaryotic as compared to bacterial community profiling, including DNA extraction and taxonomic classification challenges, and PCR amplification and sequencing platform biases [38,39]. Herein, the effect of DNA extraction methods on fecal eukaryota alpha diversity was assessed based on Chao-1 (MOTU richness) and Shannon H\u2019 diversity. Significant differences in MOTU richness and Shannon diversity were observed among the 4 extraction methods (S1 Fig). The combination of mechanical, chemical and enzymatic steps in extraction method E1 might significantly improve recovering of relatively higher fungal DNA alpha diversity compared to other methods. Therefore, this method (i.e., E1) was selected for subsequent procedures. Moreover, in this study, we provide a more comprehensive picture of the fungal community in the gut of HIV-infected patients by using multiple complementary approaches (traditional cloning/sequencing, high-throughput amplicon-based sequencing, in conjunction with multiple primer sets) to profile fungal sequences. Considering all stool samples from both groups, the OTU richness and Shannon diversity significantly varied between techniques (S6 Fig). The cloning/sequencing method applied in this study has the potential to detect greater fungal diversity, as compared to the high-throughput sequencing method. This could be explained by the use of multiple universal primer sets in the cloning step which lead to reduced PCR amplification biases, as well as keeping the rare fungal OTUs in the samples. However, it is still uncertain how much diversity was missed by this technique, due to the limited number of clones analyzed. On the other hand, the use of ITS1 or ITS2 sequences to profile fungal communities has been promoted in part because they are amenable to the short read-lengths generated by most high-throughput sequencing platforms [21,40\u201342]. However, many studies have shown that amplification of ITS1 versus ITS2 is associated with fungal taxonomic biases [43,44]. Therefore, targeting both the ITS1 and ITS2 regions may provide a more complete assessment of fungal diversity in environmental samples [45\u201347]. Surprisingly, there were differences in alpha diversity (Chao-1 and Shannon indices) between the 2 groups, depending on the molecular approach (cloning/sequencing versus high-throughput amplicon-based sequencing) (S3 Fig). This means that all previous studies based on one molecular approach (either clone library sequencing or ITS metabarcoding) might not provide the real alpha diversity and richness as we don\u2019t know actually which approach can give the closest results to the reality. Thus, these disparate results will require careful consideration in the future.",

                    "text": "From the 5,328 clone sequences that were collected from HIV-infected patients and control subjects, a total of 93 eukaryotic MOTUs were detected (80 fungi and 2 stramenopiles were found in HIV samples and 35 fungal MOTUs, along with 2 MOTU belonging to stramenopiles identified in the feces of the healthy control individuals). Our results from analyzing the clone library revealed that M. restricta was abundant in the feces of HIV-infected patients. This lipophilic yeast is naturally present on skin and human mucosal sites as either a part of cutaneous commensal flora or associated with several superficial infections of the skin, such as seborrheic dermatitis, pityriasis versicolor, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis [48]. Using culture and molecular methods, we have previously documented the presence of several species of Malassezia, including M. globosa, M. restricta and M. pachydermatis, in the gut of obese and healthy individuals and from different geographic locations, including France, Senegal, India, Amazonia and Polynesia [5,49,50]. Furthermore, metagenomic studies have demonstrated that the presence of Malassezia spp. in children is associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) and Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) [25], while Malassezia restricta has been found in fecal samples of healthy human subjects [51]. We were unable to amplify M. restricta in the fecal samples of healthy volunteers using a cloning sequencing approach. Their absence could either be due to the small size of the control samples involved in the experimental study, or insufficient M. restricta DNA caused by bias in the DNA extraction, amplification and cloning process. In immunocompromised patients, members of Malassezia are often associated with several dermatological disorders (such as seborrheic dermatitis and folliculitis) that usually develop in patients with underlying immunosuppression resulting from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, organ transplantation and lymphoid malignancies [52]. The increased incidence of seborrheic dermatitis in HIV-infected patients suggests that the deterioration in host immunity plays a critical role in the progression of this type of disease [52]. Infrequently, Malassezia species may also be able to cause a variety of systematic invasive infections, such as fungemia, peritonitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis and meningitis [53,54]. In our study, the increased abundance of M. restricta in the HIV-infected patient fecal samples requires further investigation, to see whether this fungus can play a potential opportunist role in the gut of HIV-infected patients.",

                    "text": "The high-throughput Illumina sequencing approach enabled us to obtain a total of 45 and 33 fungal OTUs by analyzing the ITS1 region of both HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, respectively, and 44 and 34 OTUs by analyzing the ITS2 region of the HIV-infected patients and healthy individuals, respectively. Of note, ITS1 and ITS2 sequences showed relatively different results for the fungal community structure at the species/genus level. The complementarity of ITS1 and ITS2 datasets suggested that targeting both fungal ITS subregions might be a useful strategy to ensure that fungal diversity is more completely represented for all fecal samples. Such complementarity was also detected in fungal diversity analyses of other environmental samples, including soil samples [47]. Additionally, real-time PCR survey for detection of enteric parasites was also conducted, to overcome the challenge of low parasite numbers in fecal samples. Most studies that have used culture-independent approaches to investigate eukaryotes in the human gut have shown the dominance of fungi over other eukaryotes [5,19,20,31,50]. A significant increase in fungal diversity in the gut has been noted in certain diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and hepatitis B virus infection [22,23]. The CD4+ T-cell response is the normal gastrointestinal mucosal defense mechanism against colonization of the human body by fungi [55]. Therefore, any disturbance or impairment of this immune response may cause patients with HIV to be more susceptible to fungal diseases [56,57], particularly in patients with low CD4+ T lymphocyte counts [4]. Our data from ITS1 and ITS2 analyses revealed that C. albicans and C. tropicalis were more abundant in HIV-infected patients. A similar finding has been reported in the study of Hoarau et al. [58], in which Crohn\u2019s disease dysbiosis was associated with a significant increase in the abundance of C. tropicalis. It remains to be determined if the increased abundance of some fungi in the gastrointestinal tracts of HIV-infected patients puts them at risk of mucosal and invasive infections with these same fungi. Other rarely detected human gut fungi retrieved in this study, such as foodborne, plant pathogens and wood decay fungi, might gain entrance to the human gut as a reflection of dietary and environmental factors [51,59]. Foodborne fungi such as Wallemia, which was also previously detected in human fecal samples [21], might be present in the gut via dietary associations. Wood-rotting fungi such as Polyporales and Peniophora, which have also been detected in healthy human gut and in the lower airways in patients with cystic fibrosis, respectively [49,60], are thought to be transient fungi in the gut, due to consuming plant-based foods.",
