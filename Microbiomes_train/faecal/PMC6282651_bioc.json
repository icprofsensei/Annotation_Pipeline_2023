Septic shock is a subset of sepsis, with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction associated with a high risk of mortality [1]. Several interventions have been reported to improve the prognosis of sepsis; however, the clinical trials of various therapies, such as activated protein C [2], heparin [3], or carnitine [4], have failed to demonstrate consistent benefits; thus, a more personalized approach towards sepsis care is urgently needed. Until now, efforts to stratify septic patients have been hampered by the lack of more specific biomarkers. Genetic diversity defined as the carriage of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of genes accounts for some of the individual variability. Cytokines, soluble receptors, cell-surface molecules, and vasoactive hormones have all been evaluated for their diagnostic and prognostic utility in sepsis [5]. Evidence shows a single biomarker cannot successfully reflect the complex pathophysiologic processes that occur in sepsis, and more biomarkers are needed to achieve the goal of individualized management of sepsis [6]. The gut microbiota is a highly metabolically active human \u2018organ\u2019 that may be a novel focus of sepsis research.",

In the case of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, Bacteroides and Firmicutes are the main categories of healthy intestinal flora, accounting for 89\u201398% of all involved bacteria [8]. The gut microbiome of patients with sepsis is often characterized by low diversity, low abundance of key commensal genera (such as Faecalibacterium, Blautia, and Ruminococcus), and is sometimes overgrowth by a single genus [9]. Gut microbiome dysbiosis can be attributed to the use of parenteral feeding, gastric acid inhibitory drugs, antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation [9].

This study strictly complies with the Helsinki Declaration. Patients were eligible if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) Age \u226518 years and (2) Sepsis was defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Organ dysfunction can be assessed by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more [1]. Septic shock was defined as a subset of sepsis, which was identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. APACHE II scores were recorded at the time of admission to the ICU. The first fecal sample was collected immediately after admission to the ICU. Fifteen non-smoking, healthy volunteers formed a control group",

The primary diagnosis of patients across the group differed with respect to severe acute pancreatitis, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe pneumonia, gastrointestinal perforation, and severe hepatitis. A major source of infection was lung (10/15) and enterocoelia (4/15). Enteral nutrition and probiotics were used in 11/15 and 8/15 subjects. Most patients were administered more than 3 types of antimicrobial drugs. Blood culture was positive in only 2 patients: Escherichia coli and Parabacteroides distasonis, respectively. On the other hand, sputum culture mainly consisted of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. About one-third of the patients had died. Only 2/15 pathogens were identified in blood cultures in our study, which was quite low. It may due to high rate of antibiotics used before the patients were transferred from general ward. The antibiotics used for a long time before blood cultures was conducted would result in a low positive rate of blood culture.",

The abundance of Proteobacteria in these samples was <2% in most healthy subjects (mean 3.52%), while Tenericutes was found in 4 healthy subjects (mean 2.30%). Compared to healthy subjects, the stool microbiota composition of septic shock patients showed a remarkable individual variation. Although Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the primary bacteria, the mean proportion of both decreased (42.38% vs. 30.27%). A significantly higher proportion of Proteobacteria was found in sepsis patients as compared to healthy subjects (mean relative proportion: 23.71% vs. 3.53%, p<0.05); similarly, a higher proportion of Fusobacteria (mean relative proportion: 1.27% vs. 0.12%, p=0.59) did not differ significantly. Furthermore, patient no. 7 demonstrated a high proportion of Proteobacteria (94%) in the stool sample and was eventually died in the hospital. Another patient, no. 13, presented 12.23% Actinobacteria. This phylum of Gram-positive bacteria, especially Streptomyces spp., was identified as the producer of several bioactive metabolites that are beneficial to humans. Actinobacteria-derived antibiotics included aminoglycosides, anthracyclines, chloramphenicol, macrolide, and tetracyclines.",

                    "text": "The microbiome plays a major role in health and disease, including diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. However, little is known about the composition of the intestinal microbiota and its effect on septic shock patients. An observational study by Lankelma et al. [10] collected stool samples from 34 ICU patients and found that more than half of the patients had significantly reduced intestinal diversity. They also found no correlation between microbiota diversity and prognosis. Moreover, the Shannon index in all healthy subjects was > 4, while that in the current study was <4. This phenomenon might be due to the difference in race and dietary habits between the Eastern and Western hemispheres. However, that study started in 2012, so sepsis was not defined according to the most recently proposed criteria, including organ failure. The present study, which included patients meeting the Third International Consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock, demonstrated similar results, including reduced microbiota diversity and overgrowth of 1 or 2 bacterial species. A study by Ojima et al. [11] evaluated the mechanism underlying the gut microbiota change in ICU patients. They collected fecal samples on days 1\u20132, 2\u20134, 5\u20138, and 7\u201310 after admission. Subsequent dynamic changes in the percentages of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were significant; however, the result was limited by the small sample size (12 patients), and the analysis of gut microbiota was limited to the phylum level. In another small-sample study by Zaborin et al. [15], 14 selected patients, during their prolonged stay in the ICU, were analyzed and local environmental conditions in the gut were found to direct the pathogen communities to adapt to either a commensal or pathogenic style. McDonald et al. [16] collected fecal, oral, and skin samples from 115 mixed ICU patients, and found that critical illness was associated with the loss of normal, \u201chealth promoting\u201d bacteria, allowing overgrowth of disease-promoting pathogenic bacteria (dysbiosis), which in turn makes patients susceptible to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, and organ failure. The limitation was that the study included ICU patients with varying diagnosis types and ages, which contributed to increased variability in the data.",

Precision medicine provides an opportunity to improve the outcomes of patients with sepsis [17]. A key to the precision medicine approach is the accuracy of biomarkers to stratify patients into subgroups based on specific pathophysiological conditions [18]. Hence, biomarkers can be the key to personalized medicine. The complex pathophysiology of sepsis makes it unlikely that a single biomarker can provide sufficient information about the derailment of the host response [19]. Biomarkers have included Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and IL-6 [20], but none of these is specific enough to be used alone in the management of critically ill patients. Some biomarkers were designed, based on the gut microbiota, to predict the clinical outcomes, such as bacterial diversity and abundance of bacteria [10]. Consistent results were not found in these studies. However, research on new biomarkers based on the gut microbiota is still in the early stages and more studies are needed.",
