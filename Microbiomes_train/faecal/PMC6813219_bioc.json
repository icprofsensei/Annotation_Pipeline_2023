IBS can be clinically subtyped into IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and mixed IBS (IBS-M) (Guilera et al., 2005; Oswiecimska et al., 2017). In addition, IBS patients appeared to have a higher frequency of psychosocial stress, a lower quality of life and lower levels of work productivity (Drossman et al., 1988, 2000; Talley et al., 1997).",

Large number of studies have been focusing on the gut microenvironment in IBS patients. Many studies have reported different compositions of fecal microbiota between IBS patients and healthy controls (Si et al., 2004; Carroll et al., 2012). For example, Palva et al. have reported that IBS-D patients have decreased amounts of Lactobacillus spp. in the fecal samples and IBS-C patients have increased amounts of Veillonella spp. (Costello et al., 2009). In addition, the diverse community of microorganisms has significant impact on human metabolism (Belizario and Faintuch, 2018; O'Malley, 2019). Noorbakhsh et al. have reported that the metabolite concentrations of serum and urine in healthy group and IBS-D patients were significantly different at baseline (Noorbakhsh et al., 2018). Researches on complex metabolic interactions between microbes and host tissues have been proved to be critical to prevent various gut disorders, such as IBS and ulcerative colitis (UC) (Ghaisas et al., 2016; Lopetuso et al., 2018). Integrated bioinformatic analysis is emerging as an important method to investigate microbes and metabolites, which can provide us new insights into the relationship between metabolites and microbiota and reveal a novel therapeutic strategy of IBS.",

The experiment was performed by using test kit\u2014MicrobioMET (Metabo-Profile, Shanghai, P.R. China). MicrobioMET is a commercial total solution including standardized, quality-controlled sample preparation, rapid GC-TOFMS analysis, data analysis software, and project report. Briefly, samples were thawed on ice-bath and weighed 50 mg for preparation. Materials were then homogenized with 1 M NaOH (300 \u03bcL) solution and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. Each 200 \u03bcL supernatant was transferred into an autosampler vial. The residue was further exacted with 200 \u03bcL methanol and centrifugated again under the same conditions. The resultant supernatant was combined with the first one in the autosampler vial. Then, the autosampler vial was capped and the extracts were submitted for automated sample derivatization using multipurpose sampler MPS2 (Gerstel, Muehlheim, Germany). After sample preparation, microbial metabolites were quantitated with a gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) (Pegasus HT, Leco Corp, USA), followed by metabolite annotation and identification. The total mass of the metabolites was determined by metabolite diversity analysis. The reference library was developed consisting of 132 methyl and ethyl chloroformate (MCF and ECF) derivatized compounds with their mass spectral and retention index information for metabolite identification. The type of capillary column used for gas chromatography is Rxi-5MS which is 30 m (length) \u00d7 250 \u03bcm I.D and 0.25-\u03bcm film thickness.",

The results revealed several significant metabolites\u2013microbe relationships, including strongly positive association between glycine level and Clostridium, positive correlation of homocysteine with Lachnospira, Clostridium and Haemophilus, and negative association of homocysteine with Corynebacterium and Lachnospiraceae.",

Many factors have been reported to play a role in the development of IBS, such as \u201cbrain-gut axis,\u201d immune regulation, defection, risk gene mutations, and altered gastrointestinal motility (Louis et al., 2007; Holtmann et al., 2016; Defrees and Bailey, 2017). However, currently there are no clear IBS-related diagnostic biomarkers and the pathophysiology of IBS are still not fully understood. In this study, the fecal samples from IBS patients and healthy people were analyzed for the following three purposes: to get the quantitative metabolite and microbial signatures for IBS; to evaluate the possible microbe-metabolite associations; to investigate the relationship between the severity of IBS symptoms and metabolites as well as the severity of IBS symptoms and microbes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the networks of gut microbe-metabolite associations in fecal samples of adult IBS patients, and this is also the first report to determine the correlation of clinical characteristics with microbiota as well as clinical characteristics with metabolites in adult IBS patients.",

The four clusters including 31 metabolites were significantly upregulated in the IBS group as compared to the healthy controls. Among these metabolites, we detected higher levels of L-methionine and homocysteine in IBS samples. Methionine and homocysteine are common amino acid obtained from food. Both methionine and homocysteine are generally considered to play an important role in intestinal health (Townsend et al., 2004). Homocysteine is an intermediary metabolite in methionine/cysteine metabolism. Consistent with our findings, Qian et al. reported that plasma homocysteine levels in IBS rats were significantly greater than in control rats and homocysteine-lowering treatment restored the barrier function in IBS mice (Zhao and Qian, 2014). These results suggested the role of homocysteine in disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier in IBS patients.",

For example, L-leucine was positively correlated with adipic acid (R = 0.83, P < 0.001). Adipic acid is a human xenobiotic metabolite and increased in urine of diabetes patients (Sonmez et al., 2007). Leucine is an essential amino acid in humans and contributes to regulation of blood-sugar levels. In addition, adipic acid and L-leucine have been identified as key factors of anti-inflammation mechanism of forsythiae fructus in rats (Yuan et al., 2017). Thus, those results suggested the positive associations between adipic acid and L-leucine might contribute to the inflammation process of IBS. Overall, the present study indicated that the changes of gut metabolites might play an important role in the development of IBS, and the gut metabolite might serve as the potential diagnostic biomarker of IBS.",

Among these gut microbes, the levels of lachnospira and clostridium were significantly increased in IBS patients than in healthy controls (3.8 and 30.0-fold, respectively). It is reported that several strains of Lachnospira were capable of producing lactate and acetate, which caused constipation by inhibiting mucin secretion (Canani et al., 2011). Clostridium difficile, one of the strain of Clostridium, was shown to increase the risk of post-infectious IBS, while the data available was scarce (Piche et al., 2007; Wadhwa et al., 2016). Unfortunately, no single cluster of microbes could be used to clearly identify IBS patients from healthy controls. This could be due to the various factors affecting the gut flora, which leads to the individual difference within each group. In addition, the results on association study of differentially abundant microbes showed the similar pattern as that of metabolites.",

It has been reported that the disruption of GABA leaded to neurological disease and enhancing GABA inhibition could alleviated sleep disorders, chronic pain and anxiety which have higher prevalence in IBS patients (Adeghate and Ponery, 2002; Raskov et al., 2016). Therefore, combined with our study, the results suggested the potential role of GABA in the treatment of visceral pain disorders.

These results suggested that the gut microbiota and metabolome were not only complex, but also interact with each other. In the present study, we found the presence of higher levels of several amino acids in IBS patients, which might suggest an active luminal proteolysis by gut microbiota in IBS patients. Indeed, some studies demonstrated that several strains of Clostridium, Lachnospira, and Intestinibacter could produce protease and belonged to proteolytic strains (Das Gupta and Sugiyama, 1972), which might explain our finding of positive correlation of amino acids with these microbes. These findings prompted that the changes of gut microbiota have impact on the change of gut metabolites, which provided a theoretical basis for future mechanism research on IBS.",

Consistently, both studies reported a significant difference in metabolite profile between the IBS and healthy controls, but no significantly differential microbial profiling. In addition, both studies showed the level of homocysteine elevated in the IBS group. Inconsistently, current study indicated that IBS patients exhibited an increased alpha diversity of the microbial population, which was different from the results of IBS rats in our previous study and some other studies. As for alterations of microbial diversity in patients with IBS, the results varies in different studies in which some presented a greater diversity (Zeber-Lubecka et al., 2016; Labus et al., 2017), some presented a lower diversity or no differences (Duan et al., 2019).

Thus, we analyzed the association of metabolites or microorganisms with age, and the results indicated that age was correlated with the module MEturquoise of metabolites (R = 0.4) or the module MEgrey of microbes (R = 0.44). Meanwhile, the module MEturquoise of metabolites was strongly correlated with the clinical traits including abdominal pain (R = 0.59), abdominal discomfort (R = 0.6), defection frequency (R = 0.59), and stool form (R = 0.62); the module MEgrey of microbes was strongly correlated with abdominal pain (R = 0.61), abdominal discomfort (R = 0.63), defection frequency (R = 0.68), and stool form (R = 0.66). The results indicated that although age was associated with some of the metabolites, the correlation was weaker than the correlation between clinical symptoms and metabolites as well as clinical symptoms and microbes (R is <0.6). Therefore, the observed differences in the metabolome or microbiome between IBS patients and healthy controls mainly attributed to the development of IBS rather than the effect of age. Afterall, all above factors need to be considered in future studies.",

We also found that some fecal metabolites or microbes were associated with the clinical traits of IBS. In addition, some of these metabolites were strongly associated with microbes, suggesting these metabolites were likely to be originated from microbial metabolism. However, further studies are needed to investigate the members of differential abundant metabolites and microbiota; It is also important to elucidate their roles in gut metabolic processes and their potential interplay with inflammation and nervous systems.",
