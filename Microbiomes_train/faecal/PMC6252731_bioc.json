Antibiotic exposure contributes to the acquisition of such ARGs; consequently efforts to curtail development of antibiotic resistance focus on minimizing exposure through antibiotic stewardship programs. Cancer chemotherapy (CC) drugs often possess potent antimicrobial properties; however, their contribution to the development of gut ARGs has not been well documented. We sought to evaluate the contribution of CC agents to the development of gut microbial ARGs using metagenomic sequencing.",

We performed metagenomic shotgun sequencing on these samples and compared the relative abundance of ARGs pre- and post- treatment initiation. Three thousand and twenty-one ARGs were categorized into 15 functional pharmaceutical classes (by agents used for patient care or environmental cleaning).
