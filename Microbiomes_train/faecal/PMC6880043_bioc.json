IgM and IgG are also present in the gut; however, their interactions with the microbiome in the developing infant remain to be characterized. Using stool samples sampled 15 times in infancy from 32 healthy subjects at 4 locations in 3 countries, we characterized patterns of microbiome development in relation to fecal levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM. For 8 infants from a single location, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting of microbial cells from stool by Ig-coating status over 18\u2009months. We used 16S rRNA gene profiling on full and sorted microbiomes to assess patterns of antibody coating in relation to age and other factors. All antibodies decreased in concentration with age but were augmented by breastmilk feeding regardless of infant age. Levels of IgA correlated with relative abundances of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the Bifidobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae, which dominated the early microbiome, and IgG levels correlated with Haemophilus. The diversity of Ig-coated microbiota was influenced by breastfeeding and age. IgA and IgM coated the same microbiota, which reflected the overall diversity of the microbiome, while IgG targeted a different subset. Blautia generally evaded antibody coating, while members of the Bifidobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae were high in IgA/M. IgA/M displayed similar dynamics, generally coating the microbiome proportionally, and were influenced by breastfeeding status. IgG only coated a small fraction of the commensal microbiota and differed from the proportion targeted by IgA and IgM.",

When babies are born, the breastmilk supplies these antibodies until the baby\u2019s own immune system takes over this task after a few weeks. The vast majority of these antibodies are IgA, but two other types, IgG and IgM, are also present in the gut. Here, we ask if these three different antibody types target different types of bacteria in the infant gut as the infant develops from birth to 18\u2009months old and how patterns of antibody coating of bacteria change with age. In this study of healthy infant samples over time, we found that IgA and IgM coat the same bacteria, which are generally representative of the diversity present, with a few exceptions that were more or less antibody coated than expected. IgG coated a separate suite of bacteria. These results provide a better understanding of how these antibodies interact with the developing infant gut microbiome.",

The immunoglobulin A (IgA) component of breast milk is protective against infection in infants and may also direct the development of the gut microbiota. IgA is secreted into the gut lumen, where it binds antigens from food and microbiota, thereby excluding them from direct contact with the host epithelial cells (3). At birth, neonates generally have undetectable IgA in meconium (4), and it takes a few weeks for their immune systems to initiate IgA production and secretion into the gut (5). Breastmilk is an important early source of IgA, and breastfeeding is associated with high levels of fecal IgA in infants (4, 6). Planer et al. characterized the fraction of IgA-coated fecal microbiota in infants over the first few years of life and reported differences between breastmilk- and formula-fed infants, which may relate to differences in how the microbiota develop in these two groups (7).",

The juvenile gut sees up to 5 g of secretory IgA daily, 100-fold less secretory IgM, and 1,000-fold less IgG (8). IgM and IgA are both produced by B cells locally, and the predominant class switching that occurs in B cells of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue is from IgM to IgA. Both are secreted into the gut via the same mechanism (polymeric Ig receptor), IgM as a pentamer and IgA as a dimer. In contrast, IgG is the most common antibody in circulation but can also be transported into the gut via a neonatal Fc receptor (9). Whereas IgA/M are produced in response to luminal microbial epitopes that are sampled by dendritic cells, IgG induction is thought to require crossing of the barrier by antigens, such that IgG is not produced continuously in response to common gut antigens.",

To gain a baseline understanding of how IgA, IgG, and IgM coat gut microbiota during microbiome development in infancy, here we performed a longitudinal analysis of the fecal microbiome of healthy infants in which we characterized the diversity of microbiota coated with IgA, IgM, and IgG as a function of time and with respect to feeding regimen and antibody levels.",

More information on the study participants is shown in Table\u00a01. Two recent papers have reported on the gut microbiome in the TEDDY cohort: Stewart et al. (11) employed a 16S rRNA gene survey on 903 subjects, and Vatanen et al. (12) used metagenomics with 783 subjects. Our results recapitulate those of Stewart et al. and Vatanen et al. in the following ways: (i) Bifidobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae dominated the infant gut at early time points, while Firmicutes increased in relative abundance later (Fig.\u00a01); (ii) breastfeeding status was significantly associated with between-sample diversity (e.g., beta diversity, as observed from associations between breastfeeding status and several principal coordinates [PCs] from both unweighted and weighted UniFrac principal coordinate analysis [PCoA]; Fig.\u00a02 and \u200band3;3; see also Table\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material) after correcting for multiple testing; (iii) the only other factor with a significant association with beta diversity was geographic location (Fig.\u00a04A); (iv) we observed a weak association between antibiotic exposure and beta diversity (unweighted UniFrac PC4; Fig.\u00a04B and \u200bandC);C); (v) age had a significant association with microbiome richness (Chao1, Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity, observed species, and Gini coefficient; all P\u2009<\u200910\u221210). We observed that age and breastfeeding status were associated with microbiome diversity, corroborating the findings of previous studies (11, 12), and therefore the subset of subjects that we used in subsequent analysis are representative of the larger TEDDY cohort.",

The gating patterns indicate that IgA and IgM coat many of the same cells, since the patterns of coating overlap.

We observed that the microbiota composition of the sorted cells (all Qs) is distinct from that of the total microbiome: a combined PCoA analysis of unweighted UniFrac analysis shows clear separation of unsorted and sorted cells along PC2 (Fig.\u00a08A). The unsorted population was richer (Chao1, phylogenetic diversity, and observed species) and exhibited greater evenness (Gini coefficient) than all sorted cells (P\u2009<\u200910\u221210 for all metrics) (Fig.\u00a0S2). We applied linear mixed models to identify taxa that were differentially abundant between the unsorted and sorted populations (all Qs). This analysis identified members of the Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Gammaproteobacteria, and most Firmicutes as comparatively enriched in the unsorted fraction and Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria as enriched in the sorted fraction (Fig.\u00a08C). The difference in composition between sorted and unsorted fractions likely stems from the FACS process itself; for example, cells belonging to Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria may be less likely to clump than others. Thus, the difference between sorted and unsorted microbiomes introduces the caveat that subsequent analyses with the sorted data are performed on a subset of the microbiome.",

Similarly, as age increased, alpha diversity also increased (Fig.\u00a0S3). Analysis of variance indicated that FACS quadrant was significantly associated with most of the first 10 PCs from the PCoA (restricted to only sorted 16S rRNA gene data) of both unweighted and weighted UniFrac and all four alpha diversity metrics. Post hoc pairwise comparisons showed that this association was driven primarily by a difference between IgG+ (high IgG only) and the other three quadrants. This finding might represent an overall diversity difference between the high IgG-only cells and others. However, the number of cells sorted into the high-IgG (IgG+) quadrant was significantly lower than those of the other three quadrants (Fig.\u00a0S3). Indeed, most of the cells coated in IgG were also coated by IgA and IgM and are therefore sorted into IgAMG+ rather than IgG+. This significant difference in cell number between the quadrants could explain the difference in diversity observed between IgG+ and the other three quadrants.",

To identify common OTUs (i.e., OTUs with nonzero sequence counts in greater than 40% of FACS samples examined) with differential relative abundance between quadrants, we performed linear mixed models using each OTU as a response variable. We searched for differences between the coated (IgAM+ and IgAMG+; excluding IgG+ because of low cell population) and uncoated (Ig\u2212) populations. When comparing IgAM+ to Ig\u2212 Qs, we observed significant differences in the relative abundances of 80 out of 190 OTUs (Fig.\u00a09 and Table S3). These mostly included OTUs classified as Blautia, which had higher relative abundance in Ig\u2212 (uncoated) than other Qs. OTUs that were higher in IgAM+ (IgM and IgA both high) were mostly classified as Bifidobacterium, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcus gnavus. Similarly, 101 OTUs had differential relative abundances between IgAMG+ (all high) and Ig\u2212 (all low), with Blautia being significantly higher in Ig\u2212 (Table\u00a0S4).",

We used the same reference database as Planer et al. to classify sequences; therefore, we could compare OTUs directly. A total of 14 individual OTUs were identified by Planer et al. as being consistently targeted or not targeted by IgA (n\u2009=\u20095 and n\u2009=\u20099, respectively). Of these OTUs, two met the same criteria as those used in this study, in that they had a nonzero value in >40% of the samples. Interestingly, both OTUs behaved similarly with respect to antibody coating. Greengenes OTU 365385 (genus Bifidobacterium), consistently targeted by IgA in the Planer et al. study, was proportionally higher in both IgAM+ (BH adjusted P\u2009=\u20093.07\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221205) (Fig.\u00a09A) and IgAMG+ (BH adjusted P\u2009=\u20091.88\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221205) than Ig\u2212. The other Greengenes OTU detected in both data sets (606927; family Peptostreptococcaceae) was consistently nontargeted by IgA in the Planer et al. study, and similarly, we observed this OTU to have a higher relative abundance in Ig\u2212 (uncoated) than IgAMG+ (BH adjusted P\u2009=\u20090.013) (Table\u00a0S4).

IgA and IgM targeting of the same cell population implies these two antibodies can be induced via the same mechanism, and that, like IgA, IgM induction is a local phenomenon. In contrast, we observed patterns of IgG coating quite distinct from those of IgA and IgM. IgG is induced as a result of the systemic immune system\u2019s recognition of a \u201cnon-self\u201d antigen and is not, in general, produced locally in the gut. Thus, whereas IgA/M responses mirror the gut microbiome generally, the bacterial targets of IgG are related to those targeted by the systemic immune system around the time of collection. We noted a fair amount of overlap between the IgA/M- and IgG-coated fractions, however, suggesting redundancy across all three classes of antibody.",

                    "text": "The majority of IgA secreted to the gut is polyclonal and thought to be relatively unselective, as it binds with epitopes that are widely shared among gut bacteria (15, 16). In addition, secretory IgA affinity maturation by somatic hypermutation is a prominent feature of the human repertoire (17), and a large fraction of secretory IgA may be targeted to specific bacterial species (18). Using a reversible colonization system in germfree mice, Hapfelmeier and colleagues showed that a specific strain of E. coli induced a sustained IgA response even after the strain was no longer there (>100\u2009days), but that colonization with other bacteria induced a decline in the Escherichia coli-specific IgA and an increase in IgA response to the newly introduced bacteria (19). These results suggested the presence of a long-lived compartment of IgA-secreting plasma cells in the intestinal lamina propria but that the compartment has a finite size, so that the IgA secreted into the intestine depends on the dominant luminal microbial species. Based on this model, we would expect the majority of the IgA-coated fraction of microbiota to mirror the unsorted microbiota (although a small subset of taxa exhibit either more or less coating than expected based on this model; see below), and allowing for the caveats of FACS sorting, this is the general pattern that we observed.",

In particular, OTUs classified as Bifidobacterium, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcus gnavus had higher representation in the IgA-coated cell fraction. In addition, we observed that levels of IgA antibody in stool were correlated to a few Bifidobacteriaceae OTUs and several Enterobacteriaceae OTUs. Planer et al. also observed one of the same OTUs was highly coated in IgA in the fecal samples of children from Malawi (7), and Bifidobacteria in particular have been shown to induce high levels of IgA in the gut (20). Bifidobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae dominated the infant gut microbiomes early on; however, the higher-than-expected levels of specific OTUs belonging to these taxa in the IgA-coated fraction suggests they are stimulating IgA production specific to them in excess of what is expected from their relative abundances in the microbiota. Alternatively, given that here we characterize antibody coating of bacteria in the feces, these taxa may be preferentially cleared from the intestine once coated with IgA. Antibody coating is implicated in aggregation, which may help retain bacteria in mucus, as well as clearance, because larger particles are more likely to be entrained; it is likely that both mechanisms operate simultaneously and differentially for various taxa.",

In the healthy mouse cecum, specific OTUs have been shown to be less coated than what would be expected by chance (21). One explanation could be antibody evasion by regulation of epitopes in response to the antibodies. Certain bacterial species, including the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, have been shown to downregulate the expression of epitopes in response to IgA (22,\u201324). Alternatively, the relative undercoating of specific taxa in stool may reflect patterns of clearance, and here uncoated Blautia OTUs are more likely to be shed than their coated counterparts. How IgA coating relates to the microbial ecology of the microbiota, their growth rates, the immune response to specific epitopes, and ultimately shedding of the cells is complex and not well understood.",

One OTU was associated with IgG levels in feces; this OTU belonged to the genus Haemophilus. IgG is produced systemically in response to infection, and it is also produced in response to immunization. Thus, this pattern may have resulted from the Haemophilus vaccine, which is given to infants. It is one of the few vaccines against a bacterium, and it is not a mucosal vaccine. Haemophilus colonizes the upper respiratory mucosa, and not all are pathogenic. The Haemophilus that we observed here may include commensal species that share capsule epitopes with the vaccine strains.",

Subjects were screened for T1D risk through HLA genotyping, and all samples used in this study were collected from children with HLA genotypes that put them at high risk of developing T1D. None of the subjects included in the current study have developed T1D or seroconverted for any of the 3 measured T1D-associated autoantibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies, IA-2 autoantibodies, and insulin autoantibodies) by 24\u2009months of age and had not developed T1D by December 2016 (approximately 10\u2009years of age). We focused on a set of longitudinal stool samples (9 to 16 time points per subject) obtained from 32 age- and sex-matched healthy children (468 fecal samples) from the United States (Georgia and Washington), Germany, and Sweden. Subjects were excluded if they provided fewer than 12 longitudinal samples, if their participation and sample collection was through a long distance protocol, or if they dropped out of the study before or at 24\u2009months of age. Additional data collected as part of the TEDDY study and that were used in the current analysis included physical descriptors (e.g., length and weight), diet, illnesses, hospitalizations, vaccinations and medicines, and social data, such as daycare attendance.",
