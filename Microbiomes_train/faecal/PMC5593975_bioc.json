The aim of this study was to investigate the links between omega-3 fatty acids, gut microbiome diversity and composition and faecal metabolomic profiles in middle aged and elderly women. We analysed data from 876 twins with 16S microbiome data and DHA, total omega-3, and other circulating fatty acids. Estimated food intake of omega-3 fatty acids were obtained from food frequency questionnaires. Both total omega-3and DHA serum levels were significantly correlated with microbiome alpha diversity (Shannon index) after adjusting for confounders (DHA Beta(SE)\u2009=\u20090.13(0.04), P\u2009=\u20090.0006 total omega-3: 0.13(0.04), P\u2009=\u20090.001). These associations remained significant after adjusting for dietary fibre intake. We found even stronger associations between DHA and 38 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), the strongest ones being with OTUs from the Lachnospiraceae family (Beta(SE)\u2009=\u20090.13(0.03), P\u2009=\u20098\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127). Some of the associations with gut bacterial OTUs appear to be mediated by the abundance of the faecal metabolite N-carbamylglutamate. Our data indicate a link between omega-3 circulating levels/intake and microbiome composition independent of dietary fibre intake, particularly with bacteria of the Lachnospiraceae family. These data suggest the potential use of omega-3 supplementation to improve the microbiome composition.",

However, the synthesis pathway requires a number of elongation and desaturation steps, making direct uptake from the diet a more effective route of assimilation. EPA and DHA in the human diet are derived primarily from marine algae (higher plants lack the enzymes for the biosynthesis of these lipids), which is concentrated in the flesh of marine fish where bioavailability is dramatically increased20. Some of the mechanisms whereby omega-3 fatty acids operate are linked directly to their anti-inflammatory actions since both EPA and DHA decrease synthesis of the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E221. EPA and DHA are also precursors of the E-resolvins and D-resolvins that suppress inflammatory cytokine production and act to resolve inflammation22.",

On the other hand, the role of omega-3 on microbiome composition and diversity has yet to be explored in human cohorts. Supplementation with DHA has been shown to help with oral and gastrointestinal diseases in which inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis play key roles27. Chronic low grade inflammation is often the result of an increase in plasma endotoxins, particularly lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived from gut dysbiosis. The increase in plasma endotoxins leads to subsequent activation of the inflammasome and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines24. Analysis of gut microbiota and faecal transfer in mice has revealed that elevated tissue omega-3 fatty acids enhance intestinal production and secretion of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, which induces changes in the gut bacteria composition resulting in decreased lipopolysaccharide production and gut permeability, and ultimately, reduced metabolic endotoxemia and inflammation24.",

After adjusting for multiple testing using FDR\u2009<\u20090.05, the faecal metabolites associated with DHA serum levels were faecal levels of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA (Beta(SE)\u2009=\u20090.15(0.037), P\u2009=\u20094.35\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125, FDR\u2009=\u20090.01), N-carbamylglutamate (0.15(0.039), P\u2009=\u20091.21\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124, FDR\u2009=\u20090.02) and the dipeptide anserine (0.13(0.036), P\u2009=\u20095.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124, FDR\u2009=\u20090.04) commonly found in fish and poultry meat36 and hence is likely to be positively correlated with fish intake) (Supplementary Table\u00a01). We hypothesized that the association between some of the OTUs and DHA may be mediated by the levels in the gut of N-carbamylglutamate (NCG). We found that several OTUs whose abundance is associated with DHA serum levels are also associated with NCG faecal levels (Table\u00a03). The association remains significant after adjustment for DHA, however some of the DHA associations with these OTUs are attenuated when adjusting for NCG levels (Table\u00a03) suggesting that the correlation between the abundances some of these OTUs and DHA serum levels could be mediated by NCG faecal concentrations.\n",

SCFAs are the end products of fermentation of dietary fibres by the anaerobic intestinal microbiota and have been shown to exert multiple beneficial effects on mammalian energy metabolism. The mechanisms underlying these effects encompass the complex interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and host energy metabolism40. Members of the Lachnospiraceae family are found in higher abundance in herbivorous animals41. The wide range of functions carried out by Lachnospiraceae may influence their relative abundance in gut communities of different hosts. In humans, members of this family have been associated with protection against C. difficile infections42 and obesity43. They are also known as potent short-chain fatty acid producers44, On the other hand, we also find members of the Ruminococcaceae associated with increased levels of DHA and subtypes of some of this family have been implicated in obesity45.",

This carbamylated aminoacid, is available as a synthetic compound, but may also be generated in nature by protein carbamylation57. Given that the other faecal compounds strongly associated with DHA serum levels are omega-3 faecal levels and a dipeptide considered as a marker of animal protein (such as fish) intake, the abundance of this compound in the faeces is unlikely to be the result of intake of a supplement containing it. NCG is a precursor of arginine, a structural analogue of N- acetylglutamate and selective activator of the first enzyme of the urea cycle58. In animal studies NCG supplementation has been shown to improve arginine synthesis in enterocytes59, to regulate signalling pathways (such as signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), protein kinase B (PKB), and 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase)59 and to enhance intestinal growth as well as heat shock protein-70 expression60. Importantly, it also reduces oxidative stress in the gut61, 62 and alters intestinal gene expression63. Some of the NCG effects may be mediated via arginine which helps maintain intestinal homeostasis, preserves the integrity of the intestinal epithelium under stress, and prevents intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation64, 65.",

This in turn is likely to result in improved gut function and reduced oxidative stress. We see that the association between DHA circulating levels and some of the OTUs (such as Coprococcus, Oscillospira, Roseburia) is attenuated when we adjusted for NCG faecal levels (Table\u00a03) suggesting that some of the DHA effect may be mediated by NCG. These are some of the bacteria that, as mentioned above, have been linked to either reduced intestinal inflammation or reduced risk of Crohn\u2019s disease and are butyrate producers.",

Nonetheless, intake of omega-3 fatty acids tends to correlate with a healthier lifestyle in general1 and therefore some of the effects of DHA on the gut may be indirect.

                    "text": "We note several study limitations. First, given the cross-sectional nature of the data, we cannot establish whether it is omega-3 affecting microbiome diversity or the other way round. On the other hand, it is well known that omega-3 circulating levels are reflective of dietary intake66 and although the associations we find with estimates of omega-3 dietary intake are weaker than with serum levels, this is likely to simply reflect the error of accurate estimates of intake from food questionnaire data compared to the accuracy of serum level measurements. Therefore, we hypothesize that it is intake of PUFAs and in particular of DHA that results in higher microbiome diversity and increased Lachnospiraceaes abundance. Our data are consistent with a recent randomized crossover clinical study in obese individuals where the effects of the gut microbiome were compared between supplementation with high oleic acid canola oil, and canola oil plus DHA. A principal analysis component carried by the authors revealed a strong enrichment of Lachnospiraceae in the canola plus DHA vs canola oil group, and more modest enrichments for Coprococcus and Ruminococcaceae\n67. Second, our study also lacked direct measurement of SCFAs in order to show a direct correlation between DHA serum levels and SCFAs in the gut. Third, our cohort sonsists exclusively of middle aged and elderly women of European descent. The lack of male participants in our in this study limits the generalisability of our results since gender differences in the gut microbiome have been reported in humans68. Moreover, estrogens cause higher DHA concentrations in women than in men, probably by upregulating synthesis of DHA from alpha linoleic acid69. Additional studies including men may show stronger or weaker associations with omega-3 fatty acids. Fourth, we have used FFQs rather than other methods for assessing nutrient intake. It has been argued that 7-day diet diaries or records add useful information above and beyond FFQ remains and have higher reproducibility and lower error rates70. However,, the value of FFQs for assessing dietary composition has been documented objectively by correlations with biochemical indicators and the prediction of outcomes in prospective studies71. Moreover, the key results we report are with serum levels of DHA, which are highly correlated with intake figures estimated from FFQs.",

Reads were then summarised to OTUs using open reference clustering Greengenes v13_8 at 97% sequence similarity78. OTU counts were converted to log transformed relative abundances, with zero counts handled by the addition of an arbitrary value (10\u22126). The residuals of the OTU abundances were taken from linear models, accounting for technical covariates including sequencing depth, sequencing run, sequencing technician and sample collection method. These residuals were inverse normalised, to make them normally distributed, and used in downstream parametric analyses.
