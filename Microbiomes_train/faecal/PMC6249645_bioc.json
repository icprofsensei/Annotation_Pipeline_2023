AutoFMT involves banking one\u2019s feces during a healthy state for later use in restoring gut microbiota following perturbation. This pilot study evaluated the effect of autoFMT on gastrointestinal microbiome taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity after exposure to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Amox-Clav). Ten healthy participants were enrolled. All received 5 days of Amox-Clav. Half were randomized to autoFMT, derived from stool collected pre-antimicrobial exposure, by enema, and half to saline enema. Participants submitted stool samples pre- and post-Amox-Clav and enema and during a 90-day follow-up period. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed taxonomic composition, resistance gene content, and metabolic capacity. Amox-Clav significantly altered gut taxonomic composition in all participants (n = 10, P\u2009<\u20090.01); however, only three participants exhibited major changes at the phylum level following exposure. In the cohort as a whole, beta-lactamase genes were enriched following Amox-Clav (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and predicted metabolic capacity was significantly altered (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Species composition, metabolic capacity, and beta-lactamase abundance returned to pre-antimicrobial exposure state 7 days after either autoFMT or saline enema (P\u2009>\u20090.05, compared to enrollment). Alterations to microbial metabolic capacity occurred following antimicrobial exposure even in participants without substantial taxonomic disruption, potentially creating open niches for pathogen colonization. Our findings suggest that metabolic potential is an important consideration for complete assessment of antimicrobial impact on the microbiome. AutoFMT was well tolerated and may have contributed to phylogenetic recovery. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT02046525.)",

For example, using nonabsorbable broad-spectrum antimicrobials such as rifaximin has been proposed as a method of limiting systemic resistance selection (10). Using such orally ingested drugs to treat infections localized to the gastrointestinal tract may indeed limit systemic selection for antimicrobial resistance; however, this practice still leads to resistance selection in the gut and allows opportunistic pathogens to gain access in this critical body habitat (11).",

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been proposed as a method of restoring the microbiome to a healthy state after treatment with antimicrobials (13). By displacing infectious or resistant microbes, the new community can restore species diversity, antimicrobial susceptibility, and colonization resistance (13). FMT from healthy allogeneic donors (alloFMT) has been remarkably successful in treating Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) (13, 14). Some studies indicate that patients who receive alloFMT for CDI may have a reduction in MDROs in feces as well as infections due to intestinal colonizers (15,\u201321). However, this approach has been found to inadvertently allow transmission of resistance genes from donor to recipient (22). Donor feces may also transmit pathogens or pathobionts which are being asymptomatically harbored by the allogeneic donor. Additionally, microbiota structure varies significantly between individuals, and a poor donor-recipient match may lead to dysbiosis or FMT failure (23,\u201326). Studies to date of the effects of FMT on the microbiome have primarily relied on 16S ribotype-based analyses of bacterial taxonomic composition and diversity (27,\u201330). While such studies have been transformative in demonstrating how well taxonomic compositions match between FMT donors and recipients over time, they are generally not designed to illuminate functional changes in the microbiome (29, 30). Accordingly, complementary approaches are required to enable a higher-resolution understanding of the impact of FMTs on the composition, dynamics, and transmission of resistance genes and metabolic capacity encoded by the microbiome.",

IMC of postantimicrobial samples clusters apart from baseline IMC.

This significant shift in metabolic capacity was observed even in the absence of phylum-level differences.

To supplement known resistance gene markers available via the well-curated CARD database, markers from novel, cryptic resistance gene unique to the studied samples were obtained by performing functional metagenomic selections on bacterial metagenomic DNA pooled by participant (46). Functional metagenomic identification of genes that conferred resistance to Amox-Clav was performed as previously described (18, 47, 48) by randomly shearing metagenomic DNA from each pool of feces into fragment libraries. These libraries were cloned into the natively pan-susceptible host Escherichia coli DH10B using vector PZE21. For each sample, the host cells containing library fragments were selected against amoxicillin and ampicillin at concentrations lethal to the untransformed host. Surviving colonies were pooled, and the inserted fragments were sequenced via the Illumina MiSeq platform (2 \u00d7 150 bp). Sequencing reads were assembled into contigs with the PARFUMS pipeline (49). The contigs were searched for open reading frames with MetaGeneMark (50) and annotated by hmmscan function of HMMER3 (51) against the Resfams core database (52), Pfams (46), and TIGRFAMS (46). Resulting annotations were then hand curated (46) in the following manner. Selections were excluded if >100 contigs were assembled, because this suggests a failure in the assembly or selection since <100 unique resistance contigs are expected per selection. Within each contig, annotations were ranked by specificity to the selective agents and lowest E value with preference given to Resfams annotations over Pfams or TIGRFAMS. In the absence of a clear specific causative gene annotation (i.e., a beta-lactamase), the two best annotations with <90% overlap were accepted. The sequences corresponding to accepted annotations were then pooled with known antimicrobial resistance gene sequences from CARD 2017 (46). The genes were then quantified in unassembled metagenomic sequence using the ShortBRED pipeline with a clustering identity of 1.",

The ability of the predicted metabolic capacity to discriminate between sample groups was visualized using principal component analysis (PCA), and significance was tested using type II Adonis of Bray-Curtis distance between samples. This test of significance was conducted with and without participants 5 and 8 to determine whether any difference observed was driven by the large taxonomic perturbations seen in those participants. Each metabolic category comprising the IMC was tested for contribution to the difference between enrollment and post-Amox-Clav IMC using a Random Forests model. This was implemented using the Boruta package in R (55). Factors were ranked according to their contribution to this difference.",
