This study aimed to determine if granins are associated with bacterial composition, immune activation and IBS symptoms. Protein levels of fecal granins (CgA, CgB, SgII and SgIII) were analysed with immunoassays. Mucosal mRNA expression of granins, TPH1 and immune markers were evaluated with RT-qPCR. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal and mucosal bacteria. The intestinal granin profile, based on fecal protein levels and mucosal mRNA expression, could not discriminate between IBS patients (n\u2009=\u200988) and healthy subjects (HS, n\u2009=\u200933). IBS patients dominated by high fecal or mucosal granin levels, respectively, did not differ in symptom or immune profiles. Fecal-dominated and mucosal-dominated granin clusters of IBS patients and HS, demonstrated separate fecal and mucosal bacterial profiles and high fecal abundance of granins were associated with a less diverse bacterial composition and the Bacteroides enterotype. The intestinal granin profiles of IBS patients and HS are linked to the intestinal bacterial composition, diversity and enterotypes. These findings suggest that granins may be one of several host-produced factors regulating the microbiota composition of the intestine.",

Among IBS patients, the fecal-dominated granins cluster (n\u2009=\u200925) displayed a separate mucosal microbiota profile compared to the mucosal-dominated granin cluster (n\u2009=\u20095) (VIP\u2009>\u20091.35, R2\u2009=\u20090.79, Q2\u2009=\u20090.48) (Fig.\u00a04a,b). Twenty-seven bacterial genera separated the clusters, of which the Gordonibacter was more abundant in the fecal-dominated granin cluster, and Coprococcus more abundant in the mucosal-dominated granin cluster (Fig.\u00a04c). Also in healthy subjects, the mucosal bacterial profile of the fecal-dominated granin cluster (n\u2009=\u200910) differed compared to the mucosal-dominated granin cluster (n\u2009=\u20094) (VIP\u2009>\u20091.35, R2\u2009=\u20090.93, Q2\u2009=\u20090.83) (Fig.\u00a04d,e). Sixteen bacterial genera were driving the separation in mucosal bacterial composition between the fecal-dominated and mucosal-dominated granin clusters, of which undefined Clostridia, more abundant in the fecal-dominated granin cluster, and Brevundimonas, more abundant in the mucosal-dominated granin cluster, were the most important (Fig.\u00a04f). In addition, several discriminatory bacterial genera such as Pedobacter, Unspecified Flavobacteriaceae, Eggerthella, Elisabethkingia and Bordetella of the mucosal microbiota were of higher relative abundance in the mucosal-dominated granin cluster of both IBS patients and healthy subjects, while mucosal Clostridia were of higher relative abundance in the fecal-dominated granin cluster of both IBS patients and healthy subjects (Fig.\u00a04c,f).",

As IBS consists of patients with not only heterogeneous symptom profiles but also a complex and heterogeneous pathophysiology, e.g. in terms of immune activation and bacterial dysbiosis2,5,18,23, further evaluation of links between these granin clusters with IBS symptoms and pathophysiology were investigated. Based on these clusters, we demonstrated that fecal protein levels and mucosal expression of granins are strongly associated with the mucosal and fecal bacterial composition in both IBS patients and healthy subjects. While many bacteria that were associated with either the fecal or mucosal granin clusters respectively, overlapped between IBS patients and healthy subjects, other bacteria only showed association to granins in either of the groups. This could hypothetically reflect divergences in the bacterial composition of the IBS patients in this study cohort23 or be a result of aberrant mucosal responses to bacteria as previously shown ex vivo in IBS patients compared to healthy subjects24. The underlying mechanism for the strong association between the mucosal mRNA expression of granins and the mucosal adherent bacterial composition remains to be determined. However, it may be suggested that granins expressed in the sigmoid colon have strong local influence on the adherent mucosal bacterial composition. On the other hand, fecal protein levels of granins are the net result of the secretion of granins in the entire intestine and might therefore correlate less well with adherent mucosal microbiota composition of the sigmoid colon. Further, among the mucosa adherent microbiota the discriminatory bacterial genera were similar in IBS patients and healthy subjects, which suggest that fecal protein levels and mucosal expression of granins, respectively, may influence certain bacterial genera rather than having a general inhibitory effect on bacterial growth.",

For instance, independent of granin type, there was a negative relationship between fecal protein levels of CgA, CgB, SgII and SgIII and bacterial diversity in faeces, but not mucosa, of IBS patients, and a similar pattern was seen among healthy subjects. Even though we in this study could not confirm previous findings of an association between CgA with IBS, our findings demonstrating a negative association between fecal protein levels of CgA and fecal bacterial diversity, are in line with a previous large Dutch population-based study25. Notably, in addition to CgA this study shows that also fecal protein levels of other granins CgB, SgII and SgIII are associated with a less diverse bacterial composition. Particularly, SgII seems to be a strong marker of a less diverse bacterial composition.",

Our findings therefore suggest that fecal protein levels of granins may be linked to diet-associated host regulation of the bacterial composition, potentially to maximize the digestion of nutrients, which in turn could influence gut health. Thus, fecal granins might be a host response directed to shape the intestinal bacterial composition, potentially to limit the growth of pathogens or opportunistic bacteria or to engineer the composition to allow maximal metabolic effect.",

For instance, granins have been shown to reduce luminal bacterial growth by their acidity and granin-derived peptides exerts bacteriolytic effects28,29. However, a previous study that measured the isoelectrical point (IEP)) of the granins showed that CgB had the highest IEP of the granins30, while in this study, CgB showed slightly lower correlation to bacterial alpha diversity compared to SgII with lower IEP. These findings support the notion that granins may have a regulatory effect on the bacterial composition beyond their acidity. Apart from having a direct effect on the bacterial composition, granins may potentially also have immune mediated influences on gut microbiota composition. Granins showed stronger association to both fecal and mucosal microbiota composition in healthy subjects than in IBS patients, and a link between granins and immune activation was only identified in healthy subjects. This lack of association between immune activation and granins in IBS patients requires further elucidation, but one may speculate in that granins may be involved in the aberrant mucosal immune response to bacteria, previously shown in in vitro mucosal cultures of IBS biopsies31. However, we cannot rule out that the lack of association between immune activation and granins are a result of an unknown direct influence of granins on bacterial growth.",

Further support in our study for the role of granins in the regulation of the gut-brain interaction is the moderate correlation between mucosal mRNA levels of granins with the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, THP1, in IBS patients. This finding suggests that granin production is linked to serotonin, which in turn affect gut motility, pain perception and facilitate gut-brain communication33. Hence, mucosal granin expression could have an effect on gut transit, visceral hypersensitivity and CNS function. However, neither fecal protein levels nor mucosal mRNA expression of granins were associated with psychological or gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS patients.",

However, this study does not provide knowledge of how granins interact or regulate the growth of bacterial genera. Further, as the majority of the symptoms of the patients originate from the intestine and granins have been suggested to have several local effects in the GI tract on the mucosal immune system, barrier integrity and, at least in animal models, bacterial composition and gut motility21,22,34,35 the focus of this study has been on intestinal granins. However, we do not exclude the possibility that serum chromogranins are a useful biomarker of IBS, as has previously been suggested for IBD36. One of the limitations of this study is that among the healthy subjects only four individuals belonged to the cluster characterized by high mucosal expression levels of granins. Therefore, the association between this cluster and immunological and microbial parameters should be interpreted with caution. Further, this study cannot rule out the possibility that the relationship between fecal protein levels and mucosal mRNA expression of chromogranins and secretogranins reflect the host\u2019s response to bacterial dysbiosis, aiming to restore the intestinal bacterial balance. The origin of fecal granins has not been evaluated in this study and therefore future mechanistic studies of intestinal cells and their granin secretion under different physiological conditions are needed. As compared to a previous study exploring the link between fecal protein levels of CgA and bacterial dysbiosis25, our study however also investigated fecal protein levels of CgB, SgII and SgIII as well as mucosal mRNA expression of granins and demonstrated that these less explored granins potentially have a strong role in the regulation of the gut flora. Further, the extensive, clinical, bacterial and immunological characterization of IBS patients and healthy controls in this study enabled us to explore linkages between granins and the IBS symptom profile, immune activation and the link to serotonin synthesis, which previously has not been investigated.",

Taken together with previously shown effects on bacterial growth28, these findings suggest that granins may be one of several host-produced factors being part of the microbiota-gut-brain interaction and regulating the microbiota composition of the intestine, potentially limiting the growth of opportunistic bacteria or engineering the bacterial composition to allow maximal metabolic effect.",

The R2 parameter represents the fit of the OPLS-DA with the best possible fit being R2\u2009=\u20091, while when considering heterogeneous biological variables, a model would be considered to have a good fit with an R2\u2009\u2265\u20090.5. The Q2 parameter represents the predictive ability calculated by cross-validation, with the best value of Q2\u2009=\u20091, while a Q2 value\u2009>\u20090.4 is considered good with biological variables49. The loading scatter plot may be superimposed over the OPLS-DA plot to see the associations between X-variables and individuals. Loading plots were generated to identify the X-variables most important for the discrimination between Y-variables (clusters). Parameters localized further away from the centre of the x-axis contribute more to the discrimination of the clusters in the loading scatter plot. In the loading column plot, variables with a large impact and more reliable contribution have larger columns and smaller confidence intervals. For immune and clinical parameters Variable Importance for the Projection (VIP) >0.7 was used. However, when modelling the fecal and mucosal microbiota, the number of bacterial genera exceeded the number of subjects by far. Therefore, bacterial genera that contributed most to the underlying variation in the X variables (bacterial genera) were identified with a VIP\u2009>\u20091.35. To reduce the risk of over-fit, post-hoc 100 permutation tests of OPLS-DA models were performed and only models with R2\u2009<\u20090.4 and Q2\u2009<\u20090.05 were accepted50. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) with distance calculated by ward was used to identify the fecal-dominated and mucosal-dominated clusters of IBS patients and healthy controls, based on their fecal protein levels and mucosal mRNA expression of granins. The heights of the clusters are proportional to the distance between clusters.",

In the co-inertia analysis, the co-inertia (the sum of the square of covariance) between the 2 sets is maximized and decomposed. Hence, the co-inertia value, so called RV coefficient, is a global measure of the co-structure between the 2 data sets51. The co-inertia RV coefficient is high when the 2 sets vary dependently and low when they vary independently. Co-inertia analysis was performed on fecal microbiota beta diversity and the abundance of fecal granins (CgA, CgB, SgII and SgIII). In this study, we used co-inertia analysis based on fecal microbiota composition using JSD distance metric and successively coupled with a principal component analysis computed fecal levels of granins. A Monte Carlo test was used to test the robustness of the RV coefficient.",
