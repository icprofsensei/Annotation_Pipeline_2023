Previous studies in healthy/non-hospitalized volunteers have shown that chemical stabilization (i.e. stabilized-frozen, or SF sampling) allows room-temperature storage with comparable results to FF samples. To test this in a hospital setting we compared FF and SF approaches across 17 patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using both 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. A paired (same stool specimen) comparison of FF and SF samples was made, with an overall comparable level in relative taxonomic abundances between the two sampling techniques. Though shotgun metagenomic sequencing found significant differences for certain bacterial genera (P\u2009<\u20090.001), these were considered minor methodological effects. Within-sample diversity of either method was not significantly different (Shannon diversity P16SrRNA\u2009=\u20090.68 and Pshotgun\u2009=\u20090.89) and we could not reject the null hypothesis that between-sample variation in FF and SF were equivalent (P16SrRNA\u2009=\u20090.98 and Pshotgun\u2009=\u20091.0). This indicates that SF samples can be used to reliably study the microbiome in acutely sick patient populations, thus creating and enabling further outcomes-based metagenomic studies on similarly valuable cohorts.",

However, it is very difficult to comply with these conditions in a hospital setting, where even refrigeration of samples is difficult due to limited resources, irregular sampling time-points or patient visits, as well as the need to prioritize patient care. Additionally, complete capture and follow-up of many patient populations would require at-home sampling of out-patients, adding further variability to the time between sampling and freezing. Therefore, the ideal sample collection method within hospitals would rather allow for samples to be kept at room temperature prior to freezing. This would enable at-home sample collection for out-patients, no need for urgent hospital carriers for sample delivery, and no requirement for same-day DNA-extraction.",

In particular, there is an open question as to the use of SF protocols when microbiomes are expected to have low diversity8. It is therefore currently uncertain whether or not results from previous method studies can be applied to samples collected in a hospital, where low diversity gut microbiomes are likely. Additionally, there have been little data evaluating the effect of SF methods using shotgun metagenomic sequencing4,7,14, which, unlike 16S rRNA gene sequencing data, provides detailed species level information. As bacterial species can differ in diseased populations, it is essential to collect this information and evaluate whether SF affects their compositions or not.",

Two studies using 16S rRNA gene sequencing found a significant increase in the Sutterella genus in SF versus FF samples5,9. While another study found significant differences in the relative abundances of Faecalibacterium, Sporobacter, Clostridium XVIII, and Clostridium XIVa, with differences being exacerbated in samples of low diversity8. However, we found no difference in the relative abundance of these or any other bacteria in our 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. In our shotgun metagenomic analysis there were minor differences in several bacteria driven only by a few sample pairs. This shows that differences in taxonomical abundance between methods are inconsistent across studies and may be due to background noise. Additionally, in the case of Hill et al., differences could also stem from comparing the SF protocol with directly processed samples (i.e. direct DNA extraction prior to freezing). Moreover, previous studies in healthy subjects support our conclusion being that there is little difference between SF and FF methods5\u20137,14\u201316,18.",

It has been shown that sampling from different parts of a stool can give different microbial compositional results20. However, stool sampling is random and therefore the paired design of our study should control for the non-homogenisation. Another potential limitation to our study is the fact that a number of FF samples were not frozen directly (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Table\u00a0S1). However, all of these samples were kept at 4\u2009\u00b0C until frozen. Previous studies have shown that cold storage can preserve microbial composition for a short period of time and up to 1 week6,8,9,26,27. This difficulty in direct freezing highlights the need for methodologies that allow for more flexibility between sampling and freezing, as immediate freezing is not always possible in a hospital setting. Finally, there was a slight batch effect in our 16S rRNA gene sequencing data due to an uneven distribution of FF versus SF samples in sequencing runs. This mainly affected reverse-end sequence quality and related variance between batches was minimized during processing. All reads went through the same quality control process, as described in our methods and results, and there were no observed microbial compositional differences between samples run on different batches. Importantly, batch-free shotgun metagenomic data yielded markedly similar results to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data.",

We further showed that use of stabilization techniques maintains reproducibility in cross-sectional studies by minimizing technical variance in sample handling.

No commercial influence on this decision was allowed, i.e. this decision was not made to promote a specific brand, we did not consult with marketing holders, and did not receive financial support. The decision was based on a review of available documentation and literature: OMNIgene.GUT was found to have the least effect on gut microbiome composition compared to other stabilization fluids9, with results generally being comparable to FF samples5,8,15 and differences among sampling methods being of a lower scale than those between individuals6,8,16. The OMNIgene.GUT stabilisation tube should allow samples to be kept at room temperature for up to 60 days (according to manufacturer guidelines) and a previous study (based on a healthy cohort) has shown that the OMNIgene.GUT collection kit gave similar results after 28 days at room temperature as samples with freshly-extracted DNA7.
