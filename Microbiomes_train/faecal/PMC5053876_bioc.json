We hypothesized that compositionally distinct neonatal human gut microbiota exist and are differentially related to relative\u2013risk (RR) of childhood atopy and asthma. Using stool samples (n = 298; aged 1\u201311 months) from a US birth cohort and 16S rRNA sequencing, neonates (median age 35 days) were divisible into three microbiota\u2013composition states (NGM1\u20133). Each incurred significantly different RR for multi\u2013sensitized atopy at age\u2013two years and doctor\u2013diagnosed asthma at age\u2013four years. The highest risk group, NGM3, showed lower relative abundance of certain bacteria (e.g. Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia and Faecalibacterium), higher relative abundance of particular fungi (Candida and Rhodotorula), and a distinct fecal metabolome enriched for pro-inflammatory metabolites. Ex vivo culture of adult human peripheral T\u2013cells with sterile fecal water from NGM3 subjects increased the proportion of CD4+ cells producing interleukin\u20134 and reduced the relative abundance of Foxp3+CD25+CD4+ cells. 12,13 DiHOME which discriminated NGM3 from lower\u2013risk NGMs, recapitulated the effect of NGM3 fecal water on Foxp3+CD25+CD4+ cell relative abundance. These findings suggest that neonatal gut microbiome dysbiosis drives CD4+ T\u2013cell dysfunction associated with childhood atopy.",

We therefore hypothesized that distinct neonatal (~1 month of age) gut microbiota exist and idiosyncratically influence CD4+ populations in a manner that differentially relates to RR of childhood atopy and asthma.

                    "text": "To address our primary hypothesis a Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model was used to group participants based on bacterial community composition7; three distinct neonatal gut microbiota\u2013states (NGM1, 2 and 3) represented the best model fit (Supplementary Fig. 3). PERMANOVA confirmed that NGM designation explained a small but non\u2013trivial proportion of bacterial \u03b2\u2013diversity (PERMANOVA; R2 = 0.09, P < 0.001; Fig. 2a), indicating that these compositional states (which did not differ in age [Kruskal\u2013Wallis; P = 0.256; Fig. 2b]) may represent a gradient of neonatal gut microbiota compositions. NGMs trended towards a significant relationship with fungal \u03b2\u2013diversity (Bray Curtis; PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.037, P = 0.068), signifying that each co\u2013associates with a mycobiota that primarily varies in the relative abundance of the dominant fungal taxa present. Infant samples were divisible into two compositionally distinct gut microbiota\u2013states, IGM1 (Bifidobacteriaceae\u2013dominated) and IGM2 (Lachnospiraceae\u2013dominated (unweighted UniFrac; PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.032, P = 0.001), which did differ in age (Wilcoxon rank sum, P = 0.0257); IGM1 participants were younger. IGMs were not related to fungal community \u03b2\u2013diversity (Bray\u2013Curtis; PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.011, P = 0.33), presumably because infant subjects were consistently enriched for Saccharomycetales. Using the conventional atopy definition (IgE > 0.35 IU ml\u22121), no significant difference in RR between NGMs was observed (Table 1). However when the asthma predictive5 PM\u2013atopy definition was used, NGM3 participants incurred a higher RR of atopy at age two-years compared with either NGM1 (RR = 2.94; 95% CI 1.42\u20136.09 P = 0.004; Table 1) or NGM2 groups (RR = 2.06; 95% CI 1.01\u20134.19 P = 0.048; Table 1). Even larger effect sizes for NGM3 were observed for parental reported doctor\u2013diagnosed asthma at age\u2013four years (Table 1). NGM\u2013associated RR of PM\u2013atopy was supported by the sum of specific IgE responses at age\u2013two years (Fig. 2c). As hypothesized, IGMs did not exhibit different RR for PM\u2013atopy (RR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.59\u20131.75, P = 0.94; Supplementary Table 2) or asthma (RR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.22\u20131.17 P = 0.11). Using available early\u2013life characteristics, we identified maternal education, season of birth, gestational age, age at sample collection and breastfeeding to be significantly distinct across IGMs (Supplementary Table 3). Only detectable dog allergen (Can f 1) concentrations in the home during the neonatal study visit (lowest in the NGM3 group), and baby gender (NGM3 was almost entirely male) were significantly associated with NGM state (Supplementary Table 4). Despite adjustment for these and other early\u2013life factors commonly related to allergic disease, the relationship between NGM and atopy or asthma remained (Supplementary Table 5). Only one other large pediatric gut microbiota\u2013atopy study exists1, the youngest participants of which were substantially older (~100 days) than neonates in our cohort (median age 35 days). Application of our DMM model parameters to this dataset identified two compositionally distinct groups (Bifidobacteria-dominated NGM1 and Lachnospiraceae-dominated IGM2 [Supplementary information]), indicating that neonatal examination of gut microbiota is necessary to identify distinct pioneer microbiota related to differential RR.",

These observations were consistent when NGM3 was compared to NGM2 (Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 7) and with previously described atopy\u2013associated taxonomic depletions1. Mycologically, NGM3 subjects were consistently depleted of multiple Malassezia taxa (Fig. 2e; ZINB; Benjamini\u2013Hochberg q < 0.05; Supplementary Tables 8\u20139), striking given our population\u2013based observation that this genus is characteristically enriched in the neonatal gut microbiota. Fungal taxonomic enrichments in the NGM3 group were also consistent when compared to either of the lower\u2013risk groups, and included members of the Saccharomycetales, Rhodotorula, Pleosporales and Candida (Supplementary Table 8\u20139). Hence neonatal inter\u2013kingdom microbiota dysbiosis is characteristic of PM\u2013atopy and asthma development in childhood.",

Un\u2013targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry identified fecal metabolites present in a subset (n = 28) of the representative subjects from each NGM (those with the highest posterior probability of NGM membership). A significant relationship existed between 16S rRNA profile, predicted metagenome and the metabolome of the NGMs (Procrustes; Supplementary Table 10), indicating a deterministic relationship between community composition and the metabolic microenvironment of the neonatal gut. Between\u2013group comparisons identified specific metabolites enriched in each NGM (Welch\u2019s t\u2013test; P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 11\u201312). As previously reported in the urine of atopic subjects1, NGM3 participants exhibited fecal enrichment of primary and secondary bile metabolites. However more expansive metabolic dysfunction involving lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, peptide, xenobiotic, nucleotide, vitamin and energy metabolism pathways, essentially those bacterial pathways predicted to be deficient in NGM3, was evident. Though NGM1 and NGM2 exhibited distinct metabolic programs, a common subset of metabolites differentiated them from NGM3. These included anti\u2013inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acids, docosapentaenoate (n3 DPA; 22 n5) and dihomo\u2013\u03b3\u2013linolenate9,10 (DGLA; 20:3n3 or n6), succinate, and the breast\u2013milk oligosaccharides, 3\u2013fucosyllactose and lacto\u2013N\u2013fucopentaose II known to influence gut epithelial colonization11,12 (Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 11\u201312).

Shared and distinct super\u2013 and sub\u2013pathway products amongst NGMs were illustrated using Cytoscape, vers. 3.2.131. Co\u2013occurrence networks of metabolites were constructed using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) with the R package WGCNA to find modules of highly interconnected, mutually exclusive metabolites. Pearson correlations were used to determine inter\u2013metabolite relationships, where modules are composed of positively correlated metabolites. To avoid spurious modules, the minimum module size was set to five. Module \u201ceigenmetabolites\u201d (referred to as eigengenes), were defined as the first principal component of a given module and considered as a representative measure of the joint metabolic profile of that module. Each eigenmetabolite was used to test (ANOVA) the association between its respective module and NGM, Module membership was used to determine the interconnectedness of each metabolite to its assigned module and to identify \u201chub\u201d metabolites: this was defined as the correlation between each metabolite and the eigenmetabolite (strong positive values indicate high interconnectedness).",
