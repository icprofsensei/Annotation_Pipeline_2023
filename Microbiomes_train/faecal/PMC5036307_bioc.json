We confirm the association of lower diversity of the fecal microbiome with obesity and adiposity measures, and then compare the association between fecal microbial composition and the adiposity phenotypes in a discovery subsample of twins. We identify associations between the relative abundances of fecal microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and abdominal adiposity measures. Most of these results involve visceral fat associations, with the strongest associations between visceral fat and Oscillospira members. Using BMI as a surrogate phenotype, we pursue replication in independent samples from three population-based cohorts including American Gut, Flemish Gut Flora Project and the extended TwinsUK cohort. Meta-analyses across the replication samples indicate that 8 OTUs replicate at a stringent threshold across all cohorts, while 49 OTUs achieve nominal significance in at least one replication sample. Heritability analysis of the adiposity-associated microbial OTUs prompted us to assess host genetic-microbe interactions at obesity-associated human candidate loci. We observe significant associations of adiposity-OTU abundances with host genetic variants in the FHIT, TDRG1 and ELAVL4 genes, suggesting a potential role for host genes to mediate the link between the fecal microbiome and obesity.",

Although overall obesity poses a global health epidemic, it is the accumulation of excess abdominal fat that is a critical risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease [2]. Changes in diet and a sedentary lifestyle can partly explain the rise in obesity, and family and twin studies also show a genetic influence, with obesity heritability estimates of 0.60\u20130.70 [3\u20136]. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genetic risk factors [7\u20139], but genetic variants detected to date explain less than 3\u00a0% of the heritability of obesity, with a prediction ability of up to 20\u00a0%, suggesting a role for other mechanisms [10].",

Many studies have linked different aspects of the fecal microbiome to obesity [11\u201317]. However, in most cases the causal mechanisms leading to these associations are unclear, although several theories have been suggested, including alterations in energy harvest from food [18] and an increase in potential inflammatory microbes [19]. There are also inconsistencies in the taxa associated with obesity [16] that may be explained in part by study design differences such as control of diet and sequencing platforms, but could also be due to differences in collective bacterial gene function rather than the species community composition [20]. Another complicating factor that varies among studies is the quantification of obesity. While most human studies consider body mass index (BMI) as the measure of obesity [11, 21, 22], mouse studies typically use epididymal fat weight [23] or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived measures of total body fat [18, 24]. BMI is an imprecise measure of adiposity and measures overall mass without distinction between lean and fat mass [25]. Estimates of visceral fat, however, have stronger associations with obesity-related cardio-metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [26\u201328], but have typically been difficult to measure in humans and have yet to be linked with variation in the human fecal microbiome.",

[29] found that monozygotic (MZ) twins had more similar microbiomes than marital partners or unrelated individuals, suggesting either a role for host genotype in gut microbiome colonisation or mother-to-child transmission of microbes. In addition, a study of Methanobrevibacter carriage concordance rate in twins showed higher concordance in MZ twins [30]. A recent study by Goodrich et al. [31] was the first large-scale analysis to report heritability of the human fecal microbiota, with the relative abundance of 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the family Christensenellaceae showing the most variance attributed to host genetic effects. Christensenellaceae was also enriched in abundance in the microbiomes of low-BMI individuals. Here, we build upon these findings to explore the association between the human fecal microbiome and abdominal adiposity as the main risk factor for cardio-metabolic disease risk. We obtained DXA-based measures of abdominal adiposity, specifically, visceral fat mass, subcutaneous fat mass and previously reported trunk fat measures [32], as well as body fat distribution, in a larger dataset of twins, including a subset of the twin sample profiled by Goodrich et al. [33] and a subset of the twin sample profiled by Jackson et al. [34]. We show that heritable components of the human fecal microbiome [31, 33] are significantly associated with visceral fat, confirming the key role of the microbiome in cardio-metabolic disease risk. We further identify a link between fecal microbiome profiles, visceral fat and subcutaneous fat with genetic variants in obesity candidate genes, providing potential insights into mechanisms to relate the fecal microbiome to cardio-metabolic disease risk.",

Adiposity was estimated using DXA-derived measures, which have been shown to be reliable alternatives [35\u201338] to traditional computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging scan-based measures of adiposity. The majority of these adiposity measures have been previously explored in the TwinsUK cohort; however, VFM and AGR are newly obtained phenotypes. The new measure of VFM was highly correlated with other abdominal and overall adiposity measures, including BMI (Fig.\u00a01a). Twin-based heritability analysis of VFM showed evidence of a significant additive genetic component, or heritability (h2), contributing to 0.70 (95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20090.58\u20130.74) of the total variance in VFM. The VFM heritability estimate remained high after adjustment for BMI (0.64, see Additional file 2). We obtained comparable estimates for the heritability of SFM (h2\u2009=\u20090.72 (95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20090.60\u20130.77)), pTF (h2\u2009=\u20090.66 (95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20090.55\u20130.77), AGR (h2\u2009=\u20090.65 (95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20090.55\u20130.76)), BMI (h2\u2009=\u20090.75 (95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20090.68\u20130.80) and a slightly lower estimate for WHR (h2\u2009=\u20090.32 (95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20090.24\u20130.40)), in line with previous studies [39\u201341] (Fig.\u00a01b).",

                    "text": "The human fecal microbiome in the dataset of 1313 twins comprised Firmicutes as the most dominant phylum (51\u00a0%), followed by Bacteroidetes (39\u00a0%) and Proteobacteria (4\u00a0%). These estimates are comparable to previously published results [33] and reflect a typical Western fecal microbiome. Using twins, we then explored evidence for heritability in the gut microbial profiles (relative abundances of OTUs), extending the results of Goodrich et al. [33] in the larger sample of 1313 twins using the same methods for OTU heritability. Altogether, OTU heritability in this dataset ranged between 0 and 0.42, and the average estimate over all OTUs was 0.07. The most heritable microbe was an OTU classified as Clostridium perfringens (h2\u2009=\u20090.42 (95\u00a0% CI 0.23\u20130.51)) (Additional file 1: Table S1). The family Christensenellaceae was the most heritable family reported in Goodrich et al. [33], and while OTUs representing Christensenella were not the top ranked in this larger dataset, Christensenella OTU heritability remained high with one OTU, Greengenes OTU 176318, showing a heritability of 0.31 (95\u00a0% CI 0.21\u20130.41). The microbial heritability estimates presented here are overall consistent with the original microbial twin-based heritability findings from Goodrich et al. [31] and with recent extended heritability estimates from the extended TwinsUK cohort [33]. For example, at the genus level, heritability estimates across studies show a correlation of 0.67 between this TUK-D dataset and the results in Goodrich et al. [31] (Additional file 3: Figure A) and 0.77 between TUK-D and Goodrich et al. [33] (Additional file 3: Figure B). Approximately 6\u00a0% of the dataset (122 OTUs) had evidence for at least moderate heritability (h2\u2009>\u20090.2), and these were present in at least 25\u00a0% of individuals (Additional file 1: Table S1).",

As in previous reports [15, 31, 42], we observed a significant negative association between Shannon diversity and all adiposity phenotypes (Fig.\u00a02, Additional file 4). VFM showed the most significant association with alpha diversity (beta\u2009=\u2009\u22120.14, se\u2009=\u20090.27, P\u2009=\u20094.13\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127) and WHR showed the least significant association (beta\u2009=\u2009\u22120.05, se\u2009=\u20090.031, P\u2009=\u20090.097).

Of the approximately 12,000 OTU-phenotype associations considered, 3217 were nominally significant, and 149 OTU results surpassed the Bonferroni correction (P\u2009=\u20093.90\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126). The 149 significant microbial-adiposity associations involved 97 unique OTUs (Additional file 1: Table S2), and these fell within either the Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes phylum, and most within the Ruminococcaceae family. Visceral fat (VFM) associations made up the highest proportion of significant results surpassing the Bonferroni threshold (45\u00a0%, Fig.\u00a03a). The peak result was an OTU classified as Oscillospira (Greengenes OTU 372146), which was associated with VFM (P\u2009=\u20091.93\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221212). Ruminococcaceae OTUs featured prominently in the top significant results, along with a number of other OTUs within the Lachnospiraceae family. Given the importance of VFM and AGR in cardiovascular risk, we were interested in determining potential microbial markers of cardiovascular risk. OTUs within Oscillospira, Lachnospira and Ruminococcus all showed negative associations with VFM and AGR, suggesting a potential protective role for these bacteria in cardiovascular risk (Fig.\u00a03, Additional file 1: Table S2). Blautia OTUs showed a positive association with VFM and AGR and may be a microbial marker candidate for cardiovascular risk (Fig.\u00a03a, Additional file 1: Table S2). These results support the crucial role of the microbiome towards visceral fat as a marker of adiposity and cardio-metabolic disease risk.",

We first tested the association between the 8 genera, to which the 97 adiposity-significant OTUs were assigned, and adiposity. Altogether, 11 associations passed Bonferroni correction (P\u2009=\u20090.001), and 27 genus-adiposity associations were nominally significant. These comprised 6 of the genera and included Blautia, Oscillospira, Lachnospira, Ruminococcus (within both Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae) and Clostridium. The two most significant associations were obtained between Oscillospira and VFM (P\u2009=\u20093.29\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221207, Additional file 1: Table S3) and Blautia and VFM (P\u2009=\u20093.65\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206). We considered a similar approach at the family level where the most significant bacterial-adiposity association was a negative relationship between Christensenellaceae and VFM (P\u2009=\u20091.48\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210), supporting prior findings from Goodrich et al.

Therefore, microbiome differences observed within MZ twin pairs are likely to be a result of environmental and stochastic influences or effects that are secondary to the phenotype. We estimated differences in fecal OTU relative abundances within 247 MZ twin pairs and compared these to differences in adiposity, for each of the six adiposity phenotypes using a Pearson correlation. Although no results surpassed Bonferroni significance for multiple testing across the six phenotypes, potentially in part due to the smaller sample size, many of the observed effects were consistent with those observed across 1313 individuals (Additional file 1: Table S2).

Following adjustment for BMI, 133 of the 149 significant associations remained nominally significant with the same direction of effect (Additional file 1: Table S2). Because of the strong association that we observed between alpha diversity and adiposity, we also wanted to assess if the strongest adiposity-OTU associations were with OTUs that were markers of diversity, or whether these taxa associated with adiposity were independent of species richness. To this end we repeated the adiposity-OTU analyses at the 149 significant OTU-phenotype associations now including alpha diversity as a covariate in the linear model as previously described [34]. All of the reported significant associations remained nominally significant after adjustment for alpha diversity.",

Due to the lack of cohorts with both visceral fat measurements and gut microbiome data available, BMI was used as a surrogate phenotype for visceral fat in these analyses. In each replication cohort, individuals selected were of European descent, over the age of 20, and had a BMI ranging between 18.5 and 30 units, resulting in 2338 individuals from the American Gut cohort (USA), 917 individuals from the FGFP cohort (Belgium) and 1031 individuals from the extended TwinsUK cohort (UK) who were not included in the discovery TwinsUK sample. To account for the difference between the 16S rRNA gene sequences between the TwinsUK discovery sample and the replication datasets, OTUs in each replication dataset were picked using closed reference in the software Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) [43] at 97\u00a0% using UCLUST [44] against the representative sequences for the 97 Bonferroni-significant OTUs associated with adiposity measures, to maximize similarity in datasets during replication. Further processing and downstream analyses took into account technical and lifestyle cohort-specific covariates to match as closely as possible the discovery sample and account for differences across cohorts (see Methods).",

To this end, we aimed to infer KEGG functions of the fecal microbes by using the software Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) to predict metagenomes for each sample based on the closed-reference 16S rRNA gene sequences. The PICRUSt analyses resulted in altogether 233 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and 6909 KEGG orthologies (KOs) within our sample. We next aimed to determine the relationship between the inferred KEGG functions and adiposity. We adjusted the KEGG pathway scores obtained for each individual in our sample for technical covariates (see Methods) and performed association analyses of these functions with the adiposity measures using a linear mixed effects model as previously described. We also assessed KO differential abundance in high and low visceral fat individuals using Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles (STAMP) [45].",

Four of the 13 Bonferroni-significant associations were with KEGG functions related to metabolism, as well as 98 of the FDR 5\u00a0% significant results (Fig.\u00a04a). Functions within carbohydrate metabolism were positively associated with adiposity, in particular, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, which had a Bonferroni-significant association with VFM (P\u2009=\u20091.19\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206) and FDR 5\u00a0% significant associations with the remaining adiposity measures. Five groups within the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathway were significantly differentially abundant in high visceral fat and low visceral fat individuals (Fig.\u00a04b).

                    "text": "To explore the hypothesis that host genetics may influence the observed microbial-adiposity associations, we performed candidate gene analysis comparing host genetic variants at human obesity candidate loci with the adiposity-associated fecal microbiome profiles. We selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within human loci previously associated with obesity as reported by Locke et al. [8], using common genetic variants within 97 50-kb regions, centred around the peak BMI-associated GWAS SNP in each region. At a Bonferroni-corrected P-value threshold (P\u2009=\u20095.31\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206) taking into account the total number of genomic regions and adiposity OTUs considered, OTU associations with genetic variants in three genomic regions surpassed multiple testing. The strongest association between host genotype and adiposity-associated OTUs was observed between an OTU within the Clostridiales order (Greengenes OTU 181702) and a host genetic variant within an intron of the FHIT gene (rs74331972 with OTU 181702, P\u2009=\u20092.49\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206, Fig.\u00a05a). FHIT encodes the fragile histidine triad protein and is a tumour suppressor gene that has been linked to cancers of the digestive tract. Although the most significant FHIT association was obtained with OTU 181702 (h2\u2009=\u20090.13), which we identified as significantly associated with SFM and VFM (P\u2009=\u20091.18\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206 and 1.27\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206 respectively), the same genetic variant was also associated with another VFM- and SFM-associated OTU (rs74331972 with OTU 287790, P\u2009=\u20095.38\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221205). The second ranked significant genetic association was obtained between variants near gene TDRG1 (peak SNP rs1433723, P\u2009=\u20094.32\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206) with an open reference unknown Clostridiales OTU (h2\u2009=\u20090.14), which we had identified as significantly associated with VFM (P\u2009=\u20094.97\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221207, Fig.\u00a05b). The final significant genetic association was observed at a variant in an intron of the gene ELAVL4 (rs2480677, P\u2009=\u20094.95\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206, Fig.\u00a05c) with an unknown Blautia OTU, 194733 (h2\u2009=\u20090.02), which we had identified as significantly associated with VFM (P\u2009=\u20091.27\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221207), SFM (P\u2009=\u20092.26\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206) and AGR (P\u2009=\u20093.11\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221207) in the peak 149 adiposity-OTU results. When we considered the genetic-OTU association results at a less conservative significance threshold (P\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124), there were in total 412 suggestive OTU-genetic associations located within or near 48 unique genes, including obesity genes such as FTO, RPTOR and TMEM18.",

We then tested the associations of this variant on TDRG1 gene expression and DNA methylation levels in adipose biopsies available for 542 individuals from the TwinsUK cohort [47, 48].

The majority of microbial associations were obtained with visceral fat, a key metabolic disease risk factor, which we also show is strongly heritable in our extended sample of more than 3000 twins. In addition to obtaining novel heritability estimates for visceral fat, we show that android/gynoid ratio is highly heritable in this same cohort, and confirm high heritability estimates for the remaining adiposity phenotypes. Using BMI as a measure of obesity, we robustly replicate eight obesity-associated fecal microbes in three independent samples from the American Gut, FGFP and extended TwinsUK dataset. We also demonstrate that host genes have an effect on components of the fecal microbiota, including the 97 adiposity-associated OTUs, although the mechanism remains unclear. Given the impact of host genetics on both obesity and fecal microbes, and our findings of strong association between adiposity and fecal microbiome variation, our results therefore support the hypothesis that heritable microbes play a role in determining components of obesity relevant to cardio-metabolic disease and may be one potential source contributing to missing heritability in obesity.",

Given the strong correlation between multiple adiposity phenotypes, we sought to assess if the high heritability observed in visceral fat is due to high heritability of BMI.

However, although specific probiotic intake has been reported to lower visceral fat [50], to date there has not yet been a systematic comparison of visceral fat and variation in the fecal microbiome across human subjects. Our results are therefore the first, to our knowledge, to link visceral fat with changes in the fecal microbiota variation in humans. The findings suggest that visceral fat mass is more important for differences in the obese microbiome, rather than overall body mass. This is also demonstrated in the recent Clarke et al. study [51], where elite rugby union players, who due to their greater muscle mass were defined as overweight and obese (BMI\u2009=\u200929\u2009\u00b1\u20093), had a more diverse microbiota than those of both low BMI and high BMI controls. We also report a novel android/gynoid ratio heritability estimate of 0.65, higher than previous family-based estimates of 0.43 [52]. Android/gynoid ratio, like visceral fat, is also a risk factor for cardio-metabolic disease, and accordingly our results show consistent direction of association effects for OTUs associated with both phenotypes.",

We therefore present a novel dual approach, using visceral fat to find novel metabolic associations in a sample of twins, and BMI to confirm associations across independent samples. The power of this design was apparent in the number of peak associations observed with visceral fat. All of the reported adiposity OTUs reported in this study were significantly associated with visceral fat, while only 7 of these OTUs were significantly associated with BMI, suggesting that microbial studies that only use BMI as a measurement of obesity may be limited.",

However, the direction of association differed for different genera within the Firmicutes. For example, Oscillospira OTUs often showed protective associations with VFM, while Blautia OTUs commonly showed adverse associations that could be used as potential markers of cardiovascular risk. Our findings also confirm the importance of fecal microbiome diversity in obesity, as we are able to replicate strong association between adiposity phenotypes and alpha diversity. Furthermore, the majority of the observed 97 VFM associations are independent of alpha diversity and BMI, suggesting that the OTUs significant in this analysis are not just markers of diversity, but form real associations with adiposity and cardio-metabolic disease risk.",

The average shared environment component was also higher, but the average unique environment component was lower than the overall dataset average. We therefore infer that host genetics in particular, as well as early shared environmental factors, play an important role in the variation of obesity-associated microbes. However, although the estimate (including measurement error) is approximately 0.80, the average unique environment component in the 97 OTUs was lower than the overall dataset average. This is consistent with findings from previous work [31] that environmental factors are key drivers of the microbiome, and they strongly contribute to variation at the obesity-microbiome associations.",

Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae continue to display opposing directions of effect at the family level. We also see that the heritable family Christensenellaceae is strongly associated with visceral fat, as previously reported for BMI in Goodrich et al. [31]. Christensenellaceae was previously found to be protective of obesity both in mice and in human twins in our previous work [31]. We extend the findings here, showing strong protective associations between Christensenellaceae and visceral fat, in particular suggesting that individuals with Christensenellaceae have less cardiovascular risk than those without. Further work to elucidate the mechanism of protection is required.",

At a stringent Bonferroni threshold 8 OTUs replicated across all cohorts, and at a more relaxed threshold 49 OTUs replicated at nominal significance in at least one cohort with the same direction of effect as in the discovery sample. The replication results included OTUs classified within Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. A higher relative abundance of Firmicutes has previously been associated with obesity in some but not all studies, and several of these studies show an increase in Firmicutes in obese subjects [12, 53, 54]. For example, Ruminococcus gnavus has been shown to be significantly enriched in low microbial gene count individuals who were prone to obesity in one study [15]. However, the phylum Firmicutes contains more than 270 genera with many different and diverse functions. Because changes may occur at finer-grained taxonomic resolution, and because the baseline abundance of different genera differs among human populations, opposing selection processes at different phylogenetic levels may in part explain differing results in studies determining microbiota differences in obesity [55, 56], including recent meta-analyses across multiple obesity microbiota datasets [16, 57]. This difference in directional effects in genera of the same family has been noted in animal models. Mice consuming a Western diet have previously been reported to have increased levels of Eubacterium dolichum [58], while another study has shown that mice consuming a high-fat diet have decreased levels of Allobaculum OTUs [59]. Both of these microbes are members of the Erysipelotrichaceae family, and yet they show opposite directions of effect in our data.",

The reasons for the partial replication of our results are unclear and are likely in part to capture differences in protocols, genetics, geography, lifestyle and diet, which are difficult to account for in full during the analysis. The American Gut dataset used the protocols developed for the Earth Microbiome Project [60], which are largely the same as those used in Goodrich et al. [31], except that the American Gut dataset is filtered to remove Gammaproteobacteria sequences increased following transit. FGFP protocols are most similar to those of TUK-D and TUK-R, however, with similar sample collection methods and sequencing protocols. Analysis of the American Gut data adjusted for more covariates than TUK-R, TUK-D and FGFP, and the cohort itself included a different age range (average 50, 21\u201394) and gender ratio (53\u00a0% female). The age range and gender ratio of the FGFP cohort were similar to those of AG (average age\u2009=\u200951 (21\u201385), 55\u00a0% female), while TUK-R was expectedly more similar to TUK-D (average age\u2009=\u200957.3 (20\u201389), 80\u00a0% female). Additionally, the American Gut samples were primarily from the USA (84\u00a0%), unlike the discovery and replication TwinsUK samples from the UK and the Belgian FGFP samples. The majority of the 97 OTUs show the same direction of association in the TwinsUK discovery, TwinsUK replication and FGFP samples, but this is not the case in the American Gut sample results (Additional file 5). This observation may partly reflect potential differences in OTU associations in different populations and geographical locations, specifically between European and American samples. Previous studies have shown some differences at the OTU level between countries [42, 61]. The sample collection methods also differed between the European studies with greater quantities collected in TUK-D, TUK-R and FGFP compared to swabs in American Gut, although neither used fixatives. These factors highlight the on-going difficulty in replicating OTU level results between studies and cohorts. Additional standardisation of both technical and analytical methods will help distinguish features common across populations, those sensitive to technical influence and those unique to a particular region or group.",

It has been suggested that the dysbiosis of microbial species in obesity is not as important as the resulting functional dysbiosis [62]. Using the PICRUSt method to predict metagenomes and functions, we find an enrichment of metabolism-related KEGG functions associated with adiposity, in particular, carbohydrate metabolism and N-glycan biosynthesis. We see a strong positive association between visceral fat and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, particularly with the genes ttdA and ttdB. The glyoxylate cycle, a pathway that until recently was thought to be absent in most animals [63], is able to metabolise fatty acids into glucose, thus contributing to insulin resistance in the event of fatty acid abundance [64]. More recently glyoxylate has been highlighted as a biomarker of type 2 diabetes, even as much as 3\u00a0years prior to diagnosis of diabetes [65]. Here we show a potential mechanistic impact of the microbial dysbiosis observed in individuals with increased visceral fat. We cannot assess whether the heritable microbes are driving the differences observed in these pathways; however, it would be interesting to determine the heritability of the inferred microbial functions, particularly in future studies with metagenomic datasets.",

[31] twin-based heritability analysis results, although peak heritable OTUs are slightly different. Comparison of the heritability results at the genus level show that consistent estimates were obtained across the two datasets (r\u2009=\u20090.67, Additional file 3: Figure A), and these were also consistent with a recent heritability analysis of the extended TwinsUK dataset [33] (r\u2009=\u20090.77, Additional file 3: Figure B). The most heritable taxon in our dataset is an OTU classified as Clostridium perfringens (h2\u2009=\u20090.42). The heritability estimate for the most heritable OTU reported in the Goodrich et al. [31] study, OTU 176318 assigned to Christensenellaceae (original heritability estimated at 0.36), remained similar in the extended dataset, with a new heritability of 0.31. The most heritable OTUs in our dataset were relatively frequent, being present in at least 25\u00a0% of individuals. A potential mechanism that underlies fecal microbial heritability is the ability of the host genome to impact the gut environment, for example, by altering acidity of the gut or by host control of microRNAs that can enter bacterial cells and affect bacterial growth [66]. Therefore, the likely mechanism of microbial heritability is host genetic manipulation of microbes [67].",

To explore how human genes could influence these microbes in the context of obesity, we pursued host genetic association analyses of the adiposity-associated OTUs using a candidate gene analysis approach at host obesity GWAS loci. The most significant genetic association was obtained with a variant in the gene FHIT, which encodes the fragile histidine triad protein. Significantly reduced FHIT gene expression levels have been reported in cardiac tissue from obese compared to lean subjects [68]. Although this genetic variant is not an eQTL itself, it does show moderate evidence for genetic impacts on DNA methylation levels in adipose tissue, specifically at a CpG site in a CpG island shore in the promoter of the FHIT gene. Therefore, it may have an indirect impact on FHIT adipose tissue gene expression in obesity through epigenetic regulation of FHIT expression. FHIT also appears to act as a tumour suppressor in several types of cancer [69], and its abnormal function has been linked to cancers of the digestive tract [70]. The FHIT-associated OTU is strongly associated with abdominal adiposity in our data, including SFM and VFM, suggesting that it plays a role in cardio-metabolic disease risk in the host.",

Furthermore, rs1433723 in TDRG1 is an interesting candidate for follow-up, as it exhibits strong genetic influences on TDRG1 gene expression in parts of the GI tract (oesophagus mucosa). This genetic variant also impacts TDRG1 DNA methylation levels in adipose tissue, specifically at a CpG site in an intra-genic CpG island in the gene body, which could mark an alternative transcription start site.

The strong associations that we detect between fecal microbes and obesity phenotypes suggest that host genetics may influence these microbial-obesity associations. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified host genetic variants in three obesity human loci which show associations with adiposity-associated fecal microbes in our dataset. These variants are promising candidates for further follow-up studies to assess their potential role in obesity-microbial interactions. Although human obesity is highly heritable, human genetic variants detected to date explain only a small proportion of the heritability in obesity. Given our observation that the average microbial heritability is greater at the most associated adiposity OTUs, our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that a proportion of the heritability in obesity may be explained by heritable fecal microbes.",

Furthermore, to determine more robust genetic associations, we require a much larger sample size than is represented here. Lack of metagenomic data limits our functional interpretation of the microbial dysbiosis observed in obesity, although predictions from PICRUSt do provide some interesting insights for further investigation. Some research has shown that in individuals who are dieting, there is an increase in Bacteroidetes and, conversely, individuals who are over-eating show an abundance of Firmicutes [53]. It is therefore important to know whether the individuals in the study were calorie restricted. This is one limitation of the present study, and future work should focus specifically on how the interaction of diet affects visceral fat associations with the fecal microbiome. Other considerations that should be taken into account in the future are stool consistency [71] and antibiotic and other drug use [72, 73].",

DNA extracted from fecal samples underwent amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using the 515F and 806R primers, followed by 250-bp paired-end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Processing of sequencing and OTU picking was carried out as previously described [34]. In brief, paired-end sequences were merged with at least a 200-bp overlap, and those longer than 275\u00a0bp were filtered from the dataset. The remaining sequences were analysed using QIIME 1.7.0 (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) [43]. Sequences containing ambiguous or low quality reads (Phred score \u226425) and uncorrectable barcodes were removed from the dataset and open-reference OTU picking was performed against the Greengenes May 2013 database. OTUs not found in at least 25\u00a0% of individuals were then discarded, and their counts were converted to relative abundances within samples, followed by the addition of a pseudocount (10\u22126) to remove zero counts. Mixed effects models were fitted to these data to control for technical and batch effects. The regression included sequencing run, depth of sample sequencing and technician who extracted and loaded the DNA for sequencing, as well as sample collection method (by post or in person) as predictors with OTU abundances as the response. Residuals from these models were then used in subsequent downstream analyses. The adiposity OTU and OTU candidate gene downstream analyses also included further adjustment for covariates such as age, gender and five long-term (10-year) summary broad dietary profiles (see following subsection on phenotype data). The final dataset contained 2135 OTUs.",

First, we compared microbiome OTUs and phenotypes by fitting a linear mixed effects regression (LMER) model using the R package lme4 [77] across all 1313 individuals. In this model the phenotype was the response variable, and the OTU was a fixed effect predictor. Additional factors included family and zygosity taken into account as random effects, and sex, age and dietary profiles (principal components) considered as fixed effects. Each phenotype was normalised to a standard normal distribution prior to analysis. To assess the significance of the associations, we compared the full regression model described above to a null model that excluded the OTU predictor using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test in R. We report associations that passed nominal significance (P\u2009=\u20090.05), as well as those that passed a Bonferroni threshold for multiple testing (P\u2009=\u20093.90\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221206).",

We therefore included these additional data as a third replication sample (TwinsUK (TUK-R)), where all individuals were of European descent over the age of 20 with a BMI between 18.5 and 30. Read data were closed-reference clustered using the representative sequences for the replication OTUs as a reference, using UCLUST [44] at 97\u00a0% in QIIME v1.9.0 [43]. Counts for each OTU in each individual were converted to relative abundances by dividing by the total number of reads in the sample. A count of 0.000001 was added to the relative abundances to account for zeros, and these were then log transformed. The transformed counts were then residualised to adjust for sequencing run, collection method, person who loaded the plate and person who performed the DNA extraction. Lifestyle covariates included in downstream analyses matched those described for the TwinsUK discovery sample. Altogether, 76 associations showed the same direction of effect and 7 associations were nominally significant in the TwinsUK replication sample.",

Average relative abundance of the OTUs in the overall dataset is also shown. Table S2. 149 Bonferroni-significant OTU-adiposity associations. OTU-adiposity results are obtained from linear mixed effects regression models and include the original results (OTU-Adiposity) and results after adjustment for BMI (OTU-Adiposity BMI-adjusted). We also provide the OTU heritability and average OTU abundance in the cohort. The last two columns show the OTU results from the within MZ twin-pair difference analyses (MZ Diff Beta), and whether the MZ results were concordant with the linear mixed effects results. Reported phenotypes are visceral fat (VFM), subcutaneous fat (SFM), android/gynoid ratio (AGR), BMI, waist/hip ratio (WHR) and % trunk fat (pTF). Table S3. Genus-level associations with adiposity, where the collapsed taxonomy OTU genus was significantly associated with adiposity. Reported phenotypes are visceral fat (VFM), subcutaneous fat (SFM), android/gynoid ratio (AGR) and BMI. Table S4. Replication of TwinsUK (TUK-D) results in three independent cohorts, the American Gut (AG), the Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP) and the expanded TwinsUK dataset (TUK-R). The table lists the 97 OTUs forming 149 significant adiposity associations in TwinsUK and their association with BMI in both the replication and discovery samples. In addition, the table outlines the results of two meta-analyses that were performed across the studies, the first of just the independent cohorts, and the second including the discovery cohort. Finally, the last section of the table shows which OTUs were replicated in at least one of the replication cohorts. Table S5. Human genomic analyses at adiposity-related candidate host genes FHIT, TDRG1 and ELAVL4. The table shows significant genetic associations between the adiposity-related candidate host genetic variants and adiposity-associated OTUs. The final three columns summarize the results of the association between the host genetic variants and DNA methylation at CpG sites targeted by the Illumina 450\u00a0k array. DNA methylation association was performed at the lead OTU-associated SNP in each locus; therefore, rs1433722 was not tested (NA). Table S6. List of the 97 BMI-associated loci reported in Locke et al.
