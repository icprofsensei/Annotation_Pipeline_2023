However, little is known about the complete microbiota profile of adult individuals suffering from asthma. We determined the fecal microbiota in 21 adult patients suffering allergic asthma (age 39.43 \u00b1 10.98 years old) and compare it with the fecal microbiota of 22 healthy controls (age 39.29 \u00b1 9.21 years old) using culture independent techniques. An Ion-Torrent 16S rRNA gene-based amplification and sequencing protocol was used to determine the fecal microbiota profile of the individuals. Sequence microbiota analysis showed that the microbial alpha-diversity was not significantly different between healthy and allergic individuals and no clear clustering of the samples was obtained using an unsupervised principal component analysis. However, the analysis of specific bacterial groups allowed us to detect significantly lower levels of bifidobacteria in patients with long-term asthma. Also, in allergic individuals the Bifidobacterium adolescentis species prevailed within the bifidobacterial population. The reduction in the levels on bifidobacteria in patients with long-term asthma suggests a new target in allergy research and opens possibilities for the therapeutic modulation of the gut microbiota in this group of patients.",

It has also been suggested that modifications of the intestinal microbiota composition that occur as a result of the westernized life-style has disrupted mechanisms that are involved in the development of immunological tolerance [3]. In relation to this, the scientific information about the relationship between allergy and gut microbiota dysbiosis (an imbalance in the gut microbial ecology) is controversial nowadays. While some reports highlight an aberrant microbiota associated with allergic manifestation, such as asthma, rhinitis, and eczema, others did not find any significant differences in the microbial profile, or specific microbial groups, in the gut microbiota of allergic individuals. This could be due to the fact that different allergens can drive allergen-specific responses, to the lack of standardized protocols to analyze the human microbiota, and because the studies were not performed in well-defined population groups. For instance, some studies have indicated an association between the gut microbiota composition and atopic disease, and there is solid evidence that variations of particular intestinal microorganisms might be associated with this physiological condition [4]. Also, a shift of the gut bacterial profiles has been associated with immune disorders in infants and in adults [5\u20138], as well as in some food allergies, such as milk-hypersensitivity [9,10]. However, despite some positive results, strategies to ameliorate the clinical manifestations of allergy through the modulation of the intestinal microbiota using probiotic microorganisms yielded limited results [11,12].",

Inclusion criteria also included confirmed diagnosis of asthma (with or without rhinitis) due to perennial allergens. The diagnosis was stablished when patients had a positive skin test and serum-specific IgE levels greater or equal to 3.5 kU/L, with clinically related symptoms. Common relevant antigens were usually house dust mite (HDM), grasses, dog epithelia and a work place allergen (green coffee).

We followed strict exclusion criteria trying to minimize the influence of environmental and genetic factors on our analysis. We considered a homogeneous group, with a very specific pathology: confirmed allergic asthma. Clinical history of the patients and the evidence of an IgE mediated disease are the main criteria in our analysis, in order to associate the microbiota profile in a highly selected allergic group. Fig 1 shows the microbiota composition at phylum, family and genus level that was obtained for healthy individuals and asthmatic persons. Rarefaction curves obtained by plotting the Shannon and Chao1 indexes against the number of sequences (S1 Fig) showed that a large part of the diversity of the samples was detected. We did not obtain significant alpha-diversity indexes (Chao1, PD Whole Tree, Observed Species, Shannon and Simpson indexes) between asthmatic and healthy individuals (data not shown). Furthermore, individuals were ordered according to their sequence data composition by Unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the taxonomic data at the phylum, family and genus level. No clear clustering of the samples was obtained at the three different levels analyzed (Fig 2 shows the plot obtained using genus level), suggesting that the characteristics of the microbiota are similar considering the sample sets of sequences in both population groups.",

Both metadata/microbiota profiles were loaded in STAMP v2.0.3 and a PCA analysis performed using the variability of the 16S rRNA gene profiling at different taxonomic levels. Sample classification according to the metadata revealed no specific clustering of the samples or correlation with different clinical features and analytical results. Furthermore, our results do not stablish a link between microbial groups and asthma when the fecal microbiota was analyzed in its entirety, and statistically significant differences between healthy controls and asthmatic patients were only detected for Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium at the genus level (both genera were more abundant in allergic asthma patients; S2 Table). However, when we examined the possible relationship between the bacterial groups present in the fecal samples and the time suffering from asthma, we found that low levels of bifidobacteria correlate with long ailment periods of asthma (Fig 3). Although the amplicons of the 16S sequences could be relatively short to perform a totally reliable population structure analysis at species level, it is noteworthy that the relative abundance of sequences assigned to Bifidobacterium adolescentis was significantly higher in allergic asthma samples. Remarkably, in asthmatic individuals the B. adolescentis species prevailed, but in healthy controls a group of other species (Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium bifidum) constituted the majority of the bifidobacterial population. Furthermore, if we subcategorize the allergic asthma patients considering the median for asthma ailment (11 years), the means of the B. adolescentis population in the two groups (long-term asthma and short-term asthma groups; > or < 11 years suffering from asthma) are significantly different (ANOVA test, p<0.002). Remarkably, our observations were significantly relevant for allergic asthma but not for duration of allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, using a Spearman Ranked Scores analysis, the levels of Bifidobacterium and of B. adolescentis were negatively correlated with the asthma duration (correlation coefficient -0,84074, p-value: 3,4588E-06 for Bifidobacterium; correlation coefficient -0,84682, p-value: 2,494E-06 for B. adolescentis). On the other hand, a multivariate linear analysis showed that the time suffering the disease and the IgE titer were identified as B. adolescentis predictor variables. We found that there is a negative association of B. adolescentis with the time suffering the disease (\u03b2 = -0.457), and a positive association with total IgE levels (\u03b2 = 0.444), p model <0.001.

There is solid experimental evidence that gut microbiota regulates our inflammatory immune response [22]. Disturbed gut colonization patterns have been associated with allergic disease but whether microbial variation is the cause or effect of these diseases is still under investigation. Whereas some authors have established a link between specific microbial profiles and allergy, other authors suggest that this should not be considered in broad terms and that it depends on the clinical manifestation of the allergic reaction and of the specific antigens triggering the immune response [9, 23,24].",

However, the present work, performed in a well-defined population of allergic asthma adults, shows that the relative abundance of bifidobacteria is higher in the asthma group, suggesting an influence of this particular pathology on shaping bifidobacterial ecology in the gut. In relation to this, infants of atopic mothers were the only ones to be colonized with B. adolescentis and infants from allergic mothers had lower counts of bifidobacteria in feces than infants from non-allergic mothers [25]. Furthermore, Stsepetova et al. [26] indicated a less diverse composition of intestinal microbiota and prevalence of B. adolescentis in allergic childrens, and He et al. [27] found that B. adolescentis is found more often in the fecal microbiota of allergic childrens than in non-allergic ones. Thus, from previous works it seems that there is an association between B. adolescentis and allergy. The novelty of our findings is that, to our knowledge, this is the first time that bifidobacteria in general, and B. adolescentis in particular, has been associated with the ailment of allergic asthma. Remarkably, higher levels of Faecalibacterium were detected in the asthmatic patients; this finding could be related to the regular treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs of most of the patients, since the presence of Faecalibacterium is normally decreased during inflammatory process [28].",

However, lower bifidobacterial levels are present in asthmatic individuals with long-term asthma, compared with those whose asthma was diagnosed more recently. Our findings suggest that the differences in the bifidobacterial populations in control vs asthma groups, as well as in short-term vs long-term asthma groups, could be explored further in order to develop novel treatments based on gut microbiota modulation. The results obtained also contribute to generate knowledge on the potential role of bifidobacteria in the physiology of allergy, and support the potential use of strains of these genera as probiotics to modulate allergy symptoms.",
