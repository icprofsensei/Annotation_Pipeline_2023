The list of assayed biomarkers known to be raised in association with obesity is also not exhaustive, and many other potential candidate analytes, such as leptin, resistin, adipokines, IL\u201010, and visfatin, have not been included in this study.",

These results were similar to the National Nutrition Survey 2010,33 implying that the dietary consumption of the study subjects is representative of the general population in Singapore. Overall, the cohort shared a relatively similar baseline dietary composition characterized by very low fiber and high fat and protein intake. The findings also demonstrated that the proportion of fiber and fat/saturated fat diets was not the key determinants of central obesity; rather, a higher consumption of sugars might lead to obesity, although this was only marginally significant. It is of note that the dietary patterns of subjects were based on self\u2010recording, which was dependent on their individual level of understanding and diligence in completing the survey, and thus might not be the most accurate reflection of the actual dietary intake. Nonetheless, the 3\u2010day dietary survey has been validated in scientific studies and has been demonstrated to be acceptable as dietary assessment tools.34\n",

It is tempting to speculate that the contents of the diet influenced the outcome of the gut microbiome, that is, higher consumption of sugar is linked to lower relative abundances of Anaerofilum, Gemellaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Rikenellaceae in the obese group in this study. However, we cannot disregard or uncouple the effect of the host's immune system as evident from the many publications reviewed recently by Freidman.37 Moreover, further experiments, such as validation using quantitative polymerase chain reactions, are required to confirm the study findings.",

The relatively small sample size of this study was not powered to detect subtle differences in microbial diversity in the various subgroups. In addition, the baseline microbiome variability was not determined as the study did not sample multiple fecal samples for comparison. It is also worth noting that there were statistically significant (P = 0.03) differences in gender and age between the obese and nonobese, groups which might be confounding factors influencing the human gut microbiome. Moreover, microbiome profiling provides no indication on the actual functionality and consequence on the individual. Further functional and clinical studies are required to elucidate the mechanistic pathophysiology associated with microbiome differences.",
