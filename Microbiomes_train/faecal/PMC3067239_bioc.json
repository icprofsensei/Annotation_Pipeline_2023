In soil and marine environments, microorganism-infecting phages are the most common type of virus. Although several types of bacteriophage have been isolated from fermented foods, little is known about the overall viral assemblages (viromes) of these environments. In this study, metagenomic analyses were performed on the uncultivated viral communities from three fermented foods, fermented shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique, a total of 81,831, 70,591 and 69,464 viral sequences were obtained from fermented shrimp, kimchi and sauerkraut, respectively. Moreover, 37 to 50% of these sequences showed no significant hit against sequences in public databases. There were some discrepancies between the prediction of bacteriophages hosts via homology comparison and bacterial distribution, as determined from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These discrepancies likely reflect the fact that the viral genomes of fermented foods are poorly represented in public databases. Double-stranded DNA viral communities were amplified from fermented foods by using a linker-amplified shotgun library. These communities were dominated by bacteriophages belonging to the viral order Caudovirales (i.e., Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae). This study indicates that fermented foods contain less complex viral communities than many other environmental habitats, such as seawater, human feces, marine sediment, and soil.",

Prior to the 1990s, our knowledge of environmental viral communities was limited by the available methodology (3, 25). Viruses cannot be cultivated in the absence of host cells, and the inability to culture most microorganisms under standard laboratory conditions has hindered progress in the field of viral ecology (9). Recently, it has become possible to direct whole metagenome sequencing of uncultured viral assemblages in a process termed \u201cviral metagenomics,\u201d and this advance has dramatically expanded our insight into understanding of viral diversity (39). Researchers are now using this approach to explore viral communities in a wide range of environments, including soil (16), sea (48), potable water (40), activated sludge (33), coral (30), and hot springs (43), as well as in human samples from feces (7, 8, 55), blood (10), and the respiratory tract (51).",

Human contact with fermented foods not only results in a direct link between food microbial ecosystems and the ecology of gastrointestinal microbiota, but it also affects human health (44, 55). Food fermentation is driven by a rich and dense microbial consortia that include bacteria, archaea, and yeast, which are organisms that coexist and interact within a given environment. Fermented foods such as yogurt and cheese are consumed worldwide, and these foodstuffs are commonly prepared by using a selected starter culture. In contrast, kimchi, sauerkraut, and fermented seafood products are fermented by microorganisms present in the raw ingredients. Although kimchi is a fermented vegetable product (Chinese cabbage mixed with various vegetable ingredients and condiments) with a long tradition in Korea, it is now consumed worldwide (more than 1,500,000 metric tons are consumed annually) and is considered to be one of the five healthiest foods (http://eating.health.com/2008/02/01/worlds-healthiest-foods/). Sauerkraut is a fermented cabbage side dish consumed commonly in Eastern Europe and North America, and it is prepared with shredded cabbage and 2 to 3% salt (49). Fermented and salted seafood products such as shrimp, shellfish, and anchovies are widely produced and consumed in Asia and Europe (37).",

Minimal assembly parameters were set at 98% identity and a 35-bp overlap. To obtain an identical read length, all sequences were trimmed to 100 bp prior to sequence selection and assembly. Average genome length was calculated on the basis of BLAST results (E-value < 10\u22125) against 510 complete phage genomes (Rohwer lab's phage genome database). Two parameters, average contig spectra and average genome length, were examined with the Phage Communities using the Contig Spectra (PHACCS) tool (2). Community structure and diversity estimates were determined by using the rank-abundance model that showed the lowest error. To identify similar proteins, the metabolic profile of each virome was assessed by using BLASTX (E-value < 10\u22125) against the SEED-subsystems database, which contains a collection of genes with related metabolic functions (http://www.theseed.org).

The Glimmer program (14) was used to predict metagenomic open reading frames (ORFs) from contigs. BLASTX was then used to compare predicted ORFs and intergenic sequences to the CAMERA databases (45). When these sequences were compared to CAMERA's nonidentical protein database, it was evident that almost all contigs contained ORFs and intergenic regions with similarity to phage or prophage gene sequences. The Artemis and ACT programs (12) were used to compare contigs to their cognate phage genomes.",

No significant identity (E-value of >0.001 or significant matches) was found between 46% (fermented shrimp), 37% (kimchi), and 50% (sauerkraut) of the selected sequences and protein sequences in the extant GenBank and ACLAME databases (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). \u201cKnown\u201d sequences with E-values of <0.001 were classified as virus, prophage, plasmid, bacteria, eukarya, or archaea, according to the best hit. Specifically, 40, 32, and 34% (fermented shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut, respectively) of the known sequences were most similar to viral protein sequences (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material); 29, 18, and 24% of the identified sequences showed similarities to prophage sequences; and virus-related sequences, including both virus and prophage, accounted for 50 to 69% of known sequences of the three fermented foods. Unlike culture-dependent investigations of phage diversity, which require specific microbial hosts, metagenomic analyses such as that performed in the present study produce large numbers of viral sequences that have no or very low identity to sequences in public databases. This phenomenon has been reported previously for viromes in other environments, including an Antarctic lake (25), seawater (3), activated sludge (33), and reclaimed and potable water (40), as well as from human fecal and respiratory tract samples (8, 51). The higher ratio of unknown genes might also be related to the short read length (100 to 400 bp) of metagenome sequences causing fewer homolog than long read sequences (>750 bp) (15, 52). Despite a virus-targeting extraction methodology, a number of the \u201cknown\u201d viral metagenome sequences showed a very strong similarity to bacterial sequences. This finding may be due to the incorporation of host genes into viral genomes, uncharacterized prophage sequences and the bias of databases toward microbial rather than viral genome sequences (11, 25, 40).",

However, these samples only contained a few dsDNA viral families that all belonged to the order Caudovirales. Other environmental habitats such as an Antarctic lake or paddy soil have been shown to contain ssDNA viruses related to other viral families (e.g., Circoviridae, Geminiviridae, Inoviridae, Nanoviridae, and Microviridae) (Fig. 3). The abundance of ssDNA viruses can be assessed by using the multiple displacement amplification method (21, 42) and the diversity of ssDNA viruses in fermented food requires further study. Of the dsDNA viruses, the Siphoviridae and Myoviridae families are known to infect bacteria. Their prevalence in the fermented shrimp and sauerkraut samples is consistent with a previous study that used conventional plaque assays to examine bacteriophage diversity in commercial sauerkraut and which isolated a total 171 phages (28).",

A small number of sequences related to the Phyconaviridae family were identified in the fermented shrimp (0.4%) and kimchi (0.1%) samples. Members of the Phyconaviridae family are the largest viruses known to infect harmful eukaryotic algae, including phytoplankton species responsible for algal blooms (22).

Barcoded pyrosequencing was used to determine that fermented shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut generated 15,549, 40,000, and 21,419 bacterially derived sequences, respectively. At the genus level, 45 to 99% of the reads could be classified into three to five bacterial genera, while the three viral metagenomes indicated the presence of nine different types of phage and prophage host (Fig. \u200b(Fig.22 ). The relative abundance of genera in the bacterial community was then compared to viral community phage and prophage host abundance in the three fermented foods (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). Although a similar bacterial community was observed in both fermented vegetable foods, i.e., kimchi and sauerkraut, the fermented shrimp sample exhibited a distinctly different bacterial community. At the genus level, Pseudomonas (31.6%), Cupriavidus (7.6%), and Propionibacterium (5.6%) were assigned to core bacterial groups in the fermented shrimp, whereas 98.5 and 88.6% of the total reads were assigned to only three genera in kimchi and sauerkraut. Previously, culture-dependent methodologies have identified Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus as dominant bacterial genera in sauerkraut fermentation (34). Moreover, previous culture-dependent and -independent studies of bacterial species in kimchi have demonstrated the predominance of several genera of lactic acid bacteria, including Weisella and Leuconostoc (5, 32). Similarly, the present study revealed that Lactobacillus (43.2%), Weisella (29.9%) and Leuconostoc (25.4%) were the dominant genera in kimchi and that Weisella (46.1%), Leuconostoc (26.6%), and Lactococcus (15.9%) were the most common in sauerkraut.",

A long-term study provides total bacterial and viral numbers for a given environment, allowing comparison of phage-host interactions (46). Although these methods indicate apparent population sizes, they cannot provide data for the abundance of a specific phage or its co-occurrence with a corresponding host strain. In the present study, metagenomic sequences were used to examine the composition of viral and host communities (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). For the fermented shrimp, the major genera of phage hosts were predicted to be Listonella (20.2%), Escherichia (13.0%), and Staphylococcus (11.2%). In contrast, there was a more even distribution of the prophage hosts Staphylococcus (10.1%), Bacillus (7.4%), and Acinetobacter (7.2%). Analysis of kimchi reads indicated that the phage hosts were associated predominantly with the genera Pseudomonas (23.6%), Escherichia (22.3%), and Vibrio (8.3%), while the genera Escherichia (21.2%), Delftia (6.2%), and Bacillus (4.9%) represented the core group of prophage hosts. There was little similarity between the microbiomes and viromes in either the fermented shrimp or the kimchi. In sauerkraut, however, the dominant bacterial strains and predicted viral hosts were remarkably similar. The most abundant phage host genera were Lactobacillus (40.3%), Lactococcus (14.1%), and Streptococcus (6.6%). The dominant prophage host genera were predicted to be Leuconostoc (32.9%), Bacillus (21.3%), and Lactococcus (7.6%). This agreement between microbiome and virome may be due to the fact that the databases contain more phages that infect lactic acid bacteria than any other group. It is important to consider, however, that these analyses are based on currently available viral databases and that some dominant but previously unreported viruses may have been omitted from the viral abundance results. Bacteriophage host prediction represents another area of uncertainly, since viral genomes are highly diverse and using homology comparison to discern the host of unknown viruses could lead to the wrong conclusions.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated high similarities between the microbiomes and host distribution of viromes within the same environment and low similarities between those from different environments (9, 36). In fermented food preparations, the microbial ecosystem is effectively enclosed within a container, and therefore these microbial communities may develop specifically enriched community profiles. Thus, the low species richness of viral communities in fermented foods may reflect the relatively low diversity of the dominant microbial hosts. However, the present study shows that both fermented shrimp and kimchi exhibit a discrepancy between the dominant bacterial genera and the predicted host distributions of phage and prophage (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). Only in sauerkraut did the major bacterial groups (Leuconostoc and Lactococcus) reflect the major predicted hosts of phages and prophages. This discrepancy between host and dominant microbial profile may be explained by the current shortage of databases containing food viromes. The genomic characterization of phages infecting the genera Weisella and Leuconostoc, the predominant genera in sauerkraut and kimchi, has not been reported thus far, whereas the complete genome sequence of phage isolated from commercial sauerkraut has been reported (26). Thus, it is not surprising that a better agreement was observed between the distribution patterns of bacteria and phage host in the analysis of sauerkraut than in the fermented shrimp and kimchi. At the time of writing, the ACLAME and NCBI databases only contained 465 and 579 phage genomes, respectively. In contrast, the prophage sequences in the ACLAME database numbered 754. Compared to the total number of completed archaeal or bacterial genome sequences (>1,000), the number of phage genomes sequenced is small, especially given the size difference between the cumulative phage and bacterial genomes (a total length of only 3.8 Mbp for 579 phage genomes compared to 3.6 Gbp for 1,089 bacterial genomes). Furthermore, there was a significant difference between the phage and prophage host distributions in the ACLAME database. We identified here a large number of unknown viral sequences and found inconsistencies between viral host and bacterial diversity. These findings are likely due to the lack of fermented food phage sequences in the sequence databases and to the intrinsic limitations of using homology to known viral hosts for predicting the hosts of unknown viruses.",

However, these diversity comparisons should be considered carefully, since different research conditions and PHACCS analysis parameters were used in the various studies. Moreover, a high degree of uncertainty in estimating richness was reported (16).

Despite a similar percentage of assembled sequences, the fermented shrimp metagenome contained a different assembly pattern than the other two fermented foods. The largest contig from the fermented shrimp metagenome (13,325 bp) was much smaller than that of kimchi (43,456 bp) or sauerkraut (57,863 bp). Moreover, 6, 27, and 26 contigs of >5,000 bp were assembled from fermented shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut, respectively (Table \u200b(Table1;1; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material), and most of these contigs showed at least one hit with a phage-related gene. Since the assembled contigs of kimchi and sauerkraut were longer and more numerous than those of fermented shrimp, it is likely that these fermented vegetables have lower viral diversity, a finding that is in agreement with the PHACCS analysis. As shown in Table S1, a large number of reads could be assembled into single contigs and many contigs showed high coverage (between 10- and 70-fold). In the sauerkraut metagenome, contigs showing relatively high coverage (30 to 70X) were observed in greater numbers than in the kimchi viral metagenome.

To date, large metagenomic sequencing projects have mainly focused on bacterial ecology (13, 16, 37), although more recently the focus of studies has broadened to include the investigation of eukarya (17), archaea (37), and viruses (25, 40, 43, 47).

Our viral metagenomic data, which were obtained from three samples that represent different types of fermented food, have also shown large numbers of previously undiscovered viral sequences. Viral metagenomic studies of various environments, such as human feces, marine water, and fermented foods, represent a valuable avenue for investigating the genetic and biochemical diversity of viruses. Such studies help further our understanding of the ecological roles played by viruses in the environment.",
