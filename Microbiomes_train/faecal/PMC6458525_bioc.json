There are distinct gut microbial changes associated with IBD in which alterations in microbial composition and diversity correlate with disease severity.2 Alterations in gut microbiota, among other environmental factors, represent a factor that may increase the risk of developing IBD. Evidence provided by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reveals that many of the susceptibility loci for IBD are implicated in the regulation of immune responses toward gut microbiota.3 Some of the disrupted mechanisms include impaired recognition of bacterial components and the inability to clear pathogenic bacteria through autophagy. Interestingly, these loci have significant overlap with other immune-mediated diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis,3, 4 suggesting a shared pathogenesis.",

Arthralgias or joint pains without evidence of inflammation are also present in a significant number of patients. Multiple studies have demonstrated gut microbial changes associated with these phenotypes as separate diseases or in the context of IBD. Studies on germ-free mice have demonstrated that segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are capable of inducing Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria, stimulating the production of autoantibodies, and rapidly causing arthritis.10, 11 In humans, rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with significant gut dysbiosis that correlates with disease severity and is partially resolved after treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).12, 13 In the context of IBD, a recent study demonstrated that patients with IBD and concomitant spondyloarthritis (SpA) have significantly increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria compared with non-SpA IBD patients and significant enrichment of IgA-coated Escherichia capable of inducing Th17-mediated responses.14 Although these studies provide insight into changes in the gut microbiota associated with inflammatory conditions like IBD and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the majority of studies do not account for potential confounders.",

Patients with CD and UC from both IBD groups were frequency-matched to the disease subclassification criteria included in the Montr\u00e9al classification of IBD24 to have a proportionate distribution of disease phenotype. Montr\u00e9al criteria for CD include age at diagnosis (younger than 16 years of age, between 16 and 40 years of age, older than 40 years of age), location (ileal, colonic, ileocolonic, isolated upper GI disease), and behavior (nonstricturing/nonpenetrating, structuring, penetrating, and presence of perianal disease). Montr\u00e9al criteria for UC include severity (remission, mild, moderate, and severe) and extent (proctitis, left-sided and extensive). We examined the clinical assessments recorded in the EHR from clinic visits and the information available in the research databases from each respective biobank to calculate disease severity scores for CD (Harvey-Bradshaw index),25 UC (Montr\u00e9al UC severity score), and RA (DAS28-CRP).26 We selected these indices based on the availability and reliability of the clinical information recorded in the EHR and the databases. A Harvey-Bradshaw index of less than 5 correlates with clinical remission, an index of 5 to 7 correlates with mild disease activity, an index of 8 to 16 correlates with moderate disease activity, and an index of greater than 16 correlates with severe disease activity in CD. For the DAS28-CRP disease activity index, a score below 2.4 is classified as remission, a score of 2.4 to 2.9 is classified as low disease activity, a score 3.0 to 4.6 is classified as moderate disease activity, and a score above 4.6 is classified as high disease activity for RA. All the clinical information we collected was obtained on the same day that patients submitted their samples or from the closest available clinic visit if no changes in medications were done or new procedures were performed before sample submission.

DNA content was quantified for each sample using the Quant-iT PicoGreen Assay to ensure a minimum concentration of 0.2 ng of DNA per \u00b5L (250 pg of isolated DNA). Each sample was processed at the University of Minnesota Genomics Center using the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). DNA sequencing was performed with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System using the v4 reagent kit to produce 2 \u00d7 125 bp (paired-end) reads in high-output mode. One hundred ninety samples were originally submitted for sequencing (26 IBD-A, 75 IBD-N, 25 RA, and 64 controls). Two IBD-N samples failed quality control due to insufficient DNA content and were excluded from further analysis and processing. To preserve matching of age, sex, BMI, and IBD subtype, severity, and extent, another 7 IBD-N samples and 1 IBD-A sample were excluded from sequencing. A total of 180 samples were finally sequenced and run over 2 lanes of 95 samples each and included in the downstream analysis. Two hundred fifteen libraries were created using one-quarter reaction Nextera XT preparations followed by custom barcoding polymerase chain reaction (PCR). At least 220 million pass-filter reads were generated for each of the 2 lanes. The average quality score for each read was 36.72 (see Supplementary Table 1 for a detailed quality report). The median sequencing depth (interquartile range) was 42,025 (25,258\u201373,418). Sequencing and associated metadata were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA Study: SRP158781).",

Multiple linear regression was used to test the association between the covariates and alpha diversity while adjusting for potential confounders, and a Wald-type test was used for assessing statistical significance. To test the association between the covariates and beta diversity measures, we used permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA),36 a distance-based analysis of variance method based on permutation (1000 permutations, \u201cadonis\u201d function in the R \u201cvegan\u201d package). We tested the association of alpha and beta diversity with the following clinical covariates: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), IBD diagnosis (CD, UC, and indeterminate colitis), disease duration (for IBD and RA), disease severity (using respective severity scores for RA, CD, and UC), aminosalicylates (5-ASA), steroids (both luminal and systemic), methotrexate, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, biologics (TNF-alpha inhibitors, anti-integrin antibodies, and ustekinumab), DMARDs (hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, abatacept, rituximab, tofacitinib), probiotic use, inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein), serologic markers of RA (rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated peptide antibodies), and history of bowel surgery. Ordination plots were generated using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA; \u201ccmdscale\u201d function in the R \u201cvegan\u201d package) for visualizing the association of covariates with the beta diversity measures. Differential abundance analysis was performed at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels; taxa with prevalence rates of less than 10% or with a maximum proportion of less than 0.2% were excluded from testing to reduce the number of tests. The count data were normalized into relative abundances (proportions) and square-root transformed. To identify differentially abundant taxa associated with covariates and account for the non-normality of the abundance data, a permutation-based approach was used based on the F-statistics of a linear model (transformed relative abundance as the response variable), and residual permutation was used to account for potential confounders.37 False discovery rate (FDR) control (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure,38 \u2018p.adjust\u2019 in standard R packages) was used to correct for multiple testing at each taxonomical level.

DMARDs included hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, TNF-alpha inhibitors, abatacept, rituximab, and tofacitinib. Sources of variability associated with these medications were determined through a beta-diversity analysis using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and PERMANOVA tests, where a P value <0.05 was deemed significant. As described in the \u201cMethods,\u201d FDR control was used to correct for multiple testing. None of these medications was associated with significant variability on microbial gene abundance (Supplementary Table 7).",

The goal was to identify gut microbiota that may have a role in the pathophysiology of arthritis. An increase in the relative abundance in the Clostridiaceae family of bacteria was found to be characteristic of the arthritis phenotype (1.6% vs 0.14%, P = 0.045) (Fig. 2), which was almost entirely composed of Clostridium (99.9%). No other significant compositional differences between the arthritis phenotype and controls were found. All P values were FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons.",

Alpha diversity was significantly increased in RA when compared with controls, as measured by the inverse Simpson index (P = 0.017), which indicated increased species evenness in RA. Alpha diversity was not significantly different when measured using the observed species (P = 0.583), Shannon index (P = 0.100), and Chao1 (P = 0.327). Beta diversity was not significantly different between both groups as measured using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (P = 0.142, PERMANOVA) and Jaccard distances (P = 0.528, PERMANOVA). A previous study that characterized the RA-associated fecal microbiota and included patients taking immunosuppressive medications identified an expansion of Actinobacteria, particularly Eggerthella, when compared with controls.13 In addition, there were also increases in Eubacterium, a genus within the Clostridiales family. We did not identify an increase in Actinobacteria in our study, but the expansion of Eubacterium is consistent with the increased abundance of Clostridiales shared between our IBD-A and RA patients. Bacterial clusters within the Clostridiales family have also been previously identified in treatment-na\u00efve RA patients, particularly Clostridium aspariforme.12 The expansion of Prevotella copri previously reported in new-onset treatment-na\u00efve RA was not detected in our cohort.41 All P values were FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons.",

A summary of the compositional and diversity changes associated with a history of bowel surgery among IBD patients is shown in Figure 3. After adjusting for the effects of bowel surgery, the effects of disease severity were not significant. Twenty-eight IBD patients (42%) had a history of bowel surgery (39% IBD-N, 48% IBD-A). There were no significant differences in the proportion of IBD patients with a history of bowel surgery between the IBD-N and IBD-A groups (P = 0.46). In the IBD-N group, 12 patients had partial colectomies, 9 patients had total colectomies, and 14 patients had small bowel resections with an average of 36.03 cm resected (95% CI, \u20135.11 to 77.18). In the IBD-A group, 9 patients had partial colectomies, 2 patients had total colectomies, and 10 patients had small bowel resections with an average of 32.53 cm resected (95% CI, 10.41 to 54.65). The average time since the last surgical intervention before sample submission was 9.88 years (95% CI, 6.67 to 13.08). Time since last surgery was similar between IBD-N and IBD-A patients. Alpha diversity was significantly decreased in IBD patients with a history of bowel surgery compared with IBD patients without a history of bowel surgery (Fig. 3A), as measured using observed species (P = 0.003), Shannon index (P = 0.001), Chao1 (P = 0.003), and the inverse Simpson index (P = 0.002). Beta diversity was also significantly different among IBD patients with a history of bowel surgery (Fig. 3B), as measured by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (P = 0.001) and the Jaccard index (P = 0.001).",

On the other hand, the abundance of Firmicutes (23.9% vs 40.4%, P = 0.009), Bacteroidetes (29.3% vs 43.4%, P = 0.01), and Spirochaetes (0.04% vs 0.06, P = 0.009) was decreased among IBD patients with a history of bowel surgery. In terms of magnitude, the increase in Proteobacteria appears to be most significant, with an increase in Enterobacteriaceae as the greatest contributor. Within the Enterobacteriaceae family, the abundance of Escherichia in IBD patients with history of bowel surgery is 21.1% compared with 4.3% in IBD patients without history of bowel surgery (P = 0.004). Other notable genera that were also found to be increased among IBD patients with a history of bowel surgery include Klebsiella (10.9% vs 1.0%, P = 0.004), Salmonella (0.1% vs 0.004%, P = 0.007), and Shigella (0.005% vs 0.001%, P = 0.01).

This cross-sectional study aimed to characterize the compositional and functional differences in the gut microbiota of patients with IBD-associated arthropathy, with the objective of identifying potential biomarkers of disease and targets of treatment in this population. We found that IBD-A was associated with a higher abundance of bacterial genes encoding pathways of tyrosine metabolism. In addition, our 4-group design allowed us to determine that an increased abundance of Clostridiaceae in the gut is associated with the arthritis phenotype, irrespective of IBD-A or RA. Last, but not least, we also found that a history of bowel surgery is a significant confounder not usually accounted for in microbiome studies.",

                    "text": "Evidence from previous human studies shows that immune cells from the lamina propria in the gut of IBD patients are capable of producing antibodies against host proteins and epitopes.42, 43 Some of these targeted epitopes are shared between intestinal bacteria and the joints and eyes of IBD patients.44 Subsequent studies on mice models have demonstrated that the gut microbiota drive the differentiation and migration of T follicular (Tfh) helper cells into systemic lymphoid tissues, an essential process in the production of autoantibodies that cause arthritis.10, 11, 45 Evidence collected from genome-wide association studies and the gut microbiome in IBD patients suggests a pathophysiologic link between intestinal inflammation and arthritis. The independent identification of variants of the IL23R gene as being strongly associated with IBD46 and ankylosing spondylitis47 has supported the development of monoclonal antibodies directed against this pathway for treatment.48, 49 More recently, IgA-coated Escherichia coli have been shown to be selectively enriched in the gut of patients with CD-associated SpA when compared with CD alone.14 Our study contributes to the available knowledge by providing evidence on the functional characteristics that differentiate the gut microbiota of patients with IBD-A. Specifically, we found a higher abundance of bacterial genes encoding pathways of tyrosine metabolism among IBD-A patients compared with IBD patients without arthropathy. Gut microbiota are crucial for the breakdown of tyrosine and other amino acids, as shown in previous animal studies, where serum concentrations of sulfated direct bacterial metabolites of tyrosine have been demonstrated to be significantly higher in conventional mice compared with germ-free mice.50 Phenols and p-cresol account for approximately 70% of the luminal products of aromatic amino acid metabolism in the gut, which are predominantly produced in the distal colon by tyrosine-metabolizing anaerobes.51 Among these metabolites, p-cresol has been studied the most because of its potential implication in a variety of human diseases, particularly chronic kidney disease.52P-cresol might have a role in increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease among uremic patients with chronic kidney disease by inhibiting endothelial proliferation and repair53 while also contributing to increased susceptibility to infection in these patients by suppressing Th1-type cellular responses.54 At the cellular level, P-cresol is also known for inhibiting mitochondrial respiration and increasing superoxide anion production in intestinal epithelial cells.55 At high concentrations, p-cresol uncouples ATP synthesis and increases DNA damage. In the context of IBD, p-cresol levels have been found to be significantly decreased in urine samples from patients with CD when compared with UC and controls.56 On the other hand, p-cresol appears to be increased in CD during remission,57 suggesting some value in discriminating between IBD subtypes. Whether the association of increased tyrosine metabolism in the gut of patients with IBD-A results in increased absorption of tyrosine metabolites is not known and will need further confirmation through metabolomics. The capacity of p-cresol to suppress Th1 activity and cause epithelial cell damage suggests that it may have a role in altering interactions between the gut microbiota and the mucosal immune system.",

Although diet is known to cause significant shifts in gut microbiome composition and metabolism,58 evidence supporting specific dietary interventions to improve outcomes in IBD is limited and standard guidelines have not been established.59 A systematic review associated diets high in total fat, polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat with increased risk of developing CD and UC.60 A prospective cohort study found that consumption of red and processed meat was associated with higher risk of relapse from UC.61 Interestingly, there is some overlap between foods high in tyrosine (cheese, soybeans, beef, pork, lamb, salmon, chicken, eggs) and foods associated with increased risk of IBD. Future studies should explore whether short-term dietary interventions with low tyrosine content result in any improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with IBD-A.",

Our compositional analyses showed that an increased abundance of Clostridiaceae is associated with the arthritis phenotype that IBD-A and RA patients have. Previous studies have associated Clostridium species with various forms of arthritis, including RA with high disease activity.12, 62Clostridium bacteria are also among the group of bacteria known to metabolize aromatic amino acids, such as tyrosine, which are then absorbed in the gut and eventually excreted in the urine.63, 64 An increased abundance of Clostridium among patients with arthritis may correlate with the increased activity of tyrosine degradation found in the gut of IBD-A patients. The relative contribution of Clostridiaceae family members and their tyrosine-derived metabolites in the pathophysiology of extra-intestinal manifestations and arthritis remains to be further elucidated.",

We found a significant increase in Epsilonproteobacteria and Campylobacterales, 2 classes within the Proteobacteria phylum, among RA patients when compared with controls. Species evenness was also increased in RA. Our findings are partially consistent with those from a previous report by Chen et al., in which fecal samples from a similar cohort of RA patients were analyzed.13 Although an expansion of Actinobacteria was not identified in our study, the expansion of Eubacterium is taxonomically consistent with the increased abundance of Clostridiaceae shared between IBD-A and RA in our study. Other members of the Clostridiaceae family, such as SFB, have also been associated with arthritis in mice10, 11 and treatment-na\u00efve RA patients.12 Additional differences in composition and diversity identified in our RA cohort are likely due to differences in disease duration and RF titers previously associated with decreased species richness,13 which were lower in our study compared with those reported by Chen et al. In addition, a lower sample size of RA patients may have limited our ability to detect significant changes in Eubacterium. In summary, there seems to be a consistent association between bacteria within the Clostridiales family and other phylogenetically related taxa and arthritis, which should be further confirmed through analysis of mucosal samples in larger cohorts.",

Our cohort included patients who previously underwent small bowel resection for stricturing or fistulizing CD and partial or total colectomy for UC. The expansion of Proteobacteria was consistent regardless of the type or location of the intestinal surgery. Intestinal surgery is common among patients with a longstanding history of IBD, as 70%\u201380% of patients with CD and 20%\u201330% of patients with UC will require surgical intervention during their lifetimes.65 Unfortunately, disease recurrence is still common after bowel resection. The reduction in recurrence rates associated with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis after ileocecal resection (ICR) in CD66, 67 suggests that bacteria may be implicated. Ileocecal resection, the predominant surgical intervention in our CD patients, has been shown to induce colonization of Bacteroides, E. coli, Fusobacterium, and nitrate-reducing bacteria in the neoterminal ileum after 1 year.68 Mouse models of non-IBD ICR have demonstrated similar findings of significantly increased colonic Enterobacteriaceae abundance and dramatically decreased colonic Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella 28 days post-ICR.69 Although these studies were focused on ICR, the microbial changes were similar to those found in our patients who previously underwent bowel surgery that did not involve ICR. Our study also showed that the expansion of Enterobacteriaceae is persistent among patients who underwent surgery more than 8 years before. It is important to note that increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Escherichia has also been found in previous studies with non-treatment-na\u00efve patients with CD, especially in patients with ileal CD.14, 70 Furthermore, significant changes in beta diversity have been attributed to shifts in the abundance of Proteobacteria in patients with CD and ICR.71 In the study by Viladomiu et al., Proteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly increased in CD-associated SpA. However, patients with previous intestinal surgery other than ICR were not explicitly excluded. We did not detect significant differences in Proteobacteria among IBD-A patients after adjusting for surgical effects in our study. Based on our results, the increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in non-treatment-na\u00efve patients with CD is mostly a consequence of the effects of intestinal surgery on the gut microbiota. We suggest that future studies involving microbiome analysis of non-treatment-na\u00efve IBD patients with history of bowel surgery should correct for surgical effects to avoid confounding results.",

                    "text": "Our study presents several limitations. First, our cohort was composed of predominantly white patients from the Midwestern United States. African Americans have a higher incidence of IBD-associated arthropathy and ophthalmological complications compared with whites with Crohn\u2019s disease within the same geographical area.72, 73 These differences in incidence may be due to differences in genetic susceptibility and unequal access to health care services. However, environmental variables such as diet and lifestyle may play a larger role in gut microbial composition and function than race.74 Second, we were not able to control for diet in our study, a major factor that affects gut microbial composition and function. However, dietary variations within the same geographical region are likely to be less significant than diet-associated changes across continents and cultures.75 Third, our analyses were performed on stool samples and not mucosal samples. Previous studies have shown that dysbiosis in IBD is more pronounced in the mucosa-associated microbiota compared with the fecal microbiota.2 It is possible that compositional differences between IBD-N and IBD-A may be more pronounced at the mucosal level and may be more relevant in the pathophysiology of EIMs and arthritis due to the close interaction with the mucosal immune system. For this reason, the results from this study should be corroborated with analysis of mucosal samples. Finally, it is possible that the lack of taxonomic differences between IBD-A and IBD-N in our study may be due to a small sample size of IBD-A patients. Our sample size was calculated based on known bacterial differences between RA patients and controls, as the effect size of microbial differences between IBD-A and IBD-N is not known. In the study by Viladomiu et al., a sample size of 25 patients with CD-associated SpA was sufficient to detect taxonomic differences in Proteobacteria.14 In our study, expansion of Proteobacteria was associated with history of bowel surgery and not IBD-A. For this reason, it is more likely that the use of fecal samples instead of mucosal samples may have played a larger role in the lack of taxonomic differences between IBD-A and IBD-N than the sample size used in our study.",
