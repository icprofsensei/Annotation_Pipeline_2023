                    "text": "Microbial amplicon sequencing studies are an important tool in biological and biomedical research. Widespread 16S rRNA gene microbial surveys have shed light on the structure of many ecosystems inhabited by bacteria, including the human body. However, specialized software and algorithms are needed to convert raw sequencing data into biologically meaningful information (i.e. tables of bacterial counts). While different bioinformatic pipelines are available in a rapidly changing and improving field, users are often unaware of limitations and biases associated with individual pipelines and there is a lack of agreement regarding best practices. Here, we compared six bioinformatic pipelines for the analysis of amplicon sequence data: three OTU-level flows (QIIME-uclust, MOTHUR, and USEARCH-UPARSE) and three ASV-level (DADA2, Qiime2-Deblur, and USEARCH-UNOISE3). We tested workflows with different quality control options, clustering algorithms, and cutoff parameters on a mock community as well as on a large (N = 2170) recently published fecal sample dataset from the multi-ethnic HELIUS study. We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and degree of consensus of the different outputs. DADA2 offered the best sensitivity, at the expense of decreased specificity compared to USEARCH-UNOISE3 and Qiime2-Deblur. USEARCH-UNOISE3 showed the best balance between resolution and specificity. OTU-level USEARCH-UPARSE and MOTHUR performed well, but with lower specificity than ASV-level pipelines. QIIME-uclust produced large number of spurious OTUs as well as inflated alpha-diversity measures and should be avoided in future studies. This study provides guidance for researchers using amplicon sequencing to gain biological insights.",

Microbial community structure can provide valuable insights not only into the workings of natural ecosystems, but increasingly into the relationship between the human host and its bacterial colonizers. Rapid progress in DNA sequencing technology has provided ever-increasing outputs coupled with lowered costs, facilitating an explosion in amplicon sequencing studies [3]. Unfortunately, these studies are vulnerable to potential biases introduced along the workflow and there is a lack of consensus regarding best practices [4\u20135]. This paper aims to provide researchers (e.g. ecologists, microbiologists, biomedical researchers) with a overview of the strengths and weaknesses of six of the most popular current bioinformatic pipelines for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. While this selection is not a comprehensive set, it includes some of the most used (QIIME [6], MOTHUR [4], and USEARCH [5]) as well as more recent options (DADA2 [6] and Qiime2-Deblur [7\u20138]). Three of these pipelines cluster sequences at (typically) 97% identity into Operational Taxonomical Units (OTUs): QIIME-uclust, MOTHUR and USEARCH-UPARSE. The other three (Qiime2-Deblur, DADA2, and USEARCH-UNOISE3) attempt to reconstruct the exact biological sequences present in the sample, so-called Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) [9]. ASVs are referred to by other authors as \u201czero noise OTUs\u201d [10] or \u201csub-OTUs\u201d [7].",

We therefore aimed to compare pipelines under these typical conditions in order to match the most plausible use scenarios. We examined the effect of different quality filtering steps (for QIIME-uclust, Qiime2-Deblur, and DADA2) and of different clustering algorithms and cutoffs (for MOTHUR), as we deemed these to be the most likely pipeline variations users might attempt.

The mock contains DNA from 20 bacterial strains in equimolar (Even) ribosomal RNA operon counts (100000 copies per organism per \u03bcL). Two of the strains (Bacteriodes vulgatus and Clostridium beijerinckii) have multiple sequence variants in the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. B. vulgatus has three variants (in a 5:1:1 ratio), whereas C. beijerinckii has two variants (in a 13:1 ratio). The 16S rRNA sequences of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are identical in the V4 region. Therefore, the mock contains a total of 22 variants (ASVs) of the 16S gene in the V4 region. These sequences correspond to 19 OTUs when clustered at 97% identity. The mock community was sequenced three times in different sequencing runs. The mock raw sequence data is publicly available (https://github.com/andreiprodan/mock-sequences).",

Fecal microbiome composition was profiled by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (Illumina RTA v1.17.28; MCS v2.5) with 515F and 806R primers designed for dual indexing [16] and the V2 Illumina kit (2x250 bp paired-end reads). 16S rRNA genes from each sample were amplified in duplicate reactions in volumes of 25 \u03bcL containing 1x Five Prime Hot Master Mix (5 PRIME GmbH), 200 nM of each primer, 0.4 mg/ml BSA, 5% DMSO and 20 ng of genomic DNA. PCR was carried out under the following conditions: initial denaturation for 47 min at 94\u00b0C, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation for 45 sec at 94\u00b0C, annealing for 60 sec at 52\u00b0C and elongation for 90 sec at 72\u00b0C, and a final elongation step for 10 min at 72\u00b0C. Duplicates were combined, purified with the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA kit (Invitrogen). Purified PCR products were diluted to 10 ng/\u03bcL and pooled in equal amounts. The pooled amplicons were purified again using Ampure magnetic purification beads (Agencourt) to remove short amplification products. Libraries for sequencing were prepared by mixing the pooled amplicons with PhiX control DNA purchased from Illumina. The input DNA had a concentration of 3 pM and contained 15% PhiX and resulted in the generation of about 700K clusters/mm2 and an overall percentage of bases with quality score higher than 30 (Q30) higher than 70%.",

We therefore used MOTHUR only with its internal read merging and filtering. In DADA2\u2014in contrast to all other pipelines\u2014denoising is always implemented separately on the forward and the reverse reads, with resulting ASVs merged at the end of the workflow. External merging / filtering is therefore not applicable to DADA2, while it can be integrated with relative ease into QIIME and Qiime2 workflows. We therefore implemented one workflow in QIIME-uclust and one workflow in Qiime2-Deblur where reads were merged and filtered externally using USEARCH. The author of USEARCH explicitly advises against using the default USEARCH read merging parameters for reads with a long overlap (e.g. MiSeq 2 x 250bp V4) and argues in favor of maximizing the proportion of reads that survive the merging step. We therefore benchmarked several settings for the merging step. Based on the outcomes (Fig 1), we chose 30 max. allowed differences in the overlapping region (\u201cmaxdiffs\u201d) for the merging step (using the \u201cfastq_mergepairs\u201d command) and max. 1 expected errors (\u201cfastq_maxee\u201d) as a quality filter threshold (using the \u201cfastq_filter\u201d command). The rationale was to use permissive parameters in the merging step in order to fully exploit the error correction made possible by the overlapping of the reads (e.g. a lower Q-score sequencing error in the reverse read can be rectified using the higher Q-score correct base call from the forward read). Strict thresholds (i.e. low \u201cmaxdiffs\u201d) discard read pairs where mismatches due to an error on one read might have been easily corrected using the complementary read. As Fig 1 shows, more relaxed merging parameters resulted in around 10% more of total raw reads (82.9% compared to 73.5%) passing the quality filter. These merging / filtering parameters were used in the USEARCH-UPARSE, USEARCH-UNOISE3, QIIME-uclust (e30.ee1), and Qiime2-Deblur (e30.ee1) flows. Expected error-based read quality filtering is described in detail in Edgar et al. 2015 [19].",

In brief, UPARSE-REF aims to explain a given input sequence starting from sequences in a database, using the fewest possible number of events (i.e. PCR or sequencing errors). It constructs a model sequence using one or more sequences from the database (i.g. a single sequence representing a non-chimeric amplicon, or multiple concatenated segments representing a chimeric amplicon). Different penalty scores are given for chimeric crossover and for mismatches and the model sequence with the lowest total score is chosen as the true OTU sequence. Sequences are ranked in decreasing order of abundance, discarding singletons. Each input sequence is then compared to the current OTU set and to the maximum parsimony model sequence constructed using UPARSE-REF. If the model sequence is more than 97% identical to an existing OTU, the sequence is assigned to the respective OTU. It the model sequence is chimeric, the sequence is discarded. Finally, if the model is less than 97% identical to any existing OTU, the sequence is added to the existing OTU set. After all OTUs are found, all merged reads (including those dropped during quality filtering) are mapped against the OTUs to construct the OTU table.",

In our analysis, all MOTHUR flows generated far fewer OTUs compared to QIIME-uclust, in contrast to a similar benchmark performed by the DADA2 authors [6]. It should be noted that USEARCH-UPARSE (by default) automatically removes singletons in the OTU clustering step.",

We observed one such bias in the QIIME-uclust output (Fig 4A). While most workflows yielded very similar relative abundance values, all QIIME-uclust flows severely under-estimated the abundance of three OTUs (corresponding to Neisseria meningitis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides). The bias was caused by QIIME-uclust assigning a large proportion of the counts of these true OTUs to other, spurious OTUs. This effect was independent of quality filtering parameters (i.e. it was observed in all three QIIME-uclust flows) and is likely intrinsic to the closed-reference OTU clustering specific to QIIME-uclust.",

While the DADA2 (no filter) flow gave results in line with that of other pipelines (Fig 4A), the DADA2 (ee2) flow under-estimated the relative abundance of three ASVs (Lactobacillus gasseri, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). This bias was caused by preferential filtering (exclusion) of reads from these ASVs in the quality filtering step. While it is widely known that Illumina sequencing error rates are position-dependent (i.e. error rates tend to increase towards the end of the read), it is often neglected that they may also be affected by underlying sequence patterns [29]. Particular patterns of bases may result in much higher base call error rates than would be expected. Examples of such patterns are \u201cGGC\u201d triplets or inverted repeats (more than 8 bases long) located upstream of the respective position [29]. Thus, if a particular ASV sequence happens to contains such a pattern, application of a quality filter will exclude its reads preferentially before the denoising step. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene contains 8 instances of the \u201cGGC\u201d pattern for L. gasseri, 7 for S. agalactiae, and 9 for S. pneumoniae, though other patterns likely contribute to the effect. In practice, this presents an issue only for DADA2 (in the case of paired-end sequencing) since all other pipelines merge paired-end reads before clustering/denoising. In these other flows, the errors at the position where the pattern is present are corrected using information from the complementary read in the pair. Considering that the additional quality filter did not improve the specificity of the DADA2 pipeline (Table 2, Fig 2) while introducing a significant bias in the output (Fig 4B), we advise against it.",

More stringent read quality filtering only reducing this number by approx. 25%. All QIIME-uclust flows produced an order of magnitude more OTUs compared to any other OTU-level workflow. Based on mock community results, the vast majority of these OTUs are expected to be spurious.

In contrast, QIIME-uclust produced between 150000 and 200000 OTUs.

Qiime2-Deblur produced around 11000 ASVs (Table 4). The representative sequence of an OTU may vary depending on the nature of the (de novo) clustering algorithm and is influenced by other sequences present, particularly in complex samples. However, by definition, ASV sequences are exact representations of biological sequences and are therefore directly comparable between workflows. We compared ASV sequences from each of the three ASV-level pipelines, identified perfect matches, and constructed Venn diagrams showing the overlap between the different outputs (Fig 7). Only around 4000 ASVs were found by all three pipelines (Fig 7A). Around 9000 (around 37% of total) ASVs produced by DADA2 were not found by either USEARCH-UNOISE3 or by Qiime2-Deblur. This mirrors findings from the mock community analysis, where DADA2 showed both the best sensitivity and the highest propensity for spurious ASVs among the three ASV-level pipelines. USEARCH-UNOISE3 and Qiime2-Deblur ach produced more than 2000 ASVs not found by other pipelines. These differences were mostly associated with low-abundance ASVs. To illustrate, 95.5% of counts produced by DADA2 were assigned to ASVs found by USEARCH-UNOISE3, while 98% of counts produced by USEARCH-UNOISE3 were assigned to ASVs found by DADA2. ASVs shared by USEARCH-UNOISE3 and Qiime2-Deblur accounted for around 98% of total counts. Thus, while the number of non-consensus ASVs produced by the ASV-level pipelines was large, it accounted for only 2% to 4% of the total number of counts.",

Some authors recommend applying a minimum relative abundance threshold filter in order to remove OTUs/ASVs with extremely low abundance that have a higher probability of being spurious. When a 0.002% minimum relative abundance filter was applied to the ASVs tables, most non-consensus ASVs were removed (Fig 7B). From each pipeline, 1396 ASVs (DADA2), 1294 ASVs (UNOISE3), and 1296 ASVs (Qiime2-Deblur) passed the filter, of which 1023 ASVs were found by all three pipelines. Thus, around 26% of filtered DADA ASVs, 21% of filtered UNOISE3 ASVs, and 21% of filtered Qiime2-Deblur ASVs were found by at most two of the three pipelines (i.e. were non-consensus ASVs). An analysis of closest matches between the (filtered) ASVs produced by the different pipelines showed that while DADA2 and Qiime2-Deblur non-consensus ASVs were generally 1 base away from the closest UNOISE3 ASVs, the most common closest match for UNOISE3 non-consensus ASVs was at 3 or 4 bases distance (S1 Fig). Thus, pipeline-specific biases remained after the application of a typical low-abundance filter. Moreover, the filter also removed around 75% of the 4029 consensus ASVs. While abundance-based filters may remove some of the spurious ASVs, they will also remove many true low-abundance biological features.",

Ground-truth ASV-level data should always yield higher alpha-diversity than OTU-level data. However, two types of errors can bias perceived alpha-diversity. First, as observed in QIIME-uclust workflows, massive numbers of spurious OTUs can greatly inflate perceived alpha-diversity. Spurious OTUs are responsible for QIIME-uclust yielding much higher alpha-diversity values than all others pipelines, including all ASV-level workflows. The relatively steep downward slope observed for QIIME-uclust when plotting richness as function of rarefaction level or of abundance-based OTU filtering (Figs \u200b(Figs8A8A and \u200band9A)9A) is indicative of large numbers of very low-abundance OTUs, most of which are likely spurious (Figs \u200b(Figs22 and \u200band3).3). The propensity of QIIME-uclust to generate spurious OTUs and inflate alpha-diversity measures has been previously reported by other authors [6, 30]. Second, as observed for QIIME2-Deblur, an ASV-level pipeline can fail to distinguish very closely related true biological sequences and clump them together into a single ASV. This will artificially decrease perceived alpha-diversity compared to higher sensitivity ASV-level pipelines, and is the reason why Qiime2-Deblur yielded lower alpha-diversity values compared to DADA2 and USEARCH-UNOISE3 (Fig 8B). Pipeline-induced biases (e.g. inflation of sample richness and diversity) cannot be fully addressed using filters (Fig 9). We applied a wide range of filters to the OTU/ASV tables and observed that inter-pipeline differences in alpha-diversity measures remain after the application of typical filters (i.e. 0.002% to 0.005% [31] of relative abundance).",

QIIME-uclust workflows produced huge numbers of spurious OTUs as well as inflated alpha-diversity measures, regardless of quality filtering parameters. Current QIIME users may consider switching to other pipelines. Indeed, the authors of QIIME have stopped supporting the platform since 1st January 2018 and are encouraging users to switch over to Qiime2. Biological conclusions based on alpha-diversity measures obtained from QIIME-uclust pipelines may warrant revisiting or confirmation other pipelines. ASV-level workflows offer superior resolution compared to OTU-level, and in this study showed better specificity and lower spurious sequence rates. Moreover, ASV-level pipelines allow for easier inter-study integration of biological features, as ASVs have intrinsic biological meaning, independent of reference database or study context [9].",
