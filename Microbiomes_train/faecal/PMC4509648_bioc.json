Nested and standard PCR methods were compared on alpha- and beta-diversity metrics and relative abundances of bacterial genera. The effects of number of cycles in the first round of PCR (10 vs. 20) and microbial diversity (relatively low in vagina vs. high in stool) were also investigated. Vaginal swab samples showed no significant difference in alpha diversity or community structure between nested PCR and standard PCR (one round of 40 cycles). Stool samples showed significant differences in alpha diversity (except Shannon\u2019s index) and relative abundance of 13 genera between nested PCR with 20 cycles in the first round and standard PCR (P<0.01), but not between nested PCR with 10 cycles in the first round and standard PCR. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that had low relative abundance (sum of relative abundance <0.167) accounted for most of the distortion (>27% of total OTUs in stool).",

The research on human microbial communities has focused on material such as feces, oral and vaginal swabs that have relatively large bacterial populations and few human cells [1,2]. Bacterial communities from body sites such as lung, esophagus and stomach are more difficult to assess by standard PCR due to sparser bacterial populations and relatively high abundance of human DNA (e. g. from human tissue biopsies). Nested PCR is thus necessary for studies on certain human tissue microbiota since it can amplify the target DNA with concentrations several-fold lower than standard PCR [3\u20137]. Nested PCR involves two rounds of PCR reactions with the first round targeting a wide DNA region and the second round targeting a narrower sub-region of the products of the first round which is used as a template. Barcoded primers have a low efficacy for binding and amplification when targeted sequences are sparse. In nested PCRs, barcoded primers are only used in the second round of PCR when the template is a 100% match and in higher abundance, and amplify the target with greater efficacy. Therefore, nested PCR works for the samples with sparse targets while standard PCR does not. The drawback to the nested PCR is that the bias due to preferential amplification may be greater when two successive PCR reactions are applied [8]. To date, the potential bias of nested PCR combined with next generation sequencing technologies on the interpretation of microbial diversity and structure has not been rigorously examined.",
