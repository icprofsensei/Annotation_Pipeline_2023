Current knowledge indicates a crucial role for the GI microbiota in extracting nutrients from the diet, thereby influencing host metabolism, body growth and weight [3]. Moreover, it is a barrier against colonization with pathogens and is essential for mucosal homeostasis and for the maturation and correct function of the GI immune system [4]. Because our GI tract and its microbiota are interdependent, disease will affect both. A variety GI diseases including chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) show specific alterations of the microbial community, called dysbiosis, and these diseases are supposed to be driven at least in part by these alterations [5]\u2013[12]. Nevertheless, it is questionable whether dysbiosis itself causes these diseases or is just an epiphenomenon due to a microbial habitat altered by other pathophysiological factors [11], [12].",

                    "text": "A hallmark of many GI diseases is diarrhea, which often correlates with the severity of disease. Diarrhea is characterized by increased stool frequency, decreased stool consistency and increased stool weight. Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to diarrhea include increased amounts of fluid in the intestinal lumen due to osmotically active substances (osmotic diarrhea), impaired absorption or increased secretion of water and electrolytes (secretory diarrhea) and accelerated intestinal transit [13], [14]. Diarrhea is often caused by a combination of these mechanisms, which furthermore leads to intestinal malabsorption of nutrients such as fat or bile acids, altering the milieu within the gut [15], [16]. Basically, acceleration of the luminal content influences the composition of the microbial community. Microbes that are replicating slowly or experiencing a particle-associated or free-living state will be subjected to wash-out and negatively selected against microbes that adhere to the mucosa or are replicating fast [17]. This principle shows that variation in just one parameter of GI physiology, like increased transit or increased amounts of fluid in the lumen, might have a profound influence on the microbial composition of our gut. Thus, deduction of relevant microbial community alterations in the light of a specific disease must take these accompanying effects into account.",

The subjects had had neither antibiotic therapy nor episodes of diarrhea for at least 1 year prior to the study. Stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily during the study and assessed according the Bristol stool chart [19]. After 6 days on a free diet without interventions (pre-treatment period) the subjects were placed on a standard diet (85 g protein, 77 g fat, 250 g carbohydrates, 25 g fiber, total calorie count 2150 kcal/d) for five days. Oral water intake was not restricted. On the third day of the diet diarrhea was induced with the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol 4000 (Forlax\u00ae, Merck, Vienna, Austria) in a dose of 50 g tid (150 g per day). PEG was administered in addition to the standard diet for three days (diarrhea period). Thereafter the subjects again noted their stool behavior without any interventions on a free diet for seven days (post-treatment period) (Fig. 1). The first day of PEG administration and the first day after PEG administration were considered equilibration days and were not included in the analysis of bowel habits. Stool samples were obtained at four different time points. Two baseline samples were taken before induction of diarrhea, sample 1 on a free diet at the beginning of the study (time-point 1, pretreatment period, day \u22127) and sample 2 seven days later on the second day of the diet (time-point 2, diet period, day 0). Sample 3 was taken from the first stool on the third day of PEG intake while subjects were on the standard diet (time-point 3, diarrhea period, day 3). Sample 4 was taken 7 days after withdrawal of PEG and the standard diet (time-point 4, posttreatment period, day 10). Colonic biopsy samples were obtained from three of the four subjects (subjects B, C, D) at two different time points, sample 1 on the second day of the standard diet before diarrhea was induced (time-point 2, diet period, day 0) and sample 2 on the third day of PEG administration (time-point 3, diarrhea period, day 3). Biopsies were taken from the sigmoid colon 25 cm proximal to the anal canal by flexible sigmoidoscopy without bowel preparation. The mucosa of the area was flushed gently three times with 20 ml of physiological saline solution before two biopsies were taken. Stool samples (abbreviated in figures and tables as F) and mucosa samples (abbreviated in figures and tables as M) were immediately frozen and stored at \u201320\u00b0C.",

The stool homogenate was incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min prior to DNA extraction to increase bacterial DNA yield as recommended. The variable V1\u2013V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with PCR using oligonucleotide primers BSF8 and BSR357 as described previously [20]. This 16S rDNA region was chosen since it gives robust taxonomic classification and has been shown to be suitable for community clustering [21]. We included a sample specific six-nucleotide barcode sequence on primer BSF8 to allow for a simultaneous analysis of multiple samples per pyrosequencing run [22]. Oligonucleotide sequences are given in table S1. PCR conditions were as follows: 100 ng DNA from stool samples or 10 ng from biopsy samples were subjected to PCR amplification in a total volume of 50 \u00b5l with 1\u00d7 HotStar Master Mix (Qiagen) and 20 \u00b5M of each primer. For stool samples the following PCR protocol was used: Initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 12 min followed by 22 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 56\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final step of 72\u00b0C for 7 min. For biopsy samples the following PCR protocol was used: Initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 12 min followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 56\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final step of 72\u00b0C for 7 min. PCR products were separated on 1% 1xTAE agarose gel and specific bands (\u223c300 bp) were excised and gel extracted using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Each sample was amplified and extracted three times independently and subsequently pooled. Purified PCR products were assessed on BioAnalyzer 2100 DNA 1000 chips (Agilent Technologies, Vienna, Austria) for size and integrity. DNA concentration was determined fluorometrically using the QuantiDect reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). An amplicon library was prepared using aequimolar amounts of PCR products derived from the individual samples and bound to the sequencing beads at a one molecule per bead ratio. Long Read Amplicon Sequencing using 70\u00d775 PicoTiter Plates (Roche Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria) was done on a Genome Sequencer FLX system (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction.",

All sequences shorter than 150 bp containing any ambiguous characters or not matching to the forward primer (distance>2) were discarded [25]. Subsequently, the chimeric sequences were identified with Uchime\n[26] and removed together with contaminant (human) sequences. The remaining sequences were assigned to their respective samples by using the sample-specific 6 bp barcode preceding the primer. In order to perform sample- and time-point-wide comparisons, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated with an extended Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)-Pyrosequencing approach [27], which was integrated in the phylotyping pipeline SnoWMAn (http://SnoWMAn.genome.tugraz.at) [28]. Briefly, all sequences were pooled and aligned with Infernal (V1.0) using a 16S rRNA secondary structure based model for accurate position alignment of sequences [29]. The aligned sequences were clustered by complete linkage to form OTUs with sequence distances ranging from 0% to 5%. For each OTU a representative sequence was extracted and a taxonomic classification was assigned to it using the RDP Bayesian classifier 2.0.1 [30]. Finally, the pooled sequences were again separated according to their sample affiliation. Taxonomic classification and biostatistical analyses reported in this paper were performed on the clustering results for 3% distance.",

The abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE), diversity and evenness were calculated using the R package \u201cBiodiversityR\u201d (V1.5) [33]. Sequence abundance in each sample was normalized to the sample with the maximum number of sequences. Normalization factors ranged between 1.06 and 2.69. Additionally, abundance data were log-2 transformed after adding a value uniformly distributed between 0.75 and 1.25 to downweight OTUs with high abundance and to resemble the normal Gaussian distribution more closely. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the normalized, log-2 transformed data was performed with the prcomp function of R. OTUs significantly changing between time points were assessed either with Metastats using default settings [34] or the R package \u201cedgeR\u201d (V2.14.7) using a linear model accounting for the paired nature of the data [35]. To account for multiple comparisons, p-values were adjusted by the method proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg [36]. Adjusted p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Changes between time points on the level of taxonomic ranks were investigated using a paired t-test or a ratio paired t-test. The latter tests the ratio of the relative abundances (time-point 3: time point 2) against 1.",

In this way, we calculated the mean relative abundance between the pre-diarrhea states (time-point 1 and time-point 2) of each OTU. Together with the corresponding relative abundance values for diarrhea (time-point 3) and post-diarrhea (time-point 4), a three point profile (pre-diarrhea \u2013 diarrhea \u2013 post-diarrhea) of each OTU could be drawn. Only OTUs experiencing an abundance change of at least 0.05% in relation to the respective sample were included. Subsequently, a scoring system was introduced that assigned values of \u22121 (decreasing abundance value between two states), +1 (increasing abundance value) or 0 (relative abundance change<\u00b10.05%) to the (two) slopes of this profile. The score for the first slope was multiplied by 3 and added to the score of the second slope, yielding a specific overall score for each OTU that related to one of the nine possible profile patterns. For mucosa samples, which were only represented by pre-diarrhea (time-point 2) and diarrhea (time-point 3) states, three 2-point profiles were generated in a similar fashion. Finally, OTUs were assigned to their respective reaction pattern and these associations were visualized with Cytoscape [37].",

Proteobacteria were also more abundant on the mucosa than in the stools (5.5\u00b111.1% vs. 2.1\u00b11.2%). When the representation of phyla was compared between matched stool and mucosa samples (i.e. from the same individual at the same time point) and p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons, Firmicutes (adjusted P\u200a=\u200a0.001), Proteobacteria (adusted P\u200a=\u200a0.027), Actinobacteria (adjusted P<0.001) and Cyanobacteria (adjusted P<0.001) were more abundant on the mucosa and Bacteriodes more abundant in stools (adjusted P\u200a=\u200a0.016). Although we noted a trend towards increased microbial richness on the mucosa compared to stools as indicated by the rarefaction analysis (Fig. 2B), richness was not statistically significant different between the two habitats (P\u200a=\u200a0.1913 and P\u200a=\u200a0.989 at time-points 2 and time-points 3, respectively). Microbial diversity and evenness, both measures of the uniformity of the phylotype assembly, also showed no statistical difference between matched stool and mucosa samples (Table. S3).",

Often the most abundant stool phylotypes were more individual specific and were rarely detected or absent in stool specimens from other individuals (Table. S4). The most abundant phylotypes in mucosa specimens were dominated by lactobacilli (Weisella, Leuconostoc, Lactococcus), which were rarely detected or completely absent in stool specimens from the same person, underscoring the difference in microbial habitat composition (Table. S5). Interestingly, the two most abundant mucosal phylotypes matched to the exopolysaccharide producers Weisella confusa and Weisella cibaria (OTU_61 and OTU_24; BLAST: 100% homology either).

S6). The effect of diarrhea on the individual microbiotas was readily identifiable in the PCA, wherein community variation at time-point 3 exceeded intrapersonal variation between time-points 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). Diarrhea also led to a significant decrease in phylotype richness in stools (P\u200a=\u200a0.0295, paired t-test), further evidenced by decreased Chao1 and abundance-based coverage (ACE) richness estimators comparing time-point 2 with time-point 3 (P\u200a=\u200a0.017 and P\u200a=\u200a0.0218, respectively; Table. S3). Although overall decreased richness due to diarrhea was evident in the rarefaction analysis of mucosa specimens (Fig. 5), this difference did not reach statistical significance (P\u200a=\u200a0.0801). Phylotype diversity and evenness showed no significant difference between pre-diarrhea and diarrhea samples, either in stools or on the mucosa (Table. S3). PCA clearly separated mucosa from stool samples, reflecting the different niches, and also separated pre-diarrhea mucosa samples by individual. It was noteworthy that diarrhea led to a prominent shift of the mucosal communities, which significantly differed from pre-diarrheal mucosal communities in the PCA (P\u200a=\u200a0.0044, Student\u2019s t-test). Diarrhea-state mucosal communities clustered together in the PCA, indicating an equalization of the otherwise individualized microbiotas (Fig. 3B). Diarrhea also led to an increase in the number of shared phylotypes between individuals that was most pronounced in the mucosa samples at time-point 3 (Fig. 4).",

Depending on the stressor acting on the microbial community (i.e. wash-out due to osmotic diarrhea) and the life-style of the respective microbes (adherent vs. living in suspension), certain phylotypes should experience a more pronounced abundance change compared to others. Thus we assessed the coefficient of variation (CV) of the relative abundances of phylotypes between time-point 2 and time-point 3 samples. A CV of \u226410% was chosen as threshold and only phylotypes prevalent with at least 10 reads per individual were considered. This analysis revealed that only a small fraction of phylotypes exhibited stable behavior and the proportion of these so-called \u201cstable\u201d phylotypes differed greatly between subjects (Table. S7). The majority of stable phylotypes were specific to the individuals, meaning that a phylotype showing stable behavior in one individual showed non-stable behavior in the other individuals according to our definition. In stools only one stable phylotype was found in two individuals simultaneously (OTU_1199; Lachnospiriaceae), while there was none in the mucosa samples. In stool samples the stable phylotype with the highest abundance was represented by Bacteroides vulgatus (OTU_33; BLAST homology 100%), but only in one individual (Table. S4, Table. S7). In the mucosa samples stable phylotypes with the highest abundance were represented by Weisella confusa and Weisella cibaria (OTU_61 and OTU_24, respectively; BLAST homology 100%), which also represented top abundant phylotypes on the mucosa as mentioned above (Table. S5). Several low-abundant phylotypes were also considered stable (Table. S7). In general, Firmicutes were overrepresented in both mucosa and stool samples as stable phylotypes (Table. S7). The finding that the number of stable phylotypes differed greatly between individuals highlights the high degree of individualization of the GI microbiota. Moreover, stable behavior seems to be related to the individual and/or the microbial community itself and not to the phylotype per-se.",

Levels of inter-individual variation might therefore exceed community variation induced by diarrhea. Moreover, our pilot study encompassed a relatively small sample size (n\u200a=\u200a22), which hampers stringent statistical assessment. Consequently, both preconditions may have obscured patterns in the microbial community driven by osmotic diarrhea. We thus employed an alternative strategy and assessed abundance changes on the level of individual OTUs with three different measures. Two biostatistical tools well established for assessment of abundance data were employed, Metastats and edgeR. A not too stringent significance threshold was used in these analyses (P<0.05) to account for the relatively small sample size. The third approach involved a scoring system with graphical data visualization (denoted Viz), wherein the abundance change of phylotypes (increasing and decreasing in response to diarrhea) was scored and presented within association networks created with Cytoscape.",

If Viz analysis was narrowed down to phylotypes showing a respective association pattern in at least 2 individuals, 61 phylotypes were evident (Table. S13). To that end, all three methods together identified 100 OTUs showing significant relative abundance variation or a respective abundance pattern (in at least 2 individuals) in relation to diarrhea (Table. 1, Fig. 6A) Out of them, 39 OTUs were at least identified by two methods simultaneously (Table. 2). Community variation was readily presented by Viz; 37 out of 61 Viz-identified phylotypes (60.7%) were reconfirmed by Metastats and/or edgeR (Fig. 7, Fig. S2). In general, Bacteroidetes were associated with an increase and decrease pattern in response to diarrhea but often approached baseline values within the 1 week posttreatment interval. Firmicutes were also associated with either an increase pattern and thereafter approached baseline or decreased due to diarrhea and remained so. Interestingly, several OTUs matching to the genus Faecalibacterium including F. prausnitzii (e.g. OTU_206; BLAST identity 97%) experienced a relative increase in abundance due to diarrhea, which was mirrored by a simultaneous decrease of these taxa in the mucosa specimens.",

Our longitudinal study with simultaneously sampled stool and mucosa specimens enabled us to compare microbiota changes within and between individuals. We noted strikingly different community structures between stool and mucosa samples wherein Bacteroidetes dominated stools and Firmicutes the mucosa. The dominance of Firmicutes on the mucosa is in accordance with several earlier reports [41], [42]. Bacteria display different life styles: either they are particle associated or they experience a free-living (\u201cplanctonic\u201d) life style [17], [43], [44]. Both life styles can be found in stools as well as on the mucosa, although in the latter the polysaccharide-rich mucus overlying the gut epithelium constitutes a biofilm-like community, which might favor a particle-associated life-style [45]. Niche colonization is determined by both partners of the mutualistic human/microbe relationship and is dependent on factors like the availability of nutrients or the capability to adhere [17]. Recent investigations comparing liquid phase and particle-associated communities have also revealed that Firmicutes are dominant in the latter [46]. Interestingly, the two top-abundant phylotypes on the mucosa, which have also been found unaltered (\u201cstable\u201d) in response to diarrhea, matched to Weisella confusa and Weisella cibaria (OTU_61 and OTU_24). Both taxons are exopolysaccharide (dextran) producers and show a strong adhesion capacity, e.g. to Caco-2 cells, which might explain their preferential colonization of the mucosal habitat and their investigation regarding their potential as probiotics [47], [48]. We also recorded a trend toward higher richness on the mucosa compared to stools, which is in accordance with earlier reports [42]. Since the mucosal surface represents the interface of host/microbe interactions, a higher phylotype richness (\u201cbiodiversity\u201d), which enhances the robustness and stability of an ecosystem, might be an intrinsic safeguard against perturbations like invasion of pathogens [49], [50]. Understanding the spatial organization of host-associated microbial communities thus poses an important challenge for future microbiota studies of the GI tract [21], [51].",

                    "text": "The human GI microbiota shows a high degree of inter-individual variation at higher phylogenetic levels despite a uniform community structure at lower levels where the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes dominate [2], [38]. This phenomenon was most prominent in stools, wherein inter-individual differences exceeded any intra-individual variation. In the mucosa samples the degree of inter-individual variation was generally lower, despite a trend towards higher richness. For instance, in mucosa specimens more phylotypes were shared between individuals than in stools. Importantly, diarrhea led to an equalization of the mucosal microbiotas, which clustered together in the PCA and showed an increased phylotype overlap at time-point 3. We induced diarrhea with PEG, a mixture of non-absorbable, non-metabolizable polymers acting as a pure osmotic agent \u201cbinding\u201d water in the gut lumen [52]. This led to \u201cwash-out\u201d and decreased phylotype richness in both habitats as described by others [53], [54]. In various inflammatory and diarrheal GI diseases, reduced phylotype richness has been reported, including AAD, C. difficile colitis, viral enterocolitis, IBD and IBS [5], [7]\u2013[10], [20], [55]. Reduced richness can be subverted by (opportunistic) pathogens that colonize niches otherwise occupied by the endogenous microbiota [50]. In that regard antibiotic treatment represents a paradigm condition wherein certain groups of bacteria are specifically depleted [55]. Our study indicates that reduced richness per se does not necessarily reflect or lead to pathology but is in turn a consequence of the diarrhea prevalent in many GI diseases.",

To understand the basic reaction patterns induced by osmotic diarrhea, we assessed the relative abundance change of individual phylotypes. To account for the high level of inter-individual variation of the GI microbiota with our relatively small sample size, we vigorously tested our data set with different approaches. These measures included two established biostatistical tools (Metastats and edgeR) and a scoring system with graphical representation of the results (Viz). These analyses revealed several significantly changing phylotypes but showed reduced congruence between methods. Interestingly, the majority of phylotypes detected with Viz (in at least two individuals simultaneously) were confirmed by at least one biostatistical method showing the usefulness of the scoring method. It is important to note that all three methods identified several low abundant significantly changing taxa (i.e. OTUs with about 10 reads representing just about 0.05% of the whole community, given that about 20,000 reads were generated per sample). But reliable detection of these low abundant taxa is highly dependent on the sampling effort (sequencing depth), which can hardly reach completeness given the large number of microbes (about 1013\u20131014) colonizing our gut [38]. Thus some of the identified low-abundant OTUs might represent artifacts because of sampling bias. Removal of these low abundant OTUs (e.g. with \u226410 reads) prior to statistical assessment would be a reasonable strategy that might increase accuracy of analysis but could also lead to loss of relevant information [57]\u2013[61].",

In this way, we identified several Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes experiencing a relative increase or decrease in stools in response to diarrhea. On the mucosa Bacteroidetes showed a significant association with decreasing relative abundance. It is noteworthy that we observed a significantly increased fraction of Proteobacteria experiencing a rise in relative abundance in the mucosa specimens due to diarrhea. Among them were several opportunistic pathogens including pseudomonads like Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter (e.g. OTU_1341, OTU_101) as well as the \u03b5-proteobacterial taxon Arcobacter (e.g. OTU_596). Several lactic-acid bacteria (e.g. Lactococcus) also increased on the mucosa during diarrhea, and may therefore represent interesting candidates for probiotics in the setting of diarrheal disease [62]. Interestingly, we also observed a relative increase in taxa matching to Faecalibacterium including F. prausnitzii (e.g. OTU_206) in stools, which was mirrored by a simultaneous decrease in the mucosa specimens. This observation warrants further investigation since this anti-inflammatory GI bacterium is reported to be decreased in IBD [63], [64].",

Proteobacteria are usually considered to be generalists able to colonize various habitats with diverse resources. For example we found that OTU_1341 matching to Pseudomonas putida significantly increased due to diarrhea; this pathogen shows genomic adaptation to diverse environments but can also cause severe diseases in humans [69]\u2013[72]. Since diarrhea decreases richness, as was reflected by a significant drop in several Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in our study, it is reasonable to speculate that Proteobacteria can occupy and repopulate these depleted niches more efficiently. It so seems that diarrhea per se, irrespective of its etiology, can select for this special community type with increased Proteobacteria. It is therefore important to note that these changes may not be specific for diseases like IBD but may represent an epiphenomenon of the wash-out effect due to diarrhea. Moreover, the efficient colonization capacity of Proteobacteria might explain the effectiveness of strains like E. coli Nissle 1917 used for the therapy of IBD [73]. It is important to note that we assessed the relative abundances of taxa within samples and their relative abundance changes comparing different samples, which does not necessarily translate into absolute changes of taxa, which would require further assessment of specimens (e.g. by means of qPCR).",

                    "text": "Capturing the true microbial representation within a sample by cultivation-independent techniques is hampered by various technical challenges. Specimen handling, DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing altogether are causes of bias [57], [59], [74]\u2013[77]. For instance, we compared stool and biopsy samples, which display considerable differences in their composition requiring individual protocols for efficient cell lysis and DNA release from samples. To account for the \u201crich\u201d matrix composition of stools, we utilized a recommended boiling step prior to DNA extraction from feces, which was not used for biopsies. Several reports emphasized the influence of DNA extraction methods on the outcome of PCR-based microbial community surveys [74]\u2013[77]. Thus we cannot exclude that the different extraction protocols used in our study influenced our findings. In addition to specimen work-up, template concentration, primer sequences and PCR conditions including PCR cycle numbers also influence the assessed community structure [57], [59], [75], [78]. The different sample types (i.e. stools and biopsies) in our study displayed different loads of 16S-targets requiring sample-type specific adjustment of PCR cycle numbers (22 and 35 cycles for stool and mucosa samples, respectively) to prevent PCR substrate exhaustion and to approach a similar end-point of PCR within the linear range of amplification. Increased PCR cycles are reported to skew diversity measures leading to an underestimation of diversity present in the sample [79]. Since we noted a trend towards an increased richness in the mucosa samples compared to stools, albeit not statistically significant, we speculate that the PCR cycle trade-off in our study might have led to underestimation of richness in the mucosa samples. The challenge to optimize the technological accuracy of human microbiome studies poses a major challenge. Inconsistencies may remain even if up-to-date technology with high accuracy combined with a stringent data analysis as in our study are used [57], [80].",

                    "text": "Our longitudinal study has revealed several important findings regarding the human GI microbiota and its response to diarrhea. (I) We found that stools and the mucosa represent strikingly different habitats with a different community structure and a different response to stressors like diarrhea. For this reason, studies investigating changes in the GI microbiota in association with specific diseases need to consider that the fecal microbiota does not readily reflect the mucosal community. (II) The finding that Proteobacteria relatively increase in response to diarrhea on the mucosa is suggestive of a basic principle of the community in this niche regardless of the cause of diarrhea. When the mucosa is severely affected as in IBD, nutrients like iron derived from blood are available in excess for these efficient colonizers [81]. In turn these bacteria can utilize these resources, i.e. they have developed siderophore uptake systems for iron capture, and so can experience a growth advantage [12], [67], [82]. This phenomenon might then lead to the persistent community change (dysbiosis) noted in IBD, which in turn perpetuates chronic inflammation due to the pro-inflammatory behavior of these bacteria. (III) Our findings show definite changes of the GI microbiota in response to PEG treatment, which is used for bowel cleansing prior to endoscopy. Studies using colonoscopy samples for microbiota analysis need to bear this in mind. (IV) We have shown the usefulness of small-scale longitudinal clinical studies to find relevant microbial community patterns of variation, if data are assessed stringently. In this regard our newly described scoring approach with visualization (Viz) is a valuable tool; since it readily illustrates the reaction of the microbiota as a whole, patterns can be caught visually by the investigator.",
