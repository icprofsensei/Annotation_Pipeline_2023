                    "text": "Profiling faecal microbiota is now routinely applied to explore relationships between microbiota and host health status (Young, 2017). Since stool, including the microbiota, is subject to change post-collection, it is essential that samples are preserved in a way that minimises microbial growth, degradation and contamination to ensure microbial associations being detected in comparative studies are not influenced by storage. The \u2018gold standard\u2019 for storing stool for microbiome analysis is cryopreserving at \u221280 \u00b0C without a buffer (Vandeputte et al., 2017). Preservation at \u221220 \u00b0C has also been proposed as appropriate (Song et al., 2016), although this may not be ideal for longer term storage (Bahl, Bergstr\u00f6m & Licht, 2012; Gorzelak et al., 2015). Whilst suitable for human studies in high income countries, cryopreservation is often not feasible for large scale projects in remote fieldwork settings, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Focusing on conditions more likely to be accessible in these settings, several studies have assessed the impact of storage under standard cold chain, that is, +4 \u00b0C (Choo, Leong & Rogers, 2015; Lauber et al., 2010; Penington et al., 2018; Tedjo et al., 2015), and \u2018room\u2019 (i.e. 25 \u00b0C) temperatures (Cardona et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2016; Lauber et al., 2010; Tal et al., 2017; Tedjo et al., 2015) prior to freezing. These approaches appear to be sufficient to maintain a representative metataxonomic 16S rRNA microbiota community profile in the short-term (up to 14 days post collection). However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies determining the effect of real time temperature fluctuations commonly seen in tropical fieldwork environments. Since geographically separated populations have distinct microbiota compositions (Lee et al., 2014; Yatsunenko et al., 2012), it is reasonable to hypothesise that the microbiota in stool samples from different communities could also have different rates of abiotic change. Exploring the impact of time-to-freezing on gut microbiota profiles is therefore an important consideration for field studies in tropical LMIC, where the gut microbiome composition is less well established, temperature variation is more difficult to control, and collection standards are difficult to optimise.",

Informed and realistic considerations must be made about the best practices for storage of stool samples in such situations to maintain sample integrity. More recently, preservation solutions have been used in an attempt to preserve DNA, and minimise microbial changes in stool after collection. Minimal differences have been reported between different room-temperature storage preservation solutions compared to immediately frozen raw stools (Blekhman et al., 2016; Dominianni et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018). Another study reported that stool microbiome 16S rRNA profiles stored in preservatives at ambient temperature for three days prior to freezing at \u221280 \u00b0C were significantly different in composition and diversity compared to immediately frozen samples without preservative (Choo, Leong & Rogers, 2015). Although storage preservation was being compared, it is possible that both time-to-freezing and abiotic factors influenced results. Understanding the performance of preservation methods, as well as their impact in combination with time-to-freezing, may be useful in settings susceptible to large temperature fluctuations, where cold storage may be unreliable or unavailable.",

The sample from Child A was collected on day 1, and those from Child B and Child C on day 2. Outer surface, central inner and mixed stool samples (~300 mg each) were taken from each specimen and stored separately in cryovials as raw stool (considered the standard), dispersed in absolute ethanol (approx. stool:ethanol ratio = 1:6) and dispersed in RNAlater (approx. stool:RNAlater ratio = 1:6), then frozen immediately on dry ice. Additionally coarsely homogenised stool from each donor were frozen on dry ice at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 h post collection for each storage preservation method (Table S1). Time zero was taken as the time at which all the stool samples, taken from an individual stool specimen, had been processed into all the collection tubes for the relevant conditions to be tested, which was approximately 30 min after defecation. Prior to freezing on dry ice, stool was kept in cooler, shaded, well ventilated, indoor spaces as much as realistically possible. Within 48 h of freezing on dry ice, samples were transferred into a \u221220 \u00b0C freezer and later transported to the University of Glasgow on dry ice for further processing and analysis. Samples underwent one freeze-thaw cycle (<30 min) during weighing and, to the best of our knowledge, they remained frozen at \u221220 \u00b0C from collection until DNA was extracted approximately 6 months later. Cryovials used in the field containing only ethanol or RNAlater, without stool, were used as negative controls. Samples from two of the children were also stored using OMNIgene.GUT kits (DNA Genotek (Doukhanine et al., 2014)) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and remained at ambient temperature until DNA was extracted approximately six (four in Uganda and two in the UK) months later (~three times the recommended 60 day stability recommendation for the kit; http://www.dnagenotek.com/us/products/collection-microbiome/omnigene-gut/OMR-200.html).

Using cutadapt software (Martin, 2011) in Python version 2.7, barcode sequences were removed, reads trimmed to a minimum quality score of 20, and then reads less than 250 bp in length were discarded (Code S1). Forward and reverse reads were combined using PANDAseq (Masella et al., 2012) for each sample before all files were merged into one file containing all samples (Code S1). Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software version 1.9.1 (Caporaso et al., 2010) in Python version 2.7 was used to analyse the data. Operational Taxonomic Units were assigned with 97% clustering to the Greengenes database version 13.8 (DeSantis et al., 2006) for 16S rRNA gene alignment. Sequences aligning to mitochondria or chloroplast sequences were screened for and removed from the dataset. Custom scripts in QIIME were used to analyse relative taxonomic abundance, and alpha and beta diversity measures (Code S1) at a sequencing depth of 10,000 reads per sample. Pairwise comparisons of beta diversity measures (weighted (Lozupone et al., 2007) and unweighted (Lozupone & Knight, 2005) UniFrac) were made using 999 Monte Carlo permutations (MCP). The linear discriminant effect size (LEfSe) (Segata et al., 2011) algorithm was performed to identify taxonomic groups associated with the variables measured (p < 0.01, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score (log10 \u2265 2)). To be included in the results, each variable must have met the inclusion criteria (p < 0.01, LDA score (log10 \u2265 2)) within each child, as well as when averaged across all three children. Higher taxonomic levels were excluded where it was assumed that a lower taxonomic level was accountable for the observed change. These situations were where a higher taxonomic level had a less significant or equal change in relative abundance compared to a lower taxonomic level classified to the higher taxonomy by LEfSe analysis. However, if the higher taxonomic level had a more significant p-value it was retained. Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests to compare read counts (significantly different if p < 0.05) were performed in R version 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017) and graphs were generated using the ggplot2 package (Wickham et al., 2018).

The lmerTest package (Kuznetsova, Brockho & Christensen, 2017) was used to determine the significance of these model components. Two maximal models were constructed and included all the fixed effects (preservation method, time-to-freezing and stool region) and their interactions with child replicate as a random effect, the first included time as a continuous variable and the second included time as a factor.

Individual child (included as a random effect) was also the only predictor of Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity from the variables measured. Multiple factors, including diet (David et al., 2014) and demographics (Yatsunenko et al., 2012), not recorded in this study, have been shown to influence microbial status within an individual, and each individual will have a unique combination of contributing factors. Individuality is therefore an important consideration when planning comparative microbial studies (i.e. between healthy and diseased states) to ensure enough participants are recruited into studies so that the obtained data are informative about the question of interest.",

PCoA of UniFrac metrics further revealed clustering by preservation method despite child variation (Figs. 1C and \u200band1D),1D), suggesting each preservation method acts similarly across each child. Despite significant differences between within-preservation-method UniFrac metrics, there was no trend in preservation method performance across each of the children. This could be due to unique microbial profiles of the children being suited to different types of storage or attributed to the randomness between samples taken within a specimen, which may also account for the significant differences in UniFrac metrics observed in child C. Modelling also identified that preservation method had a significant effect on species richness. Significant differences in the microbial profiles from stool stored in RNAlater and ethanol were identified when compared to samples stored raw, that were considered \u2018gold standard\u2019 for this study (Fig. 3). These differences appeared to remain relatively stable across time-to-freezing (Fig. 4) and were evident even at time zero, when samples were first frozen by 30 min post-defecation, suggesting that changes occurred rapidly, within a few minutes, after the addition of stool to preservative. All of the bacterial levels correlated to ethanol and/or RNAlater preservation identified by LEfSe, of which the two methods shared seven groups of the eight and 11 groups respectively (Fig. 3), were associated with some form of anaerobic metabolism. Anaerobic bacteria are possibly over-represented or better preserved than aerobic species in stool stored using these methods. Preservative exposure therefore may influence microbial profiles obtained from stool via a common physical mechanism, which favours the preservation of some bacterial taxa over others, making stool stored in various preservatives more similar in microbial structure and comparable to each other. This is in agreement with a study that found samples stored in preservatives were more likely to cluster together by PCoA, based on Bray-Curtis similarity distances (Choo, Leong & Rogers, 2015). Alternatively, it is possible that PCR product amplification of certain species was altered by residual ethanol or RNAlater salts despite care being taken to limit these PCR contaminants during the DNA extraction process. RNAlater has been reported to reduce DNA yield by qPCR (Gorzelak et al., 2015) and 16S rRNA DNA amplification purity (Dominianni et al., 2014) in microbiota studies. However, microbiota variation between samples within preservation method groups was low (Figs. 1, \u200b,22 and \u200band4)4) and DNA concentrations were standardised across the samples in our study, suggesting that at least some of the associations observed are due to the stool preservation method.",

The Bristol stool chart (O\u2019Donnell, Virjee & Heaton, 1990) defines seven levels of stool consistency and water content from type 1 (solid lumps) to a type 7 (watery liquid). It is plausible that inner and outer stool regions at the higher end of the scale are likely to be more uniform than stool at the lower end of the scale, and more difficult to define inner and outer stool regions at higher stool values. Stool samples collected from the Ugandan children for this study, although not formally graded, commonly fell into the higher end of the Bristol stool chart guide. Classifying stool specimens prior to sectioning may be a useful factor to explore in future work, along with other associations such as diet or health status. Stool size may also impact heterogeneity with the inner and outer regions of \u2018larger\u2019 stools being more distinguishable. This may explain why Gorzelak et al. (2015) and Vandeputte et al. (2016) obtained significant differences as their samples were collected from adults, who presumably produced larger stool specimens at the lower end of the Bristol stool chart than the LMIC child samples collected in this study. Whilst we did not see any differences associated with stool region, suggesting crude mixing is sufficient to maintain a representative microbiome in situations where specialised equipment is unavailable, the number of specimens collected in this study was small (n = 3). Therefore, there may not have been enough replicates to detect changes in stool heterogeneity in this study, and more samples ranging in different sizes may need to be studied to fully understand the impact of stool heterogeneity.",

An additional zero at the end of the code represents a replicate sample from the stool specimen. OMNIgene.GUT samples were stored at time 0 h but were not frozen prior to DNA extraction. Sample EM32C was excluded from further analysis due to low read count of 29 reads (Fig. S1), and sample RM32B was excluded from the analysis due to inconsistent child clustering by PCoA (Fig. S2) as it was suspected that the sample may have originated from or was contaminated with sample provided by a different individual.",
