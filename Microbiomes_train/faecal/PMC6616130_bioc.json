Emerging evidence suggests that an altered composition and diversity of gut microbiota could play an important role in the development of obesity and related metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Cani, 2013; Han and Lin, 2014; Moreno-Indias et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2016; Cani, 2019). The relative amount of the two dominant phyla in gut microbiota, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, is altered in obesity conditions both in humans and in animal models (Ley et al., 2005; Ley et al., 2006; Turnbaugh et al., 2006; Verdam et al., 2013). Besides, the Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes ratio (BFR) has been widely associated with the inflammatory and metabolic state in obesity (Cani et al., 2009; de La Serre et al., 2010; Verdam et al., 2013). Several mechanisms have been proposed as a link between obesity and gut microbiota, for instance, the production of microbial metabolites that regulate energy metabolism, metabolic endotoxemia, or the modulation of the secretion of hormones by intestinal cells (Cani, 2019).",

The beta value results in a number between 0 and 1, in which a value of zero indicates that all copies of the CpG site in the sample were completely unmethylated and a value of one indicates that every copy of the site was methylated (Du et al., 2010). Differential methylation, gene set enrichment, and pathway analyses were performed using Partek Genomics Suit with Pathway (version 7.0).

From the 45 patients with morbid obesity, 20 subjects were selected based on the relative abundances of the predominant phyla, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes: high BFR (HighBFR group; BFR > 2.5; n = 10) vs. low BFR (LowBFR group; BFR < 1.2; n = 10) (Table S2). As expected, the HighBFR group (n = 10) exhibited predominance of the Bacteroidetes phylum (p < 0.0001), whereas Firmicutes was predominant in the LowBFR group (n = 10) subjects (p < 0.0001) (\nFigure 1\n). No statistical differences between other phyla such as Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, or Fusobacteria were found between groups (\nFigure 1\n). The general characteristics of both study groups are summarized in \nTable 1\n. There were no significant differences in age, sex, and BMI between the two study groups. Glucose and HbA1c levels were significantly lower in the HighBFR group when compared with the LowBFR group (p < 0.05).

As shown in \nFigure 2\n, the two groups showed a different methylation profile in both whole blood and VAT (\nFigure 2A and B\n). We found 1,658 and 1,421 differentially methylated genes between study groups in whole blood and VAT, respectively (\nFigure 2C\n; Tables S3 and S4). We classified them as hypermethylated and hypomethylated, differentiating those that were significant in both whole blood and VAT from those that were only significant in whole blood or VAT (Table S5). Remarkably, 258 genes were differentially methylated both whole blood and VAT (\nFigure 2C\n; Table S6). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that most of the genes differentially methylated in whole blood and VAT were involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism and cell adhesion molecules, respectively (Table S7). Moreover, a further enrichment analysis on an ontology basis such as OMIM diseases revealed that the top three categories enriched were related to diabetes. In order to better understand these results, a further association analysis between the probes and the phenotype characteristics of the patients was performed (Table S8). Many associations were found, but HOMA-IR, HbA1c, weight, and BMI were found to be the most relevant variables.",

Thus, we tested the impact of changes in the methylation levels on the mRNA expression levels in VAT of the following genes: FGF1, FGF10, KDM4B, HDCA7, IGF2BP2, IL7, EDEM1, ATF6, and CDK6 (Sharma et al., 2008; Makki et al., 2013; Ohta and Itoh, 2014; Dai et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2018; Davegardh et al., 2018; Hou et al., 2018). As shown in Figure S1, HDAC7 and IGF2BP2 mRNA levels were significantly different between study groups; no differences in the expression levels were found for the rest of the analyzed genes. Further, we assessed the association between the gut microbiota composition and the methylation levels of both HDAC7 and IGF2BP2. As shown in \nFigure 3A\n, the \u03b2 values of HDAC7 (indicatives of the DNA methylation status of the gene) were significantly higher in the HighBFR group in both whole blood and VAT. Correlation analysis in the whole cohort of obese subjects (n = 45) demonstrated that the \u03b2 values of HDAC7 in both whole blood and VAT were positively associated with the BFR (\nFigure 3B\n). Additionally, whereas \u03b2 values of HDAC7 in blood correlated negatively with the relative abundance of Firmicutes (\nFigure 3C\n), \u03b2 values of HDAC7 in VAT were positively associated with the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (\nFigure 3D\n). Like HDAC7, the \u03b2 values of IGF2BP2 were significantly higher in the HighBFR group in both whole blood and VAT (\nFigure 4A\n). Furthermore, IGF2BP2 \u03b2 values in VAT significantly correlated with the BFR and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (\nFigure 4B\n). No significant correlation was observed between gut microbiota composition and \u03b2 values of IGF2BP2 in whole blood. It is noteworthy that some of these correlations remain still significant when patients with the most extreme BFR values were excluded (validation cohort; n = 25). Thus, we found that the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes positively correlated with the methylation levels of HDAC7 (r = 0.500, p = 0.011) and IGF2BP2 (r = 0.597, p = 0.002) in adipose tissue, and the relative abundance of Firmicutes negatively correlated with the methylation levels of HDAC7 (r = \u22120.465, p = 0.019) in whole blood. These results reinforce the relationship between gut microbiota and DNA methylation within these genes.",

                    "text": "Obesity is a pathological condition highly associated with lifestyle. Epigenome and gut microbiota are two factors clearly impacted by lifestyle. Recent evidence has proposed that certain metabolites produced by microbial metabolism can influence the epigenetic profile in several conditions (Hullar and Fu, 2014; Cuevas-Sierra et al., 2019). Despite the possible role of gut microbiota as epigenetic regulator, the number of works associating gut microbiome and epigenetics is scarce. Moreover, most of these studies were focused on histone acetylation, with little attention paid to DNA methylation status. Here, we have demonstrated for the first time an association between the composition of certain bacterial populations in the gastrointestinal tract with specific DNA whole-genome methylation states in both blood samples and adipose tissue biopsies in the context of extreme obesity. Overall, the subjects included in the present study were characterized by a heterogeneous gut microbiota composition. However, we found that, independently on their clinical characteristics, classification of patients clustered into two groups according to their gut microbiota profile measured by the relative abundance of the predominant phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. These clusters of obese individuals presented similar BMI and clinical parameters related to lipid metabolism but significant differences in markers of glucose metabolism. In particular, individuals with low Bact/Firm ratio displayed higher levels of fasting glucose and HbA1c. Microbiota profile is influenced by the environmental conditions (Rothschild et al., 2018). Within the gut, microbiota is influenced by the host phenotype. Gut microbiota has been extensively related to glucose levels and metabolism, although a clear conclusion about the cause or consequence has not completely been achieved (Utzschneider et al., 2016). Thus, glucose levels could drive the clusters of these patients and could influence the gut microbiota profiles and consequently the Bact/Firm ratio used in the study. The classification of obese patients according to their Bact/Firm ratio showed a clear association between the relative abundance of these phyla with the DNA methylation profile in both blood and adipose tissue, supporting the idea that the gut microbiota could act as an epigenetic regulator in obesity, as previously indicated by others for other pathological conditions (Yang et al., 2013; Hullar and Fu, 2014; Sook Lee et al., 2017; Watson and S\u00f8reide, 2017; Qin and Wade, 2018). In fact, the furthest association analysis between the DNA methylation results and the phenotypes of the patients revealed that weight and BMI, as well as HOMA-IR and HbA1c levels, were the variables more related to DNA methylation status. Interestingly, the enrichment analysis based on OMIM diseases database showed that diabetes, and particularly type 2 diabetes, was the disease most related to the DNA methylation status, which mirrored the results showed through the clustering of the patients according to their Bact/Firm ratio.",

In animal models, it has been previously shown that microbial metabolites such as SCFAs can influence epigenetic programming in various tissues, including proximal colon, liver, and white adipose tissue (Krautkramer et al., 2016). Because most of butyrate-producing bacteria belong to the Firmicutes phyla (Vital et al., 2014), differences in the Bact/Firm ratio within our cohort of obese individuals could result in different circulating levels of butyrate or other SCFAs, which would explain the observed differences in the DNA methylation status in both blood cells and adipose tissue. In addition to SCFAs, other metabolites produced by the bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract have been related to epigenetic modifications (Bhat and Kapila, 2017). In particular, gut bacteria can produce high levels of folic acid and polyamines, which are molecules highly related to carbon metabolism and therefore with potential impact in the DNA methylation status (Crider et al., 2012; Soda, 2018; Ramos-Molina et al., 2019). Nevertheless, whether the changes in the methylome associated with alterations in gut microbiome are related to changes in the levels of these or other bacterial metabolites requires further investigation.",

Our results are supported by multiple studies performed in cohorts of non-obese individuals. For instance, a recent pilot study performed in pregnant women demonstrated an association between the relative abundance of dominant phyla (Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) and the DNA methylation profile in blood samples (Kumar et al., 2014). In another interesting work, Kelly et al. reported an association between gut microbiota and histone methylation signature of intestinal epithelial cells in patients with inflammatory bowel syndrome (Kelly et al., 2018). In a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, Qin et al. demonstrated that changes in the gut microbiome could result in epigenetic alterations associated with the development of colon cancer (Qin et al., 2018). There is no evidence, however, of a relationship between the composition of the gut microbiome and the methylation status in adipose tissue. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that the DNA methylation of certain genes related to adipogenesis and lipid metabolism is impaired in adipose tissue of subjects with metabolic syndrome (Castellano-Castillo et al., 2019). Nevertheless, whether these changes in the methylation pattern are related to differences in the gut microbiota composition remains unknown.",

These genes were further studied based on their relationship with metabolism. However, it is worthy to mention that only two of the nine studied genes achieved a statistically significant difference between BFR groups, indicative of the complex machinery regulating gene expression and representing DNA methylation in only one of the mechanisms implicated. On the one hand, HDAC7 gene encodes a histone deacetylase (HDAC). Histone deacetylase enzymes repress gene expression by removing an acyl group bound to chromatin. Although it is widely known that class I HDACs (mainly 1, 2, and 3) are inhibited by microbial products as SCFAs, mainly butyrate (Yuille et al., 2018), this is the first time that a class IIb HDAC is related with gut microbiota. In line with our results, a previous work demonstrated that the HDAC7 gene was hypomethylated and overexpressed in islets from donors with T2D (Dayeh et al., 2014), which could have pathological implications given that Hdac7 overexpression in rat islets and \u03b2-cell lines resulted in impaired insulin secretion (Daneshpajooh et al., 2017). Our results show that hypomethylation in the HDAC7 promoter in both whole blood and adipose tissue is also associated with disturbances in glucose metabolism, as both study groups displayed marked differences in glucose and HbA1c levels. This suggests that the changes in the methylation profile in the HDAC7 gene are related not only to the composition of the gut microbiota but also to the metabolic profile of the subjects, at least in blood and adipose tissue. However, further investigation is required to examine in detail the implication of the microbial population.",

                    "text": "On the other hand, hypomethylation of IGF2BP2 also resulted in higher mRNA levels in adipose tissue. In adipose tissue, IGF2BP2 is able to downregulate the expression of IGF2, a growth factor that plays a pivotal role in controlling adipogenesis (Louveau and Gondret, 2004). Therefore, impaired IGF2BP2 expression levels may contribute to the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity and T2D through alterations in the function of the adipose tissue. In this regard, inactivation of the IGF2BP2 in mice induces resistance to diet-induced obesity and fatty liver due in part to increased energy expenditure, suggesting that IGF2BP2 has an important role in the regulation of energy homeostasis (Dai et al., 2015). Thus, gut microbiota profile could be participating in the homeostasis of the host through the methylation of particular genes as IGF2BP2. Interestingly, these associations between gut microbiota and HDAC7 and IGF2BP2 gene expression and methylation levels seem to be driven by the phylum Bacteroidetes. The major end products of Bacteroidetes are succinate, acetate, and, in some cases, propionate (Chakraborti, 2015). Methylation rates depend on the availability of one- and two-carbon substrates (Su et al., 2016). Acetate is a two-carbon substrate, while succinate is able to follow the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, although classically Firmicutes has been the main phylum related to epigenetic modifications, Bacteroidetes could be more related to methylation and Firmicutes to acetylation modifications. However, phylum is a phylogenetic level that groups different microbial members with different SCFAs and other metabolites that should be carefully studied.",

In order to understand how gut microbiota can influence DNA methylation in adipose tissue and other target organs, further studies are needed.",
