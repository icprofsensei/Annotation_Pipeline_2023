Given the emerging association between the gut microbiota and IBS, this study examined potential effects of rifaximin on the gastrointestinal microbial community in patients with IBS-D. TARGET 3 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study. Patients with IBS-D initially received open-label rifaximin 550\u00a0mg 3\u00a0times daily (TID) for 2 weeks. Patients who responded to the initial treatment and then relapsed were randomised to receive 2 repeat courses of rifaximin 550\u00a0mg TID or placebo for 2 weeks, with each course separated by 10 weeks. Stool samples were collected at the beginning and end of open-label treatment, at the beginning and end of the first double-blind treatment, and at the end of the study. As a secondary analysis to the TARGET 3 trial, the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota were assessed, from a random subset of patients, using variable 4 hypervariable region 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Samples from 103 patients were included. After open-label rifaximin treatment for 2 weeks, 7 taxa (e.g. Peptostreptococcaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae) had significantly lower relative abundance at a 10% false discovery rate threshold. The effects of rifaximin were generally short-term, as there was little evidence of significantly different changes in taxa relative abundance at the end of the study (up to 46 weeks) versus baseline. The results suggest that rifaximin has a modest, largely transient effect across a broad range of stool microbes. Future research may determine whether the taxa affected by rifaximin are causally linked to IBS-D.",

Therefore, the sample size was based on practicality of sequencing costs at the time the study was initiated. Fresh stool samples were collected prospectively from patients at clinic visits (V) before (open-label baseline; V3) and after open-label treatment with rifaximin (open-label week 2; V4), before (double-blind baseline; V6) and after the first double-blind treatment with rifaximin or placebo (double-blind week 2; V7), and at the end of the study (V11; Figure 1).32 Non-responders to open-label rifaximin were withdrawn from the study after V4. Patients unable to provide a stool sample at clinic visits were offered a stool collection kit for home, with instructions to refrigerate and return the sample to the clinic as soon as possible. Stool samples were separated into 2-mL aliquots in polypropylene cryovials and stored at \u2264 \u201320\u00b0C at the clinic site. Samples were shipped on dry ice for long-term storage at \u2264 \u201370\u00b0C.\n",

Sequencing of the variable 4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using the HiSeq 2500 System (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). The sequencing strategy utilised a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon of 286 base pairs (bp) generated using forward primer F515 (5'-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3') and reverse primer R806 (5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3'). The sequence length on each read was approximately 120\u00a0bp from both directions, producing reads that generally did not overlap. Moreover, the strategy utilised an initial PCR reaction followed by ligation of the Illumina primers. Therefore, the 5'- orientation of the DNA sequences in the forward and reverse reads are mixed in the dataset.",

The analysis strategy had several advantages: (1) it guarded against low sequence quality, chimeras, and non-microbial contamination because if there was a high rate of error from these sources, one would not expect the RDP algorithm to consistently agree for both non-overlapping paired ends; (2) it included only taxa on which a consistent call is generated from the RDP algorithm for both paired-end sequences despite 16S reads that generally do not overlap; the results, therefore, would be robust and not dependent on sequencing a particular sub-region of the variable 4 region; (3) it was computationally attractive despite the large number of sequences generated because the RDP algorithm is both fast and easy to make parallel; and (4) it was insensitive to the fact that orientations in both directions were present in the sequences.",

In general, algorithms have not been developed to perform detailed phylogenetic analyses on non-continuous 16S rRNA sequences in both orientations. Therefore, the analysis was restricted to reads in which both the forward and backwards reads agreed. No other quality score filtering was performed. Because quality score filtering can be described as a \u201ccompromise between quantitative accuracy and error rates,\u201d38 and the taxa impacted by rifaximin were generally low in relative abundance, the existence of similar classification on non-overlapping reads was deemed to be a sufficient guard against sequencing error. Below the family level, agreement between the 2 reads decreased: there were \u223c 18% fewer assignments in which the 2 reads agreed at the genus level when compared with the family level. Therefore, analyses are reported in this manuscript at the family level, although an analysis at the genus level yielded substantially similar results, with 25 taxa different between the V3 and V4 time points at a 10% false discovery rate (FDR; Supplementary Table S2).

All significant taxa were lower following rifaximin treatment, consistent with rifaximin having a small effect on depressing multiple microbial taxa. However, the effects of rifaximin were highly modest; none of the significantly different taxa changed by more than 2.5-fold between V3 and V4 time points (Supplementary Table S4), and no effect size of the association with rifaximin treatment was greater than 4% (Supplementary Table S5). An alternative analysis path, based on DADA 2 clustering on rarefied data (Figure S4; methods described in the Supplementary Material), failed to find any significant OTU differences between the V3 and V4 time points, perhaps reflecting the possible loss of power that is common when rarefication has been utilised.40 Moreover, the choice of log-transforming the data prior to performing the paired Wilcoxon test also modestly impacts the data; performing the paired test on log-transformed data yields 7 significantly different taxa between V3 and V4 (Figure 3A; Supplementary Table S6), while performing the test on non-log transformed data yields an additional 4 significant taxa (Supplementary Table S3). These results demonstrate that the findings of an association between rifaximin and the microbial community are small enough that their statistical significance is dependent on the exact analysis path chosen. These findings of the dependence of statistical significance on details of the analysis path emphasise the modest effect that rifaximin treatment has on the microbial community when compared with the stronger tendency of the microbial community to be stable over time within individuals. No significant changes were seen by the paired Wilcoxon test between the V3 and V11 (end of study) timepoints, indicating that the effects of rifaximin were transient.",

Simulations were conducted in which different numbers of patients were subsampled (without replacement) and compared at V3 and V4. In these simulations, to maximise the power with small sample sizes, a paired t-test instead of the paired Wilcoxon test was used. At each sample size, the paired t-test was repeated 50\u00a0times to determine the number of taxa depressed (Figure 4A, black) or enhanced (Figure 4A, red) with rifaximin treatment. These simulations revealed the likelihood that no differences between V3 and V4 would be observed with a sample size < 20 patients. Even with \u223c 40 patients, some of the 50 permutations revealed no significant differences. The number of taxa that are depressed in association with rifaximin treatment appeared to saturate at \u223c 85 patients. There were, however, apparent plateaus between 60 and 65 patients and between 70 and 80 patients, but additional taxa were still found at the larger sample size. One cannot, therefore, be certain that if substantially more patients were included, some of the taxa that trended downward (Figure 3A) might not have been found significant at a 10% FDR threshold. By contrast, there appeared to be, on average, \u223c1 taxon that was significantly increased at the end of the study across permutations, although nearly the entire cohort of \u223c 90 to 95 patients was needed to reliably observe at least one significantly changed taxon, indicating that the effect size associated with this enhancement was modest.\n",

Paired stool samples were obtained at V6 and V7 from patients receiving rifaximin and placebo (34 patients each). Given our power estimates (Figure 4), the expectation might be that this sample size may not have significant differences between rifaximin and placebo; indeed, no significant differences were observed between V6 and V7 time points for rifaximin at a 10% FDR (Supplementary Table S5). However, at a simple uncorrected threshold value of p < 0.05, 7 taxa differed significantly between V6 and V7, including Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae. If an analysis is generated that is constrained to only the 33 patients who received 2 double-blind rifaximin treatments and for which we have sequences for both V3\u2013V4 and V6\u2013V7 time points (Figure 5A), it is noted that the p values are not substantially smaller for the second rifaximin treatment and there is one taxa (Clostridiaceae.1), that is significant at the uncorrected threshold of p < 0.05 for both time points. As may be expected, there is very little agreement between changes in the V3\u2013V4 rifaximin phase and the V6\u2013V7 placebo phase in a similar analysis performed on the 30 patients in the placebo group, for which there are sequences for the V3, V4, V6, and V7 time points (Figure 5B). While limited by the small sample size in the double-blind phase, these results are consistent with a model in which there is not a large increase in effect size during repeat rifaximin treatment in the double-blind phase.\n",

The power simulations suggest that some changes observed in bacterial taxa in response to rifaximin over time with a large patient population would be missed with a smaller sample size or less sequencing depth. Based on the power simulation, there would be little value in measuring the microbial community for rifaximin in clinical trials with \u223c 70 patients or fewer. This study is the first to measure the response of the microbial community to rifaximin over multiple treatments. Data were consistent across the 2 study phases, with rifaximin open-label treatment and double-blind retreatment demonstrating approximately the same magnitude of effect on the faecal microbial community, suggesting that multiple treatments may not enhance the modest effect of rifaximin on the microbial community, although the sample size for V6 and V7 may limit the power to detect changes during the retreatment phase. Finally, results indicate that time alone had no apparent effect on the faecal microbial community as comparisons of V3 versus V11 and V6 versus V7 time points were mostly negative.",

Future studies that utilize this method will allow for functional assignments of gene families in the gut microbial community, as well as the potential for strain-level taxonomic resolution.45 Lastly, the findings of this study were limited to rifaximin use in patients with IBS-D, and lack of a non-IBS control group limits the ability to determine which members of the microbial community are associated with IBS symptoms. Future studies that mechanistically link individual taxa directly to IBS may allow for evaluation of the hypothesis that the taxa that change in response to rifaximin treatment are the cause of rifaximin's beneficial effects.",
