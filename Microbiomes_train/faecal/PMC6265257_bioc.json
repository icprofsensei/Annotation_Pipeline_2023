In this study, to increase our understanding of the potential cause of the high rate of infection in postsplenectomy patients, we evaluated the differences in the gut microbiota and plasma lipopolysaccharide level of patients after splenectomy relative to those of healthy controls. Thirty-two patients having undergone splenectomy and 42 healthy individuals were enrolled into the splenectomy (SP) and healthy control (HC) groups, respectively. The SP group was subdivided into three subgroups according to the length of their postoperative time. Fecal samples were used for gut microbiota analysis via 16s rRNA gene sequencing, blood examinations and plasma lipopolysaccharide measurements were also taken. Significant differences were observed in gut microbiota composition with regard to the relative bacterial abundances of 2 phyla, 7 families, and 15 genera. The lipopolysaccharide level was significantly higher in the SP group than in the HC group and were negatively associated with five bacterial families with low abundance in the SP group. The degree of the microbiota alteration increased with the length of the postoperative time. The PICRUSt analysis showed that the relative abundances of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathways were higher in the SP group and were positively associated with the plasma lipopolysaccharide level. Significant alterations were observed in the gut microbiota of the splenectomized patients and were associated with plasma lipopolysaccharide level. Further studies are needed to verify whether such alterations after splenectomy are related to an increased risk of complications.",

In each case, the risks are weighed against the potential benefits1. However, as many as 30% of patients with spleen injury undergo total splenectomy due to the severity of the injury or technical limitations2. An infection rate of 3.2% with a mortality of 1.3% has been reported in splenectomized patients3. Furthermore, overwhelming postsplenectomy infections, the most considered complication, have been reported to be a long-term major risk for patients after splenectomy1. Overwhelming postsplenectomy infections were first reported by King and Schumacker4. These infections include fulminating sepsis, meningitis, or pneumonia in splenectomized and hyposplenic individuals and are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type B5.",

It has been hypothesized that most plasma LPS is derived from the gut, since the gut microbiota is the biggest source of gram-negative bacteria in the body8. In addition, a high-fat western diet and dietary fiber have an effect on intestinal permeability, which can promote and inhibit the translocation of LPS into the blood, respectively9\u201311.",

At the family level, the relative abundances of eight families were observed to be significantly altered, with six families having higher relative abundances in the HC group compared to the SP group (Fig.\u00a02B). Genera with more than 0.1% richness from the splenectomy patients and healthy control were used for the differential analysis. Twenty bacterial genera that displayed different abundances between the SP and HC individuals were observed. Four genera had a higher relative abundance in the SP group, while the 16 other genera had significantly higher relative abundances in the HC group (Pfdr\u2009<\u20090.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fig.\u00a02B).

The results were visualized by Heatmap. Plasma LPS was observed to be negatively associated with five of the eight bacterial families (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Spearman\u2019s rank test, Fig.\u00a04C).

The spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ that can supply the intestine with immune cells, promote the immune response against invading pathogens and maintain gut microbiota homeostasis. Several studies have shown that the spleen contributes to the mucosal immune response in the gut25,26, as there is a \u201chighway\u201d between the human splenic and gut mucosal marginal zones27. The sIgA film that lines the intestinal epithelium, which plays a role in regulating the commensal microflora and in preventing pathogen invasion, is derived from B-1a cells that differentiate from lineage-negative precursor cells that are present exclusively in the spleen28,29. Thus, there is reason to believe that the abnormal gut mucosal immune microenvironment of patients without a spleen cannot maintain the normal gut microbiota.",

These results indicate that infectious and antibiotic application history of patients were not the factor associated with microbiota composition in this study. A study observed that the degree of microbial dysbiosis increases with age and fuels inflammation30. However, in the present study, the CCA showed that age was not associated with microbiota composition. The small age range of participants in this study may have given rise to this inconsistent result. The plasma LPS and CRP levels and the WBC count and LYMPH# showed notable correlations with the microbiota composition, indicating a relationship between the gut microbiota and low-grade, chronic inflammation.",

The relative abundance of gram-negative bacteria accounted for 15.40% of the bacterial abundance in the HC group, but up to 39.77% in the SP group. Furthermore, the predicted microbiota functions determined by the KEGG pathway analysis indicated a positive correlation between the two enriched pathways (lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein) and plasma LPS in the patients. This result supports the hypothesis that the altered gut microbiota in the splenectomized patients may have led to active LPS metabolism in the gut, resulting in the subsequent translocation of the LPS across the intestinal barrier and its mildly increased concentration in blood. Taken together, these results suggest that the gut microbiota may contribute to high plasma LPS in patients after splenectomy.",

A mild increase in plasma LPS level and low-grade, chronic inflammation was also observed in noncommunicable diseases, such as type II diabetes33, atherosclerosis34, chronic fatigue syndrome35 and depression36. The elevated plasma LPS level observed in splenectomized patients persists in the long term, which can lead to a state of low-grade, chronic inflammation that alters the innate immune environment, which may lead to a high risk of infection and chronic diseases. A study of an Italian cohort observed that compared with subjects with a plasma LPS level of <250 EU/mL, those with higher level had a threefold increased risk of atherosclerosis, especially smokers37. In the present study, nine patients reached a plasma LPS level of 50\u2009pg/mL.

In a study by Kalambokis and Tsiano39, the antibiotic rifaximin reduced endotoxemia and improved liver function. However, the results of recent studies have shown that dietary fiber and prebiotics/probiotics can be used to improve intestinal integrity and reduce signs of endotoxemia in mice10,11,40,41.

First, because an investigation of the gut barrier function was not included, it is unknown whether the altered gut microbiota leads to an injury of the gut barrier that ultimately causes the observed endotoxemia. Second, the results of a cross-sectional study can be affected by individual differences in gut microbiota, which could be addressed by performing additional studies with more participants. Lastly, the follow-up time used in this study was not long enough to reveal if the altered microbiota and high plasma LPS level are associated with the high infection rate and chronic disease occurrence in splenectomized patients.",

Cluster analysis was preceded by PCoA, which was performed to reduce the dimension of the original variables, using the FactoMineR and ggplot2 packages in R. PERMANOVA of the distance matrices, as implemented in the vegan package in R, was used to identify whether the case/control status explained the significant variation in microbial community composition. The microbiota features differentiating the fecal microbiota were characterized using the linear discriminant analysis LEfSe method for biomarker discovery, which emphasizes both significance and biological relevance. Based on a normalized relative abundance matrix, LEfSe uses the Kruskal\u2212Wallis rank sum test to detect features with significantly different abundance levels between assigned taxa and performs an LDA to estimate the size of the effect for each feature42. CCA and RDA were performed using the Multivariate Statistical Package (Kovach, Wales, UK) using normalized environmental variables were normalized. Spearman\u2019s rank test was used for the environmental parameter correlation analysis of bacterial taxa. A heatmap was generated to present the results using the pheatmap package in R.
