Although the majority of studies have assessed gut microbial diversity through analysis of faecal samples, their ability to reflect microbial diversity at the mucosal surface is inadequate [21\u201323]. Mucosal biopsies display greater microbial diversity than faecal samples [24] as well as taxonomic and phylogenetic differences [25] and contrasting dominant bacterial populations [22]. Colonic mucosal biopsies have always been regarded as the sampling gold standard, but there is a limit to how this approach could cope with the competing demands for different starting material (DNA, RNA and proteins) required for modern multi-omic technologies.",

We collected paired sigmoid colonic mucosal biopsies and lavage samples from patients attending for colonoscopy and performed a comprehensive assessment of microbial diversity using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing. Our data indicate that colonic lavage samples yield significantly higher amounts of DNA whilst also containing higher microbial counts compared to corresponding biopsy samples although diversity and evenness are similar. Differences between sample types were driven by a limited number of OTUs, which were generally over-represented in biopsies and absent or in lower relative abundance in colonic lavage samples. This difference in diversity corresponded with limited differences in the predicted functional profile highlighting that colonic lavage could be considered for colonic microbial diversity studies where multiple omic analyses are required as colonic lavage samples are not as limited as mucosal biopsies.",

Some paired subject samples (Bx and CL) did cluster together with regards to OTU richness and OTU community structure (Fig.\u00a04a, b). However, the distances between biopsy and lavage samples were still quite large especially for the Jaccard distances (Fig.\u00a04a). The PCoA plot for Jaccard distances does however demonstrate that the relative direction between the lavage and biopsy sample from the same subject was similar. This may indicate that specific OTUs are shared by the biopsy samples that are not present in lavage samples and vice versa. The picture was less clear with the PCoA plot for Yue & Clayton with no strong clustering by individuals or sample type (Fig.\u00a04b). There appears to be no pattern of shift from the colonic lavage and biopsy samples from the same individual. Consistent with these findings, an AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance) test on the Jaccard dissimilarity matrices indicated that sample type contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the samples (AMOVA p\u2009=\u20090.001).\n",

The Jaccard paired distances of biopsy and lavage samples within participants were relatively high and similar to the other comparisons (Fig.\u00a04c). The Yue & Clayton paired distances of biopsy and lavage samples within participants were very varied with relatively low values for the 25th and 75th percentiles, ~0.5 and ~0.8 (Fig.\u00a04d). This shows that some of the Bx and CL paired samples of certain participants had more similar communities than within other participants. Overall, these results indicate that intra-participant (within) OTU richness similarities are not much greater compared to that of intra-participant (between) samples. However, community structure similarities are much higher for the inter-participant samples than that of intra-participant samples.",

These analyses showed that 12 OTUs were present within the biopsy samples that are either not present or in much lower amounts in the lavage samples (Fig.\u00a06a; Additional file 7: Table S2). A further 3 OTUs were present in higher amounts in the lavage samples compared to biopsy samples. Collectively, these 15 OTUs constituted 1.36% of the sequences derived (Table \u200b(Table3).3). A number of these OTUs represent bacterial species that have been identified as contaminating sequences in previous PCR-based sequencing studies [26]. Streptococcus, Propionibacterium, Acinetobacter and Comamonas were all reported to be potentially contaminants with Streptococcus and Propionibacterium being common human skin-associated organisms and were in higher relative abundance in biopsy samples compared to that of lavage samples. Hierarchical clustering based on these 15 OTUs demonstrated robust separation by individual subjects in 20/23 cases (87%; Fig.\u00a06b). Many of the clusters were highly supported by the data with 14 of the CL samples and 9 of the Bx samples within highly supported clusters (AU p value\u2009>\u200995) that separate the majority of Bx and CL samples and all other AU p values ranging from 68 to 95 (Additional file 6: Fig. S4b).\n",

We comprehensively examined microbial composition and predicted function of patient matched colonic biopsies and lavage samples within 23 individuals. All samples were collected from subjects who had undergone bowel preparation, which may alter microbial alpha and beta diversity [30\u201332]. However, we reason that all patients were subjected to the same bowel cleansing regime therefore were subjected to the same introduced bias. Patients received bowel preparation the day before the procedure in the form of Picolax. This laxative has two ingredients: sodium picosulfate and magnesium citrate. The former is a stimulant laxative and the latter is an osmotic laxative. The preparation comes in powder form which is reconstituted in 150\u00a0ml of cold water before ingestion, and the usual dose is two sachets taken 6\u00a0h apart the day prior to the colonoscopy. The patients are encouraged to drink as much clear fluids as possible on the day prior to the procedure to flush the bowel out. Patients were not asked to collect this material as it is impractical, unpleasant and logistically challenging, although this has been done in previous studies, e.g. Jalanka et al. [33], using a different laxative (Moviprep). As the colon is a large and capacious tube, it can never be completely evacuated and inevitably some liquid remains in the bowel. The remaining liquid is therefore bathing the colonic mucosa and tends to shift naturally around the bowel with the aid of peristalsis and the constant changes in the movement and posture of the subject (e.g. supine vs recumbent or semi-recumbent positions). This lavage fluid is often encountered at the time of colonoscopy and is very easy to aspirate through a suction channel in the colonoscope and directly into a collecting tube. Both biopsies and colonic lavage samples were collected simultaneously, lavage followed by biopsy, therefore observed relationships are representative of accurate comparisons between sample types and most likely reflect the scope of the majority of such samples available for collection for research studies.",

The findings of the current study are most relevant to the type of bowel preparation that we used, i.e. Picolax and it is unknown whether other types of bowel preparation would produce different results. It is likely that specific species/taxa will be affected by the bowel prep itself. These questions should be answered in a subsequent study designed to compare the effects of different types of bowel preparation on the gut microbiota. In the current study, our primary focus was on using colonic lavage as a proxy for endoscopic colonic biopsies and as such we sought to reduce potential variation by sticking with one type of bowel preparation.",

This approach would provide unequivocal comparison of the effectiveness of the various sample types available. However, logistically such a study will be extremely challenging to conduct. A recent study looked at microbial changes caused by bowel prep in both healthy subjects and patients with IBD. Biopsy and faecal samples were collected pre and post bowel prep but longitudinal faecal follow up was not undertaken. The study demonstrated that bowel prep affected the composition and diversity of the microbiota in the short term differently between sample types with differences also noted between controls and IBD patients. Biopsies from healthy subjects showed greater changes due to bowel prep compared to IBD patients [40].",

This is in contrast to previous studies that have assessed the suitability of faecal samples as an alternative to biopsies for defining microbial diversity at the mucosal surface and have demonstrated significant differences [21\u201325, 41, 42]. The fact that PICRUSt analysis did not demonstrate differences between (a) biopsy and colonic lavage samples or (b) between patients, potentially highlights the limitation of predicting metabolic functions rather than utilising the more costing metagenomic sequencing option. This lack of difference could be a limitation of PICRUSt due to information only being available on a relatively limited number of species or that sample types did have similar metabolic functions. Unfortunately, until metagenomics become more affordable for such studies, inferred metabolic function will remain a favourable analysis strategy.",

Within our study, colonic mucosal biopsies were low biomass samples and therefore more likely to be influenced by contaminating bacteria from laboratory reagents [26]. In attempt to control this, we processed and sequenced negative controls as well as PCR processing samples in a random order to ensure avoiding creating false patterns. Biopsies and colonic lavage samples were also extracted using the same DNA extraction kit batches to reduce potential contamination. On this basis, although there is the possibility that these 14 differentially expressed OTUs could be experimentally introduced contaminants, consideration should also be given to biological plausibility of some sequences [43]. The various Firmicutes species that are routinely detected in gut microbiota studies including Blautia and Lachnospraceae sequences potentially demonstrate species that have a higher propensity for attachment to the colonic mucosa and therefore a biologically plausible justification is available. Other less common species including Comomonadaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Propionibacteriaceae are more challenging to explain and have actually been highlighted to be associated with Qiagen DNA extraction kits [26]. Thirty-four out of the 277 genera in our analysed dataset were classified as possible contaminant genera, consisting of 0.94% of the total analysed sequences. This small amount indicates that contamination is not a significant issue within biopsy or lavage samples. However, higher presence of these potential contaminants was detected within biopsy samples, this indicates lavage samples are less affected by contamination, most likely due to the larger biomass available.",

Our data demonstrates that at least for studies assessing the gut microbiome in prepped patient samples, colonic lavage provides a comparable sample type in terms of gut microbiota community structure but also yields significantly higher amounts of material for multiple analyses. It is appreciated that faecal sample collection still offers the benefit of participants not needing to have a colonoscopy to provide samples and therefore attracting large sample size is not an issue. However, there remains the issue of ensuring faecal sample collection approaches effectively retain microbial community structure through collection and processing which is always challenging in patient-led sample collection. Colonic lavage offers the benefit of sample size that faecal samples provide but from a controllable collection protocol.",

Community structures were compared using PCoA plots generated using the Jaccard and Yue & Clayton distance metrics. PCoA plots were compared with AMOVA within mothur. LefSe was carried on an OTU table subsampled to 11000 sequences per community within mothur [28]. Subsequent statistical analysis was done in R 3.2.2 [49].\n",

The extent of microbiota predicted functional differences between sample types were measured using (A) KEGG pathway abundance and (B) Alpha diversity scores. Alpha diversity scores calculated by subsampling samples to 500000 KEGG orthologs with 1000 iterations. Each point represents the diversity score for a patient sample. Error bars represent SEM. Between-group variations were measured using Mann-Whitney U test. P values of Mann-Whitney U test for each alpha diversity measure are below the relevant facet, (C) LEfSe LDA scores. (PDF 288 kb)",
