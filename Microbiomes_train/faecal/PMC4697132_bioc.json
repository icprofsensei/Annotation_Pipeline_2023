A gut microbiota, characteristic of Crohn's disease (CD), has been repeatedly described (2, 3). Although much progress has been made in understanding interactions between the gut microbiota and intestinal immune system and their involvement CD etiology (4), it remains unclear whether changes in microbiota precede or follow CD onset. Thus far, all studies exploring the colonic microenvironment of CD patients have been of cross-sectional and hence unable to address reverse causality (2, 3). Assessing, during the course of disease modifying treatment, serial changes in the gut microbiota, particularly organisms associated with colonic inflammation, will offer better insights into the role of gut bacteria or their products in the etiology of CD. Such a study has not been performed before.",

We have recently shown that EEN treatment in children with active CD induced reduction in numbers of presumptively protective gut bacterial species (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and metabolites (e.g., butyrate) that were paradoxically associated with disease improvement (6). These intriguing observations in conjunction with the simple nutrient and food ingredients of EEN make it plausible to speculate that EEN works by modulating the gut microbiota. Assessing changes in the gut microbiota during a course of EEN can offer clues to which bacteria and/or their metabolites may be implicated in the etiology of CD.",

Forty-four oligotypes (47%) differed significantly between the two groups. The 20 most significant oligotypes are in Supplementary Table 3. The findings of this high-resolution analysis were consistent with those observed through the genera and OTU assignments. Oligotypes classified as E. rectale and Roseburia inulinivorans were more abundant in controls, whereas R. gnavus and Clostridium clostridioformes were associated with CD.",

When genus diversity was regressed against days on EEN, using subject-dependent linear regression, to overcome any confounding effects of the time of sample collection during EEN, we found (Supplementary Figure S2) that every 10 days on EEN 0.6 genus diversity equivalents are lost (coeff (SE): \u22120.06 (0.012); P=2.36 \u00d7 10\u22125).

Indeed, of 34 genera that significantly changed, only one, Lactococcus, increased with EEN (Table 2). Interestingly, some of the most negatively impacted genera were those whose abundance was already lower in CD children, before EEN initiation, than controls (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium). A similar impact was observed in OTU analysis (Supplementary Table S5), with a large number of OTUs decreasing during EEN. For example, OTU3, assigned to Bifidobacterium, decreased in some children by two logs of relative abundance (Figure 3), whereas OTU4, assigned to R. gnavus, increased in most subjects during EEN (Figure 3). Oligotyping of Lachnospiraceae confirmed these patterns, with all oligotypes significantly decreasing in abundance during EEN including oligotypes that were significantly higher or lower in CD (Supplementary Table S6).",

Twenty-six genera significantly correlated with calprotectin in CD children (Supplementary Table S7); both strong positive and negative associations were found. Performing stepwise regression analysis, minimizing the overall model Akaike Information Criterion, to determine which associations were most important accounting for correlations between genera, seven of 14 genera were selected (Supplementary Table S8). The relative abundance of three selected genera was negatively associated with calprotectin (Anaerostipes, Coprococcus, and unknown Erysipelotrichaceae). Four were positively associated (Bacteroides, Gemella, Haemophilus, and Atopobium). Overall, the final model explained a remarkable 69% of the variation in fecal calprotectin concentration (Supplementary Table S8). A higher number of 35 OTUs significantly correlated (Supplementary Table S9) with calprotectin, and 14 of these were selected by stepwise regression (Supplementary Table S10). The final model predicted 78% of the variation in calprotectin levels among CD children. Among those OTUs that were most significantly positively associated with fecal calprotectin were OTU122 (Atopobium), OTU1073 (Lachnospiraceae), OTU45 (Streptococcus), OTU1086 (Peptostreptococcus), and OTU41 (Bacteroides). There were a number of OTUs negatively associated with calprotectin including OTU3 (Bifidobacterium), OTU21 (Lachnospiraceae), and OTU106 (Anaerostipes). Using oligotyping, no significant correlations were found between oligotypes and calprotectin, after correcting for multiple comparisons.",

Although a mean increase in relative abundance of several taxa was observed as CD children returned to habitual diet, these changes were not statistically significant. Those OTUs associated with fecal calprotectin (Supplementary Table S10) showed no significant change, but it is interesting to note that those negatively associated with calprotectin did increase in abundance, whereas those positively associated in general remained low at return to the habitual diet in unadjusted analysis (Supplementary Table S13).",

The gut microbiota of CD children presented lower taxonomic diversity per individual but higher variation between individuals perhaps attributed to variations in disease behavior, location, or inflammation severity. Shotgun metagenome analysis revealed, for the first time, that despite lower taxonomic bacterial diversity a higher level of genetic functional diversity was associated with the CD microbiota prior to EEN treatment. This probably reflects a greater range of functional roles that can be exploited by the gut microbiota in inflamed gut, in active disease. This diverse microbial functional capacity tended to decrease during EEN to levels similar to healthy controls. These data suggest a higher degree of functional redundancy, with multiple species performing similar roles in healthy children, and may be important in maintaining gut health. In active CD, this functional redundancy may be lost and then restored during EEN.",

Several of these findings concur with previous work (2, 3, 6), but here the methodology employed is not only hypothesis-free, unselective of certain taxa, but also more comprehensive, detailing bacterial taxonomy down to species, OTU, and oligotype levels. Numerous OTUs and species were less abundant in CD children, including classic commensals such as Faecalibacterium spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., but also a number of organisms that receive less attention, such as Eubacterium rectale and R. obeum. Conversely, some bacteria were more prevalent in CD, including E. coli/Shigella spp., Streptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Atopobium spp. More interestingly, several of these differences were not uniform or of the same direction within a genus, but varied between species and OTUs, which emphasizes the importance and need for an in-depth microbiota analysis when the role of the gut microbiota is explored. For example, R. gnavus was higher, but Ruminococcus obeum was lower in CD.",

Their importance and the relevance of these findings can be further unraveled only if these taxa are related to clinical outcomes, colonic inflammation, or changed during the course of disease modifying interventions. In the current study, correlations between fecal calprotectin, global fecal microbial composition, and genetic functional capacity were explored. Several taxa, which were different between CD and controls, did not associate with calprotectin and may have a less protagonist role in the etiology of CD. Instead, we found several other that did associate with calprotectin, negatively and positively. A subset of taxa was identified explaining a sizable amount of the variation in fecal calprotectin. Among them, OTU3 (Bifidobacterium spp.) had the strongest negative and OTU122 (Atopobium spp.) the strongest positive association with calprotectin in multivariate regression analysis.",

This is a paradox, as we would expect EEN treatment to normalize the perceived \u201cdysbiotic\u201d microbiota toward a healthier state. Instead, EEN treatment shifted the microbiota to a more \u201cdysbiotic\u201d state, with a greater NMDS distance from the healthy group compared with samples before EEN (Figure 1). Moreover, EEN caused reduction in the relative abundance of gut bacteria that were negatively associated with calprotectin, as well as those that correlated positively with it. Among these, OTU122 (Atopobium) was strongly negatively associated with the number of EEN days, but the commensal strain Bifidobacterium OTU3 was even more strongly negatively impacted. The particular Atopobium OTU identified, OTU122, has 99% identity in the V4 region with Atopobium parvulum, which is associated with halitosis (11), and has been associated with disease activity in pediatric CD (12) and hence is a good candidate for further research.",

The E. coli population is of particular interest, as adherent invasive E. coli are overrepresented in CD patients (13). Moreover, the higher representation of KEGG modules coding for ubiquinone in CD children, before EEN, coincides with this observation of a higher relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. Ubiquinone is produced only by organisms capable of aerobic respiration, its main role is maintaining membrane stability by acting as a crucial membrane chain-terminating antioxidant. In nematodes (14), ubiquinone-deficient E. coli strains were more efficiently lysed in the pharynx or the intestine than their wild-type counterparts. Therefore, ubiquinone or bacterial respiration may act as virulence factors, allowing bacteria to colonize and harm the host. Overrepresentation of ubiquinone also fits with previous work (15). Likewise, other KEGG modules that were in higher abundance in CD, such as secretion and (Tat) systems, or module encoding for LPS synthesis, may be linked with overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae or other pathobionts in CD.",

This may be indicative of the reduction in bacteria that bear genes encoding for these vitamins during EEN, such as bifidobacteria and E. coli spp., or changes in the synthesis of short or medium-chain fatty acids that requires these vitamins. Alternatively, supply of these vitamins through EEN may induce bacterial redundancy or indolence to produce them. In contrast, genes encoding for aromatic amino acid metabolism and transport of spermidine/putrescine, which have a major role in cell growth, and may indicate increased epithelial cell renewal and tissue healing (16), were overrepresented during EEN. Against expectations, no association between KEGG modules and calprotectin was found in CD. This probably reflects the lack of level in detail of currently available metabolic databases to resolve the key processes by which organisms impact the gut epithelium and that taxonomy serves as a better proxy to functional role.",

Intervention studies are required with the aim of elucidating whether maintenance of such changes, following a successful course of EEN, can prolong disease remission and whether replication of such changes occur with other types of formula and dietary intervention. Once this is proven, a plausible mechanism of action for EEN, mediated by modulation of the gut microbiota, could be suggested. Conversely, these changes are likely to be direct consequences of a diet low in fiber, rich in protein, fat, simple sugars and micronutrients, modulating various microbial communities, bacterial pathways, and metabolite production. Whether the clinical efficacy of EEN could be enhanced by selectively tailoring its composition to stimulate the growth of beneficial microbes, suppressed during EEN, is also an intriguing concept to explore. Moreover, the very distinct CD microbiome we observed in this study may hold implications for improvement in diagnostic and prognostic classification of the disease, particularly in conjunction with other established disease biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin.",

We performed analysis in feces, enabling a non-invasive collection of serial samples, but results may differ from mucosal adherent bacteria. Despite correcting for multiple testing, our participant's sample size was modest, and this study may be underpowered to explore secondary outcomes such as associations between disease location and behavior with microbiota characteristics. Also, as a community expresses only a variable subset of its genome, at any time, metatranscriptomic and metabolomic data are required to complement and progress this work further. Some patients were on concomitant treatment, and there was a modest age difference between controls and CD children. However, any effect was minimal with the changes demonstrated driven predominantly by EEN or differences according to grouping (CD vs. Healthy) on community structure. This reconfirms evidence that diet is a strong determinant of the microbial microenvironment (17). Although PCDAI and CRP were highly correlated with fecal calprotectin (r=0.60; P=7.924 \u00d7 10\u221206 and r=0.42; P=4.644 \u00d7 10\u221203), we preferred to use and present data only for the latter, an observer-independent and reliable marker of colonic inflammation, as this study aimed specifically to associate a direct marker of colonic inflammation with microbiota composition and functional capacity measured in the same fecal sample. Moreover, preliminary analysis showed that fecal calprotectin was a better predictor of community structure explaining 10.5% of the variation in genus relative abundances across these samples compared with 9.3% and 3.5% for the PCDAI scores and CRP values, respectively.",
