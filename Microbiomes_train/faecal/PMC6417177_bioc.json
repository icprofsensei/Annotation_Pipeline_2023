Thus, gut commensals can synthesize vitamin K2 as well as the water-soluble B-vitamins, such as biotin, cobalamin, folic acid, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, riboflavin and thiamine [1\u20134]. Microbial species that can synthesize vitamins de novo are known as vitamin prototrophs, and species that lack biosynthetic pathways and rely on exogenous sources are known as vitamin auxotrophs. Dietary vitamins are absorbed in the small intestine, whereas most of the microbe-mediated vitamin production takes place in the large intestine and hereby produced vitamins can eventually be absorbed by the host via specialized carrier-mediated systems, except for cobalamin [2, 5]. As the process of vitamin absorption has evolved to take place at different spatial sites, it would be reasonable to expect that there is no competition for dietary vitamins between vitamin consumers and vitamin uptake transporters in the colon and the small intestine, respectively.",

In Fig.\u00a03, we show how vitamin metabolic genes are prevalent across different phyla, which might suggest vitamin metabolism being as a part of core function in gut microbial metabolic modules. Additional file 2: Figure S1 shows a network of associations between species with mapped vitamin-related gene and its corresponding phylum. This figure\u00a0reveals that the\u00a0vitamin related pathways are mostly found in the phylum Firmicutes with about 49%, followed by Proteobacteria with about 19%, Bacteroidetes with about 14% and Actinobacteria with about 13%. Additional file 3: Figure S2 shows a network of associations between vitamin biosynthetic capabilities and phylum with species information. For every vitamin type, the number of species having prevalence of a biosynthetic pathway seemed to be higher than that of species with transporter mechanisms. Among the various vitamin transporters, species encoding thiamine transporter dominated in contrast to folate transporter being the lowest in number. However, from Additional file 3: Figure S2, it also becomes apparent that there are three types of species that differ with respect to functional characteristics related to vitamin metabolism, i.e. vitamin genes related to biosynthesis or transporters or both. Based on this, we categorized 171 microbial species as Producer (P), Consumer (C) and Producer-Consumer (Dual) for three specific vitamins (biotin, cobalamin, and thiamine) in the following analysis.",

Based on the presence or absence of genes encoding proteins required in vitamin biosynthetic pathways or transporter mechanisms or both, each microbial species was assigned as either vitamin prototrophs (producers) or vitamin consumers (consumers) or producer-consumer (dual) respectively for every vitamin type. Therefore, to estimate interactions between vitamin prototrophs and consumers, we performed a correlational analysis between species with all possible phenotypes. Of total 7021 possible pairs of species combinations (171 species (675 strains) considered), 2030 (i.e. 28.9%) and 590 (i.e. 8%) were significantly positive and negative correlated, respectively (Mann\u2013Whitney test, p\u00a0<\u20090.01). Among the positive correlations, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.7, we observed that a pair of species originating from the same phylum could coexist, probably due to their evolutionary similarities. However, we also observed a similar level of coexistence for a pair of species originating from different phyla. For example, species from two different phyla, Lactobacillus acidophilus (Firmicutes) and Citrobacter koseri (Proteobacteria) had a high and positive correlation coefficient r\u2009=\u20090.81.",

Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that species with dual functional traits (i.e. containing genes for both biosynthesis and transport of the same vitamin) contributed to a notable fraction of positive correlations among the possible phenotypes (Additional file 4: Figure S3). On the other hand, the co-occurrence of species with single phenotype (i.e., either producer/P or consumer/C) and dual phenotypes belonged to both positive and negative correlations. These observations hint that the species with dual phenotypes could drive stronger relationships than the ones with either limited or less functional traits. It is well-known, that communities of species with multiple functional features respond well to changes in the environment, thereby influencing the net outcome of a community assembly [21\u201323]",

As depicted in Additional file 5: Figure S4, riboflavin seems to be well represented and conserved among all species across all the four cohorts regardless of the health status. This conservation could also be due to the limited number of reactions involved in riboflavin pathway compared to other pathways. Contrarily, menaquinone or vitamin K2, has the least number of species with its biosynthesis pathway present. Perhaps, human microbiome might have evolved to have a reduced dependence of menaquinone production from the gut microbiota as proposed earlier [24]. In case of folate, the majority of the reactions involved in its biosynthesis were observed to be present except for four reactions which concerned interconversions of tetrahydrofolate, dihydrofolate, and folate using NADH or NADPH as cofactors and one ATP-forming reaction carried out by folylpolyglutamate synthase enzyme. Biotin and thiamine appeared to be vitamins with a major part of their biosynthetic reactions with their annotations missing. These are related to fatty acid metabolism and the upstream part of the biotin synthesis pathway provides a long-chain acyl as the starting point for the biosynthesis. In case of thiamine, three phosphatase reactions involving interconversion of thiamine monophosphate, \u2212diphosphate, \u2212triphosphate and thiamine were absent. For the rest of the vitamins, the incompleteness of their biosynthesis pathway was observed for many species, which is in line with previous studies as it has been suggested that vitamin biosynthesis could be carried out as complementary tasks between several bacteria, each harboring a part of the pathway [25].",

It is also to be noted that species from genera Bacteroides, namely B. uniformis, B. stercoris, B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, and B. caccae are among the most abundant species with relatively high coverage of biosynthetic capabilities for all vitamins.

We found that the abundance of biotin-dependent enzymes had an inreverse pattern to that of their biosynthesis level, whereas, thiamine utilization potential as well as its biosynthetic potential were less abundant in IBD subjects when compared to the healthy controls (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5b)5b) (Mann\u2013Whitney test, p\u00a0<\u20090.01). Variation in vitamin synthesis and utilization level among these three vitamins is likely to reflect the complexity of the gut microbiota towards resource allocation and reuse of enzymes.",

Fecal metagenomes sampled from four different countries were analyzed together to improve the robustness of our predictions at a statistical level. This provided insights into how a population-specific microbiome or a microbiome-specific population differs with respect to vitamin metabolism. Our approach of computational method enabled us to analyze a targeted pathway with an identification of the related KEGG Orthologies. We focused on vitamin metabolism of human gut microbiota as it might be conserved across distantly related microbial species, potentially because they are an integral part of the carbon metabolic network.",

Based on the species co-occurrence abundances, species with dual functional traits were found to be dominant and with a tendency to cooccur with each other. This observation is consistent with the notion that species equipped with diverse set of functional traits seems to establish resilient communities [21\u201323]. While the direction from correlation to causation might not hold true in every situation, we believe that these predicted positive and negative associations could imply reasons other than the parameterized variable. For instance, even though Bacteroides thetaiotamicron could produce biotin and Bifidobacterium adolescentis could uptake biotin, we found that B. thetaiotamicron and B. adolescentis were negatively correlated. As an another example, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia inulinivorans can produce cobalamin, but they were positively correlated [7, 30]. Experimental in vitro co-culturing of these pairs (i.e., for their co-growth evaluations) has been validated by co-occurrence network predictions [30]. Though further study into the micro-ecology of this pattern in a defined gut microbiota model is required, as a working hypothesis a major driver for co-occurrence seems to be the ability to cohabitate in a given environment. This is in agreement with the results of [31] who found that bacteria evolve and respond according to environmental changes.",

To profile the gut microbiome\u2019s functional capacity about vitamins, we therefore used metagenomic functional annotation of these genes encoded in the gut microbiome, and combined this with available metatranscriptomics data for an IBD cohort. The gene expression level for vitamin related enzymes was congruent with previous clinical reports where vitamin measurements from plasma samples of IBD subjects reveal a decreased level of cobalamin and thiamine. Although we observed an increase in the expression levels for biotin in IBD subjects, we also found a pattern where species with biotin producing potential were abundant in IBD subjects. These findings suggest that it is not only the difference in species abundance that sets two groups apart, it is also the functional features of the abundant species that contributes to determining a healthy gut microbiome.",

As the diet-derived vitamins are absorbed in the small intestine, it seems that the country-specific, microbial genetic content (vitamin metabolic genes derived from vitamin producing microorganisms) in the large intestine accounts for the observed differences in different cases as revealed through the abundant community-level metabolic reconstructions. Even if vitamin dysbiosis cannot be associated with an altered gut microbiota-mediated metabolic disease, we believe that it may well be an integral part of the bacterial central carbon metabolism, contributing among themselves and to the human host. Estimation of the contributory levels of human gut microbiota towards vitamin host absorption, could disentangle the interrelationship between the impact of B-vitamin dosage on gut microbial members and the host, especially in the gut microbiota of individuals diagnosed with under- or overnutrition and T2D. We are therefore confident that our study would enable screening for microorganisms with high potential for vitamin production. In related to screening results for synthetic communities of vitamin production, it may become possible to improve the current vitamin fortification programs in the food-microbiome industries through the administration of live or attenuated vitamin-producing bacteria into fermented foods. Such bacteria may offer a natural alternative than consuming vitamin fortified foods where their composition are above the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) [32].",

To do so, all the KO groups related to vitamin biosynthetic reactions as described in the previous section were extracted. KEGG reactions were mapped to Kbase [42] nomenclature systems to be consistent with the reaction identifiers in the metabolic models. Following identification, a list of biochemical interconversions for each vitamin category, namely, biotin, cobalamin, folate, niacin, pantothenate, pyridoxine, riboflavin, thiamine and menaquinone were complied. Subsequently, the presence and absence of these reactions in each cohort were analyzed to see how conserved each pathway is across different populations. Furthermore, for the American and Chinese cohort, we investigated the presence and absence of the reactions in biosynthesis pathway of each vitamin considering the abundance of bacterial species. In each community, a union list of the present species was constructed and sorted according to the relative abundance of the species in the healthy cohort.
