The markers are targeting variable regions V3\u2013V7 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The method utilizes 54 bacterial markers (Table S1), covering more than 300 bacteria at different taxonomic levels: 26 species specific, 19 detect genus specific, and 9 bacteria at higher taxonomic levels (phyla, class, and family). All samples were analyzed at the same time point. The laboratory was blinded for the diagnosis of IBD, non-IBD, or healthy.",

The only bacterial marker that was more abundant in patients (IBD and non-IBD) compared to healthy controls was Prevotella (P<0.01). The abundances of Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroides were similar in all groups. The principal component analysis plot visualizes how the microbiota composition differs between IBD, non-IBD, and healthy and overlaps between IBD and non-IBD symptomatic patients (Figure 3).",

Our non-IBD symptomatic patients consisted of pediatric patients admitted to the hospital due to symptoms and findings suspicious of IBD, but without evidence of inflammation during workup. Some of these patients may have had preclinical/latent IBD or other conditions such as disturbed permeability and motility influencing the study results. We believe most of these non-IBD symptomatic patients have functional gastrointestinal disorders. Ideally we should have further characterized and subtyped these patients with the use of Rome criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, due to the limited sample size of 50 non-IBD symptomatic patients, further subclassification would reduce the statistical power to reveal clinical significant differences between the groups.",

SCFAs are important energy sources for enterocytes and contribute to homeostasis of colonic regulatory T cell populations.25 The reduction of protective commensal microbes and concomitant loss of their protective function can have an influence on development of IBD and the disease course. As expected, Bifidobacterium was more abundant in healthy children below 10 years of age than in the healthy adolescents.26 We found no difference in bacterial abundance between age groups for our IBD and non-IBD symptomatic patients. This may be due to disease state being a stronger driver of the microbiota composition than age.",

Prevotella, R. gnavus, and Proteobacteria have been found to correlate with markers of disease activity and inflammation,28,30 which were reproduced in the present study. Proteobacteria are pathobionts, meaning that they may expand as a result of a microbial imbalance and exert pathogenic effects on the host and are consistently reported enriched in IBD.31\u201333 Our CD patients with a complicated phenotype had high abundance of Proteobacteria, in accordance with the previous reports. Proteobacteria enrichment has been associated with early relapse after induction of remission with exclusive enteral nutrition in pediatric CD,34 and in our patients, high abundance was associated with the need for surgery and lack of mucosal healing. These findings implicate that Proteobacteria abundance might be a marker for an aggressive disease course with a higher risk of treatment failure.",

This is in line with observations that low abundance of F. prausnitzii may predict nonresponse to anti-TNF therapy in UC39 and relapse after infliximab termination in CD patients.40 Studies have found baseline microbiota to be associated with treatment responses,34,36,39 but how the microbiota composition and abundances change with treatment is less studied. The IBD patients in our sample with repeated fecal microbiota analysis displayed persistent, unchanged dysbiosis after treatment, regardless of treatment modalities and remission status. Similar results have been reported in another pediatric study, where the dysbiosis improved, but nonetheless persisted despite mucosal healing.41 Lewis et al found that effective exclusive enteral nutrition and TNF blocker therapy reduced but failed to eliminate the dysbiosis of pediatric CD patients.42 Others have found the fecal microbiota to become more dysbiotic with dietary treatment such as exclusive enteral nutrition.43\u201345 Perhaps sustained and deep remission requires normalization of the gut dysbiosis, or maybe it is not possible to reverse the dysbiosis once the gut homeostasis is perturbed as fundamentally as it is in IBD. Measuring relative fecal microbiota abundance might not be an optimal method as it is not suited to determine the effects of dysbiosis, giving no information about the functional consequences. As a prognostic tool, fecal microbiota profiles may still be of value, also in established IBD patients on treatment, as the dysbiosis remained despite treatment and remission. However, due to the small number of patients with repeated sampling, firm conclusions cannot be drawn.",

First, the sample size is limited, reducing the statistical power to detect differences in microbiota composition as statistically significant. We did not adjust for multiple testing as we considered this study to be exploratory, increasing the risk for accepting false-positive associations. However, we validated our results by splitting our data into a training and a test set, and most associations estimated in the whole cohort remained statistically significant. The positive relationship between inflammation, increased abundance of pathobionts and concomitant loss of beneficial bacteria, is reassuring as it is in line with previous research reports.50",
