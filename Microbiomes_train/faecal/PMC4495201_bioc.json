The role of the microbiota in pregnancy and nutrition is a promising new area of study with potential health ramifications. In many African countries, maternal and infant death and morbidity are associated with malnutrition. Here, we assess the influence of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, supplemented with Moringa plant as a source of micronutrients, on the health and oral, gut, vaginal, and milk microbiotas of 56 pregnant women in Tanzania. In an open-label study design, 26 subjects received yogurt daily, and 30 were untreated during the last two trimesters and for 1 month after birth. Samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and dietary recalls were recorded. Women initially categorized as nourished or undernourished consumed similar calories and macronutrients, which may explain why there was no difference in the microbiota at any body site. Consumption of yogurt increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and decreased Enterobacteriaceae in the newborn feces but had no effect on the mother's microbiota at any body site. The microbiota of the oral cavity and GI tract remained stable over pregnancy, but the vaginal microbiota showed a significant increase in diversity leading up to and after birth. In summary, daily micronutrient-supplemented probiotic yogurt provides a safe, affordable food for pregnant women in rural Tanzania, and the resultant improvement in the gut microbial profile of infants is worthy of further study.",

Malnutrition is an additional challenge for pregnant women in many developing countries, along with access to medical care, exposure to malaria and HIV, and financial burden. Limited food accessibility, food with poor nutritional value, and cultural traditions result in deficiencies in essential nutrients. Micronutrients are dietary components, often referred to as vitamins and minerals. Iron, iodine, vitamin A, folate, and zinc are recommended during pregnancy (2), although unfortunately not all women are recipients. In many developing countries, including Tanzania, maternal and newborn death and morbidity are major issues, often propagated by malnourishment (3, 4). Efforts to reduce infant mortality by supplementation with vitamin A have failed (5). Fermented foods, including dairy products, have long been part of tradition in many parts of the African continent. In Tanzania (6), while milk consumption is high (per capita milk consumption of 39 kg/annum), commercial yogurt is not affordable to many, and no health-promoting probiotic yogurt is sold in traditional retail outlets. The establishment of community kitchens in Mwanza in 2004 (7) has provided affordable probiotic yogurt to around 4,000 people each day, with some measurable benefits to immunity and gut health (8, 9).",

However, during the first and third trimesters, proteobacteria and actinobacteria increase, while richness decreases (12,\u201314). Given the role of diet on shaping the microbiota (15, 16) and the potential additional nutritional stresses within impoverished African rural settings, we sought to assess the gut microbiotas of Tanzanian pregnant women. Also, since vaginal and oral microbiomes are suspected to influence pregnancy outcomes (17), and longitudinal studies seldom have included sampling after birth, we aimed to better characterize these microbiotas longitudinally.",

In addition, when serving sizes per se, or sizes of specific food items were not clearly stated in the interview, the average portion quantity, as outlined by the Tanzanian Food Composition Tables, was used. Nutritional data for Moringa were obtained (M. Broin, unpublished data) and put into ESHA. The average intake of calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, calcium, vitamin A, folate, and zinc were calculated over the 48-h period to determine daily consumption.

All plotting was carried out in R with OTUs summarized to genus level and filtered to only include organisms which composed >1% of the total data set (vaginal heat map [see Fig. 6C]) or >0.01% (entire data set [see Fig. 3]). For association of individual genera with yogurt/control treatment in infant fecal samples, the data set was filtered to include only infant fecal samples, summarized to the genus level and genera were only kept if they represented a minimum 0.1% of the total reads. Significantly differentially abundant genera were determined by comparing groups using ALDEx2 (v0.99.2) (31, 32) by Wilcoxon rank-sum test with FDR correction of centered log-ratio transformed data using 1,000 Monte-Carlo instances drawn from the Dirichlet distribution with a minimally informative uniform prior of 0.5.

Data were obtained for nine participants from the control group and six participants from the probiotic yogurt group. Samples were homogenized for 10 s prior to the removal of a 500-\u03bcl aliquot for DNA extraction using a sonicator (VCX 130; Chemical Instruments AB, Sollentuna, Sweden). The remaining sample (approximately 500 \u03bcl to 1 ml) was used for nutrient analysis. The lactose content was measured as described by Fusch et al. (33). Fat was extracted from the milk using Mojonnier ether extraction and then gravimetrically analyzed to get the total fat content (34). The protein content of the breast milk was determined as per the methods of Choi et al. (34). The true protein content was determined by subtracting the nonprotein nitrogen from the total nitrogen and multiplying this by 6.25 (35).",

However, only three babies (5%) were delivered preterm, while all other births occurred without adverse events, and overall, babies examined by the local physician were deemed to be healthy. It was noted at the study midpoint whereby there was increased calorie, carbohydrate, thiamine, folate, and zinc intake in the probiotic group while blood protein levels were also higher; however, these were not statistically supported after multiple testing corrections (Table 2). We noted that the calcium levels in the probiotic group were significantly higher than for all others (Tables 2 and \u200band3).3).

None of the mothers or infants died during labor. This finding, plus the low incidence of preterm labor, no underweight births, and no serious malnutrition, suggested that this particular rural population did not typify the Tanzanian situation as a whole, where the maternal mortality rate is 38.3 times higher than in Canada and the infant mortality under 1 year of age is 7.6 times higher (3). Sample size aside, according to the UNICEF statistics, we would expect two infant deaths in a cohort of this size. There is an association between an aberrant urogenital microbiota and preterm labor (36), but the incidence of the latter was low in this patient group (32%) and similar to that found in London, Canada (M. Mottola, M. Enos, and G. Reid, unpublished data). Likewise, periodontal disease with poor oral hygiene has been linked with preterm labor (37), but the Tanzanian women studied here did not present with acute periodontal disease as identified during their examinations, and their oral microbiotas showed no obvious abnormality. Thus, with two risk factors for preterm delivery being absent, it was not surprising to find such a low rate of premature births. Nevertheless, this is all the more laudable since many subjects had poor caloric intake. In Tanzania, normally only ca. 50% women have a skilled attendant at birthing according to UNICEF, and many women have poor access to obstetrical care. The provision of the latter in our study may have reduced the preterm labor rate and improved maternal outcome, albeit the majority of the women delivered at home.",

However, the baseline levels of hemoglobin, blood retinol, and protein concentrations suggested they were not actually overtly malnourished. It is highly probable that our study suffered from a lack of power and that with an increased sample size, we may have been able to conclusively demonstrate clinical outcomes as a result of the Moringa-supplemented yogurt consumption. A previous study in Mwanza, Tanzania, using a different combination of micronutrients supplemented in yogurt showed benefits to HIV-positive subjects (9). Given the previously reported protective effect of probiotic yogurt supplemented with L. rhamnosus GR-1 and Moringa on increasing blood levels of mercury and arsenic (38), it is important to note that no difference in hemoglobin was found, suggesting that probiotic consumption did not negatively affect absorption of necessary trace elements such as iron.",

One would therefore expect that significantly different fecal microbiota patterns would result in differences among vaginal bacterial profiles. However, this is not the case here or in other studies, suggesting that the reproductive tract has evolved receptivity to certain constituents of the gut, mainly lactobacilli, and an ability to repel others.

Since our study showed stability in the fecal microbiota from the second trimester until after birth, this adds to previous findings of the microbiome across pregnancy in Finish women (12), where the first and third trimesters showed dramatic community shifts. A strength of the present study is that, unlike previous reports, we examined all three communities (fecal, oral, and vaginal) simultaneously.",

All of the mothers breast-fed, so, since glycans in the milk promote bifidobacterial growth (47), it is not clear why only the milk from probiotic-treated mothers further increased relative abundances of these organisms. We found no significant differences in milk microbiotas and fat, carbohydrate, or protein concentrations between the two groups of women. Given the complex cocktail of bifidogenic glycans and bioactive compounds in breast milk, it will be necessary to apply further glycomic, proteomic and metabonomic approaches to study the mechanisms through which micronutrient and probiotic supplementation may affect breast milk composition and the infant's microbiota. Perhaps specific milk oligosaccharides increase following micronutrient/probiotic supplemented yogurt consumption.",
