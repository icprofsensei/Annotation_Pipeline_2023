They found a higher abundance of Bacteroides massiliensis in prostate cancer and higher Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium rectalie in controls and suggested an influence on micronutrients [8].

Spurious hits to the PhiX control genome were identified using BLASTN and removed. Passing sequences were trimmed of primers, evaluated for chimeras with UCLUST (de novo mode) [13], and screened for human-associated contaminant using Bowtie2 [14], followed by a more sensitive BLASTN search against the GreenGenes 16S rRNA database [15]. Chloroplast and mitochondrial contaminants were detected and filtered using the Ribosomal Database Project classifier [16] with a confidence threshold of 80%. High-quality 16S rRNA sequences were assigned to a high-resolution taxonomic lineage using Resphera Insight [17-21]. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis was performed to identify Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways potentially affected by groups of bacteria. PICRUSt is a bioinformatics software package designed to predict metagenome functional content from marker gene (eg, 16S rRNA) surveys and full genomes. PICRUSt was applied to infer functional categories associated with taxonomic composition [22]. Differential abundance analysis utilized the nonparametric permutation difference test for \u03b1 diversity and PICRUSt values or the negative binomial test (DESeq [23]) for taxonomic count data. Then, p values were adjusted using the false discovery rate [24]. The \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity analyses were performed using QIIME.

We used a LASSO regression analysis to identify the pathways most likely to differentiate between prostate cancer and no cancer disease using a cross-validated model-fitting procedure. Once we identified the microbiome metabolic pathways, we calculated quintiles for each metabolic process derived from PICRUSt values. If the value was positively (or negatively) correlated to cancer, then values in the top (or lowest) quintile (20th percentile) were coded as 1.0, indicating positive, and all other values were coded as 0, indicating null. We compared utilizing only the LASSO regression-derived variables (\u201cLASSO microbiome profile\u201d) to the secondary profile by including the B vitamins and carbohydrate profiles. Additional profiles were identified by LDA effect size (LefSe) analysis (Fig. 3A and \u200band3B)3B) in a biased approach to give preference to those pathways that are modifiable and not human-associated functional categories (such as \u201ccardiac muscle contraction\u201d or \u201cpathways in cancer\u201d identified in univariate analysis).

We then performed an unbiased selection using LASSO linear regression analysis and subsequent biased selection using LefSe analysis based on the ability to target the pathway. In LASSO regression analysis, the four pathways identified were not individually significant in logistic regression, but they were predictive in AUC curve analysis (AUC = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52\u20130.75), p = 0.03]. While disease-based pathways such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease may perform well for predictive markers, they do not provide the ability for modification of the microbiome. Therefore, using LefSe, we identified six additional metabolic profiles that could be added to the already defined LASSO regression analysis to develop a microbiome score. After identifying 10 microbiome metabolic pathways of interest, we computed the microbiome score (0\u201310; Fig. 4). A number of aberrant microbiome-associated gut metabolic pathways are associated with cancer compared with no cancer on biopsy (Fig. 4; Kendell\u2019s Tau for ordinal assessment, p = 0.01). We test the microbiome score to predict future risk of prostate cancer; therefore, we excluded six men with a high likelihood of prostate cancer (eg, PSA >20) for the final multivariate statistical analysis because their risk would outweigh most other factors. Additionally, the microbiome score was the only significant factor in a univariate analysis; therefore, we selected PSA and age in the logistic regression model as the most historically influential factors for prostate cancer. Controlling for age and PSA, the microbiome score remained significant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25 [1.01\u20131.55]; p = 0.04; Table 1]. The microbiome score also had a higher AUC over the LASSO approach (AUC = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.53\u20130.75); p = 0.02; Fig. 5).",

Folate is the most intriguing metabolic pathway according to the research regarding folate and the risk of prostate cancer [26,27]. In the aspirin and folate polyp prevention trial, a secondary analysis revealed that moderate folic acid supplementation resulted in an age-adjusted hazard ratio = 2.63 (95% CI = 1.23\u20135.65, Wald test p = 0.01) for developing prostate cancer [28]. Interestingly, baseline dietary folate intake and plasma folate in non-supplement users are protective of prostate cancer, which may implicate that supplements may equate to an increased risk of cancer and natural sources of folate may be preventative. Our study noted a higher prevalence of microbiota involved in natural folate production in men without prostate cancer. Therefore, one could potentially encourage increased natural folate production in high-risk men by using probiotics and reducing supplementation [29]. An interaction exists between folate and riboflavin (vitamin B2) because riboflavin is a co-factor of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [30]. In the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study with more than 40 000 participants, dietary intake of riboflavin and folate seemed to have a U-shaped curve concerning the incidence of prostate cancer [31].",

Usually PICRUSt disease-based pathways are not reported; however, in this case, a risk of neurodegenerative diseases has been shown to be inversely related to all cancers including prostate [33]. The pathways are used for their predictive ability as a prostate cancer risk factor rather than their ability to be modified. Therefore, we added the B vitamins that were significant in our analysis that also have a modifiable potential to slightly improve the AUC. We specifically note that folate and riboflavin may have implications for modifiable risk factors. The lack of a biotin\u2013associated microbiome was observed to be one of the most robust indicators associated with prostate cancer in LASSO analysis.

We then use the extra swab for microbiome research. This methodology has a practical advantage of increasing compliance and, thus, can become part of a routine clinic visit at the time of biopsy. We did not use magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy, which may have helped with the location of tumors in patients where we discovered \u201cno cancer.\u201d The no-cancer group did have larger prostates and could lead to sampling error. We could not evaluate a causal inference between folate and prostate cancer as we did not collect plasma B vitamin levels or food frequency questionnaires. Several publications associated inflammation with a benign or malignant disease. Based on a retrospective review of the pathology reports, we documented that prostate inflammation was more common in non-cancer cases (10/41, 24%) compared with prostate cancer cases (5/64, 7.8%; p = 0.018). To provide an appropriate inflammatory assessment, pathologists need to examine each slide for inflammation irrespective of the diagnosis, which was beyond the scope of this project.",
