However, these studies used a relatively small number of controls, who were usually selected from the patient population of the gastroenterology department after excluding IBD.[10] Because recent gut microbiome research has shown significant effects of stool consistency and functional complaints on the gut microbiota [11\u201313], previous results could have been influenced by their method of selection of controls.",

Here, we present a large single-centre case-control analysis of the luminal gut microbiota, the host genetics and clinical phenotypes of both CD and UC. To ensure optimal data quality, we adopted a rigorously standardized approach to collect and process fresh frozen faecal samples of 313 IBD patients from a single hospital in the North of the Netherlands and 582 truly healthy controls from the same geographical area. For all individuals, extensive clinical data, laboratory and endoscopic findings were collected. In addition, host genomic risk variants and risk scores were obtained in both the IBD patient and the healthy controls to analyse host genomic influences on the gut microbial composition.",

The default settings of MaAsLin were used in all analyses. We used the Q-value package implemented in MaAsLin to correct for multiple testing. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used as cut-off value for significance. The effect of the IBD diagnosis (CD or UC) on the gut microbiota composition was analysed by adding the IBD diagnosis versus healthy as a discrete predictor in the MaAsLin general linear mixed model analysis. Unweighted genetic risk scores were calculated for every participant by summing up the risk alleles of the abovementioned SNPs (risk allele = 1; IBD protective allele = 0).[25] Weighted genetic risk scores were calculated for every participant by summing up the log-normalized odds of the genetic variants of the same abovementioned SNPs.

Statistically significant differences were found in the first three components (PCoA1 P = 2.62 \u00d7 10\u221268, PCoA2 P = 0.033, PCoA3 P = 1.50 \u00d7 10\u221210, Wilcoxon test). The gut microbiota of healthy controls clustered together, while the gut microbiota of IBD patients were more heterogeneous, partially overlapping the healthy controls. The shape of the PCoA-plot is mainly explained by disease location and the Shannon Index (see results below) as depicted in Figure 2A\u20132D.",

In IBD patients as well as subsets of IBD patients (CD patients, UC patients, ileal CD patients, ileocolonic CD patients and colonic CD patients) neither the single genetic risk variants, the HLA-DRB1*01:03 haplotype nor the weighted or unweighted composite scores of genetic risk alleles showed any statistically significant effect on the gut microbiota composition. All results of the analyses with the risk scores of 11 SNPs can be found in Supplementary Table S3. Risk scores including all 200 IBD risk SNPs did not show any significant relations with the gut microbiota composition.",

There is overlap between healthy controls and patients with colonic disease, while in concordance with the alpha-diversity analysis in Figure 1, the gut microbiota of patients with ileal disease deviates more from healthy controls. The statistical analysis of the PCoA supports this result: the first component is related to disease location (PCoA1 rho=0.63, P = 7.39 \u00d7 10\u221291, Spearman correlation) and colonic CD patients differ from ileal CD patients (P = 5.42 \u00d7 10\u22129). The alpha-diversity analysis shows similar results: the gut microbiota of IBD patients with colonic disease is not statistically significantly decreased compared to healthy controls (Shannon index UC patients = 6.41 vs. Shannon index healthy controls = 6.50, P = 0.06; Shannon index colonic CD patients = 6.38 vs. Shannon index healthy controls = 6.50, P = 0.08, Wilcoxon test). On the contrary, IBD patients with ileal disease show a statistically significant decrease in alpha diversity (ileal CD patients vs. healthy controls P = 3.28 \u00d7 10\u221213 and ileocolonic CD patients vs. healthy controls P = 3.11 \u00d7 10\u221211, Wilcoxon test), as depicted in Figure 1.",

We could not detect any gene-microbiota interactions in IBD patients, probably due to the already well-established dysbiosis as a consequence of the inflammation in the gut. Another complication is the interrelatedness of the genotype and phenotypes in IBD. For example, NOD2 risk variants are known to be associated with ileal CD and we show that ileal CD has a specific microbial signature. After correction for treatment, disease activity and disease location, we could not find any statistically significant genome-microbiota relations in IBD patients.",

An important new finding of our study is the increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes in both CD and UC patients. Increased levels of Bacteroidetes have recently been discovered in IBS patients.[13] Since the control groups used in previous IBD studies also had functional gastrointestinal complaints (i.e. IBS), this would have confounded any comparisons between Bacteroidetes levels in IBD patients and controls, masking any meaningful enrichment in IBD.",

In our PCoA, the gut microbiota of colonic CD patients is more similar to the microbiota of UC patients than to that of ileal CD patients. While different clusters of gut microbiota samples are also observed in recent IBD metagenomics research, we have been able to relate these clusters to the disease location phenotype.[46] The importance of disease location also matches recent insights into host genetics, in which, based on genetic risk scores, colonic CD lies between UC and ileal CD.[4] We found that the gut microbiota composition in stool could explain the differences in IBD disease location, while the genetic risk variants in our cohort could not. Moreover, there is important overlap in the clinical presentation of colonic CD and UC, e.g. the risk of developing colorectal carcinoma in colonic CD is similar in UC, but different from ileal CD.[47] Based on both the previous genetic findings and our current microbiota findings, it is becoming more apparent that colonic CD and ileal CD are different diseases within the IBD spectrum.",

For the first time, we find evidence for a role of the gut microbiota in the onset of IBD: healthy individuals with a high genetic risk load for IBD also have unfavourable changes in their gut microbiota. This relationship warrants further investigation as it might be both a potential target for treatment and a possibility for prevention of IBD in genetically susceptible hosts or their families.",
