Others have shown that colonization of mice with Bacteroides fragilis ameliorates EAE7 and that colonization of mice with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a Th17 inducer, exacerbates EAE8. Tryptophan-derived AHR ligands produced by intestinal commensals can reach the CNS to modulate astrocyte function and suppress inflammation and neurodegeneration9. A recent study showed that the human gut derived commensal Prevotella suppresses EAE in an HLA class II transgenic mouse model10.",

We have found increased Methanobrevibacter and decreased Butyricimonas in the gut microbiome of MS patients1. Others have reported dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of MS subjects3,4. Recently, it was shown that high frequency of intestinal Th17 cells correlates with alterations in gut microbiota composition as well as increased disease activity in MS11. A twin study performed in discordant MS twins reported that the transfer of feces from the affected twin to germ-free mice induce more severe EAE symptoms than feces from the healthy twin12. Consistent with these fecal transfer experiments findings, another group observed that germ-free mice colonized with MS derived feces develop more severe EAE symptoms than mice colonized with feces from healthy subjects13. These findings suggest that manipulation of the gut microbiome could potentially be beneficial to MS patients.",

Furthermore, LBS has been shown to promote an anti-inflammatory response in the gut of a mouse model of peanut allergy and diabetes15,16. A recent study conducted in ART-treated HIV-1 positive patients reports an association between LBS administration and decreased T cell activation in the peripheral blood and in gut associated lymphoid tissue17. LBS immunomodulatory properties extend to the central nervous system. For example, LBS has been shown to promote neuroprotection in a mouse model of traumatic spinal cord injury18. Another study reports that LBS administration was associated with decreased microglial cell activation as well as decreased CNS monocytes infiltration leading to improved sickness behavior in a mouse model of liver inflammation19. In humans, LBS has been shown to be beneficial to patients with pouchitis, ulcerative colitis and diabetes20\u201322. Little is known about the effect of LBS on peripheral immune function in humans. The goal of our study is to investigate the effect of LBS on the gut microbiome and peripheral immune function in healthy controls and MS patients.",

Samples were sequenced by paired end 250 base pair reads at the Harvard Medical School Biopolymer Facility using the MiSeq platform (Illumina). Sequence quality was evaluated with FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The median Phred quality scores were above Q30 for the first 230 basepairs, and above Q20 for the entire sequence for forward read, however, the median Phred Q scores for read 2 dropped below Q20 within the first 50 bases of the reverse read. Thus, we utilized only the forward read of 250 bases, corresponding to the V4 region of the microbial 16S rRNA. Downstream analysis was performed in QIIME (Qualitative Insights into Microbial Ecoloy)24. Sequences were de-multiplexed and quality filtered in which reads are truncated if two consecutive bases fall below a quality score of Q20 (1% error), and reads that are <75% of full length are discarded23. OTUs were picked using the open reference method sumaclust (http://metabarcoding.org/sumatra) and sortmeRNA25. Taxonomy is picked against the Greengenes 13.8 release database (http://greengenes.secondgenome.com) using a 97% similarity threshold.

The obtained mix was then centrifuged for 15 min at 15K rpm and 4\u00b0C. 700\u03bcl of supernatant was added to 100 \u03bcl of a D2O solution of 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (TSP) 10 mM, used as NMR chemical-shift reference, buffered at pH 7.00 by means of 1M phosphate buffer. Finally, the so obtained sample was centrifuged again at the above conditions. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K with an AVANCE III spectrometer (Bruker, Milan, Italy) operating at a frequency of 600.13 MHz. Following Ventrella et al., the signals from broad resonances originating from large molecules were suppressed by a CPMG-filter composed by 400 echoes with a \u03c4 of 400 \u03bcs and a 180\u00b0 pulse of 24 \u03bcs, for a total filter of 330 ms27. The HOD residual signal was suppressed by means of presaturation. This was done by employing the cpmgpr1d sequence, part of the standard pulse sequence library. Each spectrum was acquired by summing up 256 transients using 32 K data points over a 7184 Hz spectral window, with an acquisition time of 2.28s. In order to apply NMR as a quantitative technique28, the recycle delay was set to 5s, keeping into consideration the relaxation time of the protons under investigation. The signals were assigned by comparing their chemical shift and multiplicity with the Human Metabolome Database29 and Chenomx software data bank (Chenomx Inc., Canada, ver 8.1). 1H-NMR spectra baseline-adjusted by means of the simultaneous peak detection and baseline correction algorithm (SPDBC) implemented in the baseline R package30. Briefly, the algorithm tries to iteratively locate peaks as consistent deviations from noise and interpolate over the spectra after peak removal. To each spectrum a linear correction was then applied to make the points pertaining to the baseline randomly spread around zero. No manual alignment of the signals was necessary, different to previous investigations31. Differences in water content among samples were taken into consideration by probabilistic quotient normalization32, applied to the entire spectra array.",

Shannon Index, an alpha diversity measurement of both richness (number of species present) and evenness (whether there are predominant and rare species or equal representation of all species), was measured at multiple sequencing depths using rarefaction curves (Fig 2A).

We observed a similar trend in MS patients (p=0.10, Fig 2C). The overall microbial community structure shifted back to baseline level following discontinuation of LBS in controls and MS patients (p=0.58, p=0.54 respectively; Fig 2C). No shift was observed with unweighted UniFrac distances, which measures the presence versus absence of the microbiota, likely due to the fact that taxa closely related to the strains within LBS are known to inhabit the gut, albeit at lower levels (Fig 2D). We next computed UniFrac distances for each subject, comparing baseline, ON LBS, and OFF LBS microbiota samples (Fig 2E). Baseline compared to ON LBS, and OFF LBS compared to ON LBS had higher weighted UniFrac distances than comparing baseline to OFF LBS (paired one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test), further suggesting that the individual microbiota compositions resembled their starting microbiota before treatment.",

LBS supplementation was also associated with decreased in the abundance of taxa that have been reported to be elevated in the gut of MS patients including genera Akkermansia (Th1 inducer), Blautia and Dorea (Fig 3B\u2013C). We also observed decreased in the relative abundance of B. adolescentis (Th17 inducer), following LBS supplementation in controls and MS patients (Fig 3C). The relative abundance of most of these OTUs returned to baseline levels following discontinuation of LBS (Fig 3B\u2013C). Thus, LBS supplementation can reverse MS induced alterations in the gut microbiota composition as well as inhibits the growth of pro-inflammatory bacteria.",

The abundance of several KEGG pathways was decreased in both controls and MS patients following LBS administration including pathways related to Metabolism, Cellular Processes, Environmental Information and Processing and Organismal Systems (P<0.05, Fig 4A). ABC transporters, Carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes, Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism and Sporulation are four KEGG pathways that have been reported to be increased in MS patients4. The abundance of these four pathways was reduced following LBS supplementation (p<0.05, Fig 4A). Methane metabolism is another pathway whose abundance was reduced following administration of LBS (p<0.05, Fig 4A). Methane is metabolized by methanogens and we have previously reported increased abundance of a methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii, in MS patients. Hence these findings suggest that LBS can reverse MS-related alterations in gut microbiota function.",

We observed increased 2-oxoglutarate level (p=0.040) following discontinuation of LBS in controls (Fig 4B). In MS patients, we noted increased level of 2-oxoglutarate (p=0.039) following LBS administration (Fig 4B). We also found decreased 3-hydroxyvalerate level (p=0.027) following LBS administration in MS patients (Fig 4B). We observed increased level of 3-Methyl-oxovalerate (p=0.008), citrate (p=0.023), nicotinate (p=0.039) and alpha-ketoisovalerate (p=0.016) following LBS discontinuation in MS patients (Fig 4B). We then investigated potential associations between gut microbiota and metabolites changes. We correlated microbial abundance with a set of metabolites whose concentration were significantly changed following LBS administration. In controls, we found a positive correlation between two Ruminococcaceae OTUs (187225 and 36378) and uracil levels following LBS administration (Fig 4C). We also observed a positive correlation between Lactobacillus OTU 304724 and hypoxanthine concentration in controls (Fig 4C). In MS patients, we found an association between increased in the relative abundance of the following 4 Lactobacillus OTUs: 288784, 134726, 4414261 and 4429553) and adenosine monophosphate (Fig 4D). We also observed a positive correlation between Streptococcus NROTU 985 and adenosine monophosphate in MS patients (Fig 4D). We observed a trend toward a negative association between level of Bifidobacterium OTU 1142029 and hypoxanthine concentration in MS patients (Fig 4D). We also found a trend toward a negative association between two Lactobacillus OTUs: 288784 and 4429553 and hydroxyvalerate following LBS administration in MS (Fig 4D). Thus, changes in the gut microbiota composition following LBS administration were associated with changes in stool metabolomics profile in controls and MS.",

We correlated microbial abundance with a set of immune markers that were significantly changed following LBS administration. Given that most immune markers and microbial abundance changes were observed following LBS administration, we focused on that time point for our correlation studies. We found a negative correlation between CD80 MFI on classical monocytes and relative abundance of the following five Streptococcus OTUs: NR0 (p=0.0029), NR624 (P=0.0057), NR552 (p=0.02), 536866 (p=0.028), and NR985 (p=0.0498) in controls (Fig 6B). Decreased level of expression of HLA.DPA1 and HLA.DPB1 in monocytes was associated with increased relative abundance of the following three Lactobacillus OTUs: 304724 (p=0.026 and p=0.00579 respectively), 288784 (p=0.0091 for HLA.DPB1) and 316515 (p=0.021, p=0.0107 respectively) in controls (Fig 6B). We observed a negative correlation between relative abundance of Bifidobacterium OTU 4426298 and level of expression of HLA.DPA1 and HLA.DPB1 in monocytes from controls (p=0.02, p=0.021 respectively; Fig 6B). Bifidobacterium NR847 had a negative correlation with MFI CD80 on monocytes in controls (Fig 6B). In controls, Bifidobacterium OTU 1142029 had a positive correlation with MFI CD80 and IL6ST (p=0.03, p=0.043 respectively; Fig 6B). In MS, OTU 1142029 had a positive correlation with anti-inflammatory gene CYBB (p=0.033). Thus, OTU 1142029 was associated with pro-inflammatory immune markers in controls and with an anti-inflammatory marker in MS patients.",

Of note, we mentioned above that hypoxanthine had a positive correlation with Lactobacillus OTU 304724. Hence, increased in the relative abundance of OTU 304724 is associated with elevated level of stool hypoxanthine which is associated with decreased expression of HLA.DPA1 and HLA.DPB1 in monocytes.

Administration of LBS was also associated with decreased MFI of HLA-DR on dendritic cells in MS subjects. In controls, gene expression studies in monocytes revealed decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes including MS risk alleles HLA.DQA1 and HLA.DBP1 following LBS supplementation. Similarly, in MS patients, we observed decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes MALT1 and LGALS3 in monocytes following LBS administration. On the other hand, discontinuation of LBS had the opposite effect on peripheral immune function. Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Bifidobacterium genera had a negative correlation with the following pro-inflammatory immune markers: CD80 MFI on classical monocytes, MFI HLA-DR on dendritic cells and expression of HLA.DPA1 and HLA.DPB1 on monocytes.",

For this reason, we did not calculate FDR for stool metabolomics, FACS, gene expression studies and correlations studies.

First that high dose probiotic supplementation is safe and well tolerated by MS patients taking glatiramer acetate. Second, that LBS supplementation can reverse MS induced alterations in the gut microbiota composition and function. Third, that probiotic LBS induced changes in the gut microbiome are associated with an anti-inflammatory peripheral immune response in controls and MS subjects. Hence, these findings suggest that LBS could have a synergistic effect with current MS disease modifying therapies. Of note, most of the LBS induced changes in the gut microbiome and peripheral immune system did not persist following discontinuation of LBS thereby implying that probiotic supplementation will need to be done continuously. This study is the first report on the effect of LBS on the gut microbiome and peripheral immune function in the context of MS. This study is a proof of principle study to investigate whether it is possible to modulate the gut microbiome of MS patients by using probiotics. Given that all the gut microbiome studies so far were conducted in RRMS patients, we focused on that patient population. We also opted for a simple study design in which all patients were on a single disease modifying drug (DMD) and we chose glatiramer acetate. It must be emphasized that we have no information on the long-term safety of LBS in the MS population and do not know if the beneficial changes in the gut and immune system will be maintained in MS patients who are on LBS for a long period of time. Additional studies are required to evaluate the long-term safety and immunomodulatory properties of LBS in both relapsing-remitting and progressive MS patients as well as in patients on different types of DMDs. Such studies will help determine whether there are synergistic effects of LBS with certain DMDs and not with others. In addition, it will also be important to determine if LBS induced anti-inflammatory peripheral immune responses are associated with improved clinical outcome in MS patients.",
