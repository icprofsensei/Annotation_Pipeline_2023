Critical care patients undergo treatments that are known to influence the microbiota. However, dynamics and extent of such changes are not yet fully understood. To address this topic, we analyzed the microbiota before, during and after planned major cardio surgery that, for the first time, allowed us to follow the microbial dynamics of critical care patients. In this prospective, observational, longitudinal, single center study, we analyzed the fecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.",

The unique longitudinal setup of this study displayed a restoration of the microbiota in most patients to baseline composition post-discharge, which demonstrated its great restorative capacity. A relative decrease in benign or even beneficial bacteria and increase of pathobionts shifts the microbial balance in the gut, which could have clinical relevance.

Although the merits of antibiotics in this vulnerable population are undisputed, the impact of antibiotic use on the host's intestinal flora is an important concern (Wischmeyer et al., 2016). Selective digestive tract decontamination (SDD) is widely used as an infection prevention measure in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in the Netherlands, leading to a mortality reduction compared to standard care (de Smet et al., 2009). Benefits notwithstanding (de Smet et al., 2009), SDD impacts the gut microbiota, by suppressing Gram-negative potential pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and yeasts, while maintaining anaerobic populations through selective use of antibiotics, with unclear clinical consequences (Benus et al., 2010). Besides antibiotics, several other factors inherent to ICU stay are associated with a disturbance in the host's microbiota, also called \u201cdysbiosis,\u201d where the balance between potentially pathogenic and beneficial bacteria is aberrant (Kitsios et al., 2017). These factors include a change in nutrition, non-antibiotic pharmacological interventions (e.g., proton pump inhibitors and vasopressors), and various invasive procedures including endotracheal intubation and surgery (Krezalek et al., 2016; Kitsios et al., 2017). Beneficial roles of the healthy gut microbiota on human physiology are complex and include nutrient metabolism, modulation of host immune responses (Sekirov et al., 2010) and protection against potential pathogens by competition (Harris et al., 2017). In a state of dysbiosis, overgrowth of potential pathogens occurs which can lead to inflammation and infection (Sekirov et al., 2010). Current culture-independent techniques allow for an in-depth analysis of the composition of gut microbiota (Sekirov et al., 2010; Harris et al., 2017).",

Adult patients, scheduled for cardiac surgery involving coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve surgery, screened in our outpatient clinic preoperatively and admitted to the ICU after surgery, were eligible for inclusion. Patient characteristics and clinical data were recorded, including occurrence of complications during ICU and hospital stay. Duration of hospital stay included stay at peripheral hospitals for further recovery. Antibiotic consumption from 3 months prior to inclusion until 8 weeks after admission was documented. All patients received peri-operative prophylaxis for 24 h with cefazolin or clindamycin. On indication (expected length of stay (LOS) in ICU \u2265 72 h and/or expected duration of mechanical ventilation for \u2265 48 h), SDD was prescribed, consisting of cefotaxime 1 gram intravenously four times daily for 4 days and a topical application of tobramycin, colistin and amphotericin B into the oropharynx and stomach throughout ICU stay as described elsewhere (de Smet et al., 2009). Patients colonized with Staphylococcus aureus received intranasal mupirocin ointment pre-operatively according to national protocol. We defined the following as serious adverse outcomes: ICU- and in hospital-mortality, increased (\u22654 days) ICU length of stay (LOS), prolonged (\u22652 days) duration of mechanical ventilation, and occurrence of bacteraemia and post-operative wound infections, including mediastinitis. If a patient had one or more of these adverse outcomes, we defined this patient to have a combined adverse outcome (CAO). Fecal samples were obtained by a research nurse at ideally three time points: pre-admission on the day of pre-operative screening (baseline or Time point 1, T1), once during admission in the ICU or ward around day 4 (Time point 2, T2), and post-admission at a post-discharge routine visit or home visit (Time point 3, T3).

Length of hospital stay, use of SDD and use of antibiotics post-discharge were found to be significantly associated with the Shannon index (p < 0.05). When all these variables were combined together in a single model, only length of hospital stay and post-discharge antibiotic use remained significant; therefore, it was tested which time point they were associated to.

During admission, a shift in composition of gut microbiota from baseline was seen (p < 0.001), with an increase in principal component 1 and a decrease in principal component 2, away from the original profile. Plotted samples after discharge (T3) showed a difference with T2 (p < 0.001). At T3 the samples seem to return to the baseline situation in the PCoA plot indicating recovery of the microbial composition, although statistically, there is still a significant difference (p = 0.021). In order to determine how much of the variance observed among patients could be explained by the available baseline characteristics and outcomes, the PERMANOVA analysis (Supplementary Material 4) was performed. We looked into each time point to investigate how the relative contribution of these characteristics would change during the study period. We found that treatment with SDD could explain almost 7% of the variation exhibited during admission (T2), while the combined adverse outcome alone was accountable for almost 5% at T2. The use of antibiotics during admission and post-discharge, collectively, would explain 6% of variation of the microbial composition after discharge (T3).",

Patient #14 had a complicated course after CABG with sternal dehiscence, mediastinitis, sternal closure with pectoralis major flaps, complicated by a wound infection, with cultures yielding Enterobacter cloacae, S. aureus and Enterococcus faecium, myocardial ischemia with decompensated heart failure and S. aureus bacteraemia, needing prolonged treatment with several classes of antibiotics (Supplementary Material 3), also including treatment with SDD, a long hospital stay and readmission. In this patient, the relative abundance of Enterococcaceae was 82% at T2. In patient #40, who had an uneventful clinical course, 60% of the gut microbiota was dominated by Bifidobacteriaceae at T2, while at T1 and T3, Bifidobacteriaceae's contribution to the total flora was 4%. Patient #89, who had a prolonged ICU stay due to shock caused by heart failure and subsequent renal failure, showed a relatively high abundance of Bacteroidaceae (57%) at T2, while this was 8 and 5% at T1 and T3, respectively. Likewise, there was a relatively high abundance of Enterococcaceae (18%) at T2; at T1 and T3 no Enterococcaceae were detected. Patient #98, with an uneventful course, showed a remarkable relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (16%) at T1, with a decrease to 10% at T2, but an increase to 25% at T3, while at T2, a relative abundance of Enterococcaceae (24%) was detected; this was 0% at T1 and T3.",

As previously reported and in line with other studies (Lankelma et al., 2017), we found a significantly lower Shannon index during than before admission. In our longitudinal setup, we found the Shannon index after discharge not to be significantly different from before admission. The main differences were observed between the first two time points, confirming that all interventions related to hospital admission for elective surgery have a major impact on a patient's microbiota. The length of stay at the hospital was associated with a lower Shannon index, especially in the microbiota sampled at T2, suggesting the potential use of the gut microbiota data for an intervention that might prevent post-surgery complications. A lower Shannon index at T3 was associated with use of antibiotics post-discharge indicating the strong effect that this therapy has on the microbial gut diversity.",

These changes occurred not only in patients with a complicated course, but also in those with an uneventful post-operative recovery. Relatively few patients (13 individuals, i.e., 13.4%) had a predefined CAO. The median ICU stay was only 1 day, rendering this cohort to be different from the previous studies on dynamics of microbiota in ICU patients involving mainly acute admissions due to sepsis, surgery and trauma (Iapichino et al., 2008; Zaborin et al., 2014; McDonald et al., 2016; Ojima et al., 2016; Yeh et al., 2016; Buelow et al., 2017; Lankelma et al., 2017). During hospital stay, we observed a consistent pattern of changes in microbiota, characterized by: (i) a substantial drop in abundance of many bacteria from the Lachnospiraceae family, including the genera Blautia, Roseburia and Dorea; (ii) an increase in potential pathobionts, including enterococci; (iii) a relative increase in abundance of non-pathogenic gut commensal genera known to be stable over time, such as mucin-degrading Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and the archeon Methanobrevibacter. Many factors potentially responsible for variations in the microbiota composition may contribute to the observed dynamic pattern (Zhernakova et al., 2016; Kitsios et al., 2017). All patients were exposed to multiple interventions including major surgery, dietary changes and antibiotic use for at least a short period. Some patients had more protracted courses with a longer ICU stay with use of SDD as an infection prevention measure, longer courses of antibiotics, and re-interventions. Although SDD is partially aimed at Enterobacteriaceae, no significant change in their abundance was seen in this small sub cohort likely due to sample size and possibly due to the low relative contribution of Enterobacteriaceae to the gut microbiota composition. The most pronounced dynamic change of the gut microbiota during hospital stay in our cohort is a decrease in abundance of bacterial members of healthy microbiota, mostly butyrate producers. Taking into account their roles as energy providers for colonocytes, together with their known anti-inflammatory properties (Lankelma et al., 2015), we postulate that this decrease in butyrate producers may have a direct impact on clinical outcome. These results confirm and complement previously published studies in disease- and treatment-associated microbiota dynamics in different patient cohorts (Iapichino et al., 2008; Zaborin et al., 2014; McDonald et al., 2016; Ojima et al., 2016; Yeh et al., 2016; Buelow et al., 2017; Lankelma et al., 2017).",

We observed the associations between microbial dynamics and clinical metadata but they appear not to be clinically relevant. Our data thus do not allow to state whether the microbial composition at baseline could influence outcome and whether a state of dysbiosis is a cause or an effect of critical illness. Dysbiosis was previously found to be associated with an increased risk for infection and adverse outcome. For instance, in a cohort of 301 medical ICU patients, disruption of microbiota with Enterococcus domination (\u226530% relative abundance) as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing at ICU admission was associated with a 22% increased risk for all-cause infection or death (Freedberg et al., 2018). Additionally, dysbiosis is associated with chronic disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Wischmeyer et al., 2016). In case of elective surgery, influencing or preventing a state of dysbiosis before surgery might lead to a better outcome. The use of novel probiotic strains to boost anaerobic butyrate-producing bacteria could improve resilience to the effect of surgery and hospital stay in general on the microbiota, or even simple nutritional advice or supplementation with vitamins could improve the condition of the patients' microbiota. A possible role for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) also merits consideration (McClave et al., 2018); from a recent study, autologous FMT showed a more rapid recovery than probiotics (Suez et al., 2018). Therefore, \u201cprofiling\u201d the microbiota of a patient before admission could be of relevance. On the other hand, our data showed that microbiota profiling during admission is much more promising from a clinical perspective, due to its potential for predicting post-surgery clinical outcomes, such as length of hospital stay.",

                    "text": "The strength of this study is its longitudinal design: ideally, patients were sampled three times, thereby serving as their own control. This study has several limitations. We had a relatively large number of missing fecal samples. Although in the context of mentioned previously published studies our cohort was relatively large, the sample size is still to be considered small. In future studies, as noted by others (Lankelma et al., 2017), the use of rectal swabs for sequencing could be an attractive alternative especially in large-scale studies, with results similar to those from stool samples (Budding et al., 2014). Differentiating the individual factors responsible for changes in intestinal microbiota is not possible due to the omnipresent use of antibiotics. Also, no (control) patient is withheld from surgery. We did not assess the contribution of all factors potentially influencing the intestinal microbiota composition of the patient, e.g., the use of proton pump inhibitors was not evaluated (Kitsios et al., 2017). Moreover, disentangling the many factors contributing to the disruption of the intestinal microbiota composition is limited by the inherent combination of some of these factors (Dickson, 2016); a patient with a prolonged course due to infectious complications with hemodynamic instability will likely be treated with prolonged antibiotics, possibly from different antibiotic classes, for instance. How these individual factors contributed to the observed association between length of hospital stay and lower alpha diversity at T2, is therefore impossible to say in this study design. Antibiotic use during stay in peripheral hospitals to which patients with uncomplicated courses were transferred was not documented. The use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing limits the resolution of microbial data to the level of genera and, for some taxonomic groups, species, and does not allow profiling bacterial strains or identifying abundances of metabolic functions. Viruses and fungi, although of presumed clinical relevance, were also not targeted by this method. As this study was carried out in a single center setting involving cardiac surgery patients, our results might not be generalisable to all critical care patients. However, despite these limitations, our project is a step forward in understanding the dynamics of the microbiota and holds promising views on potential diagnostic and therapeutic options for ICU patients.",
