The gut microbiome plays an important role in drug metabolism, which can potentially explain some of the variability among individuals regarding treatment efficacy and adverse events14\u201316. Inversely, a substantial amount of nonantibiotic drugs has the potential to affect the composition and function of gut microbial communities, which may also contribute to the wide variability in individual treatment response17.

The bacterial V4 16S rRNA region was amplified and sequenced with a barcoded primer set using 250 base pair, paired end kits on an Illuminia MiSeq platform31. Mothur software was used to curate sequences as described previously32,33. In brief, assembled contigs were filtered for chimeric sequences using UCHIME34 and aligned to a mothur-adapted SILVA bacterial reference database. A 97% cutoff was used to bin sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The number of sequences per sample was rarified to 2500 to prevent bias from uneven sampling. To identify species of interest in butyrate production, a representative binned sequence was identified and blasted against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.

The OTU corresponding to Ruminococcus bromii increased in a subset of individuals, but this was not significant when considering the group as whole (p=0.09). In addition to these organisms, an OTU classified as Clostridium cluster IV (OTU37), which was only initially detected in 3 of the 19 patients, demonstrated an average 3.98-fold increase and exceeded >5% relative abundance in these individuals during resistant starch supplementation. Among the most abundant butyrate-producing species detected in our population\u2014Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale, and E. hallii\u2014there were no significant increases in our population (Figure 5).",

Differences in the amount or quality of diet did not significantly differ between our medication groups; therefore, relating metabolic complications to dietary intake in AAP-treated patients fails to fully understand this relationship. The addition of an AAP to pharmacotherapy may also indicate increased seriousness of disease in bipolar disorder, which may independently affect gut microbial structure41. To account for this potential variable to the best of our abilities, we matched our medication cohorts for previous hospitalizations and other metabolic comorbidities.",

Alistipes have also shown to be decreased in patients with inflammatory bowel disorders42,43. Interestingly, our previous investigation in an independent bipolar cohort also showed Alistipes to drive AAP-associated separation in gut microbial communities33. Maier and colleagues have recently screened over 1,000 marketed drugs against the top 40 representative gut bacterial strains and observed that 24% of the human target drugs inhibit the growth of at least one strain in vitro17. As part of this investigation, the overall medication class of antipsychotics was noted by the authors as exhibiting significant antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, despite the structural dissimilarity of the antipsychotic class of medications, these drugs as a class showed more similar patterns of growth inhibition against specific commensal microbes than was expected from their chemical dissimilarity. Collectively, these results suggest that antipsychotic-associated inhibition of commensal bacteria might be important for the effectiveness or potentially adverse effects associated with these medications. Our cohort exhibited significant differences in diagnosis and concomitant use of medication for hypertension, which is a weakness to this study.",

This, however, was not the purpose of our mechanistic study.

Like previous work investigating prebiotic supplementation in human populations26,46, we observed a variable resistant starch response in microbial communities. On a population level, only increases in B. faecale and B.adolescentis were significant in response to resistant starch. However, when we considered the individual responses to resistant starch, we observed that a subset of the cohort exhibited increases in R. bromii, and three individuals showed fractional increases in an OTU from Clostridium cluster IV. It is not known how our observed variation in resistant starch response translates into functional differences in SCFA production. In the future, quantifying fecal SCFAs and other microbial-derived metabolites will give us critical insight into how AAP-specific changes in microbiome composition affect microbiome output and, ultimately, host phenotype.",

Additionally, we were also able to demonstrate that daily resistant starch supplementation for 14 days was tolerable by this patient population and showed measurable effects on their gut microbiome, including increased organisms associated with starch degradation and SCFA production. These changes can provide mechanistic insights into the effect of AAP use and the potential impact of resistant starch.",
