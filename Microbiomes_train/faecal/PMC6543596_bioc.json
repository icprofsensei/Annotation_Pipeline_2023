In contrast, the gut microbiota was substantially affected across time comparing test with control. In both groups bacterial diversity increased over time but was characterised by a more gradual increment in test compared to control. Compositionally this reflected an enhancement of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonella sp. in the test group. In contrast, the control-fed infants showed increased abundance of adult-like species, mainly within the Lachnospiraceae family, as well as within the Ruminococcus and Alistipes genus. The effects on Bifidobacterium spp. and Lachnospiraceae spp. were previously confirmed through enumeration by fluorescent in situ hybridization and were shown for test to approximate the proportions observed in the HBR. Additionally, microbial activity was affected as evidenced by an increase of l-lactate, a decrease of valerate, and reduced concentrations of branched-chain SCFAs in test versus control.",

Cow\u2019s milk allergy (CMA) is among the most common food allergies in early life and is associated with growth retardation throughout childhood, particularly in children suffering from persistent milk allergy [1]. Comorbidity is common, and many children develop other allergic conditions over time, also referred to as the allergic March [2]. The microbes that colonize the mucosal tissues after birth have a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immune development [3, 4] and may have long-term effects both on the susceptibility and the persistence of allergic disease [5, 6].",

Infants who suffer from severe CMA rely on cow\u2019s milk protein avoidance and, when breastfeeding is not possible, require specialised infant formulas such as extensively hydrolysed formula (eHF) or amino acid-based formula (AAF) [12]. Incorporation of prebiotics, probiotics, or their combination (synbiotics) in these formulas offers a safe, suitable and effective strategy for both the dietary management and for potentially optimizing microbiota development in both IgE- and non-IgE-mediated CMA infants [13, 14].",

This improvement was based on an enhancement of bifidobacteria and a decrease of the Eubacterium rectale/Clostridium coccoides (ER/CC) group; in both test levels were close to the levels observed for a separate healthy, breastfed reference (HBR) group after an 8-week intervention [15]. Recently, it was reported that the levels of both microbial groups were sustained for the full study period of 26\u00a0weeks [16]. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method used is an effective approach to quantify specific bacterial groups, but it does not provide information on the full bacterial composition and diversity of the community. For this, application of next-generation sequencing technologies are typically needed [17, 18]. We hypothesized that synbiotics would have a more comprehensive effect on the microbiota composition and activity. Therefore, we performed an in-depth characterisation of the microbial compositions of both faecal and saliva specimens collected in the ASSIGN study through 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA)-gene sequencing, and in addition investigated the effects on gut physiology and bacterial metabolic activity by analysis of faecal pH, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactate.",

Statistical analysis of the bacterial compositions was performed by applying a combination of multivariate analysis with Canoco 5 software [36], followed by differential abundance testing using the two-part statistics method [37]. Firstly, the constrained ordination method, known as redundancy analysis (RDA), was used to test time-dependent treatment effects with adjustment for stratification factor. The Monte Carlo permutation test (MCPT) with 1000 permutations was used to evaluate statistically significant differences (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) of the resulting model. If found significant, the top-15 responding OTUs identified from the RDA model were subsequently tested for differential abundance at the different timepoints using the two-part statistics method [37]. If the two-part statistics method could not be applied due to a small number of non-zero observations, then only presence-absence was considered by applying the Chi square test (if\u2009\u2265\u20095, but\u2009<\u200910 non-zeros in both groups) or Barnard test (if\u2009<\u20095 non-zeros in one group). The Benjamini\u2013Hochberg false-discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons in the differential abundance tests [38] and significance was considered when FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.1 at week 8 or when FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.1 for at least two visits (i.e. 12 and 26\u00a0weeks).",

Principal component analysis (PCA), which is an unconstrained ordination method [36], was used to explore the taxonomic compositions of saliva and faecal samples. A clear clustering by sample origin was observed (Fig.\u00a01a), which confirms that community composition is primarily determined by body habitat [39]. A summary of the most dominant taxa identified at the bacterial family level showed that saliva compared to faecal samples were typically characterized by increased relative abundance of Streptococcaceae (53.3\u2009\u00b1\u200917.8%), Microcrococcaceae (9.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4%) and Actinomycetaceae (5.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8%). Faecal samples were typically characterized by Bacteroidaceae (20.9\u2009\u00b1\u200918.7%), Lachnospiraceae (15.4\u2009\u00b1\u200912.8%), Enterobacteriaceae (14.2\u2009\u00b1\u200914.2%), Bifidobacteriaceae (7.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2%), Ruminococcaceae (6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2%) and Verrucomicrobiaceae (5.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.7%) (Fig.\u00a01b).\n\n",

We fitted both an RDA with and without correction for timepoint (baseline and week 8) and compared the results of the MCPT on the first axis of the model. The P value for the RDA with correction for timepoint (0.3816) was larger than our pre-set threshold of 0.05, so we used the simpler model (with P\u2009=\u20090.003) as a basis for interpreting the time-dependent treatment effects. The top 15 OTUs with the best fit on the first two axes (explaining most of the variation) were plotted in the RDA (Fig.\u00a03a) and further evaluated for differential abundances between test and control using the two-part statistics method [37]. No differences were observed at baseline (based on FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.1), but two OTUs out of this top 15 were found differentially abundant between test and control at week 8.

FISH enumeration of these two bacterial groups was used to verify the absolute differences in abundance between treatments, of which results have been reported before [15, 16]. In summary, FISH analysis confirmed a significant enrichment of bifidobacteria in test versus control across time (Fig.\u00a04b). Moreover, the proportions for test (36.0\u2009\u00b1\u200922.4%) as compared to that of the control group at week 8 (14.5\u2009\u00b1\u200916.4%) were close to the levels observed for the HBR group (48.1\u2009\u00b1\u200926.5%). The FISH probe used to quantify the ER/CC group targets the majority of Lachnospiraceae spp. including the differentially abundant OTUs associated with the genera Tyzzerella, Blautia and Lachnoclostridium as identified with 16S rRNA-gene sequencing. A decreased abundance of the ER/CC group in test versus control across time confirm these findings (Fig.\u00a04c). Additionally, the levels for test (11.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9%) as compared to that of the control group at week 8 (25.2\u2009\u00b1\u200916.9%) were close to the levels observed for the HBR group (10.4\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6%).",

The additional faecal parameters measured (FISH, pH, SCFAs and lactic acids) were supplemented to this RDA in a separate biplot (Fig.\u00a06b). An inverse correlation was observed for the FISH quantified levels of Bifidobacterium spp. with the ER/CC group, which reflects the major differences observed for test (and HBR) with the control group. Moreover, the increase of Bifidobacterium spp. in test was positively correlated with increased levels of l-lactate. In contrast, the more abundant levels of the ER/CC group across time in control was associated with increased levels of butyrate, valerate, iso-butyrate and iso-valerate. In test, the ER/CC group gradually increased from 12 to 26\u00a0weeks, which was associated (similarly as for control) with an increment of butyrate, valerate, iso-butyrate and iso-valerate at 26\u00a0weeks.\n",

The AAF including synbiotics compared to the AAF without synbiotics showed a more gradual increment over time of bacterial diversity, which is also typically observed in longitudinal studies investigating early life gut microbiota development of breastfed infants as compared to formula-fed infants [7, 8, 41, 42]. These studies showed that the lower diversity of gut microbiota in breastfed infants is not only observed during the exclusive human milk-feeding period, but also during the complementary feeding-period until full transition to family foods, which reflects the sustained effects of human milk oligosaccharides on the bifidobacterial species that effectively thrive on these compounds [7, 8]. The AAF including synbiotics was found to enhance the bifidobacterial community, as several bifidobacterial species had increased, which was also reflected by an increase of the fermentation end-product l-lactate in the faeces of these infants. Interestingly, the concordant increase observed in this study for Veillonella sp. is most likely explained by the ability of this species to utilize and convert lactate into propionate [43]. In contrast, the infants receiving the control formula showed an early adoption of adult-like bacterial taxa belonging to the ER/CC group (resembling Lachnospiraceae spp.), namely Tyzzerella, Blautia and Lachnoclostridium spp., as well as species of Ruminococcus and Alistipes. This increase of adult-like taxa was associated with an increase of valerate and the branched-chain SCFA iso-butyrate, which are fermentation products that result from the degradation of proteins and amino acids [44, 45]. Overall, these results indicate that the synbiotic-supplemented AAF induced a saccharolytic fermentation profile, while infants receiving the AAF without synbiotics showed a more proteolytic fermentation activity, which is generally associated with metabolite profiles that may be less beneficial for colonic health [46, 47].",

However, the common characteristics that were identified in these studies included lower levels of bifidobacteria [49\u201352] and increased levels of members of the heterogenous ER/CC group [48\u201350]. In analogy with our study, the case\u2013control study of Thompson-Chagoyan et al.

The chance of including infants with other (food) allergy presentations were mitigated by applying a robust diagnostic work-up [15]. For a number of subjects, no specimens were available due to insufficient material or not completing the study until 26\u00a0weeks (Table\u00a01), which limited the number of evaluable samples at week 12 and 26. This limitation was however similar in test and control groups and would, therefore, not have affected the observed differences between groups. Moreover, the identified microbial signatures showed very consistent patterns across time and were, regarding the relative abundances of bifidobacteria and the ER/CC group, independently confirmed by 16S rRNA-gene sequencing and FISH. Although, we specifically studied subjects with non-IgE-mediated CMA, Burks et al. [14] showed that an AAF, including ingredients from the current synbiotic blend, was safe in patients with IgE and non-IgE-mediated CMA, and affected the microbial signatures in an equal manner. Importantly, this study was primarily designed to investigate the effects of the synbiotic-containing AAF on gut microbiota and the suitability for the use in dietary management of CMA. As reported previously [14\u201316], the AAF including synbiotics showed reduction of allergic symptoms as seen for the control AAF, and in addition showed potential beneficial systemic effects based on the adverse events, which reported fewer subjects in test with infections and need for anti-infective medication, including antibiotics [14\u201316] and lower use of agents for dermatological purposes [16]. Currently investigations are ongoing to assess whether the AAF including synbiotics influences cow\u2019s milk tolerance acquisition in a clinical trial conducted in infants with confirmed IgE-mediated CMA (Netherlands Trial Register NTR3725).",
