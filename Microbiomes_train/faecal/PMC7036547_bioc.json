Flagellin interacts with the pattern-recognition receptors Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) domain containing 4, leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.4 However, unlike most other TLR agonists, flagellin is also a protein containing many antigenic epitopes, and indeed CD4+ T cells specific for bacterial flagellin are found in both mice and human beings. In mice, CD4+ T cells specific for CBir1, a flagellin derived from a commensal Lachnospiraceae strain, cause colitis when transferred to immunodeficient recipients.5 In human beings, flagellin-specific CD4+ T cells are found in circulation, and in intestinal tissues of IBD subjects are skewed toward a T helper (Th) cell 17/17.1 cell phenotype.6 In terms of flagellin-specific antibodies, approximately 50% of CD patients have circulating anti-CBir1 IgG and IgA antibodies, the presence of which is associated with small-bowel, internal-perforating, and fibrostenotic disease phenotypes.7,8",

Correlation analyses showed that the proportions of Fla2- or FliC-specific CD4+ T cells were significantly positively correlated with each other, indicating that individuals with a strong CD4+ T-cell response to 1 flagellin antigen were likely to have a similarly strong response to the second antigen, although this was not observed for IgG levels (Figure\u00a01D).

Because exposure to the antigens contained in the Pediacel vaccine should have occurred equally among the patient groups (either through vaccination or natural infection), the CD4+ T-cell memory responses to these pooled antigens provided a means to normalize the flagellin-specific responses by accounting for overall reduced frequencies in the CD4+ T-cell memory pool in IBD patients.

In contrast, for IgA, amounts of anti-FliC did not differ, but anti-Fla2 IgA was decreased significantly in UC compared with CD, with a trend of higher levels in CD compared with controls (Figure\u00a04B). We next investigated the possible basis for diminished proportions of SEB-stimulated and Pediacel-specific CD4+ T cells in IBD patients. As expected, there was an inverse correlation between the proportions of Pediacel-specific CD4+ T cells, but not of SEB-stimulated CD4+ T cells, and age. Proportions of FliC-specific, but not Fla2-specific, CD4+ T cells also diminished with age, with no age-associated changes observed for anti-FliC or anti-Fla2 IgG or IgA levels (Figure\u00a04C and D). However, because the healthy controls were age- and sex-matched, the reduced frequency of vaccine-antigen\u2013specific CD4+ T cells in IBD patients was not attributed to age-related changes in immune functions. We also did not observe any consistent effect of treatment (the majority of this cohort was on a biologic treatment) (Table\u00a03) or correlation between Harvey\u2013Bradshaw Index score at the time of the blood draw and the proportion of FliC- or Fla2-specific CD4+ T cells (Figure\u00a04E).",

Specifically, within the antigen-specific CD25+OX40+ cells, we quantified proportions of Th17 (CXCR3\u2212CCR4+CCR6+), Th17.1 (CXCR3+CCR6+CCR4+), Th1 (CXCR3+CCR4\u2212CCR6\u2212), and Th2 (CXCR3\u2212CCR4+CCR6\u2212) cells (gating in Figure\u00a05).19,20 Compared with responses to control antigens, FliC- and Fla2-specific CD4+ T cells in the cohort as a whole were enriched for Th17 and Th17.1, but not Th1 cells (Figure\u00a06A, the n used for each analysis is in Table 5). Surprisingly, comparisons between healthy controls and subjects with IBD showed that FliC-specific Th17 cells were decreased and Fla2-specific Th1 cells were increased in CD, and that Fla2-specific Th17 cells were decreased in UC patients (Figure\u00a06B).

We observed that CD patients had higher frequencies of circulating Th17 cells compared with healthy controls, and higher frequencies of Th17.1 cells compared with UC patients, with no differences in Th1 cells (Figure\u00a06C). Thus, the reduced proportions of FliC-/Fla2-specific Th17 cells in IBD patients is not driven by a systemic loss of differentiation toward these phenotypes. Overall, FliC- and Fla2-specific CD4+ T cells were skewed toward a Th17 cell phenotype. Evidence that this phenotype also was present in healthy controls and diminished in CD patients suggests that Th17-biased CD4+ T-cell responses to flagellin antigens may be a feature of a healthy immune system.",

By using this assay, we found that compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls, both CD and UC patients (the majority of whom were being treated with a biologic therapy) had reduced frequencies of superantigen- and vaccine-specific CD4+ T cells. Our data on vaccine-specific immunity are consistent with a previous study that showed that IBD patients had reduced levels of antidiphtheria or antipertussis antibodies, particularly in subjects receiving anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy,24 and that IBD patients had increased susceptibility to vaccine-preventable illnesses.25 In contrast, another study found that CD patients and healthy controls had similar levels of tetanus toxoid\u2013specific CD4+ T-cell responses,6 but this was determined by measuring proliferation, which can underestimate cellular frequencies. The fact that IBD patients have reduced T-cell immunity to vaccine antigens suggests that the disease and/or treatments affect long-lived, T-cell memory and indicate that future studies of disease-relevant, antigen-specific\u00a0immunity in subjects with IBD should include appropriate disease-irrelevant antigens as controls.",

We also found that anti-Fla2 IgA levels were significantly higher in CD patients compared with UC patients; however, this may be owing to the fact that there were more males in the CD vs UC group (75% vs 30%), because males have higher IgA levels compared with females.28 Overall, although CD4+ T cells are important to generate high-affinity, class-switched antibodies, the lack of correlation between the amounts of circulating antiflagellin antibodies and flagellin-specific T cells shows that for the antigens tested, antibody levels cannot be used to infer relative frequencies of CD4+ T cells.",

Interestingly, and in contrast to the previous study,6 we found that compared with healthy controls the Th17 cell proportion of flagellin-specific CD4+ T cells was reduced in CD and UC patients. This difference may be owing to the fact that Calderon-Gomez et\u00a0al6 defined Th17 cells on the basis of cytokine production after in\u00a0vitro expansion, whereas we quantified them on the basis of ex\u00a0vivo characteristic chemokine-receptor expression. Our data showing reduced Th17 cells are supported by the observation that monocyte-derived dendritic cells from CD patients have an impaired ability to generate Th17 responses from memory cells.

Moreover, the significant inverse correlation between the Harvey\u2013Bradshaw Index and the proportion\u00a0of integrin \u03b27+PD-1+ cells within FliC- or Fla2-specific CD4+ T cells suggests that as disease worsens these cells are no longer in circulation, possibly owing to increased migration to the intestinal tissue. An alternate explanation could be that the phenotype of flagellin-specific cells may influence disease severity, with co-expression of integrin \u03b27 and PD-1 resulting in improved symptoms. Indeed, commensal\u2013specific CD4+ T cells have been reported to be present in intestinal tissue from IBD patients.29 These observations were not driven by different frequencies of integrin \u03b27+ cells between patients and controls, with healthy controls\u2019 unstimulated CD4+ T cells actually containing higher proportions of gut-homing cells. PD-1 has been described as a marker of cellular exhaustion, although this has been largely from studies of CD8+ T cells in the setting of chronic viral infection.30 Evidence for PD-1 marking exhausted CD4+ T cells is limited, with more evidence pointing toward its expression being indicative of increased cell activation and/or of suppressive capacity.31 Therefore, these PD-1+ gut-homing, flagellin-specific cells could represent an activated, suppressive cell subset. The presence of integrin \u03b27+PD-1+ flagellin-specific CD4+ T cells in healthy controls could be a contributing factor to why some cancer patients receiving anti\u2013PD-1 therapy develop IBD.32",

Similarly, a loss of bacterial species that were associated with a healthy microbiome correlated with reduced levels of anti-FliC IgG and Fla2-specific CD4+ T cells.

Comparisons of T- and B-cell responses to FliC vs Fla2 showed that immunity to Fla2, rather than FliC, more accurately discriminates between healthy individuals and CD and UC patients. Notably, neither the proportion nor phenotype of flagellin-specific CD4+ T cells, nor amounts of circulating flagellin-specific IgG or IgA, were different between CD and UC patients, indicating that dysregulated antiflagellin immunity likely is relevant to both diseases. Evidence that changes in adaptive immunity were correlated with intestinal dysbiosis suggest that there could be a previously unappreciated link between alterations in the microbiome and the development and/or amplification of inappropriate immunity to bacteria.",

Plates were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (3% BSA/TBST) for 2 hours at room temperature on a rapid shaker. All washes were performed with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween-20. Plates were washed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with subject plasma diluted 1:100 in 3% BSA/TBST. Standards consisted of pooled high-titer plasma from the study cohort used at one-half serial dilutions from 1/25 to 1/1600. Samples and standards were assayed in triplicate. Plates were washed and incubated with goat anti-human IgG or IgA conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (109-035-088, 109-035-011; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 1:5000 in 3% BSA/TBST for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were developed with tetramethylbenzidine (Becton Dickinson) for 10\u201315 minutes at room temperature and the reaction was stopped by addition of 1 N HCl. The optical density of each well was analyzed at 450 nm on an iMark (BioRad, Hercules, CA) plate reader and analyzed using 5-parameter logistic curve fitting in Prism v7 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA).",

The DADA240 pipeline was applied to truncated reads and taxonomy was assigned using the Naive Bayes pretrained SILVA taxonomic data set (version 13241). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the QIIME2 plug-in, align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree pipeline with default settings. Sequence variants were removed if they appeared in <10% of the samples, or in >10% of the nontemplate controls. Cyanobacteria sequences were removed from analysis because they shared more homology to 16s rDNA of plants than to bacteria. We used National Center for Biotechnology Information basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) to compare our sequence data against 16S rDNA sequences from the species that are the source of FliC (E coli 118UI; GenBank: CP032515.1) and Fla2 (Lachnospiraceae A4; GenBank: DQ789118.1) to identify bacteria with >85% homology.",
