Impaired epithelial barrier function, environmental triggers, genetic susceptibility, as well as an ineffective immune reaction towards the intestinal microbiota, contribute to a chronic intermittent intestinal inflammation.1 2 As IBD affects women in their reproductive years, a common concern for patients with IBD is how pregnancy will affect their disease course, and conversely, how the disease will affect their pregnancy and fetal health. These concerns are not unfounded, as active disease during conception and pregnancy has been associated with worse pregnancy outcomes,3 4 and children of patients with IBD are themselves at increased risk of developing IBD5 due to genetic risk factors as well as parental environmental and microbial factors.6\u20139 Conversely, however, the effect of pregnancy on the maternal IBD disease course is less clear. A postpartum reduction of flares has been observed in both patients with CD and UC,10 11 although these data were disputed by Pedersen et al,12 who found an increased risk of flares in patients with UC both during pregnancy and postpartum. Pregnancy constitutes a unique state, in which hormone-induced physiological changes prepare the body for implantation, fetal growth and parturition. Changes that take place include modulation of immune function to allow for development of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched fetus.13 Thus, maternal immune tolerance was long thought to be increased throughout pregnancy; however, it is now becoming clear that immunological states fluctuate during pregnancy to support different needs at its different stages. Successful implantation requires a proinflammatory Th1 environment at the maternal\u2013fetal interface, which is followed by a shift towards a more tolerogenic Th2 response for the main duration of pregnancy, with again increased polarisation to a Th1 response shortly before partition.14 15 However, it is unclear to what extent placental immunological shifts actually translate to systemic immunological changes capable of affecting disease activity in the intestinal tract, as surprisingly few studies have investigated peripheral changes across the different trimesters of pregnancy, and those that did show conflicting results.16\u201318\n",

Third trimester stool microbiota was shown to harbour inflammatory characteristics, with an overall increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and it is possible that such alterations contribute the inflammatory environment needed for parturition and prepare the maternal body for the energy demands imposed by lactation.24 In non-pregnant patients with IBD, alterations in microbial signatures are already present, with reduced faecal bacterial diversity, decreased presence of commensal butyrate producing bacteria (eg, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria reported as some of the most consistent findings.25\u201327 Whether pregnancy in patients with IBD further modulates the intestinal microbiota and whether microbial changes during pregnancy are associated with diseases state are currently unknown.",

X and Y axes show principal component 1, and principal component prediction ellipses were such that a new observation from the same group will fall inside the ellipse with probability 0.95. Data distribution normality was tested by Shapiro-Wilk test. Comparison of prepregnancy cytokine levels to the individual trimesters was tested with Wilcoxon matched pairs test. Comparison of cytokine patterns over time between trimesters was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Friedman test), followed by Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison post\u00a0hoc analysis.

For microbiome analysis, 46 patients and 179 controls were included (table 1). Patients with IBD and controls were of similar age at time of conception and had similar mode of delivery. IBD women used more assisted reproductive technology (p<0.0001) and were more often nulliparous (p<0.0001). Three patients with IBD used antibiotics during the third trimester for urinary tract or skin infection, with one of these three also using antibiotics during the first trimester. Stillbirth occurred in two patients in trimester 3 (T3). For cytokine levels, a subgroup of 33 patients with IBD and 40 controls was analysed (table 2). In this subgroup, IBD women were younger at time of conception (p>0.0001), had a higher body mass index (BMI) (p=0.002) and were more often nulliparous (p<0.0001) compared with controls. Mode of delivery and birth outcomes were similar between patients with IBD and controls. Specific patient characteristics are summarised in\u00a0online tables S1 and S2. Of 19 patients on biologicals prior to pregnancy, 68% stopped this medication after the second trimester (T2). The number of flares (as assessed by clinician, or based on clinical findings, faecal calprotectin and/or endoscopy) during pregnancy did not vary over the course of pregnancy, nor did HBI for CD or SCCAI for UC/IBD\u00a0unclassified. We concluded that our study group would allow meaningful comparisons between patients with IBD and healthy controls for immunological state and microbiome profiles.",

PCA analysis of these samples demonstrated that overall cytokine profiles were very similar between patients with CD and UC, with samples taken during inflammation not clustering separately (figure 1A). We subsequently investigated levels of individual cytokines during pregnancy as compared with prepregnancy. Figure 1B shows that serum levels of IL-6 (p=0.005, p=0.027, p=0.012 for T1\u20133, respectively), IL-8 (p=0.042 for T1, p=0.012 for T3), IL-12 (p=0.034 for T2), IL-17 (p=0.0078 for T2) and TNF\u03b1 (p=0.039 for T2) decreased significantly on conception.

Usage of 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) and thiopurines did not fluctuate over time. PCA indicates that different treatments are not associated with an overall altered cytokine profile (online\u00a0supplementary figure S2B). We next investigated whether treatment affects individual serum cytokine levels. ANOVA showed no overall differences between the different treatment regimes in terms of cytokine expression (online figure S2C). However when compared only with unmedicated patients, patients on 5-ASA showed lower IL-10 (p=0.0267) and IL-17 (p=0.0428) levels. Patients on anti-TNF\u03b1 single treatment showed significantly lower IL-8 levels as compared with untreated patients (p=0.001). None of the patients stopping anti-TNF\u03b1 in our cohort experienced a flare. Overall, cluster analysis showed that grouping of samples was more dependent on the individual patients rather than the disease manifestation, the presence or absence of intestinal inflammation and the pregnancy trimester from which the sample was obtained or the medication used (online\u00a0supplementary figure S3). Thus, serum proinflammatory cytokine levels (and hence overall immunological state) in patients with IBD decrease on conception and are relatively stable during pregnancy.",

However, analysis of individual cytokines showed that serum levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF\u03b1 changed significantly over the three trimesters in healthy pregnant women (figure 2C, p=0.0124, p=0.0458\u2009and p=0.0030, respectively). Most noticeably, both IL-6 and IL-10 levels showed a significant upregulation towards the third trimester in the healthy controls. However, this upregulation was not seen in pregnant patients with IBD, with IL-10 levels lagging significantly behind healthy controls in the second and third trimester (p=0.0385\u2009and p=0.0016, respectively). In addition, significantly reduced IL-5 levels were observed in patients with IBD during the entire pregnancy (p=0.0194 for T1, p=0.0368 for T2, p=0.0228 for T3). In contrast, IL-8 and IFN\u03b3 levels were increased as compared with controls (IL-8: p<0.0001, p=0.0002\u2009and p=0.0003 for T1 and T3, IFN\u03b3: p=0.0443 for T2, p=0.0130 for T3).

Thus, pregnancy in healthy women is associated with specific changes in peripheral blood cytokines that seem to be largely absent in expecting patients with IBD.",

Unweighted UniFrac demonstrated significant differences in faecal microbiome between patients suffering from colonic versus non-colonic disease (p=0.011) (figure 5A). In addition, we found significant feature differences. In patients with exclusive colonic disease, features such as Bifidobacterium, Turicibacter, Clostridium, Oscillospira and Diallster were highly abundant. In the patients with ileal or ileocolonic disease, the features Methanobrevibacter and Ruminococcus were more abundant (figure 5B). Alpha diversity was higher in samples from patients with colonic disease by using Pielou\u2019s Evenness plot (p=0.02) and Shannon\u2019s diversity index (0.043) (figure 5C, D). Colonic disease in patients with CD is not similar to UC disease: significant differences were seen when comparing colonic and non-colonic CD patient samples to UC samples (unweighted UniFrac beta diversity differences, p=0.035\u2009and p=0.028,\u2009respectively, data not shown).",

LEfSe analysis, which is based on LDA scores highlighted the significant features at each time point (figure 6C\u2013G). Before initiation of pregnancy, women with UC had higher abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis compared with women with CD, who had higher abundances of Ruminococcus gnavus and Escherichia coli (figure 6C). In early pregnancy, women with UC had an over-representation of Bacteroides caccae and the genus Odoribacter, whereas women with CD had increased levels of Blautia obeum (figure 6D). The higher levels of E. coli seen in prepregnant women with CD appeared again in T2. Women with UC had higher levels of the genera Actinomyces, Anaerostipes and Veillonella (figure 6E). Veillonella remained significantly higher in these women in T3 as well, and this was accompanied with higher abundance Blautia and unclassified members of the Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae compared with the CD microbiome in T3, which had higher levels of F. prausnitzii and Ruminococcus bromii (figure 6F). R. bromii remained over-represented postpregnancy too (in CD patients), as opposed to Bacteroides ovatus, Streptococcus and an unclassified member of Lachnospiraceae (higher in T3 as well) that increased postpartum in women with UC (figure 6G). A centroid-based clustergram (figure 6H) allows for visualisation of the differences between the two IBD states and of those observed at the different time points related to pregnancy.",

Pregnant women with CD had significantly higher bacterial evenness (p=0.025) and richness (p=0.03, figure 7A) when experiencing a flare. LEfSe analysis demonstrated several features that were over-represented in women with a flare. These included Collinsella aerofaciens, Bacteroides ovatus, Dorea formicigenerans, Bilophila and the phylum Bacteroidetes in general (figure 7B). For patients with UC, no significant differences were found in richness and evenness measurements (online figure S4A, B), although LEfSe analysis indicated that women suffering from a flare had higher relative abundance of Odoribacter, Bilophila and Parabacteroides distasonis,\u00a0whereas the microbiome of women who did not suffer from a flare was enriched with Coprococcus, Lachnospira and F. prausnitzii.",

No significant differences were observed for different treatments in patients with UC. We also examined the effect of BMI and did not observe any influence on \u03b2-diversity or \u03b1-diversity.

Patients with IBD also had lower bacterial richness as measured by Faith\u2019s PD (figure 9C; p<0.001) and evenness as measured by Pielou\u2019s evenness (figure 9D; p=0.008). We also compared the alpha diversity differences per trimester. Patients with IBD showed a significantly reduced bacterial richness in T1 compared with the controls (figure 9E; p=0.001), which may even be underestimated, as patients with IBD were also more often nulliparous and nulliparity was associated with higher alpha diversity in these patients.

We also observed negative correlations between bacteria, for example, the abundance of Faecalibacterium was correlated to a decrease in abundance of Roseburia at a second timepoint. When modelling the interactions between levels of cytokines and bacterial abundance, we again observed positive and negative correlations. For example, the levels of IL-9 and IL-17 were both correlated with a decrease in the abundance of an unclassified genus of the Rikenellaceae, whereas IL-5 was positively correlated with an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia and Ruminococcus. Overall, these analyses provide a wealth of data detailing the correlations between microbiome, disease type, cytokine profiles and pregnancy.",

Interestingly, some autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, show improvement during pregnancy, while risk of flares increases postpartum.14\u201316 This suggests that pregnancy-induced physiological changes affect immune processes at peripheral sites, and it has been suggested that increased levels of Tregs and a shift towards Th2 cytokine patterns contribute to amelioration of Th1-driven diseases41 42 and conversely also play a role in exacerbation of Th2-driven inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy.43 44 CD is generally thought to constitute a Th1/Th17 disease, while UC is more Th2/Th17 driven, which may explain differences in disease patterns during pregnancy observed between these types of IBD.10 However, while surprisingly little consensus has been reached for other cytokines, one of the most consistent findings in healthy women are rising peripheral blood levels of IL-6 (generally considered a Th1 cytokine) from early to late pregnancy.18 45\u201347 Our own results confirm that changes in cytokine patterns from T1 to T3 are present during healthy pregnancy. However, it was not possible to ascribe our observed changes during pregnancy to either Th2 cytokines (eg, IL-4, IL-5\u00a0and IL-13) or cytokines commonly associated with Th1 responses (IFN\u03b3\u00a0and TNF\u03b1). While we observed increased levels of IL-6 and reduced expression of TNF\u03b1 during late gestation in healthy females, both of these have been ascribed to both Th1 and Th2 cells as well as a range of other cell types.48 Thus, based on our data, it is unlikely that an outspoken Th2 shift during pregnancy ameliorates (auto-)immune diseases. However, in the current study, we do show that several proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17 and TNF\u03b1), known to play a role in IBD pathophysiology,49 50 decrease significantly on conception, suggesting that pregnancy reduces immunological parameters of inflammation in patients with IBD. During pregnancy itself, serum cytokine levels in patients with IBD subsequently remained relatively stable, with reduced levels of IL-5 and IL-10 levels and increased IL-8 and IFN\u03b3 levels compared with control, throughout the three trimesters. Overall, it seems that the immunological state of patients with IBD improves on pregnancy.",

Here, we studied the effect of pregnancy on the UC and CD microbiomes as we know that pregnancy influences the microbiota. The microbiomes of patients with CD and UC remained different from each other throughout pregnancy. However, while before pregnancy, beta diversity differed between patients with UC and CD, the onset of pregnancy caused a shift in beta diversity, which caused the microbiomes to behave similarly diversity\u00a0wise. In general, it seems that as pregnancy progressed changes in bacterial features became more subtle (figure 6H), suggesting a dampening effect of pregnancy on microbial differences. Indeed very few patients experienced relapse of disease during pregnancy. Those patients with CD experiencing a flare had a significantly less diverse and evenly distributed microbiome than patients with CD who did not experience a flare. At the genus level, the only genus increased in both patients with CD and UC who suffered from a flare at any point during pregnancy was Bilophila,\u00a0which has been shown to increase under inflammatory and pathological conditions such as inflammatory disorders and appendicitis52 and has been suggested to be involved in the initiation of IBD.53 However, the butyrate producing F. prausnitzii was over-represented in patients with UC with no relapse. F. prausnitzii is considered to have anti-inflammatory properties which may help dampen the flaring process and has even been considered to have a clinical potential in IBD.54\n",

This trend of lower diversity in patients with IBD has been previously reported51 56 and was expected. To our surprise, we observed that the IBD microbiomes were more similar to one another (lower beta diversity), suggesting that the same species are disappearing during disease from the majority of patients. We could not identify which bacteria differed between the two cohorts as the two cohorts are from different countries and the DNA was isolated using different protocols, and we have previously shown that samples extracted via different methods still show the same diversity patterns but might change at feature levels.19 Nevertheless, we have previously demonstrated that during pregnancy in healthy females microbial diversity decreases.19 The fact that alpha diversity differed between patients with IBD and controls during early pregnancy but decreased at later gestational times indicates that pregnancy in IBD is not followed by an additional loss of diversity on top of the already altered microbial composition in these patients.",
