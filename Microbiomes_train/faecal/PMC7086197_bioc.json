The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of FMT in patients with mild or moderate UC. A single-center, open-label study was designed, including 47 patients with mild or moderate active UC who received three treatments of fresh FMT via colonic transendoscopic enteral tubing within 1 week. The inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire, partial Mayo scores, colonoscopy, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level and procalcitoin values were used to assess the efficacy of FMT and alteration in gut microbiota was detected by 16S ribosomal RNA-sequencing. Before FMT, microbiota Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) levels were significantly decreased in patients with UC compared with healthy donors (P<0.01). At 4 weeks post-FMT, F. prausnitzii levels were significantly increased (P<0.05), and the Mayo score was significantly decreased (1.91\u00b11.07 at baseline vs. 4.02\u00b11.47 at week 4; P<0.001) in patients with UC compared with healthy donors. Steroid-free clinical responses were reported in 37 patients (84.1%), and steroid-free clinical remission was achieved in 31 patients (70.5%) at week 4 post-FMT, however, steroid-free remission was not achieved in any patient. No adverse events were reported in 41 (93.2%) patients after FMT or during the 12-week follow-up. Shannon's diversity index and Chao1 estimator were also improved in patients with UC receiving FMT. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that FMT resulted in clinical remission in patients with mild to moderate UC, and that the remission may be associated with significant alterations to the intestinal microbiota of patients with UC. Furthermore, F. prausnitzii may serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for the use of FMT in UC.",

Over the past 20 years, the incidence and prevalence of IBD has risen sharply in developing areas of the world, including in Asia, South America, the Middle East and Africa (2). In China, the total number of IBD cases between 2005 and 2014 was ~350,000 and it has been predicted that the number of patients with IBD will reach 1.5 million by 2025(2). IBD is primarily caused by the aberrant activation of the immune system in response to abnormal alterations to the gut environment (3). Furthermore, the diverse microbiota in the GI tract serves a critical role in the development of IBD (4). In a previous study, significantly increased levels of Fusobacterium spp. and Enterrococcus faecalis were identified in the feces of patients with IBD compared with healthy controls (5). IBD has also been reported to be correlated with decreased levels of Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, Clostridiales and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and an increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, Proteobacter and Fusobacteriaceae (6).",

The study conducted by Moayyedi et al (13) reported that FMT induced remission in patients with active UC. A total of 70 patients with active UC were treated weekly with FMT or water enema (placebo) for 6 weeks. The remission rate (full Mayo score \u22642; endoscopic Mayo score=0) in the FMT group was significantly higher compared with the placebo group (24% vs. 5%, respectively). A recently published systematic review conducted by Costello et al (16) meta-analyzed 14 cohort studies and 4 RCTs, including 308 FMT-treated patients with UC. In these meta-analyses of RCTs, it was reported that FMT effectively treated UC with a clinical remission rate of 28% (39/140) in patients treated with FMT, compared with 9% (13/137) in patients treated with the placebo. Furthermore, clinical response was achieved in 49% (69/140) of patients treated with FMT compared with 28% (38/137) of patients treated with the placebo. In the 14 cohort studies, 24% (39/168) of patients treated with FMT achieved clinical remission.",

K-2017-103-02). In total, 47 patients (age, 18-75 years) were enrolled over this period. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table I. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. UC was diagnosed based on clinical, endoscopic and histological criteria, including clinically and endoscopically active UC, a total Mayo score of 3-10, a Mayo endoscopy subscore \u22651 and a Physician's Global Assessment subscore \u22642(17). Mild activity was defined as a total Mayo score of 3-5 and moderate activity was defined as a score of 6-10. The exclusion criteria for patients with UC were as follows: Severe disease activity (total Mayo clinical score \u226510); indeterminate colitis; co-morbid chronic disease; food allergy; irritable bowel syndrome; history of bowel cancer, pregnancy or other severe diseases, including diabetes and cancer; GI surgery (except for appendicectomy) during the 3 months before enrollment; used antibiotics or probiotics during the 4 weeks before enrollment; and had been followed up for <8 weeks. Furthermore, patients with GI infections, including parasitic and C. difficile infections, were excluded from the study. During the current study, concomitant treatments using 5-aminosalicylic acid, immunomodulators or anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents were permitted, as long as the dose was stable prior to enrollment. Furthermore, patients were not allowed to take antibiotics, probiotics or corticosteroids during the present study, and patients who were previously on steroid treatment (corticosteroids) were taken off of the treatment 1 month prior to enrollment.",

At 1 day post-TET insertion, 150 ml physiological saline containing ~50 cm3 centrifuged microbiota was infused into the entire colon of the patient via the TET tube. Patients were required to remain in the right lateral position for \u226530 min after FMT (to maintain the largest contact area between microbiota and intestines) and were allowed to eat 2 h later. The FMT procedure was repeated every other day for a total of 3 treatments, with each patient only receiving FMT obtained from the same donor (20). The FMT of each donor was batched and fecal samples were stored at -80\u02daC until further use.",

After FMT, three patients dropped out of the study before week 4, therefore, only 44 patients were included in the analyses at week 4 and 12. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table I, and the FMT outcomes are summarized in Table II. At week 4, steroid-free clinical response and steroid-free clinical remission were observed in 37 (84.1%) and 31 (70.5%) patients, respectively. Steroid-free remission was not achieved in any patient (Table II). Accordingly, the patients were categorized into responder and non-responder groups. These two groups displayed no significant differences in their baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (Table III). The clinical response rate was higher in patients with mild active UC (18/23, 78%) compared with patients with moderate active UC (16/21, 76%), although no statistical significance was observed between these two groups. The clinical response rate in patients with a lower Mayo endoscopic subscore (10/13, 77%) was similar compared with patients with a higher subscore (24/31, 77%; Table III). Furthermore, the UC endoscopic index of severity scores suggested a similar outcome to the Mayo endoscopic subscores (Table III). The association between the clinical response rate and clinical parameters, including age, sex, smoking, disease extent, disease duration, IBDQ scores, concomitant drug use and donors, was also assessed, and no significant associations were identified (P>0.05; Table III). The Mayo clinical score was significantly decreased at week 4 compared with the baseline score in the FMT group (4.02\u00b11.47 at baseline; 1.91\u00b11.07 at week 4; P<0.001; Fig. 1). At week 4, the mucosal activity was reassessed by colonoscopy in 10 responders. All 10 responders displayed a steroid-free endoscopic response (Mayo endoscopy subscore \u22641 with a reduction of \u22651 point from the baseline) and none achieved steroid-free endoscopic remission (Mayo endoscopy subscore=0; Table II). Representative images of the colons of two responders displaying steroid-free endoscopic remission are presented in Fig. 2. No serious complications, including anaphylactic shock or septicemia, occurred in 41/44 patients following FMT or during the 12-week follow-up. Increased diarrhea frequency was reported in three patients within 24 h of FMT, and two patients experienced abdominal pain within 6 h of FMT. These AEs were short-term, and disappeared within 1 day without any medical intervention. Of the patients with UC, 94% (32/34) of responders and 60% (6/10) of non-responders were willing to undergo FMT again (data not shown).",

Patients with UC displayed a decreased abundance in Ruminococcus_2 and Faecalibacterium, and an increased abundance in Bifidobacterium, Escherichia-Shigella, Faecalitalea, Streptococcus, Aeromonas and Proteobacter (Fig. 4).

The Mayo clinical score significantly decreased at week 4 compared with the baseline in FMT treated patients (1.91\u00b11.07 vs. 4.02\u00b11.47; P<0.001). No AEs occurred in 93.2% (41/44) of patients after FMT or during the 12 weeks of follow-up (data not shown). The results suggested an improved effect of FMT in patients with UC compared with previous studies (13,28-30). The improved efficacy displayed in the present study may be explained by the modified FMT procedures used, including stool preparation (feces exposure to air for <30 min), microbiota resource (fresh; all FMTs for one patient were derived from the same donor), delivery route (via TET tube; remained in the right lateral position for 30 min to maintain the largest contact area between microbiota and intestines), dosage (150 ml to avoid inducing intestinal peristalsis) and intensity (three times within one week).",

In the majority of previous studies (32-35), donor stool was mixed in normal sterile, non-bacteriostatic saline, which is presumed to guarantee the quality of microbiota. Subsequently, the mixture was homogenized, often manually, and filtered using a gauze, strainer or coffee filter. This purification process may alter the bacterial levels in the fecal suspension. In the present study, the fresh donor feces were microfiltered and centrifuged using an automatic purification system, which ensured the quality of fecal microbiota in the suspension.",

Hamilton et al (38) reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat C. difficile infection. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing has displayed stable engraftment of gut microbiota following FMT (39). Moayyedi et al (13) reported efficacy of frozen-thawed stool in FMT for active UC. Furthermore, other previous studies have reported that both frozen (15) and fresh (13,14) donor stool were effective for UC. However, Nishida et al (40) doubted the efficacy of using fresh stool for FMT in patients with UC, but the present study further suggested that this application was efficacious in UC. Another debate regarding FMT is whether pooled or single donor stool results in the highest efficacy. In a study including 81 patients who received FMT or placebo enemas for 5 days a week for 8 weeks, Paramsothy et al (15) used pooled donor stool. The aim when using pooled donor stool was to increase the diversity of microorganisms in the stool suspension. Cao et al (12) reported that 27% of the patients in the FMT group displayed steroid-free clinical and endoscopic remission at week 8 compared with 8% in the placebo group (P=0.02). However, in a study conducted by Rossen et al (14), no statistically significant difference in clinical and endoscopic remission between the FMT and control groups of patients with mild to moderate active UC was reported. However, the microbiota of the responders displayed distinct features compared with the non-responders. A key advantage of a pooled stool is that it increases the chances of transmitting key bacteria to the recipient; however, it is not clear whether this hypothesis is translated into real efficacy (41,42).",

According to two retrospective studies (45,46), nasointestinal delivery can be uncomfortable and result in a number of AEs, including severe nausea, vomiting, reduced food intake and sensory discomfort; delivery of the fecal microbiota suspension to the cecum may be difficult with the retention enema method; furthermore, the FMT capsule preparation increases the exposure time of the microbiota to the air, thus affecting bacterial activity. In the present study, a TET fixed to the cecum was used for the delivery of the fecal microbiota suspension to ensure the infusion of fecal microbiota into the whole colon. The high remission rate in the present study may be explained by the standardized and automatic purification process, fresh microbiota, appropriate dosage and intensity, and use of TET.",

                    "text": "The gut microbiota is involved in the development of intestinal inflammation and UC. Therefore, microbial manipulation could be an alternative therapeutic approach for UC (47). FMT may serve as an effective treatment strategy for UC, as it is able to correct the altered gut microbial community and restore microbial homeostasis (48). In the present study, both the diversity (Shannon's diversity index) and abundance (Chao1 estimator) of the fecal microbiota were markedly decreased in patients with UC compared with healthy donors. However, both indexes at pre-FMT, and weeks 4 and 12 post-FMT displayed no significant difference. The results of the present study suggested that the majority of patients with UC achieved steroid-free clinical response or remission, but no steroid-free remission, after receiving FMT, indicating that FMT may ameliorate UC, but did not cure the disease. Therefore, it could be suggested that patients with UC may require repeated FMT to treat the disease.",

                    "text": "Consistent with previous studies, the present study suggested that alterations to the enteric microbiota following FMT were primarily manifested by the decrease of pathogenic bacteria (for example, Faecalitalea and Proteobacter) and the increase of probiotic bacteria (for example, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium). However, pathogenic bacterium Escherichia-Shigella decreased at 4 weeks post-FMT but then increased at 12 weeks post-FMT compared with pre-FMT, possibly due to a reduction in the inhibitory effect of probiotics on pathogens over time. The present study focused on alterations to the abundance of F. prausnitzii, which is a type of anti-inflammatory and health-promoting probiotic (49). In the intestine, F. prausnitzii produce butyrate, a major energy source for colonocytes to fight against IBD (50). In addition, butyrate can reduce intestinal mucosa inflammation by inhibiting NF-\u03ba\u03b2 transcription factor activation, upregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 expression and inhibiting interferon-\u03b3 expression (51). F. prausnitzii abundance is correlated with various IBD-related signaling pathway mediators, including T helper 17 cells/interleukin (IL)-17, forkhead box 3-T regulatory-transforming growth factor-\u03b2/IL-10 and IL-23(52). A decreased abundance of F. prausnitzii is associated with the development and recurrence of UC (49). Similarly, it has been suggested that F. prausnitzii can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD (53). In the present study, the abundance of F. prausnitzii was significantly decreased in patients with UC compared with healthy donors. After FMT, the levels of F. prausnitzii were significantly increased at week 4 compared with the baseline, but remained lower compared with healthy donors. F. prausnitzii abundance is strongly correlated with the diagnostic and therapeutic effectiveness of FMT (54).",

Firstly, the present study was an open-label study and not a double-blind RCT; therefore, the results may have included potential bias from the researchers and patients, and the placebo effect cannot be ruled out. Secondly, the limitations of TET are as follows: i) Patients had to take purgatives to clean the colon, which may have influenced the gut flora; ii) although the TET tube was maintained in the same position for repeated FMT delivery, the tube usually fell out of place spontaneously at ~1 week, therefore it may be difficult to use the TET method for long-term delivery; and iii) the TET tube was positioned using colonoscopy, therefore it could be suggested that the method is only suitable for diseases that occur near to the anus, and is not ideal for diseases localized in the small intestine. Thirdly, partial Mayo scores were used as important criteria for classifying disease severity, however, these scores are primarily focused on clinical symptoms. Furthermore, the mucosal activity was only determined by colonoscopy in 10 responders and not in all patients. Therefore, endoscopic remission or responses could not be investigated in the present study. Fourthly, the ESR and other related inflammatory indicators in non-responders were slightly increased after FMT. It was hypothesized that FMT could introduce a large number of exogenous gut microbiota into the patient's intestine, which might increase intestinal immunity. However, in the present study individual differences were not excluded and a larger sample size is required to further investigate the efficiency of FMT for UC. Finally, the observation period was only 12 weeks; therefore, future studies are required to assess the long-term outcomes of the TET therapeutic strategy for UC.",

                    "text": "The therapeutic role of FMT in UC varies in different reports, as evidenced by the rate of clinical response ranging between 39 and 55% in four RCTs investigating the use of FMT in UC (55). Ramai et al (36) reported that the clinical response in patients at 1 month and 3 months after FMT was 74.3 and 51.4%, respectively. A pilot study in India reported 87.1% clinical response, 58.1% endoscopic remission and 45.2% histological remission at week 48 post-FMT (29). The patients with UC treated with FMT in the present study displayed a steroid-free clinical response rate of 84.1 and 77.3% at week 4 and week 12, respectively. The high response rate may have been due to the following reasons: i) The modified FMT procedures, including stool preparation, microbiota resource, delivery route, dosage, and intensity; ii) certain patients had an irregular medical history of taking antibiotics and hormones due to repeated enteritis, which may have been a reason for repeated episodes of UC; iii) the donors in the present study were young and had good habits and lifestyles, making the composition of the gut microbiota active and compatible. However, the FMT method requires further investigation into the effects of antibiotic use before FMT, fresh or frozen administration, and the location (upper GI or lower GI tract) and frequency of administration. In the present study, the TET procedure, frequency of administration and use of 150-200 g fresh donated feces were based on previous studies investigating the use of FMT treatment for UC (21,31,56,57). In addition, the 16S sequencing results of the present study suggested that the relative abundance of F. prausnitzii significantly increased at 4 weeks post-FMT, which had not been reported in previous FMT studies. F. prausnitzii is an important short-chain fatty acid bacteria in the intestine; therefore, it has been suggested that FMT should focus on the separation and cultivation of functional bacteria (49).",
