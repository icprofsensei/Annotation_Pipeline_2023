Furthermore, whole metagenome shotgun sequencing identified 332 bacterial SEED functions that were enriched in the high exposure group. A separate model showed that these genes, which included genes involved in virulence and multidrug resistance, were positively correlated with arsenic concentration within the group of children in the high arsenic group. We performed reference free genome assembly, and identified strains of E.coli as contributors to the arsenic enriched SEED functions. Further genome annotation of the E.coli genome revealed two strains containing two different arsenic resistance operons that are not present in the gut microbiome of a recently described European human cohort (Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract, MetaHIT). We then performed quantification by qPCR of two arsenic resistant genes (ArsB, ArsC). We observed that the expression of these two operons was higher among the children with high arsenic exposure compared to matched controls.",

Recently, arsenic\u2019s ability to affect microbes has been proposed as a possible mode of action [13] yet there have been very few studies examining the effect of arsenic on the microbiome of humans [14]. This is somewhat surprising given that arsenic is known to have antimicrobial properties and was used to treat infectious diseases in the pre-antibiotic era [15]. Furthermore, the role of microbes -and specifically gut microbiota- on human health has exploded in the past decade and there are reports demonstrating the mechanistic role of gut microbiota in cancer[16], type 2 diabetes [17], cardiovascular disease [18], and infectious diseases [19]\u2014the same diseases that are increased in populations exposed to chronic arsenic exposure.",

Furthermore, arsenic in drinking water crosses the placenta [22] but arsenic is not transmitted in breast milk [23]. This leads to discrete exposure periods during gestation and early childhood. Since the gut is colonized immediately after birth [24], it is important to understand the potential for arsenic exposure to affect children\u2019s gut microbiota using measures of arsenic exposure near the time of delivery. Therefore, the overall goal of this study was to conduct a preliminary investigation that evaluated the association between arsenic exposure and intestinal microbiota in children who resided in an arsenic-endemic region of Bangladesh. We hypothesize that the composition of intestinal microbiota would be different in children who had high arsenic exposure during the perinatal and prenatal period compared to children matched by age, sex, and residence that had low arsenic exposure at this same developmental time point.",

Thus, two separate statistical analyses\u2013where microbial differences were evaluated between high and low arsenic exposure groups and where microbial abundance was correlated with arsenic concentrations expressed as a continuous variable\u2013showed that arsenic exposure was related to the composition of gut microbiota. We only conducted the correlation analysis among the high arsenic exposure group because this group contained a range of arsenic values. The vast majority of the arsenic concentrations in the low arsenic exposure group were below the limit of detection. It was not possible to combining both groups due to the strong underlying biomodal distribution in arsenic exposure which was a feature of the recruitment strategy and resulted in heteroscedasticity.",

Comparison between high and low arsenic exposure groups revealed no differentially abundant KEGG functions (S1 Table). Since shotgun whole genome sequencing provides actual genome content information, we then inferred SEED functions[27] from this data by mapping reads to nr protein database and using MEGAN4 (MEtaGenome Analyzer) [28] to map to SEED functions. We then compared SEED functions between high and low arsenic exposure groups to evaluate the association between arsenic exposure and taxonomic composition. This analysis identified 901 bacterial genes with differential abundance (two-tailed P <0.1) (Fig 2A, left; S2 Table) that was dependent upon arsenic exposure status. We then examined the correlation between the 901 bacterial genes and arsenic concentrations in drinking water among the high arsenic exposure group. We are interested in bacterial genes that were either 1). enriched in the high arsenic exposure group and positively correlated with arsenic concentration in drinking water, or 2). had lower abundance in high exposure group and negatively correlated with arsenic level in high exposure group. By combining statistical analysis result from class comparison and correlation, we identified a set of 332 microbial genes to be associated with arsenic exposure (FDR <0.1; S2 Table; Fig 2A, right), and we refer to this as the arsenic-enriched gene set in the following analyses.",

For this analysis, we matched the 332 bacterial genes to fully sequenced bacterial genomes available at NCBI and ranked the genomes by the proportion of 332 genes they contained (Fig 2B, left). Top ranking genomes were Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica with over 70% of the 332 seed genes corresponding to the genomes of these two species (Fig 2B, right). To avoid bias in the reference genome database used in this analysis, we assembled genomes of MGS (metagenomic species) from our samples using a reference free approach (S3 Fig) that bins genes from the same genome together based on their similar abundances across multiple samples[29]. For the assembled 100 large genomes (number of ORFs (Open Reading Frames) in the genome >97, S7 Table), we annotated the ORFs in the genome with SEED functions. Then, we examined if the functions in each genome showed enrichment with the subset of 332 arsenic related SEED functions. From this analysis, one genome MGS0010 showed a significant tendency for enrichment within the 332 arsenic related SEED functions compared to all other genomes (odds ratio 6.69, FDR 1.08e-48) (Fig 2C, S8 Table). This enrichment remained significant when the different level of genome completeness was controlled (data not shown). Taxonomy assignment of the genome revealed that the genome was assigned to E.coli (>90% of the ORFs in the genomes were assigned to species E.coli).These results suggest that E. coli is the genome that contributed to the SEED functions enriched among the high arsenic exposure group.",

We observed that 78% of arsenic-enriched genes (258 genes) were also found in the bacteria surviving long-term antibiotic treatment in the mouse gut (Fig 2A; S3 Table). This association was still significant when controlling for the E.coli genome as a confounding factor (S4 Table). Using CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) database[33], we found three known antibiotic resistance genes (ermB, qnrS8, cfxA4) had a moderately higher abundance in the arsenic-enriched subset but no statistically significant associations were observed (S6A Fig). We also examined the correlation between arsenic exposure expressed as a continuous variable with the 258 genes. This analysis showed three additional antibiotic-resistance genes (soxS, marA, cpxR) tended to be positively correlate with arsenic levels. By integrating the group comparison and the correlation results, we have tentative results that suggest that the six genes are possibly related to arsenic exposure (combined Fisher P of <0.05, FDR 0.89).

For example, Lu et al observed that mice given oral exposure to 10 ppm arsenite for 4 weeks resulted in changes in composition of gut microbiota [13]. However, the changes in the microbial communities observed by Lu et al were different than those observed in our study. This could be attributed to at least two possible factors. First, while we studied chronic arsenic exposure that occurred during early development, Lu et al studies acute high arsenic exposure in adult animals. These different exposure scenarios would place gut microbiota under two very different toxic gradients. Secondly, the dissimilarities between our and Lu et al\u2019s results could be attributed to the differences between human and mouse gut microbiota. Interestingly, an ecological study that examined soil microbial communities found an increased proportion of Proteobacteria in arsenic contaminated soil which corresponds our observation of increased Proteobacteria in gut microbiota of arsenic-exposed children [35]. Notably, besides observing a similarity to our results at taxonomic level, this study reported an increased nucleic acid sequence diversity of ACR3, a gene involved in arsenic metabolism.",

Although the connection between environmental arsenic contamination and antibiotic resistance has been previously reported [36], our results provide a novel view on this problem. While our analyses demonstrated few antibiotic-resistance genes (6 out of 3006 genes from antibiotics-resistance CARD database [33]) increased in arsenic-associated microbes, the overall similarity of gene content between antibiotic and arsenic enriched microbiota is very high (Fig 2A). Such a strong resemblance can potentially be explained by the fact that arsenic may select microbes containing genes with general resistance to different toxic compounds (such as efflux pump TolC) including metals and antibiotics.",

Also, we assigned children into the two exposure categories based on the amount of arsenic measured in their household\u2019s drinking water. We did not have biomarkers of exposure to confirm exposure status.

For instance, we categorized this population based on prenatal arsenic exposure levels and examined the microbiota in children up to 6 years later. Because the exposure was examined prospectively, it is not possible to ascertain whether the observed microbiome alternations were due to colonization at birth, during early childhood, or a function of continuous arsenic exposure. It is likely that children would have been exposed through drinking water and dietary sources upon weaning [39]. Given the dynamic changes that occur in gut microbiota [24], it would be interesting to collect fecal samples from the mother during the prenatal period and repeated samples from both the mother and child during early childhood to answer this question. Another interesting approach would be to examine the role of breastfeeding since it is known that arsenic is not transmitted through breast milk [23]. Despite the effects of breastfeeding on gut microbiome [40], comparing breastfed to bottle fed infants could potentially isolate the effect of arsenic exposure on gut microbiome.",

This is in agreement with the general idea that gut microbiome is influenced by the environment the host is exposed to. In addition, the observation of higher abundance of arsenic detoxification genes (ArsB, ArsC) in high exposure groups indicate the cells possess arsenic resistant potential could have higher fitness when exposed to this xenobiotics. Moreover, the arsenic resistant system (ArsRBC), when working, by reducing As(V) into As(III) via a cytoplasmic arsenate reductase (ArsC) and extruding the latter from the cellular compartment by means of a membranous As(III) efflux pump (ArsB). This possibly would affect both other members of the microbiome and host through more available arsenic they are in contact with. This sheds light on how xenobiotics could shape microbiome composition and how hosts with different microbiomes could respond differently to xenobiotics.",

Women were eligible to participate if they were \u226518 years old with a singleton pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound at the time of enrollment, would continue receiving prenatal care through Dhaka Community Hospital (DCH) affiliated clinics, used the same groundwater well as the source of their drinking water for at least the six months prior to enrollment. In this cohort, data shows that arsenic concentrations in maternal drinking water were significantly correlated with arsenic concentrations measured in cord blood (\u03c1 = 0.47) as well as infant toenails (\u03c1 = 0.36) and hair collected within one month of birth (\u03c1 = 0.39) [38]. In the first recruitment phase, we included women who were <28 weeks gestation (N = 52) but in the latter two recruitment phases this criteria changed to \u226416 weeks gestation. This change in enrollment criteria arose after field teams realized they could recruit women earlier in their pregnancy which would yield a more nuanced exposure assessment during early gestation. Trained field staff orally administered questionnaires in Bangla to collect information about their medical, pregnancy, and drinking water histories. As an incentive for participation, all women were provided with free prenatal care from DCH and prenatal vitamins that were replenished during monthly checkups in the participants\u2019 homes.",

Individual samples were barcoded, pooled to construct the library, and then sequenced using an Illumina Miseq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to generate pair-ended 250 nt reads. The raw forward-end fastq files were quality-filtered, demultiplexed, and analyzed using \u201cquantitative insights into microbial ecology\u201d (QIIME) [46]. For quality filtering, the default parameters of QIIME were maintained in which reads with a minimal Phred quality score of <20, containing ambiguous base calls and containing fewer than 187 nt (75% of 250nt) of consecutive high-quality base calls, were discarded. Additionally, reads with three consecutive low-quality bases were truncated. The samples sequenced were demultiplexed using 12 bp barcodes, allowing 1.5 errors in the barcode. UCLUST [47] (http://www.drive5.com/uclust) was used to choose the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a threshold of 97% sequence similarity against the greengenes database. A representative set of sequences from each OTU were selected for taxonomic identification of each OTU by selecting the cluster seeds. The greengenes OTUs (version gg_12_10) reference sequences (97% similar) were used for taxonomic assignment using BLAST [48] with e-value 0.001. Shannon\u2019s alpha diversity and beta diversities were calculated using QIIME. KEGG function prediction from 16S rRNA gene OTU table was performed using PICRUST galaxy server (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/root?tool_id=PICRUSt_normalize)",

On average 2\u201318 million reads per sample were obtained. Sequences with at least one ambiguous nucleotide were filtered out by prinseq [49]. Trimmomatic [50] was used to filter out Illumina adaptor sequences (under parameters: seed mismatches:1, palindrome clip threshold: 10 and simple clip threshold: 10), to remove leading and trailing low quality bases (below quality 3), to scan the read with a 4-base wide sliding window, and to cut when the average quality per base drops below 20 and to drop reads that are below 60 bases long.

Redundant contigs were removed (shorter contigs whose 90% sequence were covered with 100% identity by a longer contig) resulting in 1,800,290 contigs. Contigs longer than 300 nucleotides were subjected to ORF prediction using MetaGene Mark [57], resulting in 1,179,372 non-redundant ORFs(95% identity covering more than 90% of a shorter redundant ORF). Abundance of ORFs are estimated by using SOAPaligner [55] to align reads to ORFs under default parameters (equal best hits are randomly assigned to one of the best hits) and using SOAP.coverage to generate ORF length normalized sequencing depth using downsized samples (1.3 million reads per sample). Co-abundant gene groups were generated using canopy clustering algorithm described previously[29]. Contigs that belong to each MGS were retrieved by their blastn similarity to an ORF in the MGS with more than 95% identity and more than 90% coverage of the ORF. Genome assembly completeness and contamination for the contigs in a MGS was assessed by CheckM [58]. Taxonomy assignment of the ORFs was performed by blastn against 5242 complete and draft bacterial genomes from NCBI FTP site under e-value 0.001. For species level assignment we required sequence identity more than 95% on more than 100bp length. A MGS was assigned to a species if more than 50% of its ORFs are assigned to a species. SEED function assignment of ORFs was generated by searching NCBI nr database using RAPSearch2 e-value 0.001 followed by MEGAN4 assignment. Arsenic metabolism gene annotation of ORFs was performed by blastx search against BacMet database predicted arsenic metabolism protein dataset (http://bacmet.biomedicine.gu.se/download/BacMet_PRE.40556.fasta). For the ORFs and contigs in Bangladeshi children cohort, we searched their homologs in the European cohort[59] by blastx and blastn against the ORF (ftp://public.genomics.org.cn/BGI/gutmeta/UniSet/UniGene.pep.gz) and contig sequences (ftp://public.genomics.org.cn/BGI/gutmeta/UniSet/UniContig.fa.gz) in the European cohort respectively.",
