Biomarkers did not change significantly during the study. PID3, with HIV > 35 years, had chronic constipation that resolved with FMT with a large shift in distribution but recurred at Week 26. Fusobacterium gonidiaformans, Porphyromonas somerae, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae comprised 27% of his microbiome at Week 0 but 0.73% at Week 6; untyped Bacteroides comprised 35% at Week 6.
