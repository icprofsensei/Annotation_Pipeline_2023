There is wide variation in the specific composition of the microbiota of the GI tract between individuals, but the microbial community appears to be relatively stable within an individual (2). The composition of the intestinal microbiota has been implicated in the recurrence of Crohn\u2019s disease, since antibiotics (metronidazole and ornidazole) delay the recurrence in the neo-terminal ileum after surgical resection (3, 4). The study of the intestinal microbiota has been revolutionized by the use of molecular-based methods, many of which target the 16S rRNA-encoding gene. These methods circumvent the main disadvantage of traditional culture-based approaches, which fail to grow and identify more than half of the species in the gut (5\u20137). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) is a molecular method that utilizes restriction enzyme digestion to identify 16S sequence heterogeneity. Sequence heterogeneity is then used as a proxy for different bacteria. T-RFLP is suitable for rapid, low-cost analysis of samples from a multiple subjects (8). This approach has been used to study the intestinal microbiota in many published studies (9\u201316).",

Contamination with bacteria that are not from the biopsy site (2, 17\u201320) can occur when the forceps passes through the colonoscope channel, particularly if colonic contents have been suctioned through the channel during the procedure. Eckburg, et al. showed that the abundance of constituent bacterial species of the microbiota is patchy and that the distribution of these species is heterogeneous from the small bowel to the colon (2). It is clear that human cecal microbiota differs quantitatively and qualitatively from the fecal microbiota (2, 21). Furthermore, the local gut associated microbiota is more likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD than the fecal microbiota (19, 20). Thus, in order to study the role of the microbiota in particular locations (i.e. the neo-terminal ileum), it is necessary to obtain biopsies from the site itself, rather than assuming that the fecal microbiota is representative of proximal locations in the GI tract. The aim of this study was to determine whether sterile sheathed forceps are needed to obtain ileal microbiota samples that are not contaminated with colonic bacteria.",

The wax plug was composed of 4 parts turnip wax (International group# Microsere 5981A, which meets the FDA requirements set forth in 21 CFR 172.886 for use in food articles) and 1 part petrolatum jelly (Vaseline) to obtain a plug compatible with sterilization that was easily extruded when the terminal ileum was reached. After forceps assembly in our laboratory, these were sterilized in ethylene oxide at the University of Michigan Hospital sterile supply services facility. Successful sterilization was indicated by change of color on a gas sterilization test strip. The University of Michigan Biomedical Engineering Unit certified the sheathed forceps for use in human subjects.",

Each type of forceps was passed through the colonoscope, and extended out of the colonoscope (and sheath, if present). The forceps were opened and closed, then withdrawn into the colonoscopy (and sheath, if present). The forceps were withdrawn from the colonoscope, extended and opened so that the jaws could be shaken in 1 mL of sterile saline.

The allocation sequence was generated with the uniform function in Stata 10.1 by PDRH, and allocations were written on paper and sealed in opaque security envelopes until the patient was consented and sedated for colonoscopy. The participants were consented, and envelopes opened and randomization order assigned by MNC and JF. We obtained 2 pairs of biopsy specimens from adjacent locations (proximal vs. distal) in the terminal ileum using the sheathed and unsheathed forceps. The biopsy specimens were collected from a single pass with a new sterile (sheathed or unsheathed) forceps used for each biopsy specimen. Each biopsy specimen was transferred from the spike of the forceps using a sterile 20 gauge blunt needle to a sterile 2 mL screw-cap cryovial kept on dry ice. The tissue samples were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (\u221270\u00b0 C) and transferred to the lab.

BCI is an ecological diversity index that ranges in value between 1 (communities are identical) and 0 (communities are completely different) and takes into account the presence/absence of a species as well as its relative abundance (27). Because the results of T-RFLP identify distinct terminal restriction fragments (TRFs), rather than species, ecological diversity measures were adapted to use TRFs.

In another four subjects, at least one of the 4 biopsy specimens did not yield any T-RFLP peaks, so they were excluded from the analysis. Despite these dropouts, randomization by forceps type was successful and samples were collected using sheathed forceps first in 15 patients and unsheathed first in 12 patients. The baseline demographics of these subjects and their indications for colonoscopy are presented in Supplementary Table 1.",

Therefore, PCR amplicons represent all members of the bacterial community of a sample. Since the forward primer in the T-RFLP PCR is fluorescently labeled and an endonuclease is used to digest amplicons at unique restriction sites, the length of terminal restriction fragments represents unique bacterial members of the community (i.e. different alleles of the 16S locus vary in restriction sites) and can be quantified using a capillary nucleotide sequencer (25). Amplicons of the same size increase the fluorescent signal (chromatogram peak height) so that the area within a chromatogram peak is a proxy for the abundance of a particular bacterium. Therefore, data generated by T-RFLP is both the length of a terminal fragment (presence of a particular bacterium) and the abundance of a terminal fragment (the abundance of a particular bacterium). One community ecology metric (a standard of measurement) that incorporates both the presence/absence of a species and its relative abundance is called the Bray-Curtis similarity index. This metric was used to evaluate the similarity between the communities (samples) in this study. To visualize the similarity among the communities, a dendrogram was constructed based on all pairwise (sample-to-sample) Bray-Curtis values (Figure 3). To appreciate the similarity of two particular communities, one simply needs to note the branch length that connects each community. Shorter branch lengths represent similar communities, while longer branch lengths represent dissimilar communities.",

A similar result was obtained using the Shannon-Wiener index (H'). On average, H' was similar between forceps samples (7.51 for unsheathed vs. 7.38 for sheathed) and was not statistically different (t-test p=0.316) (Figure 3B). Thus, the overall microbial diversity was not significantly different between samples obtained with the sheathed and unsheathed forceps. The range of H' values calculated for sheathed samples was wider than that obtained for unsheathed forceps. This observation suggests that samples obtained using unsheathed forceps have less variability in TRF richness (TRF presence) or evenness (relative abundance of organisms). It is difficult to tell from these data the source of the variation in sheathed samples (richness or evenness), but it is clear that sheathed forceps do not consistently sample less or more bacterial diversity than unsheathed forceps. It is important to point out that these results are only as relevant as the individuals from which they were obtained. Given the uniqueness of the human GI tract microbiota, it is possible that the mean and range of microbial diversity reported here (H' values) may change as more individuals are sampled, but on average we find little evidence that these changes will be influenced by whether the samples are taken with sheathed vs. unsheathed forceps.",

T-RFLP relies on PCR amplification with broad-range primers, which do not amplify the 16S sequences of some rare bacteria. In addition, two distinct species of bacteria can potentially produce the same T-RFLP peak in their profile, potentially obscuring some species diversity. Also, the ability of automated capillary sequencers to size fractionate fluorescently labeled PCR amplicons is dependent on the abundance of the amplicons, so organisms at low abundance are not represented in the analysis. More sensitive techniques, like next-generation DNA sequencing, can identify low abundance species in the gut microbiota (29). The most important difference between T-RFLP and these newer techniques is one of scale. Where T-RFLP data represent the most abundant microbial TRFs, next-generation sequencing can identify rarer members of the microbial community. So it is possible that characterizations using newer techniques would show real differences between samples collected with sheathed vs. unsheathed forceps, but results obtained from T-RFLP suggest that the diversity among the dominant gut microbes will be similar.",

There are many factors that affect the composition of gut microbiota like diet, recent use of antibiotics, concomitant intestinal disease, and host genotype, which make it difficult to compare the microbiota between different individuals (30, 31). The main strength of our study is that comparisons were made between paired biopsies in individual patients, thus eliminating the need to account for the above factors. While more sensitivity for rare species could be obtained with other techniques, this worst-case contamination study did not find significant differences. Based on this data, we would recommend the following for obtaining biopsies for microbial analysis. First, taking usual care to minimize contamination of the colonoscope channel, or flushing with sterile saline before passing the forceps; and use of standard forceps in which the biopsy is retained with a biopsy spike and enclosed by a forceps cup during withdrawal of the forceps. We hope that this approach will accelerate the analysis of the microbiota of the neo-terminal ileum in Crohn\u2019s disease to elucidate which bacteria contribute to post-operative recurrence.",
