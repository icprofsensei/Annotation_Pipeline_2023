Gaining meaningful insights into these communities requires provision of high quality microbial nucleic acids from human fecal samples, as well as an understanding of the sources of variation and their impacts on the experimental model. We present here a systematic analysis of commonly used microbial DNA extraction methods, and identify significant sources of variation. Five extraction methods (Human Microbiome Project protocol, MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit, QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit, ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep, phenol:chloroform-based DNA isolation) were evaluated based on the following criteria: DNA yield, quality and integrity, and microbial community structure based on Illumina amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes. Our results indicate that the largest portion of variation within the model was attributed to differences between subjects (biological variation), with a smaller proportion of variation associated with DNA extraction method (technical variation) and intra-subject variation. A comprehensive understanding of the potential impact of technical variation on the human gut microbiota will help limit preventable bias, enabling more accurate diversity estimates.",

Several diseases and disorders have been linked to dysbiosis (imbalance) in these gut communities, and recent studies have sought to identify changes to microbial community structure and function during health and disease (B\u00e4ckhed et al., 2004; Cantarel et al., 2012; Claesson et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2012; Hsiao et al., 2013; Gevers et al., 2014).

Differences in lysis efficiency, heterogeneous distribution of microbes across a sample, and adherence of microbes to the stool matrix can result in preferential lysis of certain cell types and misrepresentation of microbial community diversity (Li et al., 2003; Ariefdjohan et al., 2010; Maukonen et al, 2012). DNA extraction methods utilize different lysis procedures, such as mechanical (bead beating), chemical, enzymatic, and heat, and various method comparison studies have reported contradictory results regarding the most effective lysing procedure (Carrigg et al., 2007; Dridi et al., 2009; Maukonen et al, 2012; Yuan et al., 2012; Claassen et al., 2013).

It is crucial to continually assess nucleic acids extraction methods, identifying those that are the most efficient, accurate and reproducible with the overall aim to standardize methods across gut microbiology studies, limiting preventable bias due to technical variation.

All subjects were located within Auckland, New Zealand and consented to supply three entire stool samples at 48 h intervals into sterile polypropylene containers. Stool samples were immediately stored on ice until processing of the samples in the lab. Pre-processing of samples into smaller sub-samples occurred within 12 h of collection and these were stored at -80\u00b0C until microbial DNA was extracted. Samples for the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) extraction method were processed first, before homogenization, according to the HMP Manual of Procedures 2010 Version 11.0 (McInnes and Cutting, 2010). After sub-samples were processed according to the HMP protocol, the remaining stool sample was homogenized via stirring with a sterile metal spatula and sample sizes were standardized to 200 mg, enabling better comparisons between the DNA extraction methods.",

Abundance data were appended to unique sequences and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were constructed using the UPARSE pipeline, based on the program usearch (Edgar, 2013). Briefly, individual OTUs were constructed by binning sequences into clusters of greater than 97% sequence similarity (-cluster_otus, -minsize 1), discarding putative chimeric OTUs in the process. A representative sequence of each OTU was further tested for chimeric artifacts using the SILVA reference database provided as part of the UPARSE pipeline (-uchime_ref). Abundance data were then reincorporated into the dataset by mapping the initial sequences against the representative OTUs (-usearch_global, -id 0.97).

Shannon and Simpson diversity indices measuring richness and evenness, were used to estimate diversity within each of the DNA extraction methods.

All three beta diversity measures returned overall similar results, and we chose to use the unweighted UniFrac metric to compare beta diversity, because of its previous successful application distinguishing microbial communities within the human microbiome (Lozupone and Knight, 2005; Wu et al., 2011; Lozupone et al., 2013).

Representative sequences from the Yatsunenko data were aligned against the SILVA seed database and a lane mask constructed to represent the base positions covered by the first 90 nucleotides of these sequences.

Vectors with a statistically significant contribution to the ordination were identified following Benjamini-Hochberg (\u201cBH\u201d) false discovery rate correction (p = 0.05) and overlaid onto the ordination space. The size of taxa nodes is based upon the average abundance of the taxon in the communities. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) was used to identify changes in microbial community structures between countries (Clarke, 1993). ANOSIM tests between countries were performed in mothur, using 10,000 permutations to determine significance and \u201cBH\u201d correction applied to all p-values.",

Unclassified OTUs (sequences unresolved at domain level) represented 0.58\u20130.75% and unclassified bacteria represented 1.0\u20131.3% of the total number of sequences for each of the DNA extraction methods (Table S2). The percentage of sequences represented by each phylum varied between DNA extraction methods. Method Q yielded the largest proportion of Bacteroidetes (77.7%), whereas Z had the lowest (45.2%), but the highest proportion of Firmicutes (50.8%). The HMP method yielded the lowest proportion of Firmicutes (12.8%); however, this method had the highest proportions of Cyanobacteria (5.1%) and Proteobacteria (5.3%) (Figure \u200b(Figure3).3). Only two methods, HMP and Q, detected Fusobacteria (<0.001%), which is interesting since these are the only extraction methods that include a heat lysis component. Phyla that were only detected using protocol Z include Acidobacteria, Chlorobi and Thermi. HMP was the only method to detect members of the candidate phylum TM7.",

However, analysis of the community structures from the phylum- and genus-level taxa plots revealed minor differences in the recovery of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The HMP method recovered significantly higher proportions of Gram-negative Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria. The MoBio PowerSoil\u00ae DNA Isolation Kit recovered higher proportions of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, which are both Gram-positive taxa. It is unclear why the HMP method, which uses the MoBio PowerSoil\u00ae DNA Isolation Kit, reported a higher abundance of Gram-negative bacteria, and consequently, lower abundances of Gram-positive bacteria.",

Significantly higher proportions of Ruminococcaceae (p < 10\u221225) and Cyanobacteria (p < 10\u221223) in Subject 1 were also important drivers of inter-subject variation. Higher proportions of Bacteroides sp. observed in Subject 2, and higher proportions of Sutterella sp. observed in Subjects 1 and 2, but not Subject 3, were significantly associated with inter-subject variation (p < 10\u221225 and <10\u221224, respectively).

We removed any subjects <3 years old from the Yatsunenko data set, so that the effect of age on gut microbiota did not affect clustering. The samples clustered primarily by geography/culture (American vs. agrarian vs. New Zealand), and these differences were large enough to outweigh the technical differences observed between the three New Zealand subjects (Figure \u200b(Figure4).4). Notwithstanding the very low numbers of subjects from New Zealand, the 2D NMDS suggested that a transition from western (American and New Zealand) to agrarian (Malawian and Venezuelan) cultures could be associated with an enrichment in members from the bacterial families Prevotellaceae, Clostridiaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae. Transitioning from American and agrarian cultures toward New Zealand subjects was associated with an increase in sequences classified to the order Bacteroidales and the family Rikenellaceae (Figure \u200b(Figure4).4). American subjects were associated with an enrichment in sequences classified to the order Clostridiales, and Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families.",

Samples clustered strongly by age and geography/culture, which was to be expected (Yatsunenko et al., 2012; Lozupone et al., 2013; Suzuki and Worobey, 2014). However, in data sets comparing fecal samples from subjects with similar ages and geographical/cultural background, secondary clustering by experimental protocol was observed.

One recent study (Claassen et al., 2013) identified few significant differences between DNA extraction methods when examining lysis technique; however, a different study (Yuan et al., 2012) reported the most effective cell lysis and DNA recovery from bead beating and/or mutanolysin (Yuan et al., 2012; Claassen et al., 2013). In another comparison of lysis techniques, the most effective lysing procedure was hot phenol and bead beating, suggesting that a combination of lysing procedures captures the most accurate community composition (Wu et al., 2010). Our study examined a variety of lysing techniques; however, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices did not reveal significant differences in microbial community diversity specifically pertaining to lysing methods.",

Although phenol:chloroform extractions are still widely used, they may take considerably more time than kit methods, and often require extensive clean-up steps before PCR amplification to remove left-over phenol and humic acids. Additionally, human error can affect the reproducibility of these extractions when analysing recovered nucleic acid yield and quality.

Analysis of the gel electrophoresis image supports the low amounts of extracted DNA, as bands were barely visible. Results from a study by Claassen et al. indicated much higher amounts of extracted DNA from ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep\u2122 kit when compared to other DNA extraction methods tested in that study, and when compared to the results presented in our work. Additionally, Claassen et al., reported a substantially higher median quality of DNA extracted using the ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep\u2122 kit (A260/A280 = 1.678) when compared to the results presented here. Closer examination of the data from that study revealed a substantial range of A260/A280 results below 1.6, even though the results were considered reproducible (CV < 1.0) (Claassen et al., 2013). Significantly lower DNA yield and quality from samples extracted using this kit, and subsequent PCR bias may help explain differences in community structure between ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep\u2122 and the other methods. Richness and diversity estimates for ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep\u2122 were significantly higher when compared to the other extraction methods. Claassen et al. (2013) reported the highest Shannon index for the ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep\u2122 kit, but the value was not significantly different from those estimated for the QIAamp\u00ae DNA Stool Mini Kit or MoBio PowerSoil\u00ae DNA Isolation Kit.

As previously described, the abundance of Prevotellaceae was associated with Malawi and Amerindian subjects (Yatsunenko et al., 2012), as well as Subject 1 from New Zealand. Even though significant differences were observed in pairwise ANOSIM tests between subjects from New Zealand, Malawi, America, and Venezuela, the New Zealand subjects were more similar to those from America than the agrarian cultures. A paucity of information exists regarding the New Zealand adult gut microbiota, and the three subjects presented in this study may not be an accurate representation of the average New Zealand gut community. Increasing the number of New Zealand samples may help moderate the extreme biological differences depicted between the three subjects sampled here. Additionally, increasing the number of New Zealand subjects will help describe their gut communities within the global context, especially in relation to other \u201cwestern\u201d cultures.",
