Standard clinical testing to diagnose CD and UC includes blood tests and stool examination for biomarker quantification, endoscopy and biopsy. The diagnosis of IBD, particularly CD, can be missed or delayed due to the non-specific nature of both intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms at presentation. In this regard, non-invasive, cost-effective, rapid and reproducible biomarkers would be helpful for patients and clinicians alike.",

Using faecal samples and culture-independent techniques, including qPCR, T-RFLP, cloning/Sanger, pyrosequencing or Illumina sequencing, several studies have reported that CD is associated with a decrease in Clostridiales such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increase in Enterobacteriales such as Escherichia coli.6\u20138 Patients with UC are associated to some extent with a decrease in microbial diversity; however, no strong dysbiosis has been reported compared with healthy controls or patients with CD.5 Although many studies have revealed a clear association between an altered microbiome and IBD, they have not addressed the differences between CD and UC at the microbiome level nor have proposed a set of biomarkers that is useful for diagnosis based on stool samples.9",

Correct primer and proper barcode sequences were also checked. After filtering, from a total of 2206 faecal samples, we obtained a total of 115.5 millions of high-quality sequences with a number of reads ranging from 1 to 223\u2005896 per sample. We used the USEARCH15 algorithm to cluster similar filtered sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on a 97% similarity threshold. We then identified and removed chimeric sequences using UCHIME.16 Since each OTU can comprise many related sequences, we picked a representative sequence from each one. Representative sequences were aligned using PyNAST against Greengenes template alignment (gg_13_8 release), and a taxonomical assignment step was performed using the basic local alignment search tool to map each representative sequence against a combined database encompassing the Greengenes and PATRIC databases. The script make_phylogeny.py was used to create phylogenetic trees using the FastTree programme.17 To correctly define species richness for the analysis of between-sample diversity, known as \u03b2 diversity, the OTU table was rarefied at 6760 sequences per sample and kept for further analysis a total of 2045 samples and 115.5 millions of reads. Rarefaction is used to overcome cases in which read counts are not similar in numbers between samples. The summarise taxa table was used to classify taxa from the Domain to the Species level. To provide community \u03b1 diversity estimates, we calculated the Chao1 and Shannon diversity indexes.18\n19 To calculate between-sample diversity, weighted and unweighted UniFrac metrics were applied to build phylogenetic distance matrices, which were then used to construct hierarchical cluster trees using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PcoA) representations.",

The Friedman test was used for one-way repeated measures of analysis of variance. We used the mixed-analysis of variance (ANOVA), a mixed-design ANOVA model, to take into account that repeated measurements are collected in a longitudinal study in which change over time is assessed. We performed analyses with the non-parametric multivariate ANOVA (NPMANOVA) called the adonis test, a non-parametric analysis of variance, to test for differences in microbial community composition. We applied Multivariate Association with Linear Models to find associations between clinical metadata (age, body mass index (BMI), gender, smoking habits, medication intake and site of disease) and microbial community abundance.

In order to uncover microbial signatures of recurrence, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the faecal samples of patients with UC and CD at the time of recurrence with those of patients who remained in remission after 1\u2005year of follow-up. We did not find significant differences. Furthermore, in order to discover the predictive value of recurrence in patients with CD and UC, using the same test, we compared the baseline faecal samples of those who developed recurrence later on (n=13 for CD and n=18 for UC) with those who remained in remission after 1 year of follow-up (n=21 for CD and n=15 for UC).

Christensenellaceae, Methanobrevibacter and Oscillospira have been correlated with subjects with a low BMI (<25),23\u201325 and they may interact with the gut immune system to maintain homeostasis.

We then studied the association between relative abundance of groups of bacteria and smoking habit using the Kruskal-Wallis test. In patients with CD, a genus belonging to Peptostreptococcaceae was present in a higher proportion in smokers (FDR=0.006), while Eggerthella lenta was found in a higher proportion in non-smokers (see online supplementary material 1). In patients with UC, we observed that smokers presented a greater abundance of Butyricimonas, Prevotella and Veillonellaceae (FDR<0.04), while non-smokers had a higher proportion of Clostridiaceae and Bifidobacterium adolescentis (FDR<0.03). We also examined the link between the relative abundance of groups of bacteria and disease localisation for CD and extension for UC (obtained by the Montreal classification).31 In patients with CD, the disease was localised mostly in the ileum (L1, 35%) and in the ileocolon (L3, 64.7%). The Mann-Whitney test revealed that Enterococcus faecalis and an unknown species belonging to Erysipelotrichaceae were more abundant in stool when the disease was localised in the ileum than in the ileocolon. In patients with UC, the distribution of disease behaviour at sampling was as follows: proctitis (E1, 27.3%), left-sided colitis (E2, 33.3%) and pancolitis (39.4%). Using the Kruskal-Wallis test, we correlated disease behaviour and microbial community composition and found that proctitis was associated with a greater relative abundance of an unknown Clostridiales, Clostridium, an unknown Peptostreptococcaceae and Mogibacteriaceae (FDR<0.05) in stool. Finally, we did not find any relation between the medication use (table 1) and microbiome composition.",

During remission, FC was significantly higher in patients with CD and UC than in their HR and significantly higher during recurrence than during remission (figure 3). However, FC concentration did not differ between patients with CD and UC, either during remission or at recurrence, making them useless to discriminate the two disorders.",

We generated about 5.2 million high-quality sequence reads for the 187 samples. We applied our algorithm to the whole cohort and identified an overall sensitivity of 81.8% of the samples as being CD (true positive) (table 2). Furthermore, to evaluate the predictive value of recurrence, we performed a Kruskal-Wallis analysis of the faecal samples collected before surgery, comparing patients on the basis of their Rutgeerts scores obtained 6\u2005months after surgery. The results showed that patients who developed postoperative recurrence (with a Rutgeerts score of i3 and i4, n=28) harboured a higher relative abundance of Streptococcus (p=0.002; FDR=0.17) than those who remained in remission (with a Rutgeerts score of i0 and i1, n=26). This result suggests that the presence of Streptococcus in stool samples before surgery is a predictive marker of future recurrence.",

We extracted and sequenced the faecal microbiome at baseline (ie, collected before any intervention), generating 1.5 million sequence reads and tested our algorithm on this dataset. We obtained a specificity of 95.1% for the detection of CD versus UC (table 2). We also tested the specificity of our algorithm on several non-IBD published datasets, namely on IBS, subjects with anorexia and healthy subjects. IBS and CD may present common symptoms, including abdominal pain, cramps, constipation and diarrhoea, and a simple method that distinguishes CD from IBS could also help reducing unnecessary endoscopies. Therefore, we applied our algorithm to the faecal samples of 125 subjects previously diagnosed with IBS. The sequence data were obtained from a recently published study.32 Of the 125 patients with IBS, the algorithm identified seven as being CD, thus showing only 5.6% of false positives and a specificity of 94.4% (table 2).",

Our algorithm detected 75 out of 1016 samples (7.3% of false positive) as being CD, thus showing a specificity of 92.7%. The second study was designed to address dysbiosis in patients with anorexia compared with HC and to evaluate the shift in the microbial community after weight gain in patients with anorexia.34 As shown in this study, anorexia is associated with an alteration of gut microbiome composition. In order to evaluate whether changes occur in the gut community as a result of a condition other than IBD, we tested the algorithm on this anorexic cohort.

We first tested its performance on the Spanish IBD cohort used as the discovery cohort and validated its sensitivity on a newly enrolled Belgian CD cohort. The overall IBD cohort comprised new-onset patients with CD and IBD in remission or with active disease. We evaluated its specificity on a healthy UK twin cohort and on several cohorts of patients with non-IBD. The test showed a sensitivity of about 80% for CD, using the Spanish and Belgian cohorts, and a specificity of 94.3%, 94.4%%, 89.4% and 90.9% of CD detection versus HC, and patients with anorexia, IBS and UC, respectively. Furthermore, all the samples from the Belgian patients with CD who took antibiotics were detected by the algorithm, thereby suggesting that antibiotics intake prior to sampling did not affect detection by the algorithm. Nevertheless, the overall sensitivity of 80% obtained with the Spanish and Belgian cohorts could have been inflated as a result of the fact that we applied the algorithm to the samples independently over time. Another limitation of our analysis is that the higher accuracy of 85.4%, to detect CD versus UC, obtained using the Spanish cohort compared with the 60% with the French cohort could be explained by a difference in the methodological approach. The low accuracy obtained with the French data may point to a limitation of this method as a diagnostic tool, as the laboratories analysing the patient's microbiome should apply the method used in this study. This finding also demonstrates the importance of the development and use of standardised methods to analyse the microbiome. Further experimental designs could be proposed to evaluate the extent to which the method used here could be implemented in a laboratory.",

Together, these developments have allowed us to perform the microbiome analysis of a faecal sample for less than 150 euros on a small scale and in 1\u2005day. On a larger scale the cost could be significantly reduced.",
