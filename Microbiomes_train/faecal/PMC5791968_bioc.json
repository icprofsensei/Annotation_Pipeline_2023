In order to provide this service at Stony Brook University Hospital, we initiated an open-label prospective study of single colonoscopic FMT among patients with \u2265 2 recurrences of CDI, with the intention of monitoring microbial composition in the recipient before and after FMT, as compared with their respective donor. We also initiated a concurrent open label prospective trial of single colonoscopic FMT of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) not responsive to therapy, after obtaining an IND permit (IND 15642). To characterize how FMT alters the fecal microbiota in patients with recurrent Clostridia difficile infections (CDI) and/or UC, we report the results of a pilot microbiome analysis of 11 recipients with a history of 2 or more recurrences of C. difficile infections without inflammatory bowel disease (CDI-only), 3 UC recipients with recurrent C. difficile infections (CDI + UC), and 5 UC recipients without a history of C. difficile infections (UC-only).",

Marked decreases in the relative abundances of the strictly anaerobic Bacteroidetes phylum, and two Firmicutes sub-phyla associated with butyrate production (Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae) were observed between the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipient groups. There were corresponding increases in the microaerophilic Proteobacteria phylum and the Firmicutes/Bacilli group in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipient groups. At a more granular level, significant effects of FMT were observed for 81 genus-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in at least one of the three recipient groups (p<0.00016 with Bonferroni correction). Pairwise comparisons of the estimated pre-FMT recipient/donor relative abundance ratios identified 6 Gammaproteobacteria OTUs, including the Escherichia-Shigella genus, and 2 Fusobacteria OTUs with significantly increased relative abundance in the pre-FMT samples of all three recipient groups (FDR < 0.05), however the magnitude of the fold change was much larger in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients than in the UC-only recipients. Depletion of butyrate producing OTUs, such as Faecalibacterium, in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients, were restored after FMT.",

The standard course of treatment for CDI is metronidazole or vancomycin, which have 72% and 79% eradication rates, respectively [4]. However, 20\u201335% of recovered patients experience a recurrence of CDI, particularly those patients with continued use of antibiotics, use of acid suppression therapy, and older age [5, 6].

In order to provide this service at Stony Brook Medicine, we initiated an open-label prospective study of single colonoscopic FMT among patients with \u2265 2 recurrences of CDI, with the intention of monitoring microbial composition in the recipient before and after FMT, as compared with their respective donor. Each of the transplants was conducted using a single known donor, as suggested by the US Food and Drug Association (FDA), to minimize the transmission of occult pathogens (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/biologicsbloodvaccines/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/vaccines/ucm488223.pdf). Although the FDA has classified human stool as a biological agent, no investigational new drug (IND) permit was required for performing FMT for recurrent CDI. We also initiated a concurrent pilot open label prospective trial of single colonoscopic FMT of patients with UC not responsive to therapy, after obtaining an IND permit (IND 15642). We report here an interim 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence analysis of stool samples collected from 19 recipients before, 1 week (wk.) after, and 3 months (mos.) after FMT, as well as the transplant stool samples from their respective donors, who were recruited between December 12, 2013 and the last patient included in this report, completed 1-year follow-up June 14, 2017.",

Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved trial study protocol.) was approved by the Stony Brook University Institutional Review Board (479696) on 11/14/2013 and was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Number: NCT03268213, S1 Table. Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs (TREND) checklist.). The pilot study was started with the plan to enroll subjects from our medical center. However we decided to register as a clinical trial at a later date to enhance enrollment and power of the study. The reason we did not hold recruitment was because this study was designed as a longitudinal observational trial in which all enrolled subject received a fecal microbial transplant from a healthy donor selected by the subject, where each enrolled subject would serve as their own control. We were mistakenly under the impression that only trials where subjects would be randomized to alternative therapies, would require completion of registration prior to enrolling the first patient. For multiple reasons there were delays in completing the PI\u2019s responses to the registry\u2019s queries, although completing these responses did not in any way alter the design of this observational study from that in place prior to registering as a clinical trial. The initial recipient/donor pair was recruited on December 13, 2013. The final recipient included in this report, completed one-year follow up on June 14, 2017. For the patients with recurrent CDI (with or without IBD), the inclusion criteria were \u2265 2 recurrences despite treatment with antibiotics, documented by \u22653 positive stool tests for CDI. For the patients with UC without a history of recurrent CDI, the inclusion criteria were medication refractory UC, requiring step up therapy beyond mesalamine alone. Exclusion criteria for all of the recipients included: a) scheduled for abdominal surgery within the next 12 wks., b) pregnancy, c) Grade 4 anemia (Hemoglobin < 6 g/dL), d) Grade 1 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count <1500), e) known diagnosis of graft vs. host disease, f) major abdominal surgery within the past 3 mos., g) administration of any investigational drug within the past 2 mos., h) use of a TNF-\u03b1 antagonist within 2 wks. of the proposed date of transplantation, i) bacteremia within past 4 wks. (28 days), j.) For adults \u226518 years inability to give informed consent. Twenty-six prospective FMT recipients were referred by community physicians, and evaluated and consented by the principal investigator and study coordinator in the Stony Brook University outpatient gastroenterology clinic between November 2013 and June 2016. Five patients were excluded from enrollment (Fig 1). Three of five were excluded, because we could not document \u2265 2 CDI recurrences. The remaining two had not undergone a vancomycin taper for recurrent CDI, and experienced no recurrence after completing the vancomycin taper regimen. Although the protocol was approved for children < 17 y, thus far all of the FMT recipients enrolled in this study have been over the age of 18. One patient was excluded from this report because of concerns about factitious disorder. A second patient with ileal Crohn\u2019s disease and recurrent CDI, recruited during this study period, was excluded from this report, and the results will be reported at a later time, after analysis of additional recipients with Crohn\u2019s disease with and without recurrent CDI. We report here an interim 16S rRNA sequence analysis of stool samples collected before, 1 wk. after, and 3 mos. after FMT, from 19 recipients with recurrent CDI with and without UC and their respective healthy donors, who were recruited between December 12, 2013 and June 2016.

To compare the relative abundance of each OTU between timepoints before and after FMT [pre-transplant recipient, 1-wk. post-FMT recipient, 3-mos. post-FMT recipient] and each disease group (recurrent CDI-only recipient, CDI + UC recipient, UC-only recipient), a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) or generalized estimating equation (GEE) were used by taking the actual counts of each OTU as the outcomes that were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution [25]. The log-transformed overall sequence count for each individual at each timepoint was considered as an offset. Two-way interaction terms (Group*FMT) were used to estimate the difference between the timepoints within a specific disease group. Possible covariance structures to model correlation among longitudinal measurement from the same patient and measurement in the corresponding donor were unstructured (UN) and had compound symmetry (CS). In GEE, the dependence structure was chosen based on Quasi Information Criteria (QIC). Pair-wise p-values were based on the T-test for GLMM, and the Z-test for GEE. The p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni correction or by the Benjamin-Hochberg method (FDR < 0.05). All analysis was performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R 3.4.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",

However, it was discovered that this recipient had syringes and opiates in her hospital room, raising concerns about possible factitious disorder. Consequently, this donor/recipient pair was excluded from the analysis. The characteristics of the remaining 19 recipients and their corresponding donors are summarized in Table 1. The median ages of the four donor/recipient groups differed significantly (unadjusted p = 0.009) with the recurrent CDI-only group being substantially older (Table 1).

Following transplant, only the CDI-only patients experienced an increase in relative abundance of F. prausnitzii. These patients had increased relative abundance at both 1-wk. (8.98, 95% CI 5.28 to 12.69, p<0.0001) and 3-mos., (9.04, 95% CI 4.65 to 13.43, p = 0.0004) post-FMT. Patients with CDI + UC showed a trend of increasing relative abundance 3-mos. post-transplant (12.23, 95%CI 4.17 to 20.28, p = 0.005), but did not reach significance with the Bonferroni correction. Patients with UC did not show an increase in their relative abundance of F. prausnitzii following transplant.",

As summarized in Table 13, the range in post-FMT changes in fecal calprotectin levels ranged from a decrease of 49.6 \u03bcg/g to an increase of 190.5 \u03bcg/g compared to pre-FMT levels. Of the four recipients who underwent a follow-up sigmoidoscopy 3-mos. post-FMT, neither the Mayo nor Endoscopy scores were significantly increased.",

Because this pilot study was a prospective longitudinal observational study without a placebo control, it was not designed to address clinical efficacy. The analysis implemented in this pilot study considers all data points simultaneously in order to have the optimal degree of freedom for hypothesis testing. In addition we have adjusted for the multiple testing issue. Although we sequenced sufficiently deeply (mean > 100,000 16S rRNA sequences per sample) to identify all but the very rarest of OTUs, we were conservative in the number of OTUs included in the analysis. This was so that we could avoid statistical modeling issues because of excessive zero counts and control the false positive rate, given the small number of patients studied. Our analysis of this pilot study revealed marked alterations in the pre-FMT fecal microbiota composition in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients compared to their donors. These differences were characterized by depletion of anaerobic phyla/subphyla and correspondingly increased microaerophilic phyla/subphyla and a trend towards reduced community complexity (i.e., Shannon H). These findings are consistent with those reported by recent studies [26\u201330]. In contrast, the pre-FMT alterations in fecal microbiota in the UC-only recipients were less evident [31, 32].",

However, observation of increased relative abundance of OTUs that are generally sensitive to vancomycin, such as staphylococcus and streptococcus, suggests that dysbiosis may not be simply attributable to vancomycin exposure. Instead, the marked imbalance between the relative abundances of microaerophilic and of strictly anaerobic taxa observed in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients may reflect increased intraluminal oxygen levels in the colon [33, 34].",

This may relate to the observation that the CDI-only and CDI + UC had marked dysbiosis prior to transplant. It is less clear, especially given the small number of recipients, whether FMT has a significant effect on the microbiological outcome of UC-only recipients where their baseline pre-FMT alterations in microbial structure/ composition compared to their donors were more subtle. The significant findings of this pilot study warrant a larger confirmatory study that carefully characterizes the microbial and molecular components of donor and recipient stools before and after FMT, with the goal of improving selection of recipients and donors for FMT, and to identify the active components of the transplanted stool for the development of new therapies for CDI and IBD.",
