However, the detected composition of the faecal bacterial community can be affected by various factors including experimental design and procedures. This study evaluated the performance of different protocols for collection and storage of faecal samples (native and OMNIgene.GUT system) and bacterial DNA extraction (MP Biomedicals, QIAGEN and MO BIO kits), using two NGS platforms for 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Ilumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM). OMNIgene.GUT proved as a reliable and convenient system for collection and storage of faecal samples although favouring Sutterella genus. MP provided superior DNA yield and quality, MO BIO depleted Gram positive organisms while using QIAGEN with OMNIgene.GUT resulted in greatest variability compared to other two kits. MiSeq and IT platforms in their supplier recommended setups provided comparable reproducibility of donor faecal microbiota. The differences included higher diversity observed with MiSeq and increased capacity of MiSeq to detect Akkermansia muciniphila, [Odoribacteraceae], Erysipelotrichaceae and Ruminococcaceae (primarily Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). The results of our study could assist the investigators using NGS technologies to make informed decisions on appropriate tools for their experimental pipelines.",

The main source of the information regarding human gut microbiota originated from the analyses of the faeces. The importance of this easily available metabolic waste comes from its microbial content found to hold the potential in diagnosis, disease prediction and therapeutic intervention. This justifies it being considered a \u201cvirtual organ\u201d3 or a human tissue4,5. The analyses of human intestinal microorganisms were, until recently, performed by culture-dependent methodologies, limiting the outputs to the cultivable species. The availability of novel tools, primarily next-generation sequencing (NGS), enabled the assessment of genes and genomes contained within complex microbial communities. The most widely used NGS method for the taxonomic and phylogenetic evaluation of bacterial community composition relies on 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis4,6\u20139. However, detected composition of the faecal bacterial community can be affected by experimental design and procedures, including sampling and storage protocol as well as DNA extraction method.",

Faeces represents one of the most complex biological materials for bacterial DNA isolation as it also contains remnants of human DNA, food DNA and many inhibitors hampering subsequent PCR amplification and NGS procedures18. DNA extraction from faeces represents the essential step in obtaining good quality DNA and ensuring accurate identification of microbial composition and relative abundance19. It is therefore critical to evaluate the available methodologies for bacterial DNA extraction from faeces and optimize protocols and procedures that would provide sufficient amount, purity and integrity of the DNA, thus obtaining high quality sample for further studies.",

NGS is used for determining bacterial composition in a sample based on DNA fragment detection from the total DNA isolate. Although shotgun sequencing provides the most complete information on the entire gene pool within the sample, the high amount of generated data requires substantial bioinformatic efforts in sequence assembly, mapping and analyses. In many studies, both clinical and environmental, sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, covering variable regions of the gene, is the method of choice for the analyses of bacterial community composition, providing cost-effectiveness, sufficient resolution and sequencing depth1,7,8,20. The 16S rRNA gene is approximately 1500\u2009bp in size and consists of nine variable regions separated by conserved regions19,23. Illumina and Thermo platforms with their MiSeq and Ion Torrent (IT) Personal Genome Machine (PGM) benchtop sequencers are increasingly being used for 16S rRNA-based analyses of diverse bacterial populations7,9,19,21,22. Although both Illumina and IT platforms sequence DNA by detecting the nucleotide addition during DNA synthesis, the two platforms function on different principles, which could affect their performance and ultimately result in variation of the obtained data7,9,24\u201327.",

Diversity indices were calculated to describe the complexity of samples (alpha) and distinguish differences between samples (beta). Alpha diversity was assessed through three indices (Fig.\u00a04b). The more rapid increase in observed OTUs and higher Chao1 (a measure highly favouring singletons and doubletons) with MiSeq than IT was noted. However the difference is lost when phylogenetic distance of detected taxa is taken into account and expressed using PD_whole_tree measure. Additionally, the same indices point to higher diversity in samples where MP was used for DNA extraction (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Principle coordinate analysis of beta diversity expressed as weighted UniFrac (Fig.\u00a04c), revealed a major contribution to the differences in diversity first by platform (PCo1) followed by donors (PCo2\u20134).",

Setting the fresh native sample (native 0) as a reference point and comparing the kits (Fig.\u00a05a), it was observed that MO BIO kit tends to provide higher proportion of Bacteroidaceae (48.6%) and less Lachnospiraceae (17.3%), compared to MP (33.4% and 25.2%) and QIA extraction kit (24.8% and 28.4%, respectively). Comparing the frozen native samples (native 14) with their corresponding reference points revealed the increase in Bacteoridaceae/Lachnospiraceae ratio and identification of slightly less Prevotellaceae across all extraction kits. Collecting the samples with OMNIgene.GUT stabilizing system (Omni 0, Omni 14) tended to increase the Bacteoridaceae/Lachnospiraceae ratio for QIA and MO BIO extracted samples. Altogether, application of MP and MO BIO resulted in fewer discrepancies across all tested parameters (Fig.\u00a05b). QIA displayed variations between native and Omni samples most notably in the ratio of two dominant families, Bacteroidaceae and Lachnospiraceae.",

The majority of significantly differing families (Wilcoxon rank test) between kits were found in MP versus other kits (Table\u00a01), with all families more efficiently extracted with MP (1.9\u20133.2 fold). Kruskal Wallis test revealed that this difference can be accounted for by disparities between MP and MOBIO kits, with QIA coming out as less specific (Table\u00a01). The families with sufficiently high effect size are [Mogibacteriaceae], Clostridiaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. When MOBIO is compared to other two kits, only three of the above mentioned taxa (Mogibacteriaceae], Coriobacteriaceae, and Streptococcaceae) show significance which stems from lower abundance (by a factor of 2\u20133.8) these taxa achieve with MOBIO kit (Supplementary Tables\u00a03 and 4).",

However, each methodological step comprises of multiple technical variables and potentially introduces variation in the final results. These steps include methods of sample collection, stabilisation and storage; DNA extraction and sequencing technology which play an important role in preserving the bacterial content of the sample. Consequently, thorough selection of experimental design and subsequent interpretation of the results needs to be implemented. All this wealth of advanced technological and methodological options exposes the researchers entering the field to plethora of choices only a subset of which is tailored to their particular needs. In addition, the data analysis of the experimental outputs create further level of complexity related to interpretation and comparison across studies in the same research field27\u201330.",

Our results suggest that freezing at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C preserves the specific microbial community composition in faecal samples (Fig.\u00a06 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05), confirming these literature data. Although it was reported that freezing significantly increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes relative abundance ratio using quantitative PCR analysis32, our study identified a decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, as well as a decrease in the ratio of Lachnospiraceae to Bacteroidaceae, two major families within Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Also, we found a decline in Proteobacteria phylum in frozen faecal samples. These changes, however, were not found statistically relevant. The use of preservative buffers and nucleic acid stabilizing reagents, such as TE-buffer or RNAlater was found to negatively influence DNA yield and quality, alter microbial diversity and proportions of certain taxa12,33,34. However, studies evaluating OMNIgene.GUT, a commercially available faeces collection/stabilization system, indicated this system was equivalent to, or superior in maintaining sample microbiota composition to freezing, resulting in very few alterations to fresh stool samples12,15. We found that stabilizing the faecal sample in OMNIgene.GUT tended to preserve Proteobacteria, a phylum which was depleted in frozen samples (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06), as already observed12. OMNIgene.GUT favours isolation of Prevotellaceae family, but with no statistical significance (Fig.\u00a06). Although we did find a significant increase in Sutterella genus in samples collected using OMNIgene.GUT (Supplementary Table\u00a05), also documented by Choo et al.12, our findings suggest that microbiota composition in OMNIgene.GUT collected samples was comparable to freshly processed faeces.",

                    "text": "The evaluated three DNA extraction kits successfully extracted bacterial DNA from faecal samples. MP kit was the most efficient, extracting approximately three times more DNA than MO BIO and QIA kits per mg faeces. The use of MP and QIA kits resulted in high quality of the extracted DNA, while MO BIO provided DNA of inferior quality, consistent with literature data18,35\u201338. Furthermore, DNA extraction from faecal samples collected using OMNIgene.GUT system resulted in higher DNA yield irrespective of the extraction kit utilized, thus decreasing the amount of faecal material required, as previously reported15. MP kit was also associated with higher richness of isolated taxa as observed in alpha diversity analysis (observed OTUs, Chao1 and PD_whole_tree) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). This is probably due to its effective G+ cell wall disruption, resulting in extracting significantly more G+ bacteria including Bifidobacteriaceae (and Actinobacteria phylum) than the other two kits (Table\u00a01, Supplementary Table\u00a04). Statistical analysis indicated differences between MP and MO BIO kits, with MO BIO depleting Lachnospiraceae, the most abundant G+ family, as well as other G+ organisms from Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla. The largest effect sizes were observed for Coriobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. The discrepancy in extracting efficiency of G+ organisms (illustrated in Supplementary Fig.\u00a06) was previously suggested to relate to suboptimal lysing conditions in MO BIO extraction method36. The additional bead beating step proposed for MO BIO protocol38 was included in this study, but it did not improve the G+ recovery as was expected. When QIA was compared to other kits, Wilcoxon rank test on simulated data did not detect significant differences and only two significant families were identified using the Kruskal Wallis test (Table\u00a01). This could be a consequence of intrinsic variability among QIA extracted samples with OMNIgene.GUT collection system (Fig.\u00a06) having an influence on the G+/G- relative abundance ratio in these samples (Supplemental Fig.\u00a06). Although the recently published study aiming to standardise extraction procedures38 recommended QIA based protocol for faecal DNA extraction (protocol Q), the results of the MP protocol from the same study (protocol #14) demonstrated high DNA quantity and quality, as well as community diversity and G+ recovery, positioning this extraction method high on the performance scale.",

MiSeq annotation slightly outperformed IT at lower taxonomy levels since higher proportions of the assigned OTUs were obtained at family, genus and species levels (Fig.\u00a03). This could be attributed to several platform set-up related factors, including differences in sequencing depth, targeted 16S gene region, amplicon sequencing lengths and/or single vs. pair-end sequencing technology7,9,27. Additionally, the mock community revealed that both sequencing technologies have the ability to detect all bacteria present in the mock sample with >99% of detected OTUs annotated correctly down to family level. In contrast to previous platform comparison using even and uneven mock community designed for that study9, we identified all 17 genera present in our mock community sample (HM-782D). The detected false positive genera comprised <1% of total OTU counts, resulting in overall substantial correspondence to theoretical composition unlike the abovementioned study. The different capacity of platforms to capture mock community diversity in these two studies could be related to the differences in community composition, tested 16S gene region and primer sets used. The relative abundances of taxa in our study were not fully reproduced and MiSeq in general had closer proportions and improved detection of Actinobacteria (Actinomycetaceae (Actinomyces odontolyticus) and Propionibacteriaceae (Propionibacterium acnes)), when compared to the expected values. This is in accordance with previous work on the same mock sample7 that also found marked differences with these organisms and attributed them to premature read truncation observed on the IT platform. In general, we found more deviations from theoretical abundance with IT than with MiSeq sequencing of mock community (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02).",

                    "text": "The assessment of relative abundances did not reveal marked differences between platforms (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). However, the statistical analyses taking into consideration the compositional nature of the NGS data and using Kruskal Wallis test on clr transformed dataset demonstrated statistical differences at all taxonomic levels, showed numerous taxa in this study to be exposed to technology driven bias (Supplementary Tables\u00a03 and 4). However, as the level of significance does not by itself predict the magnitude of the differences further evaluations were performed. Primarily, to ensure that false positives (type I error) are avoided and to account for the technical variation and imprecision intrinsic to NGS datasets, Monte-Carlo simulations from Dirichlet distribution were generated on the original data followed by the evaluation of the effect sizes and additional parametric and non-parametric statistics. Statistical significance (Kruskal Wallis) revealed a substantial number of taxa (ten on family level) apparently guiding the platform difference (Supplementary Tables\u00a03 and 4). After accounting for technical variation (Wilcoxon) the number declined (eight families remained). Scrutinizing for the effect size and filtering out only the taxa with medium to large effect sizes39 the number was further reduced (four families with effect size >0.5). We considered these taxa as the most relevant drivers of platform differences. The notable finding of this study, and not reported so far, was the increased capacity of MiSeq to detect Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia muciniphila species was the only representative of this phylum) as well as Faecalibacterium genus with abundances being 10 and 5 fold higher than with IT, respectively. This finding may be of special interest to researchers of health promoting bacteria since both Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a butyrate-producing species in the Ruminococcaceae family, and Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucus-colonizing and degrading bacteria, showed sufficient efficacies to be considered next generation probiotics40. Other taxa of interest that were statistically significant and 2 fold more abundant on MiSeq were [Odoribacteraceae], Erysipelotrichaceae and Ruminococcaceae (Supplementary Table\u00a03). Additionally, the property that also separated MiSeq from IT was its improved consistency in detecting organisms across samples (fitness to linear model) and lower error margins (Fig.\u00a07c) which could potentially be attributed to the fact that MiSeq pair-end sequencing produces longer reads versus single-ended IT (mean length\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD - amplicon 451\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u2009bp and read 213\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u2009bp, respectively). Although previous reports suggested that the sequencing approach of using more than one primer pair covering more 16S rRNA gene regions should better represent the content of a complex bacterial sample9,41, we failed to see this improvement with experimental setup here described. The higher overall richness in MiSeq in this study could be attributed to the higher average sequencing depth (2.3 fold in MiSeq) or to the lower required matching sequence for MiSeq (V3-V4 region) to assign taxonomy to an OTU, than for IT (V2-V4, V6-V9).",

Out of three kits used, MP provided most efficient DNA extraction resulting in significantly higher quantity and quality of the DNA, as well as higher richness of faecal microbiota content. Despite the fact that this study investigated optimized NGS platform technologies which differ in multiple parameters (16S rRNA gene region(s), primers, amplicon lengths, sequencing technology (single vs. pair-end)), when analysed using the same processing pipeline, both MiSeq and IT adequately reproduce donor faecal microbiota specificity. However, all the technology-related bias described here suggests that particular care should be given to appropriate methodology choices suitable for the microbial profiling in a specific study.",
