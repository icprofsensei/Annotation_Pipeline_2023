Diet is probably the most significant lifestyle factor for the etiology of metabolic diseases, making the dietary composition an essential target in a strategy aiming at prevention [1]. Recent studies have demonstrated that saturated fats and animal protein, which are typically high in a Western diet, are associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity, reduced insulin sensitivity, T2D, and CVD [2], and also altered microbiota, e.g., reduced diversity [3]. In contrast, inclusion of whole grain foods in the diet has been found advantageous by lowering the risk of weight gain, T2D, and CVD [4]. Accumulating evidence from both epidemiological studies [5] and dietary interventions [6\u20139] suggest preventive potential of dietary fiber (DF) on cardiometabolic risk. The beneficial effects of DF are largely suggested to emanate from mechanisms related to microbial metabolism of the DF [6\u201310]. We and others have shown that barley kernel-based evening meals improve glucose tolerance following a subsequent standardized breakfast [6, 7, 10]. The underlying mechanisms were suggested to emanate from colonic fermentation of the DF present in barley. Recent studies have observed a high variability in the effects on glucose tolerance to food between subjects although the meals or more specific food items were identical [11, 12]. Thus, the importance of personalized nutrition is highlighted and it has been suggested that the glucose response can be predicted by collecting data regarding personal features and/or gut microbiota composition [11, 12]. In agreement, we previously reported high variability in glucose response in test subjects following barley kernel-based evening meal [10]. Interestingly, we found that the microbiota differed between the subjects acquiring improved glucose tolerance after intake of barley (responder subjects) compared to subjects that showed no or minor effects on glucose tolerance (non-responder subjects). In responder subjects, intake of barley was associated with increased abundance of gut Prevotella and increased ratio of Prevotella/Bacteroides. In contrast, in non-responders, the abundance of Prevotella or ratio Prevotella/Bacteroides was not affected after barley kernel-based products. In addition, we observed tendencies towards an increased ratio of Prevotella/Bacteroides in the responder subjects compared with the non-responder subjects already at baseline, i.e., prior to the barley intervention [10]. The purpose of this study was to investigate if the ratio Prevotella/Bacteroides at baseline can be used to identify and stratify metabolic responders from non-responders to barley DF in a population.",

Out of the total cohort of 99 subjects, we identified 15 HP subjects. Based on this number, we selected 15 LP subjects with the lowest Prevotella levels and the highest Bacteroides levels. Some of the individuals (n\u2009=\u200910) had high levels of Prevotella and high levels of Bacteroides and were identified as high Prevotella and Bacteroides (HPB) subjects and also included in the intervention study.",

Calculations of remaining test variables were performed using actual values. The trapezoid model was used to calculate the postprandial area and incremental area under the curve (AUC and iAUC, respectively) for each subject and test product. Graphs and calculations of areas were performed using Graph Prism (version 6; GraphPad Software). Postprandial mean values are reported instead of AUC and iAUC for test variables if the concentrations scarcely changed during the experimental day. Calculations of insulin resistance were made using a homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) formula [fasting glucose (mmol/l) \u00d7 fasting insulin (mU/l)/22.5] [20]. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a modified composite insulin sensitivity (ISIcomposite), also known as Matsuda index, and involved fasting and postprandial measures of b-glucose and s-insulin (ISIcomposite: 10 000/square root of [fasting glucose (mg/dl)\u2009\u00d7\u2009fasting insulin (\u00b5U/ml)\u2009\u00d7\u2009mean glucose concentrations 0\u2013120\u00a0min (mg\u00a0min/dl)\u2009\u00d7\u2009mean insulin concentrations 0\u2013120\u00a0min (\u00b5U\u00a0min/ml)]) [21]. Modification of Matsuda index refers to that postprandial concentration of b-glucose and s-insulin was obtained after a WWB breakfast consisting of 50\u00a0g rapidly available starch instead of 75\u00a0g glucose.",

From this cohort, we identified 15 subjects with highest abundance of Prevotella and lowest abundance of Bacteroides (group HP). Based on this, we selected 15 subjects with the lowest abundance of Prevotella and highest abundance of Bacteroides that formed the LP group, and 10 subjects with high abundance of both bacteria (group HPB) to be included in the short-term barley intervention. Of the selected subjects, 12 HP subjects, 13 LP subjects and 8 HPB subjects (Table\u00a02) completed the intervention and were included in the statistical evaluation (Fig.\u00a01; Table\u00a03); see the \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section for a comprehensive description regarding selection of individuals and exclusion criteria. The microbiota composition with respect to Prevotella and Bacteroides of the 59 subjects that were not included in the short-term intervention, are displayed in Fig.\u00a01.",

Therefore, subjects were stratified into different subgroups (HP, LP and HPB) depending on the gut microbiota composition. We evaluated both the effects of the short-term 3-day interventions with BKB vs WWB and effects of microbiota subgroups on cardiometabolic test variables. Effects of the interventions were also evaluated within each microbiota subgroup. The current design, 3-day long intervention with BKB, was based on previous findings where 3 days of intake of BKB was sufficient to observe acute effects of gut microbiota and glucose metabolism [10].",

However, high variability between subjects in the metabolic responses to food, e.g., postprandial glycemic responses, or SCFA production (in particular butyrate), has previously been observed, which may be related to gut microbiota composition [11, 12, 22]. In this context, we have previously shown that improved glucose tolerance after a short-term intervention with BKB was related to an enrichment of gut Prevotella, where P. copri was the most prevalent [10]. In addition, subjects responding to BKB with an improved glucose tolerance tended to have an elevated abundance of Prevotella also at baseline, prior to the BKB intervention. Prevotella can ferment a wide spectrum of complex carbohydrates, such as arabinoxylans and \u03b2-glucans, i.e., DF abundant in barley [23]. Populations living in rural areas ingesting diets rich in DF have higher abundance of Prevotella compared to those on a Western diet [24]. Accordingly, Prevotella has been associated with high intake of carbohydrates/dietary fiber [25].",

In addition, it was shown that the HP group had significantly lower breath H2 concentrations at fasting, compared to the LP group. These findings further suggest differences in the gut microbiota fermentative activities between these two groups. Furthermore, the differences in insulin responses to the standardized breakfast between the microbiota subgroups that differ the most in composition, i.e., the HP and LP groups, revealed a significant effect of baseline gut microbiota composition, demonstrating that a high abundance of Prevotella and high Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio at baseline may be advantageous with respect to postprandial glucose homeostasis, compared to a low baseline Prevotella and low Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio.",

There were no differences between the microbiota subgroups in response to BKB, in comparison to WWB, with respect to the tested variables. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that the Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio at baseline can be used to stratify metabolic responders and non-responders to the prebiotic mixture present in BKB. However, these findings do not exclude that the beneficial effects of DF are mediated by Prevotella-dependent fermentation. In addition, based on reduced insulin responses, reduced inflammatory markers and improved subjective appetite ratings in the HP group compared to the LP group (independent of intervention), the results of the current study suggest that higher Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio may be advantageous with respect to cardiometabolic regulation, and may play a preventive role in the development of obesity, T2D and CVD.",
