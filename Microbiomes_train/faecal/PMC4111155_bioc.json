Viral metagenomes typically contain many\nunknown sequences. Here we describe the discovery of a previously unidentified bacteriophage present\nin the majority of published human faecal metagenomes, which we refer to as crAssphage. Its\n~97 kbp genome is six times more abundant in publicly available metagenomes than all other\nknown phages together; it comprises up to 90% and 22% of all reads in virus-like particle\n(VLP)-derived metagenomes and total community metagenomes, respectively; and it totals 1.68% of all\nhuman faecal metagenomic sequencing reads in the public databases. The majority of\ncrAssphage-encoded proteins match no known sequences in the database, which is why it was not\ndetected before. Using a new co-occurrence profiling approach, we predict a Bacteroides host\nfor this phage, consistent with Bacteroides-related protein homologues and a unique\ncarbohydrate-binding domain encoded in the phage genome.",

Here, we address both these issues by exploiting the idea that\ninteracting sequences co-occur across samples. Co-occurrence analysis is a strong tool to identify\nfunctionally related entities. For example, correlation of gene presence/absence across genomes,\nalso known as phylogenetic profiling has been exploited to predict functional relationships between\ngenes27. Similarly, co-occurrence across metagenomic samples has been used to predict\necological interactions between bacterial species28,29. Recently, similarity in read\ndepth profiles across metagenomes has been introduced to bin contigs derived from the same genome,\nallowing the assembly of draft genomes from rare bacteria in the microbial community. This approach\nrelies on the availability of multiple similar metagenomes, such as time series samples30 or metagenomes obtained after extracting DNA with different protocols31.",

Assembly of the short, second\ngeneration sequencing reads into longer contigs may facilitate their annotation and interpretation.\nDepending on the sequence diversity of the underlying microbial community, their genome sizes, and\nsequencing statistics including depth and read length, metagenome assembly can yield short or longer\ncontigs, comprising genome sequences with different degrees of fragmentation. Binning of contigs\nderived from the same genome followed by re-assembly of the reads associated to these contigs can\ngreatly improve assembly statistics31. Several binning strategies are commonly used.\nFirst, contigs derived from the same genome may be identified if they are homologous to a known\nreference genome, although this approach seems less suitable for completely novel genomes. Second,\ninformation from mate-paired sequencing reads may be exploited for de novo binning, if\navailable. Third, oligonucleotide usage (k-mer profile binning) is a de novo binning approach\nsuitable for longer contigs >1,000 nt, but it is not robust for short contigs33. Moreover, genomes with similar k-mer usage cannot be distinguished. Fourth, a recently\nintroduced depth profile binning approach allowed the assembly of near-complete draft genomes from\nmetagenome data30,31. Combining different metagenomic data sets in a cross-assembly\nis a simple way to create an occurrence profile for contigs, where the number of reads from a\nmetagenome that are assembled into a contig represents the occurrence of that contig in the\nmetagenome. The cross-assembly programme crAss32 generates such an occurrence profile\nfor each contig. By normalizing for metagenome size, these occurrence profiles can be transformed\ninto depth profiles for all contigs.",

Next, we used depth profile binning as well as homology binning to identify other contigs\nthat were likely derived from the same ubiquitous viral genome as contig07548. First, we calculated\nSpearman\u2019s correlation scores between the depth profile of contig07548 across the 12 samples,\nand the profiles of all other contigs (Supplementary Data\n1). This resulted in many contigs with highly similar abundance patterns across the viral\nmetagenomes (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that they had a similar occurrence\nin the original samples. Second, we performed a blastn34 search (e-value\n<10\u221210) against Genbank35, resulting in significant hits for\n1,591 cross-contigs.

Because we expected\nthe viral quasispecies to contain sequence heterogeneities, we used assembly settings that allowed\nsuch diversity to be collapsed (specifically, a short word length and a large bubble size, see\nMethods). We used the viral metagenome of Twin 1 from Family 2 (F2T1) for this assembly8, because most reads in the ubiquitous cross-contigs were derived from this metagenome\n(Supplementary Data 1). This allowed us to construct a\ncircular chromosome of 97,065 base pairs (bp) at an average depth of 230-fold in the F2T1 viral\nmetagenomic sample (Fig. 1). We named this phage \u2018crAssphage\u2019\nafter the cross-assembly programme originally used to discover it32. Although we used\nde novo assembly, the crAssphage genome aligned a total of 31 sequences from the unrelated\nhuman gut metagenome in Genbank mentioned above over 99.3% of its length (blastn e-value\n<10\u221243, four small gaps of 7\u2013406 bp remained).

They are largely\nco-oriented, being organized in two large blocks of ORFs encoded on the same strand (Fig. 1). This genomic organization is typical of phage genomes, which frequently have a much\nlarger fraction of their proteins encoded in sequential stretches on the same strand than bacterial\ngenomes37. Functions could be annotated to a minority of the ORFs by a combination of\nhomology searches in Genbank35 and the Phage Annotation Tools and Methods database\n(PhAnToMe, http://www.phantome.org/), and domain\nsearches using HHPred38 (Supplementary Data\n2). Viral structural proteins were predicted using iVireons39. Among the\nannotated ORFs, a tentative clustering of functionally related proteins could be observed (Supplementary Data 2). The HHPred search identified two hits\nto a Firmicute plasmid replication protein (RepL; PFam identifier PF05732 (ref. 40)) in orf00050 and orf00102. Interestingly, these two ORFs occur close to the\nlocation where the coding directionality switches from the forward to the reverse strand. These\nconserved domains may facilitate the independent replication of the phage genome. Moreover, we\nidentified several Bacteroidetes-associated carbohydrate-binding (BACON; PFam identifier\nPF13004 (ref. 41)) domains present within orf00074 (Supplementary Fig. 5). BACON is a recently identified domain\nmediating adherence to glycoproteins41. It has thus far only been found in\nBacteroidetes genomes and in gut metagenomes, and was recently reported in another phage\ngenome7. The homology-independent iVireons tool39 predicted orf00074\nto be a phage-structural protein (iVireons score 0.97, that is 85\u201388% accuracy). The presence\nof the BACON domain in a phage-structural protein might be explained by the recently proposed\nbacteriophage adherence to mucus model42. According to this model, phage adhere to\nthe mucin glycoproteins composing the intestinal mucus layer through capsid-displayed\ncarbohydrate-binding domains (such as the immunoglobulin-like fold or the BACON domain),\nfacilitating more frequent interactions with the bacteria that the phage infects42.",

These public metagenomes were sampled from a range of microbial environments, and were not\nlimited to the human gut. To do this, we created a database consisting of 1,193 phage genomes\nincluding crAssphage and all complete phage genomes in the PhAnToMe database, and used this to align\nthe public metagenomic reads (blastn, \u226575 bp aligned, \u226595% identity,\nambiguously aligned reads were discarded). We detected reads that uniquely aligned to crAssphage in\n940 of these metagenomes, including both total community metagenomes and viral metagenomes, among\nwhich were 342 of the 466 faecal metagenomes (73%). Previous reports have estimated that total\ncommunity samples may also contain sequences of viral origin, estimates ranging up to 17% (refs\n6, 8, 17,\n24, 25). Here, we observed that the\ncrAssphage genome accommodated up to 90% of the sequencing reads in the faecal viral (that is,\nVLP-derived) metagenomes from the twin study that we used as a starting point8; up to\n24% of the reads in an unrelated faecal viral metagenome from Korea13; and up to 22%\nof the reads in total faecal community metagenomes from USA16 (Supplementary Data 4). Across all the metagenomes, 235.8 million\nreads aligned uniquely to crAssphage. Almost all these hits (235.5 million or 99.9%) were derived\nfrom human gut metagenomes, comprising 1.68% of all the reads in the metagenomes that were annotated\nas being derived from human faeces. Thus, crAssphage is significantly more abundant in human faeces\nthan in other environments (one-tailed Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test,\nP<2.2e\u221216). Based on this analysis, crAssphage is by far the most\nabundant, and one of the most ubiquitous bacteriophages in the publicly available metagenomes (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 5).",

These depth profiles were highly similar for the majority of the ubiquitous\ncross-contigs, suggesting that they were derived from the same genome (Supplementary Data 1).

We note that the presented genome sequence should be interpreted as a metapopulation\nconsensus genome of the viral quasispecies that occurs in the sample36, where some\nsequence diversity remains. For example, this can be observed in the sequencing results of the PCR\nproducts, where higher sequence identity to the crAssphage genome is observed in the traces derived\nfrom the original sample, F2T1 than in the unrelated sample TSDC8.2, although some mutations\nrelative to the assembled sequence still remain, even in F2T1 (Supplementary Table 1).",
