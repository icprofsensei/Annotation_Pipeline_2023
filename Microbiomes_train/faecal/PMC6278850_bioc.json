However, most of the environmental risk factors in MS remain unexplained. In consideration of additional potential mediators, the gut is a natural site of investigation, given that it is a major locus of environmental interaction and home to a large portion of the human immune system. In addition, immunologic development and patterning, dysregulated in MS and other autoimmune diseases, is heavily influenced by resident commensal microbes, the microbiota. Gut microbial composition is shaped by both genetics and environmental exposures that begin in utero, providing a potential pathogenic link between these factors and autoimmune diseases such as MS. Studies of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice have demonstrated reduced disease severity with administration of oral antibiotics3 and established that the presence of commensal flora is required for EAE induction.4",

Efficacy in MS was established by several clinical trialse7\u2013e9 and it has been U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of MS since 1996. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an orally administered fumaric acid ester. Immunological effects relevant to MS include antiproliferative effects, inhibition of the NF-KB pathway, promotion of the heme oxygenase pathway, and anti-inflammatory effects related to T-cell differentiation and cytokine production.e10 Efficacy was established by 2 large clinical trials,e11,e12 and U.S. FDA approval was granted for MS in 2013.",

In total, 49,679,344 raw reads passed the quality filtering in QIIME and were clustered into OTUs based on the GreenGenes database at a 97% sequence identity. We further applied stringent filters to remove samples with low sequencing reads and rare taxa (see Methods for detail) and then combined multiple collections within a short time interval from the same participant to counteract temporal variations (figure 1). This resulted in 8,542,763 high-quality reads (on average 49,628 \u00b1 31,746 reads per participant) mapping to 2,191 unique OTUs. At the phylum level, the microbiota of all patients with MS was comprised predominately of Firmicutes (45.9%) and Bacteroidetes (41.0%) and to a lesser extent of Proteobacteria (8.7%), Actinobacteria (2.0%), and Verrucomicrobia (2.0%), consistent with recent reports on microbiota profiles identified in patients with MS or healthy participants on a Western diet5,6,17,18 (figure 2).",

Although no alpha diversity differences were detected, we detected small within-sex and between-sex beta diversity differences (p = 0.01, effect size = 0.6%) that are not noticeable on a principal coordinate analysis plot (figure e-2). As shown in figure 2, administration of DMF or GA did not result in overall changes to microbial community structure as measured by alpha diversity (richness of taxa within samples by observed_species or richness and evenness of taxa within samples by chao1) or beta diversity (diversity between different samples by unweighted UniFrac. However, LEfSe analysis identified 13 differentially abundant bacterial genera in patients with MS on DMF and 14 differentially abundant genera in patients on GA, as compared to those who were treatment-naive (table 2). Of interest, GA led to a reduction in the relative abundance of 7 genera and an increase of 7 genera, whereas all the 13 genera affected by DMF treatment showed decreased relative abundance (figure 3). Among the taxonomic units decreased by DMF, the most dramatic effect was mapped to the order Clostridiales (figure 4), thereby suggesting potential importance of this taxon.",

This result is interesting in the context of other studies that have looked at this commensal group in MS and suggested a potential protective effect. A small study in pediatric MS showed relative depletion of Bacteroides compared with healthy controls.8 From a mechanistic standpoint, oral administration of purified polysaccharide A produced by Bacteroides fragilis was shown to mitigate EAE in an IL-10-dependent fashion.19 Lipid 654, a lipodipeptide generated by several commensal Bacteroidetes species, reaches the systemic circulation and is reduced in the serum of patients with MS compared with healthy controls.20 In an adoptive transfer model of EAE, low-level Lipid 654 was administered to induce toll-like receptor 2 tolerance and was found to attenuate EAE and decrease macrophage activation and TH17 cells in the CNS.21 Our results suggest that the observed effects of DMF on gut microbiota might be relevant to its anti-inflammatory effects in MS.",

Another possible explanation for observed differences in the effects of DMT on Prevotella in our study compared with others relates to our use of the V4 hypervariable region as compared to the use of V3\u2013V5 in the aforementioned studies. However, previous comparisons of these variations in the technique have demonstrated relatively consistent results, making this difference unlikely to fully account for this discordance.23,\u201325",

An increase in Sutterella in treated compared with untreated patients with MS was previously reported; however, the treatment group included patients treated with either IFN or GA.5 Suggesting that IFN may in fact be the driving factor, an additional study has noted an increase in Sutterella in IFN-treated MS patients.26 In a spontaneous EAE model, specimens from mice who received transplanted MS fecal material were noted to be relatively depleted in Sutterella.27 Given that the EAE course worsened in mice transplanted with fecal material from patients with MS, compared with those transplanted from a healthy twin, this finding might be pathologically significant. However, in this experiment, 3 of the 5 MS twins received treatment with IFN, potentially confounding interpretation of these results. Further work is needed to understand whether Sutterella is associated with MS pathology, whether there are differential effects of DMTs on the abundance of this genus, and finally whether such potential effects on Sutterella abundance have any clinical significance.",

Members of 2 particular Clostridial families, Lachnospiraceae and Veillonellaceae, were decreased by both DMF and GA. Of interest, we previously noted increased relative abundance of the genus Megasphaera (family Veillonellaceae) in untreated MS compared with healthy controls.10 DMF seems to \u201creverse\u201d this. Clostridial organisms have received significant attention in demyelinating disorders. An increased frequency of immunoreactivity to epsilon toxin\u2013producing Clostridium perfringens type B was observed in patients with MS, suggesting this organism as contributory to MS pathology, given the potentially toxic effects at the blood-brain barrier.28 A subsequent study demonstrated the ability of epsilon toxin to destroy oligodendrocytes and induce demyelination.29 An overabundance of C perfringens has also been noted in a small study of patients with neuromyelitis optica.30 In addition to the described potential effects of Clostridial members on inflammation, Lachnospiraceae was demonstrated to impair oligodendrocyte differentiation in cultured cells and was associated with impaired myelination in mice.31 Clostridial taxa therefore have potential for pathologic relevance in MS and the mechanism of action of DMTs both with respect to inflammation and neurodegeneration/neuroprotection. In concordance with our results regarding other Clostridial family members, DMF was noted to inhibit the log-phase growth of C perfringens in vitro, and investigators hypothesized that this may be contributory to the drug's mechanism of action.32 A decrease in species belonging to Clostridia clusters was previously found in patients with MS compared with controls; however, this majority of participants in this study were treated with DMTs.7 A decrease in the relative abundance of Clostridial members could be common to several MS DMTs.",

The methodology used here to calculate relative abundance values precludes conclusions about the absolute numbers of microbes present. However, fumarates have known antimicrobial properties and in fact DMF was previously used as an antimicrobial preservative for upholstery.33 Of interest, previous work in EAE suggests that a reduction in gut bacterial load might be of benefit.3 Compared with mice who received no antibiotics or intraperitoneal antibiotics, those who received oral antibiotics before EAE induction demonstrated reduced EAE severity that correlated to an increase in FoxP3+Treg cells in distal peripheral lymph nodes. Further, costimulation of harvested lymphocytes from distal nodes resulted in decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN gamma and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Additional studies are needed to evaluate this potential effect of DMF as its generalized antimicrobial properties may be a contributing factor to efficacy in MS.",

PICRUSt analysis may help identify the impact of changes in microbial composition on biological and metabolic pathways and suggest potential mechanisms that link changes in gut microbiota with therapeutic effects.16 One of the common pathways affected by both GA and DMF was retinol (vitamin A) metabolism. Vitamin A metabolites are known to modulate specific functional aspects of the immune response, such as the Th1\u2013Th2-cell balance and the differentiation of Treg and Th17 cells.34 Retinoic acid also modulates lymphocyte trafficking by enhancing integrin a4b7 expression on lymphocytes and imprinting them with gut tropism.35 Of interest, dendritic cells from the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, but not from the spleen, were able to produce retinoic acid from retinol, suggesting that vitamin A plays an important role specifically in the gut-immune system interaction. Another bacterial pathway affected by both therapies was methane metabolism. An increased relative abundance of methane-producing bacteria and exhaled methane in patients with MS compared with healthy controls was reported.5 The role of these pathways in MS pathophysiology and precise effects of therapies will need to be further explored in future studies.",
