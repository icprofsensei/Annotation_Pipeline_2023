The highest OTU richness and phylogenetic diversity was found in the mouth samples. The microbial communities of multiple biopsy sites within the colon were highly similar within individuals and largely distinct from those in stool. Within an individual, OTU overlap among broad site definitions (mouth, stomach/duodenum, colon and stool) ranged from 32\u2013110 OTUs, 25 of which were common to all individuals and included OTUs affiliated with Faecalibacterium prasnitzii and the TM7 phylum.

Recent research has begun to enumerate the microbial species inhabiting the mouth8,9 and the distal colon, with emphasis on studies of gut colonization10,11, and populations that are present in both health12,13 and disease14,15. Despite the impact of the oral and gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome on human health, a taxonomic baseline, consisting of a comprehensive survey of the diversity and distribution of microbial communities within healthy human beings, is lacking. This is due to several issues including difficulties in cultivating host-associated microorganisms, lack of suitable molecular methods for comprehensive characterization of complex microbial communities, and the relative difficulty in obtaining internal human mucosal samples for analysis. Although culturing microorganisms sampled from human body sites continues to provide valuable insight into the bacterial populations present, knowledge of the human microbiome has been expanded greatly by culture-independent techniques such as fluorescence microscopy, bacterial phylogenetic microarrays, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics.",

Preliminary next-generation sequencing studies have achieved greater coverage of the microbial populations associated with multiple human body sites. In particular, global surveys of feces and external body sites17,18,19,20, the oral cavity13 and selective sampling of the human digestive tract21 reveal high diversity, site-specific clustering of community composition and taxonomic uniqueness between individuals. However, until now there have been no studies that have profiled the microbial communities associated with the complete human digestive system in healthy individuals. The comprehensive characterization of normal microbial communities associated with the human GI tract is a critical prerequisite to understanding and predicting alterations in these communities in relation to disease. Here we address this lack of knowledge by generating an extensive taxonomic baseline for the human digestive system using next-generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing, leveraging Illumina sequencing technology22. Using this approach, we address as-yet unanswered questions such as: How do microbial communities change along the length of the GI tract? Which bacterial assemblages inhabit each GI location? Are bacterial profiles in feces the same as those associated with intestinal mucosa? Do abundant bacteria differ fundamentally from those found at relatively low abundance (i.e. the \u201crare biosphere\u201d)?",

The samples included mouth plaque (left and right supra-gingival and sub-gingival, tongue), stomach (antrum and body), duodenum, colon (transverse and descending), rectum and stool. The results show that bacterial communities cluster by sample site and that specific bacterial populations are characteristic of different human GI sites. Microbial communities shift along the length of the digestive tract, exhibiting clear differences even between colon mucosal and fecal profiles. Despite the depth of sampling, most accumulation curves did not plateau. The abundant and rare organisms within each library belonged to similar taxonomic groups, although there was an increase in the proportion of unclassified OTUs among rare sequences. This study represents the first internal biogeographic map of the complete human digestive system, and therefore it represents an essential baseline to support further studies linking microbial communities with aspects of human health and disease.",

This validation consisted of prospecting a predefined community, a mixture of DNA from 12 known bacterial cultures, with both Sanger-based sequencing of a single clone library (96 clones), and Illumina sequencing of two technical replicates (>500,000 sequences for each replicate). The Illumina method recovered 16S rRNA gene sequences from all 12 organisms with a reproducible abundance distribution (Fig. S1), confirming the reproducibility of this analytical approach. Fewer Pseudomonas sequences were recovered in the replicate Illumina libraries than expected based on the initial mix ratio. However, no Pseudomonas sequences were detected within the Sanger-sequenced library. These results demonstrate the importance of increased sequencing coverage to offset the loss of detected OTUs by possible methodological biases.

This indicates that the 16S rRNA gene dataset found potentially novel lineages in the human microbiome. This study found 19 known phyla to be present in the oral samples of all individuals, with a predominance of five or six major phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria and either of Spirochaetes, TM7 or SR1 (Fig. 2). No major differences were observed between supra- and sub-gingival plaque samples as would be expected in healthy subjects. Although stomach and duodenum samples showed fewer OTUs than other sites, they harbored representatives of most phyla observed throughout the study with the exception of a population of unclassified Cyanobacteria not seen elsewhere. Because a colon prep was applied prior to sampling and Cyanobacteria-related sequences have previously been reported in the colon of humans and the guts of other mammals26,27, Cyanobacteria may be resident organisms within the duodenum and not simply DNA sequences transiently present there at the time of collection. Interestingly, three of the four duodenum samples contained larger proportions of Acidobacteria (mainly unclassified Acidobacteria Gp22; Table S4) than any other sampled site. The results of this study reveal substantial OTU diversity in the stomach and duodenum, although, as reflected in their low Shannon indices (Fig. 1), most communities were dominated by only a few genera.",

The dataset contained representatives of 19 known phyla and 436 known genera (Tables S2 and S3, respectively). Colon mucosal communities were largely comprised of known anaerobic microorganisms and the predominant genera at these sites were Bacteroides, Coprococcus, and Faecalibacterium. A species of the latter genus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has been implicated in colonic health due to its anti-inflammatory properties4. Bacteroides are thought to be the key anaerobes in health and disease28 and were the most abundant genera identified (occurring mainly in colon mucosal sites), making up the bulk of the Bacteroidetes sequences obtained in the study. However, several other genera such as Prevotella and Capnocytophaga were particularly abundant and important in clustering of oral sample sites.",

The stomach and duodenum set of OTUs typically shared the fewest clusters with other body sites. A subset of 32\u2013110 OTUs were present in every sampling region of each individual, with 25 of these OTUs being present in all subjects (Table S5). The abundances of these 25 shared OTUs varied among individuals and sites, but were generally high, ranging from ca. 50,000 \u2013 2,800,000 sequences. Included in this shared subset were Faecalibacterium, TM7 and Streptococcus (Table S5).",

Whenever this species was abundant in the mucosa, it was also abundant in the corresponding stool. On the other hand, the ability to detect sequences of potentially harmful organisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Treponema denticola or Clostridium difficile at very low relative abundances has potential diagnostic value and possible prophylactic applications.

Inter-individual variability is a hallmark of human microbiome studies. Accordingly, there was more phylogenetic variability between subjects than there was between sample sites from within each GI location (e.g. mouth, large intestine), likely due to the similarity in redox conditions and availability of nutrients at sites compared with the variability of host-specific factors such as diet or oral hygiene. This is not surprising if the gastrointestinal tract is thought of as a changing ecosystem where adaptable microbial communities are replaced continually by functionally similar representatives in each host20. Nonetheless, although the types of organisms present within each person are distinct at the OTU level, they are very similar at higher taxonomic levels.",

This observation concurs with those made from shallower sequence sampling coverage by Costello and coworkers17. The most abundant microbial populations found within the oral sites here were also observed in previous 16S rRNA gene surveys8,29, whereas some of the low-abundance groups seen in this study, such as Alphaproteobacteria, Coriobacteridae, Acidobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Deinococci, were found in a recent PCR-independent metagenomic study of oral communities30. This suggests that our method not only reproduces the results of previous 16S rRNA gene screens but can identify low abundance organisms not usually detected with less sequence coverage. These results reinforce the notion of the mouth as the entry point for GI bacteria (highest diversity) with selection for a subset of the total diversity occurring as these organisms pass through the gastrointestinal tract. The microbial diversity associated with mouth samples was similar to that observed in a previous pyrosequencing study of oral microflora31. Our study found greater OTU numbers in the stomach than previous studies16, likely due to the greater sequencing depth achieved here. Recent evidence for diverse microbial populations within the stomach has challenged the traditional notion that the upper GI tract is nearly sterile16,32. Further research is required to assess the extent to which these findings reflect genuine diversity, or whether alpha diversity measures (e.g. Fig S2) continue to be inflated by artifacts of next-generation sequencing approaches33. As in the murine gut12, diversity along the GI track increased from stomach to stool. Bacterial density and growth rates are also known to change along the GI track34. In agreement with previous reports including those using metagenomes sequences35, the abundant organisms in colon and stool samples were similar between individuals, with inter-individual variation occurring in the least abundant groups.",

Here, due to the collection of multiple samples from the same individual within a short timeframe, gradients of microbial community composition as well as distinct differences at different body sites along the digestive tract were apparent (Fig. 4). Bacterial communities in the oral cavity were made up of different taxonomic groups and were phylogenetically distinct from those at colon sites (based on UniFrac), whereas there was an observable representation of bacterial taxonomic groups in both the mouth and colon but not stool (as with Fusobacteria in Subject 2 and Proteobacteria in Subject 3; Fig. 2). These results point to a seeding of mucosal (colonic) communities with organisms from higher up in the digestive tract. Within multi-site shared OTUs (Fig. 4), those related to both Faecalibacterium and TM7 (among others; Table S5) were associated with all general site locations (e.g. mouth, stomach/duodenum, colon, stool) in all individuals. It is interesting to note the all-subject and all-site distribution for sequences of Faecalibacterium-like bacteria (Table S5), which have been associated with anti-inflammatory properties in patients with Crohn disease4. This distribution suggests widespread exposure and continuous seeding of this beneficial bacterium in humans. TM7-related bacteria represents a largely uncultivated phylum36, with corresponding sequences associated with a variety of human body samples ranging from the mouth29,37,38, associated with chronic periodontitis39, and other body sites such as the esophagus40, stomach16, intestines41, vaginal secretions42 and skin43. It will be useful to assess the widespread distribution of the core 25 OTUs shared between all sites in additional individuals.",

The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes within stool has recently been suggested to fluctuate with the body mass index (BMI) of the individuals sampled12. Although we sampled only four individuals, we noted that the ratios of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes within the intestinal mucosal and stool samples were not the same (Fig. 2). This difference in ratio suggests that the specific relationships with BMI that were found previously may differ for luminal (stool) and mucosa-associated bacterial communities. Additional research would be required to determine whether this observation is generally consistent across individuals although a previous study has also shown stool microbial profiles that are distinct from fecal profiles27.",

The analyses of low-abundance sequences (Fig. 5, Fig. S5) indicate that only relatively minor shifts in taxonomic representation occur among scarce OTUs, still with a small proportion of unclassified organisms, at all sites within the human GI tract. This observation contrasts with the patterns observed recently in Arctic tundra soil22, where low-abundance OTUs belonged to different taxonomic groups from those of high-abundance OTUs. However, in agreement with previous observations22,44, we observed an increasing proportion of unknown or unclassified organisms among rare OTUs. Because phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity is expected to correlate with functional diversity, our observation of few shifts in the taxonomic membership of rare organisms indicates a possible functionally redundant role of the rare biosphere in the oral and GI tract. Further research will continue to explore the identities and roles of rare uncharacterized taxa in human and environmental samples. Notably, the Illumina sequencing method applied here resulted in a relatively low proportion of chimeric sequences within the data, consistent with previous observations25. This is not surprising considering the short length of the PCR amplicons and the absence of long stretches of highly conserved nucleotides. This finding emphasizes the usefulness of this method for deep-sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and removes the need to exclude a large portion of the data due to predicted chimeras.",

However, although variable regions have high taxonomic resolution45, caution should accompany the interpretation of such targeted analyses because V3-region sequences can represent closely related species, and thus will not, in some cases, be able to distinguish pathogenic from commensal members or, potentially, even closely related species within the same genus45. Similar concerns apply not only to our data, but also to any single-gene (or even phenotype-based) analyses of host-associated microorganisms. Sequencing variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene is one of many investigative techniques and thus requires additional complementary approaches to confirm observations.",

The stool sample was frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until the time of endoscopy and the sample was stored at \u221280\u00b0C until DNA extraction. Prior to gastroscopy and colonoscopy, samples of the oral biofilm were collected from supra-gingival plaque, sub-gingival plaque, and the surface of the tongue. Plaque samples were collected using a sterile curette and placed into 1\u2005ml of sterile DNA-free Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (D-PBS; Invitrogen). Supra-gingival samples were taken from caries-free interproximal sites between the maxillary lateral incisor and the maxillary cuspid incisor or the maxillary cuspid incisor and the first primary molar on the right (12/13 or 13/14) and left side (22/23 or 23/24) for each subject. Sub-gingival plaque was taken from periodontal pockets of the above-mentioned teeth. Teeth were isolated to minimize salivary contamination and two strokes of the curette were used per site in an attempt to standardize collection. Sampling of the tongue was done with a sterile stainless steel spatula with one midline scrape of the tongue only. The sample solutions were vortexed and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until DNA extraction. During colonoscopy and gastroscopy, biopsies of the transverse colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, gastric antrum, gastric body and of the duodenum were collected. Tissue samples were placed in 1\u2005ml of sterile D-PBS as above, then rapidly frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until used for DNA extraction.",

Total genomic DNA was isolated from 500\u2005\u00b5l of the sample storage buffer (or from 0.25\u2005g of feces) with the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications, described below. Only supernatants from vortexed tissue biopsies were included in the DNA isolation in order to reduce the co-extraction of human DNA. Modifications to the DNA isolation kit protocol included the addition of a 40\u2005sec bead-beating step (at speed 6.0 in a FastPrep homogenizer; MP Biomedicals, USA) and heating to 70\u00b0C for 10\u2005min prior to binding of contaminants with kit reagents. Purified DNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel and quantified by densitometry of the gel image and spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 1000; Thermo Scientific, USA) of the sample. Of the 48 samples collected, two were excluded due to low biomass and an inability to extract sufficient DNA for subsequent PCR amplification.",

For Illumina library preparation, amplification of the V3 region used modified 341F and 518R primers47 containing a six-base barcode, the Illumina adapter sequence and regions for binding of the sequencing primers22. Twenty-five cycles were used for the first PCR round and 20 cycles were used for the second round. One exception to this was the use of 30 cycles for gastric antrum and gastric body samples in the second PCR round. Forty-six pooled PCR amplicons were prepared as described previously22 and added in equal ng amounts to be sequenced in two lanes of a Genome Analyzer IIx at the Plant Biotechnology Institute (National Research Council Canada; Saskatchewan, Canada).",

The V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified as described above, in duplicate using two different barcodes, in order to evaluate library reproducibility. These additional two libraries were sequenced as part of a separate Illumina run containing additional environmental samples. Near full-length 16S rRNA genes from the same pool of DNA were amplified using 27F/1492R primers as described above and inserted into the TOPO cloning system (Invitrogen, Canada) then used to transform E. coli, as per kit instructions. Ninety-six positive clones were chosen and sequenced with conventional Sanger sequencing. All sequences were classified using the RDP classifier with the same conditions as below.",

Calculations for Chao1, phylogenetic diversity and Shannon diversity involved five rarefied subsets of 200,000 sequences from each sample. Supra-gingival plaque from Subject 1 was excluded from this analysis since it contained an unusually low number of sequences. Similarity and differences in community membership were calculated based on the phylogenetic information within each sample with both the unweighted and weighted UniFrac analysis. UPGMA trees of weighted and unweighted UniFrac values were calculated with QIIME and plotted with FigTree v 1.3.154. Jackknife values were calculated with 100\u2005sets of 200,000-sequence rarefied tables (without replacement).
