These reservoirs are fed with rainwater and/or directly from the river, which are very contaminated by several pathogenic bacteria. They are used without any treatment as a drinking water by the surrounding population. In this context, the aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of consuming contaminated water stored in reservoirs on health status for six rural communities located in Assif El Mal, Southern East of Marrakech. This was investigated using a classical methodology based on population survey and by molecular approach using PCR\u2013DGGE technique to determine the intestinal bacterial diversity of consumers. The survey showed that, the residents of the studied area suffered from numerous health problems (diarrheal diseases, vomiting or hepatitis A) due to the lack of waste management infrastructures. The consumer\u2019s stool analysis by molecular approach revealed that numbers of Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila and Clostridia, were significantly higher in the diarrheal feces. In addition, PCR\u2013DGGE study of the prevalence and distribution of bacteria causing human diseases, confirmed that, there is a relationship between water bacterial contaminations of storage reservoirs and microbial disease related health status. Therefore, water reservoir consumption is assumed to be the mean way of exposure for this population.",

Indeed, to identify one species by this technique, the biochemical or serological procedure used for that needs at least one week according to the standards of microbial analysis. To ensure a good public water quality, we must develop improved methods, more precise to identify human fecal pollution. Consequently, scientists have been searching for other rapid methods, that are very sensible to detect all bacterial diversity in environmental samples. Therefore, a molecular detection method is required, since such methods are highly specific and sensitive. The molecular approach is typically based on the detection and quantification of specific segments of the pathogen\u2019s genome (DNA or RNA).",

The majority of the dominant bands sequences (72%) displayed more than 97% similarity with the known sequences in database. The most abundant bacterial groups detected were members of the Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, but the diarrhea groups were mainly composed by phylum Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Among the dominant bands, 94% (16/17) had more than 98% of similarity with the known sequences in the database and were found in both the studied groups (exposed and control).",

Cluster analysis, based on band patterns, showed a clear gradient upstream\u2013downstream in fecal samples in parallel to the gradient that was shown for water reservoirs with reference to bacterial contamination level (Aziz et al., 2013). An obvious grouping of all subjects of each station is also viewed (Fig. 3). Therefore, this clear grouping of fecal samples is related to bacterial diversity in water reservoirs. So, this spatial gradient from the station R1\u2013R6, due to an accumulation of microbiological contaminants from upstream to downstream in water (Aziz et al., 2013), is proportionally reflected on GI tract of the user population. This is due mainly to the increasing degree of the pollution impact caused by the activity of neighboring populations along the studied area.",

Even though some bands obtained by 16S rDNA PCR amplification are short and cannot be used to distinguish the exact taxonomic groups, we can use them to understand the distribution of bacterial population. In addition, the use of this molecular technique helps to give accurate information on the most dominant bacteria groups in the human tract. This could be seen as a preventive evaluation of the sanitary risk, for vulnerable population, before causing the diarrhea or other water borne diseases.",
