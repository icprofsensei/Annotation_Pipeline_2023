Severe insults to the gut have been hypothesized to promote multiple organ dysfunction syndrome as a result of disruption of commensal bacteria [4]. In previous studies, a low microbial diversity has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in critically ill patients [5, 6], and domination by certain pathogens has been identified as an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes [7\u20139]. Neurocritical care in the management of acute neurologic injury has rapidly evolved over the last 30\u2009years [10]. However, little information is available regarding the ways in which the microbiota changes during neurocritical illness and whether the features of the intestinal microbiome are associated with mortality in the setting of neurocritical care.",

However, the composition and community structure of microbes that colonize the human gut during critical illness have not been fully understood. Advances in next-generation sequencing provide opportunities to determine the gut microbiome composition in individuals as \u201cmicrobial fingerprints\u201d. Therefore, additional knowledge of the characteristics of the gut microbiota in neurocritically ill patients is required to better understand the microbial disturbances associated with clinical outcomes to identify patients who would benefit from microbiota-targeted therapies [14].",

Sequencing 200\u2009bp at one end of each fragment had the advantages of a good overlap effect, minimal use of computing resources and improved sequence quality [18, 19]. Depending on the overlap between the two paired-end sequences, we then used SeqPrep to merge the paired-end sequences and assessed the quality of the result using the open-source software Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, version 1.9.1) [20]. A QIIME workflow script, split_libraries_fastq.py, was used to check the quality of the sequences, and sequences with a Phred score of \u2265\u2009Q20 were considered qualified sequences. Then, we used a home-brewed script to split FASTA files according to the paired-end barcode information, which met the following criteria: a 100% match between the barcode and the primer and more than 200\u2009bp remaining after the removal of the barcode and primer. Finally, we used a QIIME workflow script, pick_closed_reference_otus.py, to remove chimaeras, perform reference-based operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering and generate a BIOM file. We used Greengenes 13.8 as the reference database and SortMeRNA for clustering and classification with an identity cut-off value of 0.97.

A univariate Cox proportional hazards model was first performed, and the candidate variables with a p value of <\u20090.05 were further included in the multivariate Cox regression model for adjustment. The candidate variables included demographic data (age and sex), comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, intracranial infection, intracranial hypertension, and pneumonia), serum markers (white blood cell count, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, brain natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein), indicators of critical illness (GCS, APACHE-II and SOFA scores and the length of ICU stay), medical treatments (mechanical ventilation and enteral nutrition), the biodiversity of the microbiota (Shannon, PD\u2013whole tree, Chao 1, observed species and Simpson indexes) and the z-scores of specific taxa abundances or their changes.

At the family level, Enterobacteriaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Enterococcaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Rikenellaceae and Lactobacillaceae were enriched in the neuroICU group. To show the heterogeneity among individual gut microbiota compositions, we generated area plots from the first sample of each individual. At the phylum level, a high interindividual diversity in the faecal microbiota composition was observed in the neuroICU group (Fig.\u00a02a). The faecal samples from patients P40 revealed a high abundance of Verrucomicrobia (>\u200930%), similar to the results reported by Lankelma et al. [25]. The bacterial composition analysis at the family level revealed an even greater interpatient diversity than that seen at the phylum level (Fig.\u00a02b). Enterococcaceae comprised more than 70% of the microbiota in P31, and Enterobacteriaceae comprised more than 70% in two other patients (P53 and P64). However, none of the microbiomes in the HCs were dominated by any single pathogen to an extent of greater than 70%.",

The other 48 patients were excluded, as they had only one available stool sample during their hospital stay. The bacterial community composition in all of these patients exhibited a substantial compositional divergence at discharge relative to that at admission (Fig.\u00a03a). The samples collected at admission exhibited significantly higher community composition diversity (as indicated by the Shannon index) than the samples collected at discharge (Wilcoxon test, p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03b). The microbiota changed radically after neuroICU admission. The \u03b1-diversities of the samples, which included only samples collected more than once from a single patient, were correlated inversely with the number of days spent in the neuroICU (r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.211, p\u2009=\u20090.008; r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.196, p\u2009=\u20090.015, respectively) (Fig.\u00a03c, d). The distances between each sample in the neuroICU and HC groups were calculated by the Bray\u2013Curtis and unweighted UniFrac metrics, which were plotted against the length of hospital stay. The Bray\u2013Curtis distances and unweighted UniFrac were correlated positively with the number of days spent in the neuroICU (r\u2009=\u20090.207, p\u2009=\u20090.010; r\u2009=\u20090.220, p\u2009=\u20090.006, respectively) (Fig.\u00a03e, f). The \u03b1-diversities changed greatly in the serial samples collected from the same patients several weeks apart (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S3). In some subjects, the \u03b1-diversity recovered by the end of hospitalization (P01, P05 and P26), which was similar to a previous report [26].",

Fifty patients with paired samples both in the first 72\u2009h and in the second week were included. The other 48 patients were excluded as they had only one available stool sample during their hospital stay. The results of the univariate model showed that the abundance changes in Fusobacteria, Fusobacteriales, Enterobacteriales, Veillonellaceae, Fusobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were associated with the 180-day mortality (Table\u00a03). However, only increases in Enterobacteriales and Enterobacteriaceae were found to be independently associated with 180-day mortality in the multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for APACHE-II, respiratory failure, intracranial hypertension and serum lactate (Table\u00a03). The increases in Enterobacteriales and Enterobacteriaceae during the first week in the neuroICU were both associated with increases of 92% in the risk of 180-day mortality after adjustments.",

We documented both changes in the diversities and large interindividual diversities in these patients relative to those characteristics in HCs. An overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens defined dysbiosis in patients with neurocritical illness. We also found that the bacterial community composition in the intestine at discharge significantly diverged from that observed at admission. In addition, the Cox regression analyses demonstrated that the abundances of Christensenellaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae at admission, as well as the abundance increase in Enterobacteriaceae during the ICU stay, were significantly associated with patients\u2019 mortality within 180\u2009days. To the best of our knowledge, this prospective observational study represents the largest cohort study of neurocritically ill patients to perform 16S rRNA gene sequence-based analyses of the gut microbiota and explore the association between the abundances of specific bacteria and survival status during the following 180\u2009days in the setting of neurocritical illness.",

                    "text": "Intestinal microbiota dysbiosis can be defined as an altered dialogue between the host\u2019s cells and enteric bacteria due to disruption of microbial diversity usually manifested as the dominance of a given taxon. In recent decades, basic and translational studies have elucidated the functions of and architectural shifts in the intestinal microbiota in specific conditions and processes such as metabolic disease [27], central nervous system function [28, 29], systemic inflammation [30, 31] and immune function [32]. More recently, convincing evidence has emerged to report the appearance of pathogens, disappearance of commensals and loss of microbial diversity in the pathogenesis of critical illness [3, 9, 25, 26, 33\u201335]. We previously reported significant dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in patients with stroke and transient ischaemic attack [24] or chronic kidney disease [36]. Very recently, our research showed that participants at a high risk of stroke were characterized by the enrichment of opportunistic pathogens, low abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and reduced concentrations of faecal butyrate [37]. As a whole, these investigations could contribute to an increased awareness among clinicians that disturbances in the gut microbiota might be associated with poor prognosis. Dysbiosis of the microbiota can be reasonably presumed to increase the risk of adverse events, including infection, undernutrition and unconsciousness. Consistent with the findings of prior studies, our results confirmed that the microbiome in patients in neurocritical care differed substantially from that in healthy subjects. For example, the samples from the neuroICU group were characterized by gut microbiota dysbiosis and a loss of health-promoting commensal microbes. These differences were further characterized using LEfSe, which showed that neuroICU patients tended to have lower relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and an increased level of Proteobacteria than healthy subjects. This difference is unlikely to be a study effect, as the samples from patients were rigorously processed and run in parallel with those from healthy subjects. Moreover, we collected our samples in the same city to partially avoid geographical effects [19]. In addition, the disruption of the microbial community appeared to be greater at discharge than during the ICU hospitalization, with the decreased abundance of the butyrate-producing bacteria Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. This ICU-acquired dysbiosis likely resulted from the pressures imposed by various patient-related factors and modern intensive care therapy. The use of antibiotics [38], vasoactive agents, artificial nutrition, proton pump inhibitors, analgesics or sedative agents that impair intestinal motility [39] may affect the gut microbiota. Antibiotic treatment precluded distinguishing the effect of critical illness from the effect of antibiotic pressure. However, the current study failed to address the impact of antibiotics on microbiota since most patients enrolled in this cohort received antimicrobial treatments, which is a common clinical practice in critical care. Because of the ubiquitous use of antibiotics worldwide [40], antibiotic pressure should be considered both a medical treatment and an inevitable pathophysiological insult that could exert negative effects on beneficial organisms.",

                    "text": "Our findings that the abundances of Christensenellaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae are potential risk indicators of mortality within 180\u2009days are consistent with previous reports. Christensenellaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae have been found to be associated with metabolic disorders and gastrointestinal diseases [41\u201343]. Christensenellaceae was reported to be enriched in patients with multiple sclerosis [44]. Some studies have shown that HIV-infected individuals [45] and individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [46] and Rett syndrome [47] exhibited a high abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae. Moreover, our results showed that the abundance increase in Enterobacteriaceae is associated with death within 180\u2009days. As previously reported, Enterobacteriaceae is one of the most detrimental pathogens to humans, especially for patients in ICUs [48, 49]. Our results provide evidence potentially suggesting that high abundances of some specific pathogens or their abundance changes may contribute to poor clinical outcomes. However, due to the limited sample size, lack of confounder control and regional variations, the results from the Cox regression analysis are insufficient for worldwide generalization. Nonetheless, the relationship between the gut microbiota and poor prognosis might serve as a platform for identifying potential targets for mortality prediction in the future. Freedberg et al. [9] provided novel insights into the possibility of predicting death or subsequent infection in critically ill patients by the characteristics of the gut microbiota upon ICU admission. Both colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci and the dominance of Enterococcus species were associated with death or all-cause infection adjusted by illness severity. Some studies have suggested that critical illness can lead to translocation of gut microbes into the bloodstream [50, 51], potentially explaining the association between specific pathogens and mortality. Identifying the critically ill patients most at risk of mortality is crucial for medical treatment strategies and doctor-patient communication. An intriguing possibility is analysing stool samples by 16S rRNA gene sequence as a non-invasive method for pretreatment assessment at admission to describe the role of the faecal \u201cfingerprint\u201d in predicting poor outcomes.",

Microbiome intervention therapy includes antibiotic treatment, probiotic administration and faecal microbiota transplantation. Two case reports have discussed the successful application of faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with diarrhoea and therapy-resistant sepsis [53, 54]. However, these strategies should be implemented with personalized knowledge of the bacterial colonization patterns in the patients, as well as the selection of appropriately high-risk patients prior to implementing any intervention. Prior investigations of the ICU microbiome have generally been restricted by the limitations of culture-based approaches, which can detect only certain species of bacteria and cannot provide a complete picture immediately during acute illness. The 16S rRNA gene sequence technique has allowed clinicians to perform sequence-based investigations of microbes previously thought to be inaccessible [55]. This achievement may inspire the development of simple and effective microbiota-targeted therapies.",

This prospective observational study used 16S rRNA sequence analysis to identify members of the intestinal microbiota, exploring early samples after admission and longitudinal samples obtained weekly to provide dynamic observations. This research was the first to investigate the microbiota in neurocritically ill patients, with a correlation analysis between the abundances of taxa and clinical severity scores, as well as survival analyses based on the abundances of or changes in specific taxa and the rigorously adjudicated primary outcome of death. However, this research also has some inherent limitations that warrant further discussion. First, the window of our first sample enrolment was 72\u2009h after admission, and the underlying changes in microbial diversity may occur during the period of the first sample collection. Although rectal swabs could obtain samples immediately and have been shown to provide similar efficacies as stool [56], faecal sampling was used in this study to avoid harmful effects on the patients. Therefore, the sample collection process was restricted to patients\u2019 defecation cycle, and selection bias was present because faecal samples could be collected only from patients who defecated spontaneously. Second, the limited sample size and the substantial heterogeneity of the selected patients make the interpretation of the relationship between the microbiota composition and prognosis challenging. Third, the 16S rRNA gene sequence method used in this study could only evaluate the composition percentages but not the absolute numbers of microorganisms in the samples. An advanced technique is needed to define the gut microbiota more precisely. Finally, we could not continue to analyse faecal samples after discharge, and the recovery of the microbiome might be prolonged. We would like to evaluate post-discharge microbiota dynamics in future studies.",

The abundance and its changes were important risk factors for 180-day mortality, indicating that a gut microbiome examination could be a useful tool for identifying high-risk patients. High-quality prospective investigations with substantial samples collected on the day of admission and, ideally, with concurrent experimental models, are warranted to confirm the findings of this research and evaluate the net effect of microbiota dysbiosis on the progression and outcome of neurocritical illness.",
