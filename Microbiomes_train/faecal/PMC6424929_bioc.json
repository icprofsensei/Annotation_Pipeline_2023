                    "text": "Olives and olive oil are important and characteristic components of the Mediterranean diet, a dietary pattern shown to improve on both physical and mental quality of life, and reduce the risk of chronic diet-associated disease, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1]. Indeed, extra-virgin olive oil, as part of a Mediterranean style diet significantly reduced both the incidence of composite CVD end points and total mortality in the PREDIMED study [2]. Polyphenols, complex aromatic plant secondary metabolites, are independently linked to these health effects [1, 3]. Olives and various olive oils and extracts have been shown to mediate different health effects in humans, many associated with CVD risk. Olive extracts have been reported to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from baseline in both hypertensive and pre-hypertensive individuals [4\u20137] and to improve plasma lipid profiles in both normo-lipidaemic and hypercholesterolaemic subjects [4, 6, 8\u201310]. Olive extracts have also been found to induce acute reductions in arterial stiffness [11], which agrees with data suggesting that olive oil and olive extract significantly improve vascular function [12, 13] and blood pressure [14]. Currently, these improvements are thought to be associated with polyphenol-rich olive oil fractions rather than other bioactives which may be present [15, 16]. In contrast, other studies have failed to demonstrate significant modulation of CVD biomarkers upon olive extract ingestion. For example, olive leaf extracts did not appear to improve plasma lipids [7, 17], ambulatory blood pressure, cytokines and/or carotid intima-media thickness [17] in different studies. However, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has recognized a specific health claim for the polyphenol extract of olive for protection of LDL cholesterol particles against oxidative damage\u2014although they also noted that there is a lack of evidence for other health claims including maintenance of normal blood pressure and HDL cholesterol levels, reduced inflammation and improved gastrointestinal function [18]. EFSA considers that the claim that \u201cconsumption of olive oil polyphenols contributes to the protection of blood lipids from oxidative damage\u201d reflects the scientific evidence, and that a dose of 5\u00a0mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives (e.g. oleuropein complex and tyrosol) in olive oil should be consumed daily for food products to bear the health claim. In olive, the majority of polyphenols present belong to the tyrosol group [hydroxytyrosol (HT), tyrosol (TYR) and conjugated forms like oleuropein]. These conjugated forms are extensively hydrolyzed in the stomach [19] to HT and TRY, which are either absorbed in the small intestine and undergo extensive phase I and II biotransformation or reach the colon where they undergo biotransformation by the resident microbiota [19, 20]. The most common derivatives are small phenolic acids like homovanillic acid (HVA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acids (DHPAA), hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPAA), protocatechuic acid and benzoic acids for example. The impact of olives or their constituent parts on the composition and metabolic activity of the human intestinal microbiota is, however, poorly understood. One recent study has shown that thyme phenolic compounds at different doses in olive oil can induce a small increase in bifidobacteria using the quantitative culture-independent method fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), with the suggestion that this change in microbiota could be related to improved LDL cholesterol oxidative status [21]. Similarly, a sex effect in terms of metabolism of HT and related compounds has been observed in rats with the suggestion that differential excretion of HT derivatives between male and female animals might be due to sex-linked differences in enterohepatic circulation [22]. However, no data are reported for differences in metabolism of these compounds between men and women or indeed, whether such differences if they do exist, could be due to sex-specific differences in gut microbiota. To date, no studies have reported whether olives or olive pomace can impact on the relative abundances of the human gut microbiota, on the diversity of the gut microbiota and only a few studies have specifically addressed the metabolic end products produced by combined host\u2013microbiota co-metabolism of olive polyphenols [20, 21].",

Olive oil is extracted from the fruit of Olea europaea, leaving waste in the form of olive water and solid olive pomace. The olive pomace and wastewater produced from oil extraction processes contain macromolecules such as polysaccharides, lipids, proteins and polyphenolic compounds (mainly of the tyrosol group) which can range from 1 to 8\u00a0g/l [23] in wastewater and 2.9 to 3.7\u00a0mg/l in olive pomace [24]. The annual worldwide production of olive oil is about 2\u00a0million metric tons reported for 2015/16 (average: COI, 2017). For each ton of olive oil the waste produced is dependent on the fruit quality, ripeness and extraction technology and typically ranges from 2.75 to 4 tons of olive pomace and 1\u20138\u00a0m3 of wastewater [25\u201327]. In addition these olive mill wastes are produced in significantly large quantities during the short olive production season and because the waste cannot be disposed of through ordinary waste treatment systems, disposal of wastewater and olive pomace is a major environmental problem and cost to the industry. Given the push towards a green economy, there is a stimulus for the oil industry to move towards a circular economic model, reducing waste production or adding value to waste streams, developing added value secondary product lines. To this end, we have developed an olive pomace extract as a functional food ingredient. This olive pomace, which delivers 17.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.01\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g HT and its derivatives, is also rich in fibres and our preliminary in vitro data showed it was fermentable and leads to increased numbers of bifidobacteria in pH-controlled faecal batch cultures (data not shown). For this current study, we have incorporated this olive pomace into a biscuit formulation. For flavour, texture and constitutional reasons, other ingredients were also necessary including extra virgin olive oil and flours from chestnut, pea and buckwheat, but the olive pomace remained the dominant ingredient and the dominant source of polyphenols (>\u200990% of polyphenols present in the final biscuit). Here we report the effect of this olive pomace-enriched biscuit on the human gut microbiota, their metabolic output and on various biomarkers of CVD and inflammation. The study was conducted jointly by researchers at Fondazione Edmund Mach (San Michele all\u2019Adige, Italy), OlioCru s.r.l (Arco, Italy) and the study centre was the Casa di Cura Eremo di Arco s.r.l.

This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Ethic Committee for Clinical Trials of the Trento Azienda Provinciale Servizi Sanitari (APSS). The clinical trial was carried out at the Casa di Cura Eremo di Arco (Arco, TN, Italy) between November 2015 and June 2016. The primary outcome measure was the faecal microbiota analysis by Illumina sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) carried out with probe for Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Ruminococcus spp. The secondary outcome measures were related to cholesterol analysis in plasma [total, LDL, HDL cholesterol, oxidized LDL, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A\u2013I and B (APO A and APO B)] together with the analysis of the variation of polyphenols and their metabolites in plasma and urine. Additional measures were the analyses of the anthropometric indices, the fasting plasma insulin, glucose and C-reactive protein (CRP) and the analysis of isoprostane F2 in urine. This study was powered for changes in blood LDL cholesterol and changes in faecal bifidobacteria. Since previous studies have shown that fewer individuals are required for measuring changes in faecal bifidobacteria and because of its clinical significance, the sample size calculation was performed only for changes in LDL cholesterol levels. Based on measures from a previous parallel trial design using similar products [28], we assessed as clinical significant end point the average LDL decrease of 15.44\u00a0mg/dl with a standard deviation of 14.28\u00a0mg/dl. According to Snedecor and Cochran equation with significance value \u03b1 equal to 0.05 and a 90% power (1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03b2) [29], the minimum number of subjects to enrol was 28.

DNA was extracted from 100\u00a0mg stool aliquots using Power faecal DNA extraction kit (MOBio), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to evaluate microbiota diversity and genus-level abundances. Using the specific bacterial primer set 341F (5\u2032 CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3\u2032) and 806R (5\u2032GACTACNVGGGTWTCTAATCC 3\u2032) with overhang Illumina adapters, total genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification by targeting a\u2009~\u2009460-bp fragment of the 16S rRNA variable region V3\u2013V4. PCR amplification of each sample was carried out using 25-\u03bcl reactions with 1\u00a0\u03bcM of each primer. Specifically 12.5\u00a0\u03bcl of 2\u00d7 KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, 5\u00a0\u03bcl forward primer, 5\u00a0\u03bcl reverse primer were used in combination with 2.5\u00a0\u03bcl of template DNA (5\u00a0ng/\u03bcl).

The PCR products were checked on 1.5% agarose gel and cleaned from free primers and primer dimer using the Agencourt AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Subsequently dual indices and Illumina sequencing adapters Nextera XT Index Primer (Illumina) were attached by seven-cycle PCR (16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation, Illumina). The final libraries, after purification by the Agencourt AMPure XP system (Beckman), were analysed on a Typestation 2200 platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and quantified using the Quant-IT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by the Synergy 2 microplate reader (Biotek). Finally all the libraries were pooled in an equimolar way in a final amplicon library and analysed on a Typestation 2200 platform (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Bar-coded library were sequenced on an Illumina\u00ae MiSeq (PE300) platform (MiSeq Control Software 2.0.5 and Real-Time Analysis software 1.16.18).

The diluted sample was homogenized using a Stomacher 400 (Seward) at the speed of 230\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min or until it appeared homogeneous. Ten millilitre of the suspension was transferred into a 15-ml falcon tube containing glass beads; the tube was mixed by vortexing for about 30\u00a0s, then centrifuged at 1100\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to pellet fibrous particles. Then 375\u00a0\u03bcl of the suspension were transferred into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 1125\u00a0\u03bcl of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The suspension was fixed in 4% PFA for 4\u201324\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After fixation the tubes were centrifuged at 13,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min and the pellet were resuspended in 1\u00a0ml of filter-sterilized 1M PBS. This washing procedure was repeated twice, then the tubes were centrifuged again at 13,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min, supernatant was carefully removed and the pellet was finally resuspended in 150\u00a0\u03bcl of filter-sterilized 1M PBS. One hundred and fifty (150) microlitre of absolute ethanol was added and the samples were mixed by inversion and immediately stored at \u2212\u200920\u00a0\u00b0C. For FCM-FISH analysis, 10\u00a0\u03bcl of the fixed faecal sample was resuspended in 190\u00a0\u03bcl of PBS 1X sterile. Every step was done in 96-well plates. After resuspending, the sample was centrifuged at 4000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min. The sample was resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcl of Tris\u2013EDTA buffer and then centrifuged another time at 4000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min. For hybridisation with the probes specific for Lactobacillus/Enterococcus spp. [31], Bifidobacterium spp. [32] and Ruminococcus spp. [33] that needed lysozyme treatment to render the cell wall more permeable to the probes, we resuspended the sample in 200\u00a0\u03bcl of Tris\u2013EDTA containing 1\u00a0mg/ml of lysozyme and incubated for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. After that period, sample was washed with centrifugation and resuspended in 50\u00a0\u03bcl of hybridization buffer [0.9\u00a0M NaCl, 20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% [wt/vol] sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)] with 5\u00a0\u03bcl of 50\u00a0ng/\u03bcl fluorescently Cy5-labelled oligonucleotide probe and incubated at the appropriate hybridization temperature (Table\u00a02). Washing was repeated and the sample was resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcl of hybridization buffer without SDS and incubated at the appropriate wash temperature (Table\u00a02). After washing, sample was resuspended in SYBR Green, used to enumerate the total cells. SYBR Green binds to DNA and the resulting complex absorbs blue light (\u03bbmax\u2009=\u2009497\u00a0nm) and emits green light (\u03bbmax\u2009=\u2009520\u00a0nm). A blank sample (without the fluorescently Cy5-labelled oligonucleotide probe and without the SYBR Green) was prepared and for every sample, following the same steps as per the hybridized sample, to set the threshold of the gates of the flow cytometer that permits the revelation of the microbial species and exclude the false positives due to the potential autofluorescence of the sample. FCM was performed using Guava easyCyte\u2122 Single Sample Flow Cytometer (Millipore) with a single blue (488\u00a0nm), dual blue and red (642\u00a0nm), or triple blue, red, and violet (405\u00a0nm) excitation lasers that provided 12 simultaneous detection parameters, including 10 fluorescent colours plus forward and side scatter for size and granularity determination. The FCM parameters were adjusted to give particle counts of 1000 events in total. Data were analysed by the InCyte software, version 4.1.1. To avoid loss of the signal intensity of hybridized cells, the samples were kept in the dark until the FCM analysis. Results were expressed as the percentage of cells hybridized with the group-specific-Cy5 probe calculated on the total bacteria, counted after SYBR Green staining. Also absolute numbers were obtained.",

After methanol extraction of polyphenols, analysis was performed by an ultra-performance liquid chromatographic system (UHPLC) coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer. The system used was an ACQUITY UPLC system coupled to a Xevo TQ triple quadrupole via an electrospray (ESI) interface (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The separation was performed with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC column HSS T3 (100\u00a0mm\u2009\u00d7\u20092.1\u00a0mm, 1.8\u00a0\u03bcm) equipped with a guard column. The injection volume was 5\u00a0\u03bcl. Mobile phases of 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) were used. Chromatographic separation was performer using a gradient as follows: 0\u00a0min, 5% B; 0\u20133\u00a0min, 5\u201320% B; 3\u20134.30\u00a0min, 20% B; 4.30\u20139\u00a0min, 20\u201345% B; 9\u201311\u00a0min, 45\u2013100% B; 11\u201314\u00a0min, 100% B; and 14.01\u201317\u00a0min, 5% B as equilibration time. For calibration, a standard mixture of polyphenol metabolites was serially diluted in aqueous methanol (50:50) at a concentration range of 0.01\u201320\u00a0mg/l. Quantitative data were processed withTargetlynx software (Masslynx, Waters).",

Statistically significant differences in the relative abundance of Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Rikenellaceae, Barnesiellaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae were observed between the faecal microbiota of men and women (Fig.\u00a05).

Considering the accepted physiological relevance of olive polyphenols, their apparent ability to protect LDL cholesterol particles from oxidative damage, and the fact that the gut microbiota appears to be intimately related to their metabolism in vivo, we measured changes in key olive-derived polyphenols, including tyrosol and HT, and their derived catabolites using a quantitative LC\u2013MS-based strategy. The OEP biscuits did not have a major impact on the composition of the gut microbiota, but did induce subtle changes in relative abundances of certain bacteria. Significant differences in relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Gemellaceae and Anaerofustis were observed between treatments using community level 16S rRNA profiling. More quantitative analysis using flow cytometry-coupled fluorescent in situ hybridization did not confirm statistically significance for bifidobacteria, lactobacilli or the Ruminococcus obeum-like bacteria. However, a trend was apparent, consistent between 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the probe-based FISH and qPCR, showing a small increase in bifidobacteria.",

                    "text": "In terms of metabolic output, LC\u2013MS-based targeted metabolomics confirmed that ingestion of the OEP biscuits resulted in a significant increase in urinary excretion of small phenolic acids derived from the metabolism of olive polyphenols. These small phenolic acids derive from the combined activities of human phase I and II biotransformation and the action of the gut microbiota. OEP ingestion resulted in a significant increase in excretion of homovanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid, scopoletin, protocatechuic acid, sinapic acid, 3-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, isoferulic acid, caffeic acid, hippuric acid, 3,3-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Many of these compounds derive from the breakdown pathways of the tyrosol group enriched in olives and/or the hippuric acid pathway, a pathway common to many classes of polyphenols. Both involve steps mediated by the gut microbiota and these catabolites and similar small phenolic acids have been reported to be excreted following ingestion of olive or olive fractions in previous studies [20\u201322, 36, 37]. Few studies have reported the profile of metabolites present in fasted blood samples after chronic ingestion of olive pomace. Here we found that ingestion of the OEP biscuits for 8\u00a0weeks resulted in a significantly higher level of tyrosol metabolites, homovanillic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC). Homovanillic acid increased more then twofold in the OEP-treated group and was also about double the concentration after the CTRL treatment. For DOPAC, OEP induced more than tenfold increase in fasted blood concentrations, and a similar difference in magnitude was observed compared to the control group. As well as being associated with the protection of LDL cholesterol particles from oxidative damage, both homovanillic acid and DOPAC have been reported to transiently associate with LDL cholesterol particles in blood thereby mediating their antioxidative effect. While most studies report these molecules to be relatively rapidly cleared from the blood [38], our study is one of the very few to record high levels of these antioxidants in fasted blood samples, many hours after ingestion of the olive-enriched food. This is an important observation for the possible functional activities of the OEP biscuit since persistence of these tyrosol-derived metabolites in blood, or indeed within the intestine, could prime antioxidant defences and/or absorption of oxidized LDL cholesterol upon fat meal challenge. However, our current study was not designed to measure the effect of olive polyphenols on oxidized LDL cholesterol levels and therefore, any potential beneficial effect of the OEP biscuit awaits confirmation in an acute, postprandial study. Similarly, homovanillic acid and DOPAC are both involved in the dopamine pathway and have been shown to mediate other physiological effects including ameliorating age-related decline in muscle function [39] and brain function [40]. In addition, DOPAC has been shown to impact on the inflammatory response of immune cells to lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin, an inflammatory microbially derived signal associated with increased risk of metabolic disease [41]. However, any ability of the OEP biscuits to mediate such health effects awaits specifically and appropriately designed human studies.",

Previous studies with whole plant foods or oat-derived beta-glucan in particular, have shown significant and clinically meaningful reductions in cholesterol upon ingestion [42]. However, the mechanisms by which these foods mediate their cholesterol lowering effects are still very much unclear, with different mechanisms suggesting involving phytosterols, gel-forming and cholesterol binding activities, modified bile acid profiles and/or prebiotic type modulation of the gut microbiota [43, 44]. Our OEP, not containing the pit pulp of the olive, did not contain large amounts of plant phytosterols, and only had minor impact on microbiota composition. Although in this case, the olive pomace did not change blood lipid profiles, further studies, possibly with larger sample size be warranted, especially since the ability of olive and olive extracts in general to modulate blood lipid profiles remains to be convincingly established as per the EFSA statement on olive polyphenol extract health claims [18].",

                    "text": "The quantities of small phenolic acids in urine differed between men and women upon OEP ingestion. Men excreted significantly more 3,5-diOH-benzoic acid, t-coutaric acid, naringenin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid than women. A sex bias in polyphenol metabolism has been reported previously. Zamora-Ros et al. [45] analysing the EPIC cohort study reported a significant sex bias in excretion of dietary polyphenols. Moreover, the sex differences in dietary polyphenol metabolism also appears to be reflected in the concentration and profiles of polyphenols or their derivatives in different tissues and organs, as shown for grape seed flavanols in rats [46]. Such sex effects could have important implications for the biological activity of these compounds, especially since a sex effect has also been reported in response to dietary interventions measuring physiological change and/or reduced risk of chronic disease upon intervention with polyphenol-rich foods [47]. The contribution of the intestinal microbiota to any sex-specific \u201cmetabotype\u201d in terms of polyphenol metabolism remains very much unexplored. In our study, faecal samples collected from men and women post-OEP ingestion differed significantly in the relative abundance of Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Rikenellaceae, Barnesiellaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. Some of these bacteria are linked to host physiology and protection from metabolic and cardiovascular disease (Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium in particular), but also Bacteroides and Prevotella in relation to obesity and traditional dietary paradigms [48\u201350]. Similarly, the enterobacteria, which includes many intestinal pathogens, appear particularly susceptible to the antibacterial activities of polyphenols [51]. The role of the human gut microbiota in determining the profile and quantities of different polyphenol breakdown products, their bioavailability, bioactivity and nutri-kinetics may constitute and important new compounding factor to be taken into consideration when designing human dietary interventions where polyphenols are considered mediators of physiological effect. Further data from similar human studies are required to confirm the involvement of the gut microbiota in gender-specific polyphenol metabolism and possible implications sex-specific response to diet.",

Delivering 17.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.01\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g HT and its derivatives, the OEP biscuits induced a significant increase in excretion of small phenolic acids in urine, indicative of up-regulation of microbial polyphenol biotransformation in the intestine. Quantities of some small phenolic acids differed in urine of men and women, as did relative abundances of important members of the gut microbiota. OEP also led to a significant increase in homovanillic acid and DOPAC in fasted plasma samples, indicating related clearance of these compounds from the blood or extended release and uptake from the intestine. In either case, higher levels of these biologically active compounds mediated by OEP ingestion warrant further investigation in acute or post-prandial studies specifically targeting LDL cholesterol oxidation and cognitive function.",
