The use of antianaerobe antibiotics (piperacillin\u2013tazobactam and imipenem\u2013cilastatin) was associated with higher rates of GVHD and overgrowth of Akkermansia species in a murine model of HCT [8].

When 1 measurement was used per individual (ie, the sample closest to neutrophil recovery), logistic regression was used. For the correlation between organisms and severe (grade 3\u20134) acute GVHD: similar to analysis of the composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) [25], for each observed organism identified to the genus or species level and each genus identified, a log ratio of the species count plus 1 over the genus count plus 1 was calculated. Logistic regression was performed, with these ratios as the independent variable and severe acute GVHD as the dependent variable. The estimated coefficient (\u03b2) was normalized to its standard error of the mean to generate the Wald statistic. The distribution of the Wald statistic for each species was considered, with the Student T distribution used to determine a P value, which underwent the Bonferroni correction.",

We did not see a consistent trend in the rate of change over time (Supplementary Figure S1) with grade of GVHD. For recipients for whom we had paired stool microbiota samples from their donors, we saw a trend toward higher donor-to-recipient microbiota distance (an indicator of dissimilarity of the bacterial communities) as grade of acute GVHD increased, through grade 3 (Supplementary Figure S2); the one grade 4 patient for whom we had a donor pair was an outlier for this trend.

We used the following 2 measures of diversity: balanced weighted phylogenetic diversity (BWPD) [26], which is a measure that accounts for the phylogenetic relationships between organisms in the community when calculating diversity, and Inverse Shannon [27] (InvSh), which is a commonly used measure of species diversity. When using all samples for a given patient, or just the sample closest to neutrophil recovery, there was a trend to lower alpha diversity (InvSh or BWPD) at higher grades of acute GVHD. By GEE regression with an independence correlation structure, both BWPD and InvSh alpha diversity were statistically significantly lower in patients with grade 3 or 4 GVHD when compared to those with no acute GVHD or grade 1\u20132 acute GVHD (P < 0.05). Figure 2B shows the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for BWPD (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.56) and InvSh diversity (AUC of 0.63) at neutrophil recovery as a predictor for eventual development of severe acute GVHD (grade 3\u20134).",

We then selected the organisms that were consistently significantly positively or negatively correlated with subsequent severe acute GVHD (Table 2). Members of the Bacteroides genus (B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, and B. caccae) were negatively correlated with subsequent acute severe GVHD, while others (B. dorei) were positively correlated. Among the gram-positive bacteria, oral bacteria such as Rothia mucilaginosa, Solobacterium moorei, and Veillonella parvula were positively correlated; several Lachnospiraceae (including B. luti) and a Butyricicoccus species were negatively correlated.",

Figure 3B shows the gradient for the microbial communities closest to neutrophil recovery; the trend is clearer toward a higher gradient being associated with higher grade of acute GVHD. Figure 3C is the ROC for this gradient as a test for development of severe acute GVHD (grade 3 or 4); the AUC of the ROC for this test is 0.83 (significantly better than the null hypothesis value of 0.5, P < 0.05 by permutation over 1000 iterations).

We noted a trend toward greater phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient stool microbiota with higher grades of acute GVHD. We found a trend toward lower alpha diversity in patients with severe acute GVHD. We described several distinct bacterial species positively or negatively correlated with the subsequent development of severe acute GVHD when present around neutrophil recovery and used these organisms in a metric to predict subsequent severe acute GVHD. Our results are broadly comparable with the prior published work [6, 7] but point to specific species rather than alpha diversity as a more predictive microbiome factor for eventual development of severe acute GVHD.",

Typically oral Actinobacteria and oral Firmicutes in the gut were positively correlated with subsequent development of severe GVHD in our study (a novel association with GVHD, not previously published). Others have implicated the same family of organism with gut inflammation in colorectal carcinoma [28, 29] and to gut damage [30] in a model system of HCT. Several studies have shown a correlation between antibiotic exposure and risk for death from severe GVHD [31\u201333], particularly antibiotics with an anaerobic spectrum [8].

Certain clades of organisms (including the Clostridiales and Enterobacteraceae) can be difficult to resolve via 16S rRNA gene amplicon-based profiling [22]. Samples were at room temperature without preservative for up to 72 hours prior to being stored at \u221280oC. This makes the study conditions easier to reproduce in the clinical setting but could have resulted in shifts in the composition of the microbiota samples due to blooms or loss of organisms in that time window [46]. In future studies, we would like to explore the effect of enteral vs parenteral nutrition, antacid use, and other factors that may correlate with the shift to oral organisms we observed in severe GVHD. As with other published studies, this was a single-center study, and therefore our findings may not be generalized to all centers. We provide a novel metric to assess risk of GVHD so that other centers can validate or refute this approach to risk assessment.",
