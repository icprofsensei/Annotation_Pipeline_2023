Bacterial DNA from individual fecal samples was subjected to sequencing of 16S rRNA-based inventories using the 454 GS-FLX platform. Fecal samples from control infants demonstrated a temporal pattern in their microbiota, which converged toward that of a healthy full term breast-fed infant. Microbiota development in NEC patients diverged from controls beginning three weeks prior to diagnosis. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to identify functional differences in the respective microbiota of fecal samples from a set of twins in which one twin developed NEC and one did not. The majority of the differentially abundant genes in the NEC patient were associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mapped to members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. This may indicate an adaptation of the community to an altered profile of substrate availability for specific members as a first step towards the development of NEC. We propose that the microbial communities as a whole may metabolize milk differently, resulting in differential substrate availability for specific microbial groups. Additional differentially represented gene sets of interest were related to antibiotic resistance and vitamin biosynthesis.",

NEC is a devastating inflammatory bowel necrosis that primarily afflicts premature infants after the initiation of enteral feeding. The primary risk factors appear to be prematurity and bacterial colonization [1]. There is a high mortality rate of 20 to 30% and up to 50% in infants who require surgery [2]. Morbidity includes risk of intestinal stricture, short-gut, intestinal failure, and poor neurodevelopmental outcome [3-5].

We have previously published 16S rRNA-based sequence inventories of the intestinal microbiota of preterm infants with and without NEC, from fecal samples at time of NEC diagnosis [6]. Clustering based on microbial community composition exhibits distinct separation between NEC patients and corresponding controls. Intestinal bacterial colonization in all preterm infants was notable for low diversity, but samples from patients at the time of NEC diagnosis had even less diversity, marked by an increase in the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and a decrease in other bacterial species. While this study was the first to demonstrate a clear bacterial pattern associated with NEC, it was limited by its focus on the time of NEC diagnosis and bacterial taxonomy solely inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequences. The present study was designed to examine the development of the intestinal microbial community over time in NEC and control patients. We hypothesized that NEC is not an acute bacterial insult, but rather, infants that eventually develop NEC acquire an altered intestinal microbiota which influences intestinal homeostasis weeks prior to the onset of clinical symptoms.",

In order to more closely investigate functional consequences of the altered microbial communities observed prior to the onset of NEC, shotgun metagenomic sequencing was conducted on samples collected between the time of the first bacterial community shift (highlighted by the arrow between two to three weeks of life as described in Figure\u00a02) up to NEC diagnosis (Figure\u00a01). 454-based pyrosequencing was initially applied to fecal samples from a small cohort of patients to generate shotgun metagenomes. Sequence data were annotated using the MG-RAST (MetaGenome Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology) analysis platform (http://metagenomics.anl.gov; Meyer et al., 2008). Samples collected one week prior to NEC diagnosis were indistinguishable from those collected on the day of NEC diagnosis (data not shown). Guided by the 16S rRNA-based inventories (Figures\u00a02 and \u200band3),3), and to see if the development of a distinct NEC functional profile could be observed before diagnosis, subsequent shotgun sequencing focused on earlier time points (three weeks prior to NEC diagnosis).",

The second time points diverged from the initial set; however, while the second time point from the healthy twin remained unchanged on the same first principal axis, the pre-NEC sample from the twin ultimately diagnosed with NEC diverged significantly along this same axis, indicating a distinct metagenomic profile from the other three samples (arrows Figure\u00a04). In all four datasets, members of the Enterobacteriaceae were the dominant family (Proteobacteria phylum), however for the pre-NEC dataset there was a noticeable increase in the dominance of this family. This was accompanied by a marked decrease of members of the Firmicutes, specifically the lactate-fermenting genus Veillonella, a member of the Veillonellaceae family. Additionally, presumed sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs; members of the Firmicutes family Peptococcaceae including Desulfitobacterium and Desulfotomaculum) were detected at low levels (0.26% for the healthy twin at the first time point, and 0.27% at the second; 0.28% for the NEC twin at the first time point but 0.058% at the pre-NEC time point).",

                    "text": "In contrast, comparison of NEC and control patients demonstrates a distinct trajectory of community development in patients that develop NEC. The ultimate trajectory of microbiota in these infants does not overlap with that of control infants, suggesting that at crucial times a healthy trajectory can be misdirected towards deviant states (for example, NEC). The deviation from control appears to occur two to three weeks prior to NEC. Previous work by others [14] had noted a similar deviation from healthy infants but only at one week prior to the onset of NEC. Earlier detection, as demonstrated here, would provide an extended timeframe for intervention, but is also indicative of a more prolonged microbial community deviation prior to pathology emergence. Additionally, the earlier detection of this trajectory also led us to sequence metagenomes from earlier time points (three weeks prior to NEC diagnosis) and allowed the identification of functional gene sets that may contribute to the onset of NEC. The initial time point from the set of twins we sampled coincided with the two to three week transition period that we identified in the original control cohort (Figure\u00a02). Although the 16S-based data indicate a shift between controls and those that go on to develop NEC, the first time point comparison between twins, based on ordination of the functional genes detected in the metagenomes does not reflect a major difference. This may be explained by organisms that differ at taxonomic resolutions finer than those reported here, occupying a similar ecological niche between patients at this first time point. In other words, there is a functional redundancy between the community memberships wherein different organisms can perform the same community function. Our present efforts are a coarse level description of functional differences between samples that will provide a candidate set of functions to investigate at a finer scale resolution in subsequent work.",

Siroheme plays a major role in the sulfur assimilation pathway: converting sulfite to a biologically useful sulfide. The etiology of ulcerative colitis is uncertain but may relate to environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) have been implicated through the harmful effects of hydrogen sulfide, a by-product of their respiration, as it is freely permeable to cell membranes and inhibits butyrate oxidation by the host. However, inspection of the taxonomic assignments of the annotated genes (via phylogenomic inference) across all four samples revealed a lower relative abundance of known SRBs when compared to the other three samples, indicating that a sulfide-mediated phenomenon may not be a key requirement for the onset of NEC.",

Those detected in the Group B set (over-represented in the pre-NEC sample) are part of the mdtABCD multidrug resistance gene cluster (encoding for the multidrug transporter MdtC), which confer resistance to deoxycholate and novobiocin. In the Group D set, which contains those genes that are under-represented in the pre-NEC sample, the resistance genes detected are related to the BlaR1 protein family (specifically peptidase M48, Ste24p precursor). This group of genes encodes a family of membrane-spanning proteins with a penicillin sensor and a signal transducer domain that provides the starting point for this resistance mechanism. While utilization of neither antibiotic is noted in the clinical records for the patient, deoxycholate is a bile salt and may be indicative of a community response to changes in the intestinal contents.",

Our data suggest that the colonization pattern of the healthy full term breast-fed infant may represent this optimal colonization for the preterm infant as well. While several studies have evaluated the progression of colonization patterns in healthy full term infants, and have demonstrated that there is high variability between colonization patterns of individual infants at early ages, some patterns have emerged [19]. Previous sequencing based studies have demonstrated that immediately after vaginal delivery, infants have colonization patterns reflective of the maternal vaginal compartment including Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia species [20]. Culture-based studies have then shown that these infants have earlier colonization with Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Breast-feeding is associated with colonization by Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus[21-25]. Several clinical studies have shown a beneficial effect of probiotics on the incidence of NEC [26-28]. In these studies, probiotic administration was begun early with primarily Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus species that may have altered the overall community toward the healthy breast-fed infant community profile.",

It is possible that early patterns induce key developmental pathways critical for protection of the preterm infant. Studies have shown that bacteria can influence maturation in many ways - prevention of apoptosis, improvement of intestinal barrier function, establishment of intestinal mucus, maturation of glycoconjugate patterns, improvement in immune response, and maturation of intestinal vasculature patterns. All of these may be important for health and protection against NEC. Further testing beyond the scope of this study is necessary to confirm the mechanistic implications of the microbiota differences found for NEC pathogenesis. The host response to these microbiota differences, also warrants further study. However, since bacterial patterns differ between control and NEC patients, our data suggests that bacterial therapy may be an option for NEC prevention. Our studies suggest that a shift toward the microbial patterns seen in control infants may be protective. Additionally, our data suggest that identifying a shift in microbial community three weeks prior to NEC could be used to predict patients at risk for NEC. As such, our data emphasizes the importance of the temporal nature of the microbial community development in preterm infants. Identifying the critical time point, key microbial components, and functions will be necessary for effective bacterial therapeutics to prevent NEC. In the neonatal population, microbial patterns are not yet established; thus, in this patient group one has the unique opportunity to initiate and influence colonization. Our data demonstrate a difference in microbial community structure by both taxonomy and function several weeks prior to NEC. This suggests a window of opportunity in which interventions to alter community structure could influence clinical outcome.",
