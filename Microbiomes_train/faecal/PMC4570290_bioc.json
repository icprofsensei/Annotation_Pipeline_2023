Distance-based analysis is a popular strategy for evaluating the overall association between microbiome diversity and outcome, wherein the phylogenetic distance between individuals\u2019 microbiome profiles is computed and tested for association via permutation. Despite their practical popularity, distance-based approaches suffer from important challenges, especially in selecting the best distance and extending the methods to alternative outcomes, such as survival outcomes. We propose the microbiome regression-based kernel association test (MiRKAT), which directly regresses the outcome on the microbiome profiles via the semi-parametric kernel machine regression framework. MiRKAT allows for easy covariate adjustment and extension to alternative outcomes while non-parametrically modeling the microbiome through a kernel that incorporates phylogenetic distance. It uses a variance-component score statistic to test for the association with analytical p value calculation. The model also allows simultaneous examination of multiple distances, alleviating the problem of choosing the best distance. Our simulations demonstrated that MiRKAT provides correctly controlled type I error and adequate power in detecting overall association. \u201cOptimal\u201d MiRKAT, which considers multiple candidate distances, is robust in that it suffers from little power loss in comparison to when the best distance is used and can achieve tremendous power gain in comparison to when a poor distance is chosen. Finally, we applied MiRKAT to real microbiome datasets to show that microbial communities are associated with smoking and with fecal protease levels after confounders are controlled for.",

Via standard methods, the 16S sequence tags are clustered on the basis of their sequence similarity to form operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which can essentially be considered surrogates for biological taxa. Distance metrics are then constructed to measure the phylogenetic or taxonomic dissimilarity between each pair of samples by incorporating the phylogenetic relationship or the absolute and relative abundance of different taxa. Then, for assessing the association between the microbiome diversity and an outcome variable of interest, the pairwise distance between each pair of samples is compared to the distribution of the outcome variable.

The original, unweighted UniFrac distance between any pair of microbial communities is calculated as the proportion of the total branch length within the tree, which leads to un-shared taxa (i.e., taxa in one community but not the other). Thus, the UniFrac distance primarily considers only the species presence and absence information and is most efficient in detecting abundance change in rare lineages given that more prevalent species are likely to be present in all individuals. Weighted UniFrac distance uses species abundance information to weight the UniFrac distance and thus has more power to detect changes in common lineages. The generalized UniFrac distance14 was introduced as a compromise between weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances; it down-weights its emphasis on either abundant or rare lineages and therefore has more power to detect changes in OTU clusters with modest abundance. Generalized UniFrac distance involves an additional parameter (\u03b1), such that the generalized UniFrac distance with \u03b1 = 1 is equivalent to the weighted UniFrac distance. A range of other distances that do not incorporate phylogeny are also available. For example, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, which is also commonly used, quantifies the taxonomic dissimilarity between two different sites on the basis of counts at each site. Similarly, Euclidean distance can also be used and is frequently thought to be similar to weighted UniFrac distance because abundance information from common taxa tends to dominate.",

Although there are similarities, they are designed to capture distance differently, leading to differential performance across different scenarios. This creates problems in which choosing a particular metric to use as the best metric for any particular dataset depends on the unknown true state of nature. A non-optimal distance metric will reduce power to discover true associations. Using multiple metrics and cherry picking the best result will result in inflated type I rates and lead to large numbers of spurious results. Beyond difficulties in choosing a particular distance metric, the need for permutation can be computationally expensive. Furthermore, the analysis framework is not easily interpretable and does not allow for easy covariate adjustment.

Furthermore, microbiome studies usually have more modest sample sizes, yet the kernels built on standard distance metrics are frequently of full rank and have poor eigenvalue behavior. Consequently, in contrast to previous analytic17\u201319 and perturbation-based20 p-value-calculation approaches, which do not control type I error well, our method uses alternative small-sample corrections21 (unpublished data) and permutation methods.

In numerical simulations, the correlation between p values obtained from single-kernel MiRKAT and the corresponding distance-based method is usually more than 0.99 in scenarios without covariates to be adjusted for. For example, Figure\u00a0S5 shows the p values for MiRKAT and the distance-based approach for 2,000 simulated datasets when a single distance or kernel was used.

It was demonstrated that FPs from IBS-affected individuals have a profound impact on intestinal physiology, including visceral sensitivity and colonic permeability in mice.35 Although there is evidence that elevated FP levels can alter intestinal physiology by activating proteinase-activated receptors, it remains unclear whether the FP levels are of human or microbial origin. Consequently, Carroll et\u00a0al.36 conducted a study to examine the relationship between FP levels and microbiota in human fecal samples from 30 individuals affected by IBS and 24 healthy adults. 454 pyrosequencing of the gene 16S rRNA was again used for profiling the microbiomes, and QIIME was again applied to quantify the composition and diversity of each community.",

The unweighted UniFrac kernel is primarily based on the presence or absence of an OTU, whereas the weighted UniFrac kernel further incorporates abundance, which could account for the differences, but the difference in association results makes it difficult to draw a single conclusion. The optimal MiRKAT, which simultaneously considers the three candidate kernels, gave a single p value of 0.0116 after covariate adjustment.

In the most extreme cases, optimal MiRKAT from multiple perfectly correlated kernels will generate the same p value as will each of the individual kernel tests.

In practice, the optimal \u201cweight\u201d is unknown and needs to be estimated from data or selected via other approaches, such as a grid search. From the mixed-model point of view, estimating the weights is equivalent to estimating a variance component that disappears when the null hypothesis is true; this violates the common regularity conditions in the standard asymptotic tests. Statistical methods for such problems, such as likelihood-ratio tests, recently have been the focus of considerable statistical research.37,38 However, this is frequently much more computationally intensive than the score test, especially when many kernels are under consideration. Furthermore, very limited work has been conducted on the likelihood-ratio test for variance components when some parameters disappear under the null and when the null values are on the boundary of the parameter space. On the other hand, selecting the best \u201cweight\u201d through a grid search can be conducted similarly to the optimal MiRKAT, in which each of the weighted combination of candidate kernels is treated as a new kernel. However, when the number of kernels under consideration increases or when a finer grid is used, the computation burden increases quickly as a result of the large search space and rapidly becomes computationally prohibitive. Therefore, if prior evidence is available to suggest that a single kernel is the best kernel, then using that single kernel or using a smaller set of kernels will be more powerful. In the absence of prior knowledge, then we suggest using a modest range of kernels with differing characteristics, e.g., a combination of phylogeny-based and non-phylogeny-based kernels, as in our simulations.",

This approach for analyzing microbiome data is frequently complementary and parallel to methods for testing overall composition and diversity. One common approach for doing this is to assess the marginal association between each OTU and the outcome. However, in addition to difficulties in determining the scale of the analysis, i.e., whether to use composition percentages or raw OTU counts, a problem of considerable interest lies in using distance metrics to inform the identification of individual taxa related to the outcome. To this end, as a regression-based approach combined with relatively fast computation, MiRKAT could enable a stepwise variable selection approach with the Akaike information criterion or the Bayesian information criterion. Such an approach could be applied post hoc to identify the variables most strongly driving apparent associations. It might also be possible to use a penalized regression approach within the kernel framework,39 but this remains a topic for future research.",
