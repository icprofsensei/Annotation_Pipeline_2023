In this study, we analysed the faecal microbiota of patients with PSC including patients from a German and a Norwegian cohort based on 16S rRNA gene\u2010amplicon sequencing profiles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest microbiota study focusing on PSC so far. The previously analysed cohorts13, 16 were reprocessed using a unified sequencing\u2010library preparation and data analysis workflow to reduce technical and statistical disparities. Controlling for cohort\u2010specific effects and potentially false positive results, the joint analysis of these two cohorts facilitated the identification of extensive disease\u2010associated changes in the faecal microbiota structure in PSC independent from geographical region. We identified several microbial signals previously not described in association with PSC, including an increased abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria, likely driven by the class Gammaproteobacteria, increased abundance of the genus Parabacteroides, and increase of one OTU belonging to the genus Bacteroides. Gammaproteobacteria comprise gram\u2010negative bacteria with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) containing membranes, such as Enterobacteriaceae.25 Multiple lines of evidence point to LPS as a common co\u2010factor of liver injury.26 Individual variation in Gammaproteobacteria has been directly linked with susceptibility to fatty liver disease.27 The increase in Parabacteroides is intriguing, as it has been demonstrated that this bile\u2010tolerant taxon is linked to changes in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.28, 29\n",

Additionally, we confirmed a markedly reduced abundance of one OTU belonging to the genus Coprococcus in patients with PSC. This taxon has previously been found to be decreased in patients with UC,31 which is consistent with our own findings (Supporting information). This supports the notion of Coprococcus as an indicator of general gut integrity. Other previously described associations of bacterial taxa with PSC could not be confirmed, such as the recently described association with the genus Klebsiella.32\n",
