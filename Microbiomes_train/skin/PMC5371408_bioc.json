Effectively measuring the composition of the hand microbiome is important to hand hygiene science, which has implications for human health. Hand hygiene products are evaluated using standard culture-based methods, but standard test methods for culture-independent microbiome characterization are lacking. We sampled the hands of 50 participants using swab-based and glove-based methods prior to and following four hand hygiene treatments (using a nonantimicrobial hand wash, alcohol-based hand sanitizer [ABHS], a 70% ethanol solution, or tap water). We compared results among culture plate counts, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted directly from hands, and sequencing of DNA extracted from culture plates. Glove-based sampling yielded higher numbers of unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) but had less diversity in bacterial community composition than swab-based sampling. We detected treatment-induced changes in diversity only by using swab-based samples (P < 0.001); we were unable to detect changes with glove-based samples. Bacterial cell counts significantly decreased with use of the ABHS (P < 0.05) and ethanol control (P < 0.05). Skin hydration at baseline correlated with bacterial abundances, bacterial community composition, pH, and redness across subjects. The importance of the method choice was substantial. These findings are important to ensure improvement of hand hygiene industry methods and for future hand microbiome studies. On the basis of our results and previously published studies, we propose recommendations for best practices in hand microbiome research.",

The primary advantage of culture-independent methods is their ability to readily identify a large proportion of the bacterial diversity that can be difficult to observe with culture-based studies. The currently used culture-based methods, although limited in breadth with respect to the types of organisms detected, have the advantage of quantifying absolute cell abundances of the culturable living microbes. The increase in use of culture-independent methods, namely those based on DNA sequencing, has been driven by advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatic analysis tools and a reduction in the cost of conducting such studies (6, 7). In particular, the use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods has become routine in microbiology studies. For these reasons, culture-independent methods are expected to continue to be used more frequently in many fields, including hand hygiene effect research and product development. Since these methods are relatively new in comparison with culture-based microbiology assessments, they are still evolving and not yet standardized (6,\u20138).",

In the hand hygiene industry, efficacy assessments of hand hygiene products (e.g., antiseptic hand wash, antiseptic hand rub [sanitizer], and surgical hand preparation) have well-established standard protocols developed by ASTM International and the Committee for European Norms. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (14) requires the use of these ASTM standards. The ASTM in vivo methodologies rely solely on measurement by culture-based techniques and fall into two categories. The techniques in one category are designed to evaluate effectiveness of hand hygiene products to remove transient pathogens from hands (e.g., ASTM E1174 [15], ASTM E2755 [16], and ASTM E2946 [17]). The subjects\u2019 hands are experimentally contaminated with the test organism (a surrogate marker of a pathogen) before the test formulation is applied. In the techniques in the second category, which applies to surgical scrubs (e.g., ASTM E1115 [18]), the objective is to evaluate the hand hygiene product for its ability to reduce resident bacteria on hands. In both categories, hands are sampled using the \u201cglove-based\u201d methodology by vigorous massage in loose-fitting gloves with an eluent for 1\u00a0min, after which the eluents are assayed for bacteria using culture-based methods (10).",

For example, hands are washed with a nonantimicrobial soap prior to testing to remove excess transient bacteria in the ASTM standard hygiene methods, but this practice is uncommon in skin microbiome studies. Standardized hand hygiene methods prohibit participants from exposing their hands to any antimicrobials for days prior to sampling to reduce the confounding effects from other products, whereas this practice is uncommon in skin microbiome studies. To date, most skin microbiome studies have been ecological surveys, not controlled laboratory studies, designed to assess the effects of a specific perturbation, such as hand hygiene. Another fundamental difference in study design is sample timing. With swabs, it is feasible to sample skin immediately before and immediately after an intentional perturbation because swab-based sampling is not expected to drastically change the skin microbiota or physiological condition. However, glove-based hand sampling presumably changes the bacterial population and skin condition due to the vigorous nature of this approach. Thus, when glove-based sampling is used to sample resident bacteria on hands, such as in the ASTM E1115 surgical scrub method, the \u201cbaseline hygiene\u201d hand sampling must be done days prior to the \u201cimmediately after\u201d sampling to allow for the resident bacteria and skin to return to baseline conditions before the hand can be resampled. Therefore, there are a number of important variables to consider when designing a hand sampling study.",

Such factors include subject inclusion and exclusion criteria, how skin is sampled, genetic material extraction approach, storage solutions and conditions, sequencing platform, regions sequenced, and bioinformatics data processing and analysis, among others (7, 19, 20). A study performed by Rosenthal et al. (21) was the first microbiome study to use the glove-based hand sampling method and to result in the observation that glove-based samples yielded data that were more similar at different time points for the same individuals than the data from swab-based samples, which had greater variation. In another skin sampling method comparison study, samples taken by scrape, swab, and biopsy produced similar results (22). Sequencing methodologies based on amplification of the V1-V3 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene also have been shown to report community composition results that are different from the results from other regions (20).",

More robust studies must characterize differences between current standardized hand hygiene protocols and the emerging culture-independent skin microbiota characterization method options. Our report compares results obtained from standard culture-based methods with those obtained from culture-independent skin microbiome characterization methods for assessment of the impact of hygiene products on the hand microbiome. In addition, we assessed the relationships among hand microbiota and physiological skin characteristics. Specifically, we characterized the hands of 50 individuals before treatment and immediately, 24\u00a0h, and 7\u00a0days after treatment with a hygiene intervention. We sampled hands using both swab-based and glove-based methods and characterized bacteria using culture plating (aerobic and anaerobic), culture-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and sequencing of the organisms grown on the culture plates. We provide a framework outlining many of the methodological decisions to be considered in the design, execution, and data analyses of a hand microbiome study.",

The relative differences in numbers of unique OTUs between hand samples taken from different hands of the same subject or different sides of the same hand of a subject were not statistically significant (ANOVA; P = 0.60 [hand side], P = 0.86 [for dominance]). We also observed differences in bacterial community composition across subjects, as within-subject variation was significantly lower than variation between individuals (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA], P = 0.001; r2 = 0.50). We observed no effect of hand dominance (PERMANOVA; P = 0.36).

As expected, sequencing of plate washes of the cultures grown from either aerobically or anaerobically grown bacteria showed significantly lower numbers of unique OTUs and diversity in bacterial community composition, indicating that plating underestimates the diversity of the hand skin bacterial community. Glove-based samples had the greatest richness, resulting in recovery of, on average, 97.6 unique OTUs per hand per 1,000 sequences. Culture plate washes had the lowest richness, with approximately 14.6 OTUs per hand per 1,000 sequences, whereas the richness for swab-based samples averaged 48.3 OTUs per hand per 1,000 sequences. Swab-based samples, however, had a greater range in bacterial composition among participants than glove-based samples. Staphylococcus was the most abundant genus, comprising 93% of the recovered sequences from plate washing and 53% of the recovered sequences from glove-based samples, on average (Fig.\u00a01E). Other genera most commonly observed were Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter. Swab-based samples contained the highest proportion of rare OTUs, with 21.7% of sequences represented by OTUs that were each present at <0.5% relative abundance, compared with 11.3% rare OTUs in glove-based samples and <1% in plate washes. OTUs unclassified at the genus level comprised 9.9% of the swab-based samples, whereas they comprised 5.9% of the glove-based samples.",

The nonantimicrobial hand wash and water rinse controls did not significantly impact viable aerobic or anaerobic bacterial counts at any time point. In contrast, the alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) and ethanol control performed similarly; both significantly reduced the levels of viable aerobic bacteria immediately after product use (by 0.84 log10 CFU reductions and 0.81 log10 CFU reductions from baseline, respectively) (ANOVA; P < 0.05). Between 5.10 log10 CFU and 5.36 log10 CFU viable resident aerobic bacteria remained on hands immediately after use of the ABHS and ethanol. Similarly, the ABHS and ethanol control significantly reduced (ANOVA; P < 0.05) the levels of viable anaerobic bacteria immediately after product use by 0.90 log10 CFU reductions and 0.95 log10 CFU reductions from baseline, respectively. The reductions were temporary for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as the levels of culturable bacteria were not significantly different between baseline and samples taken 24\u00a0h or 7\u00a0days post-hygiene treatment.",

Within-subject numbers of unique OTUs and bacterial community compositions observed from swab-based samples, glove-based samples, and anaerobic and aerobic culture plating of glove-based sample changes between samples collected at baseline, as well as samples collected immediately, 24\u00a0h, and 7\u00a0days after use of an ABHS, nonantimicrobial hand wash, ethanol control, and water control, are illustrated in Fig.\u00a02C and \u200bandD.D. In this analysis, there were two different \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d hygiene treatment comparisons made. The first comparison was modeled after the standard hand hygiene method in which the \u201cbaseline\u201d measures were taken days prior to the hygiene treatment. This first analysis of data for the baseline versus after treatment was performed for all four sample types collected: swab-based samples, glove-based samples, anaerobic plate culture washes, and aerobic plate culture washes. In the second comparison, the \u201cbefore\u201d measures were taken immediately before, and on the same day as, the hygiene treatment. Since only the swab-based samples could be taken immediately before the hygiene treatment, the second analysis was performed only for swab-based samples. No significant changes were observed in bacterial community composition as a result of hygiene use for any of the sample types in comparisons of baseline samples (PERMANOVA; P > 0.05). Interestingly, there was a systematic trend of an increase in numbers of unique OTUs across most time points in swab-based samples but not in glove-based samples or culture plate washes. The richness measured at baseline for swab-based samples was generally lower than the richness in all swab-based samples taken at all of the \u201cafter\u201d time points. The other sample types (glove-based samples and plate washes) did not show the same increase in richness as the swab-based samples post-hygiene treatment.",

Furthermore, the bacterial community compositions recovered in glove-based samples were more similar among participants, whereas swab-based samples demonstrated greater variability in bacterial community compositions among participants (as shown in Fig.\u00a01D). Glove-based sampling results at baseline had higher richness than swab-based results, which indicates there were greater numbers of unique OTUs. We hypothesize that this pattern is the result of glove-based sampling recovering greater total biomass and bacterial communities, as the total surface area of the hand that is sampled by glove-based sampling is larger than the area involved when swabs are used. Glove-based sampling represents more of the entire hand, including the interdigital spaces and fingernails, than swab-based sampling does. The variations in bacterial community compositions observed among the 50 participants were much greater for the swab-based samples than for the glove-based samples, perhaps indicating that the glove-based method recovers resident populations that are more similar between people than previously thought on the basis of results of swab-only sampling studies (23, 24). A potential criticism is that the swabbing was done on the hands prior to glove-based sampling, which may have influenced the study results. However, all hands were prewashed to remove transient bacterial populations prior to sampling, which would reduce the impact of this potential effect. Future studies conducted to directly compare glove-based sampling results with versus without prior swab-based sampling would be valuable; however, this potential limitation is outweighed by the benefit that this study design choice provided\u2014enabling direct comparison of the same hand at the same time for glove-based sampling and swab sampling. Only swab-based samples (and not glove-based samples or culture plate washes) showed an increase in the number of different types of bacteria recovered after all hand hygiene treatments at each time point. These results cannot be conclusively explained. Possible reasons include hygiene treatment reducing the dominant OTU (thus increasing the apparent number of different OTUs), technician sampling technique variability, and/or variability in environmental conditions.",

Our findings, illustrated in Fig.\u00a03, confirmed that there were several significant correlations identified among (i) bacterial community composition assessed by sequencing, (ii) aerobic culturable bacterial CFU level, (iii) anaerobic culturable bacterial CFU level, (iv) aerobic culturable bacterial population reduction immediately after hygiene use, (v) anaerobic culturable bacterial population reduction immediately after hygiene use, (vi) skin pH, (vii) skin hydration, and (viii) skin redness.

The overall pattern of correlations suggests that individuals with higher skin hydration levels have lower pH, less redness, larger amounts of culturable bacteria (both aerobic and anaerobic), and bacterial community compositions that differ from those of persons with low hydration. Also, those with higher levels of skin hydration demonstrate greater reductions in populations of culturable bacteria (aerobic and anaerobic) when exposed to hygiene treatment. Future studies should aim to elucidate what is the cause and what is the effect: does more-hydrated skin result in higher levels of microbes and a particular microbial population, or does the presence of certain microbial populations result in more-hydrated, healthier skin?",

By culture methods, the ABHS and ethanol control had greater impact than the nonantimicrobial hand wash or water rinse control on the numbers of viable bacteria. The nonantimicrobial hand wash, however, had the greatest impact in assessment using bacterial community composition. These results align with previous studies that indicated that nonantimicrobial hand wash use can modify the microbiome (23, 37). No change in community composition, via glove-based sampling, was observed for any of the hand hygiene treatments. In contrast, swab-based sampling detected a change in bacterial OTUs and community composition as a result of hygiene treatment with a hand wash. Sequencing of both swab-based and glove-based samples showed that the use of ABHS had no more impact on diversity, as measured by OTU richness, or on the hand bacterial community composition, than did rinsing with water. This may indicate that hand hygiene interventions act on only the outer surface of the skin and do not change the resident populations below the outermost surface of the skin (38). However, in all instances, any effects were not lasting, as no significant differences were observed at the follow-up sampling time point of 24\u00a0h. It is likely that the microbiota returned in less than 24\u00a0h, but future studies will need to be conducted with shorter sampling periods (e.g., minutes and hours) to address that issue.",

Additionally, anaerobic plating is recommended, as it recovered greater total levels of bacteria than aerobic plating, but the two methods qualitatively delivered similar community compositions. Culture plating overrepresented the relative prevalence of the Staphylococcus species and underrepresented the overall diversity of the microbial community detected using culture-independent characterization. Since culture-independent sequencing is not able to differentiate between viable and dead microbes, the effect of test articles (ABHS and ethanol control) that kill bacteria may be underestimated. Plating is good for quantification and viable counts but detects only a fraction of the diversity of the community. While sequencing is better at showing the entire community, it is not effective in distinguishing living from inactive or dead microbes. In the future, the need for culture plating could be eliminated, if sequencing methods improve to become more quantitative, such as by using a spiking method (39), and lead to resolution of the problem of the inability to distinguish live and/or active microbes from dead and/or dormant bacteria, such as with the propidium monoazide (PMA) method (40) or SYTOX-based methods (41).",

Glove-based sampling is preferred when characterization of the resident population is desired, while swab-based sampling may be appropriate for some studies aimed at assessing only a portion of the hand surface area when transient bacterial populations are the focus of the study. The cup scrub sampling technique (42) could be explored in future studies, as it may be a more direct comparison to swabbing, as it can also be done on smaller areas of the skin.",

A key limitation in the current ASTM method (E1115-11) for assessment of the effect of hand hygiene on the resident bacteria is the confounding factor of time and the environmental exposures that the hands encounter. This is because the baseline is measured days prior to the post-hygiene sample. In our study, we chose to use the same hand for all glove-based sampling, following this ASTM approach. This is because we assumed, on the basis of previous work (23), that the microbiotas of the two hands of each participant would be markedly different. The similarity between dominant and nondominant hands observed in glove-based samples in our study suggests that it is acceptable to assume that the two hands are similar. We believe that the error introduced by taking baseline measurements on the same hand on different days prior to post-hygiene measurements (as recommended by standard ASTM hand hygiene methods) would be greater than the error introduced by taking measures using different hands but on the same day (i.e., taking measures from one hand immediately before the hygiene intervention and from the other hand immediately after the hygiene intervention).",

A better approach is likely to combine elements of both the existing culture-based standard methods with the culture-independent methods to assess microbial loads and microbial community composition in order to more completely assess the overall effects of hand hygiene use on the microbiome.

For the swabbing procedure, a sterile double swab (BD BBL CultureSwab; catalog number 220135) was rubbed for 60\u00a0s over the dorsal side of the hand, flipping the swab at 30\u00a0s and avoiding the fingernails. This was repeated with a new double swab on the palmar side of the hand. After a 15-min waiting period postswabbing, skin measurements were taken on the non-glove-based sampled hand to assess skin color, moisture content, and pH. For all skin measurements, three readings were taken from the dorsal side of the hand and the measurements were averaged, with pH always assessed last. Skin color was assessed using a Konica Minolta CR-400 Chroma Meter. Measurement of skin moisture content was performed using an MPA 6 system with a Courage-Khazaka CM 825 Corneometer probe. pH was measured using an MPA 6 system with a Courage-Khazaka PH 905 skin pH meter probe on the skin, which was first hydrated by adding a few drops of distilled water to the skin before each measurement. Immediately following skin measurements, glove-based sampling of the other hand (randomized; one hand was used for skin measures and the other hand for glove-based sampling) was conducted as described in ASTM E1115 (http://www.astm.org), with 50\u00a0ml of a modified sterile hand sampling solution (0.5% K2HPO4, 0.4% Na2HPO4, 0.1% Tween 80, 0.03% l-cysteine HCl prepared in deionized water, pH\u00a06.8 \u00b1 0.1). The modified solution was used instead of the solution suggested in the ASTM E1115 and E1174 protocols because the Triton X-100 in the standard formulation is known to prevent the growth of some normal skin bacteria (43), and pilot evaluations (data not shown) demonstrated higher bacterial recovery counts from hands using the modified formulation than using the standard hand sampling solution.",

(23). Raw sequences were demultiplexed using a Python script (https://github.com/leffj/helper-code-for-uparse), the resulting sequences were clustered, and OTU abundances were calculated on a per-sample basis using the UPARSE pipeline. The sequence processing consisted of building a de novo sequence database from the demultiplexed paired-end sequences, which were merged and quality filtered using a maximum error rate of 0.5\u00a0bp per sequence. Singleton sequences were removed prior to building the database, and the remaining sequences were clustered using a >97% sequence similarity cutoff to form OTUs. Representative sequences of these OTUs (the de novo database) were provided taxonomic identifications using the RDP classifier trained on the Greengenes database (version 13_8). To obtain sequence counts for each OTU per sample, merged unfiltered reads were mapped to the de novo database. OTUs identified as mitochondria or chloroplasts were removed prior to downstream analyses. Since blanks included among the samples during microbial community analysis were consistently found to contain members of the genus Alicyclobacillus, OTUs classified as Alicyclobacillus were removed also prior to downstream analyses. All samples were rarefied to 1,000 sequences per sample.",

Differences in diversity and differences in community composition across sample types (swab-based sequences, glove-based sequences, and sequences of plate washes from aerobic and anaerobic culture growth) were assessed using ANOVA and PERMANOVA, respectively. Effects of hand hygiene treatment on skin bacterial community composition were assessed by calculating dissimilarities between pretreatment samples and posttreatment samples for the same individual and for the same hand (left versus right), as well as for the sides of the hand (palmar versus dorsal) for swab samples. ANOVA was used with Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference (HSD) tests with the predictor variables treatment, dominant/nondominant hand (for swab-based samples), and hand side (for swab-based samples) to determine whether there were significant differences across treatments at each time point.",
