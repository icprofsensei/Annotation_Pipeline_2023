Similar to IBD, pouch inflammation is thought to result from a\ncombination of genetic and microbial factors which together contribute to a\ndysregulated immune response and subsequent inflammation. Indeed, our group has\nillustrated that IBD-associated genetic polymorphisms are associated with chronic\npouch inflammatory complications, including the development of a Crohn's disease\n(CD)-like phenotype(10). As has been observed\nin IBD, alterations in the tissue-associated microbiome have been found in\nileal-pouch inflammation(11, 12). Both diseases are characterized by an\noverall decrease in organism diversity, however, the specific organisms associated\nwith each of these phenotypes are not identical1, 12-14. Furthermore, the\nphenotypic differences between pouch inflammatory complications and IBD, most\nnotably the responsiveness to antibiotic therapy among a majority of individuals\nwith pouchitis, suggest that there are differences between the microbiota in these\ngroups, which may have a role in pathogenesis. Given that pouches are constructed\nfrom ileal tissue, among patients with a disease phenotype which is not typically\ncharacterized by ileal inflammation (UC), it is interesting to speculate that\nchanges in the tissue-associated microbiome resulting from fecal stasis generated in\nthe pouch, may be responsible for de novo ileal inflammation. We\nhave made use of a large cohort of patients, including healthy individuals and those\nwith evidence of either acute or long term chronic inflammatory phenotypes, all on\nminimal medical therapy, to address these hypotheses by comparing and contrasting\nthe tissue-associated microbiome of colonic and ileal tissue with that of the ileal\npouch.",

In brief,\ncomparisons between pouch and sigmoid, pouch and TI, afferent limb and sigmoid,\nand afferent limb and TI were conducted using Fisher's exact test and the\nnon-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests of significance. LEfSe (v. 1.1.0)(24) was used to explore whether additional\norganisms at different phylogenetic levels were also associated with biopsy\nlocation. Additional attention was paid to genus-level organisms which had been\npreviously associated with IBD or pouchitis through either our own work, or that\nof others(12, 25, 26). The\ncomposition of the microbiome was then compared at the genus-level between\ndisease subgroups (CD and UC). Analyses were carried out separately in the\nsigmoid and TI, with the primary outcome measure of interest being CD and UC\ncompared to HC. Further analyses were conducted in which medication use and\ninflammation were controlled for using linear modeling. Finally, in order to\ninvestigate the relationship between sampling location and microbiome content,\nwe also assessed the correlation between length of time since ileostomy closure\nand genera relative abundance using Spearman correlation.",

Several associations at different taxonomic ranks were\nobserved from the phylum to the genus level. Notably, Bacteroidetes comprised a\nsignificantly lower proportion of the tissue associated microbiome in pouches, while\nProteobacteria and Fusobacteria were more abundant. At the genus level, a large\nnumber of taxa within these phyla were detected at differential abundance in pouches\ncompared to ileal and colonic tissue. The majority of these associations\ndemonstrated a decreased abundance of typically ubiquitous organisms in the pouch\nand AL compared to ileal and sigmoid tissue. Escherichia and\nStreptococcus were exceptions to this pattern and were detected\nat higher abundance in pouch tissue. Previous work has demonstrated that\nEscherichia and other Enterobacteriaceae thrive in conditions\nof inflammation, due in part to host-derived byproducts of nitric oxide\nsynthase(27). This might suggest that\ndespite a relatively healthy appearing pouch among individuals with no history of\npouchitis or FAP, sub-clinical inflammation of the submucosa may be present to a\ngreater degree than that seen in ileal or colonic tissue, exerting a profound effect\non the structure of the microbiome. Alternatively, it is possible that past\nantibiotic use either following pouch construction or at the time of surgery, may\ninfluence the composition of the pouch microbiome with long term repercussions. The\nmoderate levels of intrinsic antibiotic resistance characterizing both\nEscherichia and Streptococcus thus lead to the\ndominance of these groups in pouch tissue(28-30). Despite similarities in\ndisease phenotype between UC and inflammatory complications of the pouch, our\nobservations of different microbial profiles in these locations may provide\nimportant information regarding disease pathogenesis.",

Several organisms\npreviously suggested to be protective against IBD, including\nFaecalibacterium, were also decreased in the ileal pouch(31). Our previous results documenting reduced\ndiversity and reduced abundance of specific organisms with anti-inflammatory\npotential in the inflamed ileal pouch (reduced further from that seen in healthy\npouches), suggests that incremental decreases in these organisms' abundance may not\ninfluence pouch inflammatory processes, rather severe reductions of these organisms\naccompany pouch inflammation. It is therefore possible that the high incidence of\npouch inflammatory complications following IPAA, are a result of a reduction in the\nalready inherently low abundance of beneficial organisms which characterize the\npouch microbiome in general.",

In order to ensure that\nresults of decreased prevalence of organisms in pouch tissue were not due to this\nphenomenon, we explored whether alterations in the pouch-associated microbiome were\nrelated to the amount of time which had lapsed since surgery. We saw little evidence\nto support the hypothesis that microbial changes were associated with the duration\nof time since surgery. However, samples were not collected longitudinally, and were\nspecifically restricted to individuals who had undergone pouch surgery at least one\nyear prior to recruitment. It is possible that the majority of adaptations of the\npouch microbiome occur during the first year, mirroring the period when the greatest\ndegree of colonic metaplasia is occurring(34,\n38). Furthermore, the question of whether\ncolonic adaptation of ileal tissue leads to changes in the microbiome, or whether\nalterations in the tissue associated microbiome result from the pelvic pouch\nprocedure lead to changes in ileal tissue, remains unanswered. To further explore\nthis, additional prospective studies are required. However, it would seem that pouch\nduration is not a confounding factor in our analysis.",

Yet, the\nquestion of whether the pouch is a useful model of de novo CD of\nthe ileum, or recurrence of colonic UC has not been well elucidated. On the one\nhand, the occurrence of inflammation in tissue of ileal origin comprising the pouch\nwould seem to suggest processes similar to CD are involved. Yet colonic metaplasia\nwhich is often undergone by ileal tissue following pouch construction(34, 38),\ncould over time lead to recreation of more \u2018colonic\u2019 conditions\nnecessary for the development of UC. Commensurate with these hypotheses, our\nobservations demonstrate that the formation of the pouch results in drastic changes\nto the composition of the microbiome, with the final composition resembling neither\nileal nor colonic tissue, but rather a novel hybrid of the two. Thus, the ileal\norigin of tissue prior to surgery may be influential in defining the composition of\nthe pouch microbiome, with the unique physiology and gene expression characteristics\nof this region of bowel impacting the architecture of microbial communities\noccupying this niche. However, niche-specific growth parameters characterizing the\npouch such as fecal stasis, lead to alterations in the structure of the microbial\ncommunity which are more in keeping with its colonic functionality. This would seem\nto suggest that the pouch may be a useful model for either colonic or ileal\ninflammation, with the important caveat that the described microbiome differences\nmust be considered when interpreting results.",
