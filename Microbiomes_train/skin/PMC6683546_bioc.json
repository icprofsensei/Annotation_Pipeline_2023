The intestinal microbiota has an essential role in maintaining overall health through several different mechanisms, including protection against pathogens, priming of the immune system, digestion of food and synthesis of essential vitamins [2\u20134]. In contrast, disturbances of the composition of the intestinal microbiota, especially early in life, are associated with the development of numerous diseases and clinical conditions such as asthma, allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, atopy, necrotising enterocolitis and obesity [2, 5\u201311]. Despite increasing evidence for this crucial role of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease, little information exists on colonisation early in life and on environmental factors that may affect its composition. Information on microbial dynamics during the neonatal period is pivotal, since early microbial colonisation is considered to be crucial for the microbial composition later in life.",

However, recent studies have demonstrated that gut colonisation begins in utero [12]. In the first days following birth, environmental factors like (breast)feeding, skin contact and medication further contribute to colonisation [13]. The influence of the route of delivery and the use of antibiotics during a caesarean section (CS) on neonatal microbial colonisation has not been completely clarified. Neonates born by CS have delayed intestinal colonisation compared to vaginally delivered children, since there is no contact with the maternal vaginal and faecal microbiota and the perineal skin [14\u201316]. In addition, infants born by CS seem to have a decreased microbial diversity, possibly persisting for a prolonged period of at least 2 years [15]. Consequently, these infants are considered to have an increased risk of developing diseases associated with early aberrations in gut microbiota [15, 16]. However, studies on the role of the route of delivery on neonatal colonisation have few participants and short follow-up periods, while the reported results are\u00a0inconsistent. In addition, there is limited information on the impact of the timing of maternal antibiotic administration during a CS on neonatal colonisation.",

However, the previous guidelines advised administration of antibiotics after clamping of the umbilical cord. This adjusment\u00a0has been shown to decrease the risk of total infectious morbidities, without an increase in adverse neonatal outcomes. Maternal infectious morbidity affects around 5\u201310% of women undergoing CS [17, 18]. In a recent meta-analysis, infectious morbidity affected 3.9% of women receiving antibiotics preoperatively, compared to 6.9% of women who received antibiotics after clamping of the umbilical cord (relative risk 0.57). This reduction was predominantly caused by a reduction of endometritis and fewer wound infections [18]. Obviously, when antibiotics are administered prior to skin incision, the infant will be exposed too, whereas infants are not exposed if the antibiotic is administered after clamping of the cord. The effects of this protocol adjustment on neonatal outcomes were exclusively evaluated in the short term, including the effects on suspected sepsis that required a workup [18, 19]. The long-term consequences of the timing and type of antibiotics, such as the influence on neonatal intestinal colonisation, priming of the immune system and on the incidence of auto-immune diseases, like coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma and allergies, have not yet been addressed [20].",

The first two groups include 40 pregnant women visiting the outpatient clinic of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at VUmc during the last trimester of pregnancy. They must have an uncomplicated pregnancy so far and be scheduled for CS. An uncomplicated pregnancy is defined as a normotensive singleton pregnancy, with a normal-weight foetus without maternal or foetal risk factors, delivered without complications at a gestational age of more than 37\u2009weeks. Twenty women will be treated according to the current NICE guidelines for antibiotic administration during CS (group A). These subjects will receive 1500\u2009mg cefuroxime intravenous 30\u2009min prior to skin incision. The remaining 20 women will be treated according to the former protocol (group B) and will be administered 1500\u2009mg cefuroxime intravenous directly after clamping of the umbilical cord. Allocation to a group will be randomised in permuted blocks of 10 using www.random.org. Allocation to a group will be blinded only for the statistician performing the analysis. The third group will include 20 pregnant women with an uncomplicated pregnancy as described above, admitted for outpatient vaginal delivery in VUmc (group C). Exclusion criteria for this group include antibiotics administration during pregnancy or labour and premature rupture of membranes (Table\u00a01). The women delivering vaginally will be recruited at the same time as the women in the other two groups. The neonates born at \u226537\u2009weeks gestational age from mothers included in one of the three study groups will be included following informed consent from both their parents.",

The number of infants born by CS has increased unprecedentedly in recent years, currently reaching a rate of over 27% in developed countries. In some countries, it even exceeds 50% [30]. Insights into the possible effects on the intestinal microbiota of early antibiotic exposure and the role of the intestinal microbiota in health and disease later in life are, therefore, essential to ensuring the safety of the current guidelines for infants. However, few studies have addressed this topic.",

One study showed increased Firmicutes abundances and an almost entire depletion of Bacteroidetes species at the postnatal age of 3 months. In contrast, at the age of 1 year, they did not observe any differences in the microbiota of infants born by elective CS [35]. However, early microbial dysbiosis at the age of 3 months could already have affected the development of the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in long-lasting pathologic consequences that persist even after normalisation of the composition of the gut microbiota [36]. A second study demonstrated a delayed colonisation with Actinobacteria, a concurrent lack of Bacteroidetes and a higher Firmicutes abundance compared to unexposed vaginal deliveries [34]. However, it should be acknowledged that both studies compared antibiotic-exposed infants to vaginally born unexposed infants. Since the route of delivery has an impact on the microbial composition [15, 37, 38], both studies lack the ability to draw firm conclusions about the influence of antibiotic administration during CS on the neonatal microbiota.",
