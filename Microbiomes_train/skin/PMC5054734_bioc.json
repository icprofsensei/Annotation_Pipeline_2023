It is known that many ocular infections such as postoperative endophthalmitis, blebitis, and infectious keratitis originate from the ocular surface. However, a definitive diagnosis of the causative pathogen can be challenging. Culture yields for infectious-appearing corneal ulcers are typically less than 60%.6,7 Similarly, in postoperative endophthalmitis (where there is little doubt of an infectious etiology), the success rate of pathogen identification by conventional bacterial culture is only approximately 50 to 70%.8,9 In a recent study, cultures failed to detect a causative agent in approximately 33% of the postoperative endophthalmitis cases, while biome representational in silico karyotyping (BRiSK; a metagenomic detection method for DNA-based life-forms) was able to identify a small DNA virus, torque teno virus (TTV), in 100% of culture-negative endophthalmitis samples.10 These results suggest that TTV may be an overlooked or unknown resident virus of the ocular surface and further support the importance of understanding both the bacterial and viral constituents of the normal ocular surface.",

Although these results demonstrate potential diversity of the ocular surface microbiome, these studies examined a relatively small number of individuals, and did not assay for nonbacterial organisms or viruses, as 16S rDNA gene sequencing cannot detect other classes of microorganisms such as viruses or fungi. Previous work using viral-directed PCRs have shown that herpes simplex type 1, hepatitis B virus, and even hepatitis C virus can be detected in the tears of asymptomatic volunteers,16 suggesting a potential niche for viruses in the ocular surface microbiome. Therefore, simply focusing solely on the bacterial constituents of the ocular surface may result in an incomplete understanding of the ocular surface microbiome.",

Participants were enrolled from a combination of clinical ophthalmology offices, medical school students, and seniors living in retirement communities. Subjects were given a questionnaire assessing their systemic health including questions regarding immunocompromised states such as diabetes and HIV status. Ocular and systemic medication use over the past year were queried, including use of corticosteroids and immunomodulatory drugs. The ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire was used to identify subjects with healthy ocular surface, using score of 6 or under as the cutoff point. Enrolled subjects were ages 18 to 30 or 60 and older (in order to use these same groups in subsequent studies of the effect of contact lens wear and cataract surgery, respectively, on the surface microbiome). Exclusion criteria were obvious ocular surface disease/irritation, facial skin disease, history of recent contact lens wear, use of oral or topical antibiotics or prescription eye medication in the past 3 months, ocular surgery in the last 12 months, active ocular infection, dry eye condition, diabetes, or immune-compromised state. After instillation of sterile, topical proparacaine, DNA swabs (SK-2S; Isohelix, Boca Raton, FL, USA) were used to obtain samples from the superior and inferior fornices of both eyes for molecular analysis. In a subset of subjects, swabs were taken from buccal mucosa and/or cheek skin. All swabs were immediately placed on ice and transferred to lab within 6 hours to be stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Environmental \u2018air swabs' consisting of exposing freshly-opened swabs to air in proximity of the subject were collected at same time as subject collections for each fourth subject (27 total), and treated identically to subject swabs.",

Master mix was prepared under a laminar hood to minimize contaminations. The final reaction volume was 20 \u03bcL. The primer pairs for TTV PCR were 5\u2032-AGGTGAGTTTACACACCGCAGTCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AATGAAGACCCTAAGAGCCTTGCC-3\u2032.

Briefly, genomic DNA was subjected to whole genome amplification using phi29 and digested with BsaXI as previously described. Illumina-compatible barcoded paired-end adapters, one of which is biotinylated, were ligated to digested DNA, followed by isolation of sequences with asymmetric adapters using streptavidin column and PCR-amplified using adapter sequences. The resulting product was gel-purified and subjected to high throughput sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

The first PCR was conducted using the amplicon primers (from 5\u2032\u20133\u2032) that contain the Illumina overhang adaptor and the universal V3-V4 priming sequence. Each reaction mixture contains 5 ng of extracted DNA and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) in a final volume of 25 uL. The PCR conditions involved a denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes followed by an initial denature step at 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, an annealing step at 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds for a total of 25 cycles followed by a final elongation at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. The resulting 16S V3-V4 amplicons were purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Of the purified first PCR products, 5 uL were used in a 50 uL PCR using the Nextera XT Index Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to attach dual indices and Illumina sequencing adaptors. The PCR conditions involved a denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes followed by an initial denature step at 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, an annealing step at 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds for a total of eight cycles followed by a final elongation at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. The resulting amplicons were purified with AMPure XP beads to clean up the final library before quantification. The DNA concentration in each reaction was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to instructions. Finally, equal DNA amounts of all samples were pooled to a final concentration of 4 nM and subjected to paired-end Illumina sequencing on the MiSeq using paired 300-bp reads and MiSeq v3 reagents. Addition of random PhiX phage DNA to the solution (10%) provided calibration and cluster generation on the MiSeq's flow cell.

Human \u03b2-actin DNA was also quantified by qPCR to control for sample loading. In addition to collecting samples from the conjunctiva of healthy adults, samples from the facial skin and the buccal mucosa from a subset of volunteers were also obtained (Fig. 1A). The normalized bacterial load for all conjunctival samples was 0.14 \u00b1 0.03 16S rDNA copies/human actin copy (mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 82), which was approximately 150-fold less than the normalized bacterial load of the buccal mucosa (24.29 \u00b1 8.08 16S/human actin copy, n = 28) or the facial skin (33.51 \u00b1 6.96 16S/human copy, n = 25). These results translated to approximately 0.06 bacterium per human cell in the conjunctiva compared with approximately 12 bacteria per human cell in the buccal mucosa and approximately 16 bacteria per human cell in the skin, assuming an average of 4.2 16S rDNA gene copies per bacterial genome.25",

                    "text": "Although this relatively small number of genera predominated, sequences from over 800 genera were identified. For conjunctiva, on average, 245 different genera were identified per sample using 16S rDNA gene deep sequencing (range, 17\u2013579). This finding raises the strong possibility that some of these are artefactual. Production of DNA-free reagents is challenging, and false-positive amplifications are common.26,27 Quantitative PCR of the bacterial load in the conjunctiva showed that there is approximately 1 bacterium for every 20 human conjunctival epithelial cells collected on conjunctival swab. Based on this, we estimate there should be approximately 38 bacteria detected per conjunctival sample given that one diploid human genome weighs approximately 6.6 \u00d7 10\u221212 g and 5 \u00d7 10\u22129 g of DNA was processed for each 16S PCR sample. A reasonable assumption is that the majority of the genera identified are contaminants during sample processing. To assign a confidence measure to determined differences, we compared the bacteria recovered from conjunctival swabs with those of the environmental control. To determine those bacteria likely to show meaningful enrichment in conjunctiva, we first limited our analysis to those bacteria whose total 16S counts constituted 0.1% or greater of the conjunctival microbiome. This analysis reduced the number of genera from 887 to 42. We next employed a novel heuristic to rank these bacteria for \u2018confidence'. We reasoned that confidence in a particular result would be a function of the magnitude of fold difference in the observed bacteria between conjunctiva and environmental samples, and the P value for the difference between these sites (adjusted for multiple comparisons, see Methods for details of calculation of P values). Because of the large number of samples analyzed, P values for significant differences included 17 that were smaller than 1 \u00d7 10\u221210. The confidence heuristic was calculated as log10(fold difference/adjusted P value), where the fold difference was mean conjunctival count/mean environmental count (Table 2). Four of six highest confidence genera were Corynebacteria, Propionibacteria, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus, which were all detected frequently in cultures and had confidence heuristics of greater than 10. However, Pseudomonas and Elizabethkingia, which conjointly accounted for 29% of all reads in conjunctiva, had confidence levels of 2 or less, a difference of over 10 orders of magnitude from these other bacterial genera. Examination of the distribution of confidence measures across the 42 genera (Fig. 3) reveals a remarkably broad distribution, with 22 genera having confidence heuristics less than 5, while 17 genera have confidence heuristics at least 5 logs higher (i.e., \u226510). This latter set includes a number of genera detected by culture in some samples (e.g., Lactobacillus and Haemophilus), as well as bacteria not detected by culture including Anaerococcus, Parascardovia, Peptoniphilus, Actinomyces, Prevotella, Dietzia, Finegoldia, Dermacoccus, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, and Mycobacterium. However, none of these species accounted for more than 0.8% of total conjunctival reads. Thus, we find the core cluster microbiome identified by deep DNA sequencing consists of the same four predominant species as detected by culture: Corynebacteria, Propionibacteria, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus, likely with sporadic or very low amounts of several other species.",

Control samples were considered as the environmental swabs. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling plot provides a two-dimensional visualization of differences between members of a population, with similar members grouping together. This analysis allows measurement of overall differences in microbial populations among the various sample groups. The bacterial communities of the healthy conjunctiva clustered differently than the skin (R = 0.474, ANOSIM P = 0.0001) and also differently than the buccal mucosa (R = 0.893, P = 0.0001). Importantly, there existed a statistically significant difference in the communities between the healthy conjunctiva and the control environmental samples (R = 0.536, P = 0.0001). Together, these results indicate that while the facial skin, the oral mucosa, and the ocular surface are adjacent sites, the microbiome of each site is unique.",

These small DNA fragments are then sequenced up to 10-fold coverage. The advantage of this technique is that it allows for the identification of all abundant organisms present in a complex clinical sample, including viruses, fungi, and parasites. Eighty samples of the left lower eyelid from 80 healthy subjects were subjected to BRiSK sequencing and analysis. The results are shown in Figure 5. Of the 78 organisms identified, 10 were detected in 86.3% of all subjects. These organisms included Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Multiple Sclerosis\u2013associated retrovirus (MSRV), Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K), Paenibacillus, Clostridium, TTV, and Bacillus (Fig. 5A). Consistent with culture and 16S rDNA gene deep sequencing, Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus predominated. Notably, BRiSK also revealed the presence of multiple viruses in the conjunctiva. Multiple Sclerosis\u2013associated retrovirus, HERV-K, and TTV were the top three viruses identified. As both MSRV and HEV-K are human endogenous retroviruses (HERV), the DNA sequences detected here likely originated from the host DNA, and hence their clinical significance is unclear.28 The presence of TTV on the ocular surface is particularly noteworthy. Torque teno virus is a 3.8 kb, single-strand circular DNA anellovirus that has been associated with seasonal hyperacute panuveitis (SHAPU) and culture-negative endophthalmitis.10,29 To confirm the presence of TTV on the healthy ocular surface, directed quantitative PCR in healthy conjunctiva samples was performed. Of 80 tested samples, 52 harbored at least 1 TTV copy per 100 epithelial cells (Fig. 5B). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant differences between men and women (0.079 \u00b1 0.068 and 0.014 \u00b1 0.005 TTV/human actin copy, mean \u00b1 SEM; P = 0.547) or between subjects younger than 30 years and older than 60 years (0.075 \u00b1 0.059 and 0.008 \u00b1 0.002, P = 0.089). Additional confirmation of the presence of TTV was performed by visualizing the amplified TTV products on agarose gels. Figure 5C demonstrates the presence and absence of TTV in a subset of healthy conjunctiva samples. In addition to TTV, sequences matching Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and Abelson murine leukemia virus were detected in two samples each by BRiSK. Given that these viruses were detected in only a few healthy subjects, their significance is unclear although MCV and HPV are known to be present in healthy epithelial cells.30,31 Together, the BRiSK analysis of the healthy conjunctiva suggests that there exists a resident DNA viral community on the ocular surface of most subjects with TTV predominant.",

To our knowledge, this study is among the largest studies to date using cultivation-independent techniques to survey the constituents of the ocular surface microbiome. Consistent with previous studies,11,12,14 few organisms were identified using conventional cultures. Quantification of bacteria load from various body sites using 16S rDNA qPCR revealed that the conjunctiva is truly paucibacterial, harboring approximately 150- to 200-fold fewer bacteria per human cell than the facial skin or the buccal mucosa. The community of the conjunctiva appears to be uniquely constituted compared with either skin or buccal mucosa, and contains both resident bacterial and often resident viral communities. The core constituents of the conjunctival microbiome appear relatively consistent between individuals, and are dominated by the four genera of coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Diphtheroids, and Propionibacteria, and Streptococci. Analysis using BRiSK demonstrated that a majority of healthy subjects have detectable TTV on the ocular surface, which was confirmed by direct PCR.",

This group reported identification of an average of 460 operational taxonomic units (OTU) from normal conjunctiva, and a total of 7392 OTUs from among 107 samples. It has been challenging to reconcile these potentially inconsistent results. Our results suggest that application of 16S metagenomics to a paucibacterial sample results in substantial artefactual amplification. Quantitative PCR quantification of 16S amplification suggests the presence of approximately 1 bacterium per 20 recovered epithelial cells, suggesting less than 40 bacteria present per swab (using 5 ng DNA for each sample). It is difficult to reconcile recovery of greater than 100 different genera per sample by this reasoning. That 16S metagenomics analysis is prone to bias and skew has been well recognized.37\u201339 The sources for these artifacts include DNA contamination of reagents,27 errors introduced by PCR amplification, sequencing errors, and misattribution errors.40 We modeled the potential confound of DNA amplification errors by simulating a PCR amplification containing 20 copies each of four pure 16S sequences (from S. epidermidis, P. acnes, Corynebacteria, and Streptococcus) for 25 cycles of amplification using published error rates for different heat-stable polymerases, ranging from 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22127. Because errors at earlier cycles are propagated, these errors accumulate. For a polymerase with 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 error rate, after 25 cycles of the total 2.68 \u00d7 109 amplicons, 2.92 \u00d7 106 will have incorporated errors (0.11%). This would lead to 36 new genera being identified within the sample. Even with an error rate of 1 \u00d7 10\u22127, 27 new genera would be identified.",

Four of the six highest confidence genera were those most frequently recovered by culture and also detected by BRiSK. Conversely, the frequent finding of Pseudomonas in 16S data but not culture or BRiSK must be tempered with its markedly lower confidence heuristic. Validation of the presence of specific bacteria not detected by culture will require further studies, which might include performing transcriptomics on ocular surface samples, as this technique analyzes RNA, and hence only detects viable microbes and not DNA contaminants. Similarly, confirmation of suspected microbes by proteomics, immunohistochemistry, or in situ localization would provide more substantial evidence of presence on the ocular surface.",

Our results indicated that there were approximately 2 orders of magnitude fewer bacteria on the ocular surface than there were on the facial skin or the buccal mucosa. The relatively sparse bacterial population of the conjunctiva is likely due to multiple innate antimicrobial properties of tears including antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme, and other innate effectors.41\u201344 However, our study also revealed that the ocular surface bacterial community is distinct in comparison with either the buccal mucosa or the skin (Fig. 4). Thus, the conjunctiva is not simply a sparse version of either skin or cheek mucosa. In other niches in the body, modulation of the microbiome can influence health and disease.45\u201348 It is conceivable that modulation of the ocular surface microbiome could similarly modulate risk for conditions such as dry eye disease, endophthalmitis, and blebitis, although this hypothesis remains to be tested.",

This small DNA anellovirus has been correlated with several intraocular inflammatory conditions, specifically SHAPU and culture-negative postoperative endophthalmitis.10,29 While TTV has been detected previously in tear film,49 the current study is the first to demonstrate its widespread presence on the ocular surface of a majority of healthy individuals. Torque teno virus induces an adaptive immune response50 and thus may contribute to ocular surface inflammatory conditions. Future studies will be required to determine the role of this virus in ocular health and disease. While several other viral sequences were identified in a few individuals (i.e., MCV and HPV), these did not appear widespread in this study. It is important to note, however, that none of the techniques used in the current study are able to detect RNA-genome viruses.",

The sampled populations included substantial numbers of subjects living in retirement communities, and sampled only one region (urban/suburban Pacific Northwest of United States). For other body sites such as the respiratory tract, specific features of housing conditions such as occupancy have been shown to influence the resident microbiome.51 It is thus conceivable that other populations\u2014geographic, socioeconomic, or living in different housing\u2014might demonstrate different resident microbial populations. Additionally, the relative health of subjects and their ocular surface was inferred from review of symptoms, history, and external examination. It is possible some subjects had subclinical or asymptomatic disease (such as mild blepharitis) and their ocular surface was therefore not truly healthy. Further studies may examine whether relatively mild ocular surface disease (such as mild dry eye or blepharitis) influences the resident microbiome or virome.",
