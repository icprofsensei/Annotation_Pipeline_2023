Deciphering functional diversity and dynamics within human skin microbial communities is critical for understanding their involvement and for developing the appropriate substances for improving or correcting their action. We present a direct PCR-free high throughput sequencing approach to unravel the human skin microbiota specificities through metagenomic dataset analysis and inter-environmental comparison. The approach provided access to the functions carried out by dominant skin colonizing taxa, including Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium, revealing their specific capabilities to interact with and exploit compounds from the human skin. These functions, which clearly illustrate the unique life style of the skin microbial communities, stand as invaluable investigation targets for understanding and potentially modifying bacterial interactions with the human host with the objective of increasing health and well being.",

Selected by both environmental and human characteristics, skin microorganisms are not qualitatively and quantitatively evenly distributed on the body, since they range from less than 102 to more than 107 cells.cm\u22122 as a function of the colonized site [1]. A widely used approach for studying microbial DNA extracted from skin is through its in vitro enzymatic amplification by targeting the rrs gene with \u201cuniversal\u201d primers [2]. This technique, not constrained by the low amounts of microbial DNA extractible from skin, led to the description of the skin microbiota as much more diverse than previously estimated by cultivation-based methods, with strong spatial variations as well as consistent individual host specificities [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. However, a better understanding of the skin microbiota\u2019s role in protecting against pathogens and in improving human health requires investigation beyond the taxonomic inventory of bacteria. Specific activities associated with functional genes need to be characterized. This can be achieved by sequence-based skin microbiome explorations via high throughput shotgun sequencing of metagenomic DNA or by associating species to function with previously sequenced genomes. Due to differences in function even within the same microbial species [8], we decided to build shotgun metagenomic libraries for the skin microbiome despite the requirement for high DNA concentrations.",

The same sampling effort was repeated for a second week in order to constitute a second replicate of the global human skin microbiota for each of the two individuals tested (detailed protocol accessible in Protocol S1). These four DNA samples (>3 micrograms each) were tagged separately and sequenced (Titanium pyrosequencing technology, reads size average of 184\u00b1138 bp).

Most of the sequences were related to a limited number of general subsystems (fig.1) like carbohydrates, amino acids and derivatives, as well as protein metabolism. In contrast, other general subsystems are less represented (e.g., motility and chemotaxis). Homogeneity of the functional distributions among the different datasets can be explained by the functions observed at the general subsystem level (e.g. photosynthesis, respiration\u2026). Specifically, hundreds of subsystems can be simultaneously compared when studying datasets at more detailed functional levels. However it was not possible to explain the functional specificity of the skin microbiome without comparing it to other environments. Thus, principal component analysis (PCA) based on the relative functional distribution of the reads from 69 datasets (annotated by SEED functional level 3 subsystem, 800 functions compared), including human skin and feces, revealed an apparent specificity of skin microbial communities since their related datasets clustered separate from those generated on the 12 other investigated environments (fig. 2). While methodological differences could induce biases among the different metagenomic datasets, these do not compromise their comparison as has been demonstrated previously [13]. Among the 626 functional subsystems detected in human skin related datasets, 52 possessed a distribution significantly different from the 65 other datasets (table S2). These 52 functional subsystems were reviewed to decipher the specific nature of the skin core-(meta)genome and its potential contribution to human health. In order to best represent the skin microbiome\u2019s lifestyle, six of these were analyzed in more detail. Other functions are accessible in the table S2.",

The human skin surface microbial communities potentially possess strong capacities for interacting with their environment based on inter-ecosystem comparisons (fig. 3). The functional potential of skin bacteria indicates that these bacteria are strongly adapted to the exploitation of compounds produced by the human skin, including sugars, lipids (and iron), and petrobactin-mediated iron uptake systems were detected in the metagenome datasets. The presence of lactic acid generated by sweat (>99 \u00b5g/ml) [15] and of a sugar, such as sialic acid, common to humans and animals justifies the predominance of respective catabolic genes in our skin metagenome datasets. Similarly, the detection of a high proportion of sequences related to triacylglycerol catabolism, a skin lipid critically involved in epidermal permeability, suggests its utilization as a carbon source and triacylglycerol catabolism could also provide a significant contribution to the lipases produced by the skin for preventing lipid accumulation as in the ichthyosis pathology [16].",

For instance, acidification ecosystem preservation could explain the bacterial adaptive strategy of using the butanediolic fermentation as deduced from detection of alpha acetolactate and acetoin butanediol metabolism genes for transforming pyruvate into the final product (2,3-butanediol) rather than a mixed acid fermentation. The predominance of genes involved in the arginine deiminase metabolism [17] in the metagenome datasets confirms the tolerance of bacteria to skin acidity [15]. The skin metagenome analysis also brings new clues about the extensive spread of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria. Within the human skin Staphylococcus populations of the two individuals, various Staphylococci seem to be intrinsically resistant to methicillin (fig. 3), although neither of the two individuals had recent contact with a methicillin-rich environment (hospitalization and/or methicillin treatment). Moreover, the level of teicoplanin and bacitracin resistance genes was particularly high in the sequence datasets.",
