Previous sequencing of skin samples has identified 273 different cutaneous HPV types, including 47 previously unknown types. In the present study, we wished to extend prior studies using deeper sequencing. This deeper sequencing without prior PCR of a pool of 142 whole genome amplified skin lesions identified 23 known HPV types, 3 novel putative HPV types and 4 non-HPV viruses. The complete sequence was obtained for one of the known putative types and almost the complete sequence was obtained for one of the novel putative types. In addition, sequencing of amplimers from HPV consensus PCR of 326 skin lesions detected 385 different HPV types, including 226 previously unknown putative types. In conclusion, metagenomic deep sequencing of human skin samples identified no less than 396 different HPV types in human skin, out of which 229 putative HPV types were previously unknown.",

Some mucosal HPV types cause cervical cancer19, as well as vulvar, anal and penile cancers20, whereas some cutaneous HPV types cause skin warts and others are associated with SCC in patients with a rare immunosuppressive disease21,22. Virus-associated cancers have an increased incidence among immunosuppressed patients23. This fact has spurred intensive efforts to search for viruses in cancers that have an increased incidence among the immunosuppressed patients, but that are not known to have a viral etiology. The cancer form that is most highly increased in incidence among the immunosuppressed is non-melanoma skin cancer23.",

These findings indicate that the Illumina deep sequencing technology is a useful method to obtain the complete picture of the viruses that are present in human skin. 9 out of 12 viral types that were detected with only a single read using 454GSFLX or Ion Torrent PGM were confirmed by the Illumina, with many more reads. Only 3 of the 12 viruses previously detected by only a single viral read were not confirmed by the deeper sequencing.",

Possibly, the viruses in the \u03b3-genus may exist at higher viral loads, making them easier to detect, wheras viruses of \u03b2-genus might be biologically different and be present in lower viral loads. It might intuitively be surmised that viruses present in high amounts are more pathogenic, but there is no data to support this notion. Alternative scenarios are possible where the many different viruses present may interact. A first step that will enable investigations of this issue is the basic knowledge that these viruses are present - the basic and fundamental discovery of the paper. Although 22 of the HPVs detected appeared to be more common in either the SCC/AK or KA sample, the massive number of viruses detected suggests that the association may have been due to chance and that it needs to be investigated in further studies.",

Indices, included in the Illumina adaptors, were used to assign the sequences obtained to the originating sample. The bioinformatic analysis started with quality checking, where sequences were trimmed according to their Phred quality scores34. Quality checked reads were then screened against the human reference genome hg19 using BWA-MEM35 and SOAP aligner (http://soap.genomics.org.cn) and reads with >95% identity over 75% of their length to human DNA were removed from further analysis. The rest of the sequences were normalized (http://ged.msu.edu/papers/2012-diginorm) to discard redundant data and reduce sampling variation and sequencing errors. The normalized dataset was then processed for assembly using the Trinity36, SOAPdenovo and SOAPdenovo-Trans (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/) assemblers into contiguous sequences (contigs). Reads before assembly were re-mapped to assembled contigs and the result was used to calculate number of reads for each assembled contig. The use of several assembly algorithms and re-mapping of all singleton reads to assembled contigs were used to validate assembly results13,37. Assembled contigs were then subjected to taxonomic classification by comparing them against GenBank nucleotide database using paracel blast (www.strikingdevelopment.com) blastn to classify them as i) previously known sequences, ii) related to previously known sequences, or iii) unrelated to any previously known sequences. To identify possible artifactual \u201cchimeric\u201d sequences, contigs containing sequences originating from different viruses, all papillomavirus-related contigs and singletons were checked as described38. Shortly, the sequence that aligned to its most closely related sequence in GenBank was divided into three equal segments. If at least one of the segments differed in similarity to the corresponding overlapping parts with more than 5% (for example, if segment 1 was 88% similar and segment 2 was 94% similar) the sequence was considered as a \u201cpossible chimera\u201d. All analyses were performed using in-house R (www.R-project.org/) and python (www.python.org) scripts that run on a high performance (40 core, 2\u2005TB RAM) Linux server.",
