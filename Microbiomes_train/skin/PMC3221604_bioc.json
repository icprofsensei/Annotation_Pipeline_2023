Genomic analysis of several strains has revealed an extensive H.\u00a0pylori pan-genome, likely to grow as more genomes are sampled. Here we describe the draft genome sequence (63 contigs; 26\u00d7 mean coverage) of H.\u00a0pylori strain B45, isolated from a patient with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The major finding was a 24.6-kb prophage integrated in the bacterial genome. The prophage shares most of its genes (22/27) with prophage region II of Helicobacter acinonychis strain Sheeba. After UV treatment of liquid cultures, circular DNA carrying the prophage integrase gene could be detected, and intracellular tailed phage-like particles were observed in H.\u00a0pylori cells by transmission electron microscopy, indicating that phage production can be induced from the prophage. PCR amplification and sequencing of the integrase gene from 341 H.\u00a0pylori strains from different geographic regions revealed a high prevalence of the prophage (21.4%). Phylogenetic reconstruction showed four distinct clusters in the integrase gene, three of which tended to be specific for geographic regions. Our study implies that phages may play important roles in the ecology and evolution of H.\u00a0pylori.",

Our finding of a 24.6-kb prophage integrated inside an H.\u00a0pylori genome and the observation of circular integrase gene-containing DNA and phage-like particles inside cells upon UV treatment demonstrate that we have discovered a viable H.\u00a0pylori phage. The additional finding of integrase genes in a large proportion of screened isolates of diverse geographic origins indicates that the prevalence of prophages may have been underestimated in H.\u00a0pylori.

For instance, it has been estimated that 20 to 40% of bacterioplankton cells in the ocean are lysed by bacteriophages on a daily basis (1). Escape from viral infection is thus a major driver of microbial evolution, which is apparent in, for example, high evolutionary rates of cell surface proteins that serve as viral receptors (2) or the rapid acquisition of spacers complementary to viral DNA within the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) microbial immune system (3, 4). This is countered by adaptations of the viral populations (e.g., cell attachment proteins), resulting in an evolutionary arms race between viruses and their hosts (5). Furthermore, viruses contribute significantly to microbial evolution by inserting novel genetic elements into host genomes; it has been suggested that most of the strain-specific genes are derived from viruses (6).",

Most of the infected individuals do not develop disease; however, H.\u00a0pylori infection doubles the risk of developing gastric cancer (12), which is responsible for 10% of all cancer-related deaths in the world. It is therefore important to identify H.\u00a0pylori genes and genotypes associated with disease development within the relatively unexplored high genetic diversity of H.\u00a0pylori (8, 10, 13). H.\u00a0pylori possesses an arsenal of tools which allow it to colonize the hostile gastric environment, including a strong urease to resist the acidic gastric pH and flagella to move in the thick mucus and evade host immunity. H.\u00a0pylori pathogenicity has been associated with the production of numerous virulence factors, in particular those encoded by the cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI), which have been associated with peptic ulceration, atrophic gastritis, and gastric adenocarcinoma (14, 15). These factors can target tumor suppression functions (reduction of p53 on delivery of CagA), in a mode similar to that of DNA tumor viruses (16). Currently, eradication of H.\u00a0pylori is performed with antibiotics that have severe effects on the intestinal microbiota, including persistence of elevated levels of antibiotic-resistant strains years after treatment (17); thus, novel therapies targeting H.\u00a0pylori specifically are needed.",

(19) described intracellular phage-like particles observed in human gastric mucosa. Two other studies from the early 1990s showed spontaneous production of small amounts of phage particles by the H.\u00a0pylori strain Schreck (20). Furthermore, Vale et al. (21) described H.\u00a0pylori temperate phage induction of phage-like particles using UV. Reports of prophages in other Helicobacter species are also rare. Until now, there have been only two reports of a prophage: one in the genome of Helicobacter acinonychis strain Sheeba (22) and one in Helicobacter\u00a0felis CS1 (ATCC 49179) (23). Although the reports concerning H.\u00a0pylori phages are rare, genetic characteristics of H.\u00a0pylori isolates suggest that the organism is challenged by viruses; a multitude of restriction-modification (R-M) system genes are found that display high evolutionary rates (24\u201326). In addition, R-M system genes are highly diverse among strains, representing more than half of the strain-specific genes present in H.\u00a0pylori sequenced genomes (27). The repertoire of R-M system genes in a bacterial cell influences the pattern of DNA methylation, which in H.\u00a0pylori has been shown to influence gene expression (28); however, R-M system genes are generally believed to function as a protection against invading DNA (2). H.\u00a0pylori cell surface proteins are rapidly evolving (29\u201331). This has been inferred as an adaptation to differences in mucosal surface structures among human hosts or as a selection to counteract the immune response, but it could also reflect escape mechanisms in response to bacteriophage infection.",

No significant lysis plaques of B45 were observed on agar plates after mitomycin treatment (0.1 to 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml; see Materials and Methods) or UV inductions (1 to 10 times the D\u00a0value of UV irradiation; see Materials and Methods). Lysis plaques were observed using the JP1 strain, which served as a positive control (21). Liquid medium cultures did not reveal a significant decrease in optical density (OD) values (600\u00a0nm) at low concentrations (0.1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) of mitomycin. High concentrations (1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) could not be used since they were highly toxic to the cells (the negative-control strain 26695 displayed markedly lower OD values at this concentration). Finally, we tried to induce the B45 prophage in liquid medium by UV irradiation (1 D\u00a0value after 24\u00a0h of incubation, followed by 24 additional hours of incubation; see Materials and Methods), which was followed by a precipitation step, as described in Materials and Methods. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using negative staining revealed numerous phage-like particles with an eggshell structure (size, 100 \u00b1 30\u00a0nm) (Fig.\u00a02) apparently lacking a tail. Negative staining does not usually reveal phage tails because of the limited density of the tail (42). Fixation embedding and ultrathin sectioning of the bacteria allowed us to have access to the interior of the bacterial cells. A few cells contained 1 or 2 phage particles in their cytoplasm. These were recognizable by a high-density mature head, with rounded appearance, on which a tail was attached. The phage head was ~62.5\u00a0nm (\u00b17.3\u00a0nm) in diameter, and the tail was ~92.4\u00a0nm (\u00b12.97\u00a0nm) long and 5 to 6\u00a0nm in diameter. The total length of the phage was ~150\u00a0nm. Overall, these structures were compatible with a Siphoviridae phage (Fig.\u00a02).",

                    "text": "Because the phage morphology observed using TEM was compatible with the Siphoviridae family of phages, we compared the B45 prophage genome organization with this family of viruses. Siphoviridae genomes fall into two size classes: 121 to 134\u00a0kb and 22 to 56\u00a0kb (44, 45). Hence, the B45 prophage (as well as H. acinonychis strain Sheeba prophage II) had a size compatible with the second class. Siphoviridae family phages usually harbor several typical modules such as head proteins, head-tail joining, DNA packaging, tail and tail fiber proteins, host lysis, lysogeny module, replication module, and transcriptional regulators (44). Most of the genes (23 of 27) did not generate significant BLAST matches to proteins other than those of the H. acinonychis strain Sheeba and B38 prophage proteins, indicating that no closely related virus had been sequenced before (Table\u00a01; see also Table\u00a0S2 in the supplemental material). However, searches based on PSI-BLAST gave functional clues about a subset of the genes. Although sometimes highly putative, the results indicated that functionally related genes could be organized in several modules. These included a putative lysogeny module, harbouring at least a phage integrase/recombinase gene (C21B450018); 2 putative transcriptional regulators (C21B450020 and C47B450016); a replication module including one putative phage replication protein (C21B450021), a DNA repair protein (C21B450024 and C47B450012), a DNA primase (C21B450025), and a putative structural maintenance of chromosomes protein (SMC) (C21B450026); a putative tail fiber protein (C47B450002); and a putative crystalline beta/gamma motif-containing protein (putative lysin) (the 5,958-bp CDS which corresponds to the fusion of C21B450028-C73B450001-C47B450001) (Table\u00a01).",

Surprisingly, 21.4% of the isolates (73/341) had an integrase gene (GenBank accession numbers JF734912 to JF734984), suggesting that this is a much more frequent phenomenon than initially estimated. The prevalences of the gene were similar in different pathologies: 25.6% (30/117) in duodenal ulcer strains, 20.9% (23/110) in gastritis strains, 15.9% (10/63) in gastric MALT lymphoma strains, and 19.6% (10/51) in atrophic gastritis/adenocarcinoma strains. Significant association was not found with cag\u00a0PAI status. The average prevalence among European strains was 21.4% (59/276). Prevalence was higher in Sweden (18/56, 32.1%) than in France (28/125, 20%), Germany (6/53, 11.3%), and Portugal (3/29, 10.3%). No significant conclusion can be made concerning the United Kingdom and Norway, for which only 7 and 6 strains were tested, respectively. Notably, the prevalence among African isolates was low, with only one strain out of 18 (5.6%) being positive by PCR screening. This could be explained either by a lower prevalence of the prophage in African isolates or by significant integrase sequence divergence leading to mismatching of the PCR primers. The only South American strain included in the present study was negative. Thirteen of the 46 Asian strains (28.3%) included in the study were also positive.",

This prophage is morphologically similar to phages of the Siphoviridae family. No prophage sequence has been reported for H.\u00a0pylori, except for a remnant prophage sequence in the B38 strain; however, our study confirms two previously published articles reporting spontaneous production of small amounts of phage particles by an H.\u00a0pylori strain (20, 48). Interestingly, all three reports describe the morphology as compatible with that of Siphoviridae; as with the phage described in the present paper, these previous articles reported infection, propagation, and electron microscopy images of a Helicobacter phage with a morphology compatible with that of Siphoviridae. The phage characteristics described by Heintschel von Heinegg et al. (i.e., phage heads of around 50 to 60\u00a0nm and DNA estimated to be 22,000\u00a0bp in length) are also in line with the B45 prophage (20).",

The methods used for phage induction in the present study are most likely suboptimal, since relatively few phage particles were observed and there were no visible plaques (Fig.\u00a02). Other strategies may be more effective, such as exposing the bacteria to physical stress, leading to an induction of coccoidal forms, or by using a subinhibitory concentration of an antibiotic that induces DNA damage instead of chemical stress (49, 50). However, the optimal conditions for phage induction are difficult to predict. Nevertheless, it would be of interest to know whether randomly selected H.\u00a0pylori strains are susceptible to infection by phage or whether most are resistant.",

The presence of such insertion sequences (IS) in B38 has been viewed as a sign of a degenerative process (39). In prophages from Gram-negative bacteria, \u201cextra genes\u201d called \u201cmorons\u201d can be found near the prophage DNA ends, at strategic positions, and these can interfere with the functions required during lysogeny and for lytic infection (45). However, in prophages some morons can be flanked by such transposase genes in their vicinity, pointing to alternative methods of mobility. Therefore, the presence of ISHp608 could be also viewed as a \u201cpoison\u201d inside the phage DNA interfering with the inducibility of the phage, which may provide one putative explanation of the small amount of phage particles observed in the present study.",

This is most likely due to the high evolutionary rate of bacteriophages; identification of unknown sequences is expected when analyzing a novel phage genome (45). This could explain why some of the genes typically existing in a phage genome could not be identified, including a head-like and a tail fiber protein. The origin of this Helicobacter prophage could not be determined based on the data obtained in the present study. Siphoviridae is the best-documented phage family, with more than 60 complete phage genomes sequenced. They were described among a large panel of bacteria including Gram-positive bacteria (Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus) and Gram-negative bacteria (in particular, Enterobacteriaceae members such as Escherichia coli) as well as Mycobacterium (44). Due to this large diversity, limited conclusions could be drawn regarding the H.\u00a0pylori phage biology based on the observation that it resembles a Siphoviridae phage.",

Although some H.\u00a0pylori positive strains may have been missed due to primer mispairing, the prevalence was higher than that previously observed by Thiberge et al. (39), where DNA hybridization based on three prophage CDSs was carried out. In fact, due to the genetic variability of the prophage CDSs, including the integrase gene, hybridization results may be skewed. Altogether, this does suggest that prophages are relatively widespread among H.\u00a0pylori strains; however, integrase-positive isolates may not carry complete prophages. To address this point, an extensive genome sequencing strategy based on H.\u00a0pylori prophage-positive strains is under way.",

However, no significant association was found between the presence of the integrase gene and specific H.\u00a0pylori gastroduodenal disease. This does not exclude the possible association of complete prophage sequences, or of specific prophage genes, with virulence. However, phylogenic analysis of the detected phage integrase gene showed a pattern of biogeographic separation. This is in agreement with a model of coevolution between the virus and its bacterial host, since biogeographic separation is also observed within H.\u00a0pylori. A model of geographically constrained viral dispersal also fits, i.e., H.\u00a0pylori strains from different geographical regions may have been infected by distinct phage lineages after the geographic separation of the bacterial host. Another hypothesis could be that after bacterial infection with the virus, the divergence of the bacterium is also accompanied by divergence of the integrated virus. The fact that the genetic content and organization of the B45 prophage are similar to those of H. acinonychis strain Sheeba prophage II is of particular interest. In fact, it has been argued that H. acinonychis strain Sheeba is derived from H.\u00a0pylori and that the prophage was acquired after the host jump from human to feline (22). Our study indicates that an equally likely scenario is that the prophage was present in the bacterial genome before the host jump.",

The B45 prophage is flanked on both sides by partial gene sequences corresponding to a type I R-M enzyme subunit. Indeed, R-M systems are often linked with mobile genetic elements, such as viruses. Examples of linkage between phages and restriction and R-M systems have already been described, i.e., HindIII on Phi-flue, Sau42I on phi-42, EcoO109I on P4-like prophage, and type I RM on a prophage annotated as a genomic island 5, among others (52, 53). This integration site is not conserved among Helicobacter prophages; the H. acinonychis strain Sheeba prophage II is integrated into a camphor resistance gene and carbamoylphosphate synthase small chain, while the B38 prophage is located between a hypothetical protein and cysteine-rich protein G. The integration of the prophage in the B45 genome does not seem to create any significant genome rearrangement, because the numbering of the flanking gene on each site is conserved when taking into account all reference genomes.",

This explains the sometimes fuzzy distinction between phages, plasmids, and pathogenicity islands (PAIs) and the chimeric nature of some phage genomes (55, 56). Nonetheless, several factors are typical of a PAI, like the cag PAI, which are not shared by the H.\u00a0pylori prophage: (i) GC content clearly different from that of the host, (ii) hot spot for IS, (iii) integration within an essential gene (glutamate racemase), (iv) encoding of a secretion machinery specific for effectors (type IV secretion system for cag), and (v) effector molecules (CagA and peptidoglycan) translocated into the host cell by a contact-dependent secretion system (57). The large CDSs in the middle of the B45 prophage have significant similarities to Hac_1615 (Hac_1615|-|Hac prophage II orf11|mosaic CUP0956/HP1116/jhp1044-like protein) and a JHP1044-like CDS in another part of the genome. Interestingly, JHP1044-like proteins have been described in an article aimed at identifying strain-specific genes located outside the plasticity zones of H.\u00a0pylori genomes (58). An exciting hypothesis would be that the plasticity zones, which are increasingly being considered true PAIs (13, 59), have a phage origin. This kind of association between phage and PAI has indeed already been described in other bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (60, 61).",

The role of phage lysin is to make the bacterial membrane more permeable, thus allowing the entry of the phage DNA. Lysin targets the integrity of the cell wall and is designed to attack one of the major bonds in the peptidoglycan. During the lytic cycle of phages, lysin also participates in bacterial lysis. With few exceptions, lysins do not have signal sequences, so they are not translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. When lysins are used as antimicrobial agents, they are believed to work only with Gram-positive bacteria, where they have access to the cell wall carbohydrates and can attack the peptidoglycan, whereas the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria prevents this interaction. However, the presence of the B45 phage carrying a putative lysin suggests that it may be possible to identify novel lytic enzymes for targeting Gram-negative bacteria (63, 64). These could potentially be engineered to lyse cells and be used as antimicrobial agents against H.\u00a0pylori, for example, and possibly delivered through liposomes (65).",

The high percentage of isolates carrying an integrase gene highlights the idea that prophages are underestimated in H.\u00a0pylori. It is possible that they shape the genome at least in terms of the diversity of strains found worldwide as well as contributing to virulence evolution. The high percentage of isolates carrying the integrase gene of a prophage strongly suggests its importance in the diversification and fitness of the genome architecture in H.\u00a0pylori. We previously published a paper in which we described the discovery of new sequences in the H.\u00a0pylori genome (66). One of our conclusions was that these new genes could correspond to bacteriophage receptor/invasion proteins. This highly speculative conclusion is further supported by the present study. We believe that the description of the B45 prophage is an important contribution that will aid future genome analysis in H.\u00a0pylori.",

To find optimal values for min_identity and min_length_ratio, as well as for the granularity parameter I of the MCL algorithm, simulations were run using only the reference H.\u00a0pylori proteomes. All combinations of a series of different values for the three parameters were run (min_identity: 50, 60, \u2026 90; min_length_ratio: 0.3, 0.4, \u2026 0.9; I: 1, 2, \u2026 5), and the combination rendering the largest number of clusters with exactly one protein per genome was selected. The rationale for this was that too-stringent criteria would likely split orthologous groups and produce groups lacking representatives in some genomes, while too-sloppy criteria would likely expand groups to also include paralogs and produce groups with multiple representatives in some genomes. The optimal conditions were found to be min_identity = 70, min_length_ratio = 0.5, and I = 1 (I had only minor effect compared to the other parameters). This parameter setting was then used for running the clustering procedure on all H.\u00a0pylori proteomes, including Hp_B45.",

The supernatant was gently decanted to a new tube. Four milliliters of phage precipitant (33% polyethylene glycol [PEG], 3 M NaCl) was added to the supernatant, followed by incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C. To pellet phage particles, a centrifugation step (10,000\u00a0rpm, 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C) was applied. The supernatant was gently discarded, and residual liquid was drained using a paper towel. The phage pellet was resuspended in 500\u00a0liters of phage buffer (150\u00a0mM NaCl, 40\u00a0mM Tris-HCl [pH\u00a07.4], and 10\u00a0mM MgSO4) and transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube for further processing.",

To ensure complete elimination of bacterial genomic DNA, the minipreparation was treated sequentially with two exonucleases and resuspended in the same volume of water to eliminate the enzymes (after heat inactivation and DNA precipitation). The enzymes used were (i) exonuclease I (E.\u00a0coli) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and (ii) lambda exonuclease (New England Biolabs) sequentially. The goal was to cut any genomic remnant DNA trace, whereas putative circular closed DNA (i.e., phage DNA) could not be degraded by any of these enzymes. The extracted DNA was then tested for the presence of phage DNA and bacterial genomic DNA by PCR amplification of the phage integrase gene (see below) and the cagA gene as already described (67, 70).",

For negative staining, Formvar membrane-covered 300-mesh copper grids were floated for 1 to 2\u00a0minutes on a small drop (10 \u03bcl) of the virus suspension for particle adsorption to the membrane. The grids with adsorbed particles were floated on a drop (50 \u03bcl) of aqueous 1% uranyl acetate in bidistilled water for 1\u00a0min and then transferred to a second similar droplet for 1 additional minute. In some preparations, additional samples were stained with 2% aqueous phosphotungstic acid using a similar procedure. Excess stain was drained with filter paper and then air dried. The resulting samples were observed using a JEOL 100SX electron microscope. For fixation embedding and sectioning, bacteria in suspension were prefixed in 0.2\u00a0mol/liter cacodylate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 5% glutaraldehyde (50/50 mixture with the culture medium) for 2\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 8,000\u00a0rpm for 3\u00a0minutes, bacteria were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide buffered in 0.1\u00a0mol/liter of cacodylate (pH 6.8) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature in the dark. Pellets were included in 1% agar and cut in small pieces (2\u00a0mm3), and specimens were dehydrated in an ethanol series (50%, 70%, 95%, 100%). Dehydration was completed in propylene oxide, and the specimens were embedded in epoxy resin (Epon 812; EMS, Hatfield, PA). The resin was polymerized at 60\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. The samples were sectioned using a diamond knife on an ultramicrotome (Ultracut-E; Leica Microsystems, Nanterre, France). Thin sections (70\u00a0nm) were picked up on copper grids and then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The grids were examined with a transmission electron microscope at 120\u00a0kV (H7650; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).",
