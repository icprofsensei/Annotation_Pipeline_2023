Disruption of electrolyte homeostasis at mucosal surfaces leads to severe lung, pancreatic, intestinal, hepatic, and reproductive abnormalities. Loss of lung function as a result of chronic lung disease is the primary cause of death from CF. Using high-throughput sequencing to survey microbes in the sputum of 16 CF patients and 9 control individuals, we identified diverse microbial communities in the healthy samples, contravening conventional wisdom that healthy airways are not significantly colonized. Comparing these communities with those from the CF patients revealed significant differences in microbial ecology, including differential representation of uncultivated phylotypes. Despite patient-specific differences, our analysis revealed a focal microbial profile characteristic of CF. The profile differentiated case and control groups even when classically recognized CF pathogens were excluded. As a control, lung explant tissues were also processed from a group of patients with pulmonary disease. The findings in lung tissue corroborated the presence of taxa identified in the sputum samples. Comparing the sequencing results with clinical data indicated that diminished microbial diversity is associated with severity of pulmonary inflammation within our adult CF cohort.",

A chronic, progressive process slowly destroys the airways, leading to severe lung dysfunction and death from respiratory failure (2\u20134). Treatment of CF pulmonary disease has focused on enhancing mobilization of secretions from the lower airway and the use of long-term antibiotic therapy to suppress bacterial activity at airway surfaces (1, 5). Paradoxically, antibiotic therapy often confers clinically detectable benefit even in the context of continuing infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms or with microbes that have established biofilms with minimum inhibitory concentrations far above the applied dose. This paradox was recognized in the clinical setting and has been difficult to reconcile with laboratory observations. Emerging hypotheses point to nontraditional mechanisms of antibiotic action at sublethal antibiotic concentrations (2, 6\u20138).",

Subsequent studies found higher incidences\u2014but incomplete penetrance\u2014of recognized CF pathogens in patients relative to pulmonary disease controls (14, 15), and a lower-resolution terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) study found a higher incidence of such pathogens in CF patients compared with healthy controls (14).",

Measures of microbial diversity within CF patient populations have been compared with patient genotype, clinical status, and prescribed therapies, but the strongest correlation found so far is that diversity within a given patient decreases over time (4, 19). A prejudice that healthy lungs are devoid of microbes, based largely on negative clinical culture results, has impaired testing of the alternative hypothesis that the major feature of pulmonary communities is not the presence of microbes generally but particular perturbations of normal pulmonary microbe communities. Notwithstanding molecular evidence of bacterial populations in the lungs of individuals not diagnosed with lung disease (20\u201322), few investigations that compare the microbial ecology of healthy and diseased airways have been made. Determination of the microbial communities that are resident in the lungs of both healthy control and disease subjects is necessary to gain insight into the pathogenesis of human pulmonary disease.",

We discovered a pervasive CF-specific profile and identified, in the CF pulmonary milieu, a subset of organisms (including but not limited to recognized CF pathogens) that associated strongly with CF and either survived or thrived under current paradigms of treatment. As a further control, we sequenced lung tissues explanted from CF and other patients (table S1) who were undergoing lung transplants and validated the rich microbial communities and taxa that constituted the CF microbiome in the sputum samples. The identification of a CF-specific microbial profile prompted us to test for and discover correlations between microbial ecology and clinical parameters.",

PCA is a mathematical method for transforming data into a new set of coordinates for exploring variation in high-dimensional data sets, displaying the variation in such data sets with lower dimensionality, and finding hidden (composite) variables. The new data coordinates (\u201cprincipal components\u201d) are linearly independent coordinates each chosen to describe the maximum degree of variation in the original data set, and are ordered by the amount of sample variation described. The first principal component is a coordinate freely chosen to ordinate (explain) the maximum possible variation in the original data set (expressed as a percentage of the total variation); the second coordinate is that which ordinates the most data set variation while being linearly independent from (that is, orthogonal to) all other principal components, and so on. Thus, a significant portion of the variation in a high-dimensional data set such as the abundances of a number of microbial taxa (dimensionality = no. of taxa) can be rendered for print in a small number of dimensions by plotting the data against the first few principal components (Fig. 2 shows two-dimensional plots of the first principal component versus the second and third principal components). The meaning of the principal components is understood by interpretation of their relationship to the plotted data and the original coordinates (microbial taxa in our case).",

The first principal component (PC1), which explained about one-third of the total variance in the data sets (inclusive of additional variance introduced by our resampling procedure), efficiently separated the healthy control and CF samples (Fig. 2A, upper plot, view separation of sample groups along PC1 axis in plot of PC1 versus PC2), indicating the presence of a stereotyped distinction between the control and the CF samples at the phylum level. The second PCA component, which represented one-fifth of the data set variance, described differences among the control samples (Fig. 2A, upper plot, view spread of control samples along PC2 axis in plot of PC1 versus PC2). The third component, which represented 14% of the data set variance, stratified both sample categories across exclusive regions of the graph (Fig. 2A, lower plot, view spread of control and CF samples along PC3 axis in separate regions of PC1 versus PC3 plot). By projecting the original data coordinates that corresponded to the microbial phyla as vectors on the PCA plots, we determined which microbial groups drove distinction among PCA-segregated subject groups. Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, TM7, SR1, Spirochaetes, and Tenericutes were associated with health, whereas Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and particularly Actinobacteria were associated with CF. The clustering of all 16 CF samples in one region of the PC1\u2013PC2 plot suggests the existence of a characteristic pulmonary microbiome for CF patients.",

Because some clinical metrics were strongly correlated with one another (see Materials and Methods and fig. S3), we computed indices that represented two underlying variables: inflammation and pulmonary function. A significant correlation between phylum-level diversity and inflammatory markers was found [r = 0.61 to 0.62, P = 0.02, where P is the probability that random data yield an equal or stronger correlation coefficient than observed in the data under test (|rrandom| \u2265 |robserved|); Fig. 3], but diversity did not correlate with pulmonary function in the present cohort. Clinical status is known to decline over a patient\u2019s lifetime and to correlate with reduced microbial diversity (4, 19). Our cohort was relatively uniform in age, such that the major differentiator was clinical status (or rate of clinical decline), not patient age per se. Nonetheless, we tested for correlation of age with microbial diversity and found positive but statistically insignificant values. Taxonomic diversity at the family level correlated less strongly with inflammation than did phylum-level diversity. This may indicate that functional diversity among microbes is the key variable related to patient clinical status rather than phylogenetic diversity.",

In this analysis, the samples from control subjects formed dispersed foci and remained distinct from one another, indicating that personalized pulmonary microbiomes exist in the healthy cohort. Markedly, all 1600 data points derived from the 16 CF patient samples collapsed within a confined region of the graph that was separate from the healthy control data points and exhibited an overall range similar to that found for individual control subjects. The cluster of CF data held even when the first three principal components, representing almost half the total data set variance (which includes intersubject biological variability and technical variability from the resampling procedure), were considered together (Fig. 2C).",

Families that contain the most-recognized CF pathogens associate with the CF group, including Pseudomonadaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Staphylococcaceae. Notably, the families Burkholderiaceae and Pasteurellaceae, which include species whose presence is known to correlate with poor clinical outcomes in CF, do not associate with the CF group. Only a small number of Burkholderiaceae sequences were found in total, and these sequences were inconsistent with the presence of Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC); BCC infection has been associated with morbidity and mortality in CF patients. Pasteurellaceae family members were more consistently represented in the control group than in the CF group, with the exception of the genus Haemophilus, which was found in both control and patient samples. Although the occurrence in control subjects of taxonomic families (such as Pasteurellaceae) that encompass known pulmonary pathogens is surprising, the Pasteurellaceae family includes not only pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae but also commensal organisms such as Actinobacillus indolicus, Lonepinella koalarum, and the capnophile (CO2-loving) Mannheimia succiniciproducens (27).",

The Micrococcaceae have the strongest disease association overall, with most of these sequences classified as Rothia and making strong hits to the sequenced genomes of two species, Rothia dentocariosa and Rothia mucilaginosa. Rothia spp. have been previously isolated from CF sputum samples (28) but are not generally considered to be pathogens characteristic of CF. The Micrococcaceae, which make up about 20% of the sequences we recovered from CF patients, constitute high-penetrance organisms that may worsen the pulmonary status of patients with CF. The abundance of these organisms is strongly and inversely correlated with the abundance of Pseudomonas spp. in our cohort [r = \u22120.56, P = 0.02, where P is the probability that random data yield an equal or stronger correlation coefficient than observed in the data under test (|rrandom| \u2265 |robserved|)]. Carnobacteriaceae, Aerococcaceae, and Lactobacillaceae also show strong associations with CF and should be investigated as agents of disease, as organisms whose growth may be favored by current paradigms of intervention in CF, and as possible targets for new therapies.",

Fusobacteriaceae and Leptotrichiaceae are known components of the human oral microbiota, but the sequences we sampled in sputum are most likely of pulmonary origin for the following reasons. First, it is known that the mixing of saliva with viscous sputum is limited (29), and induced sputum is an accepted method for pulmonary sampling (22, 29, 30). Second, compared to the control group, the prevalence of these microbial families is markedly diminished and, in many cases, entirely absent from the CF group, despite the use of identical sampling methods. Third, the quantities of microbial DNA recovered from the CF and control sputum samples were statistically indistinguishable (see Materials and Methods for details and table S4) and in line with quantities determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in explanted lung tissue samples (table S4). Fourth, the sputum samples from control and CF individuals shared a larger fraction of genera with each other than with saliva samples from two independent studies that used comparable methodology (fig. S4) (31, 32). The co-occurrence of 30 to 40 core genera between the oral and pulmonary samples was not surprising because colonization of the airway by oral taxa was observed previously (29). Fifth, a recent study demonstrated marked homogeneity of microbial communities found along the length of the respiratory tract, indicating that contamination of deep-origin sputum by transit through the upper respiratory tract is of minimal consequence (22). Finally, sequencing of 21 explanted lung samples from seven individuals corroborated both the richness of microbial taxa evidenced in the sputum samples and the correspondence between the microbial taxa found in sputum samples and the microbes present in the lungs themselves. In a concordance analysis for the presence and absence of microbial families, more than 85% concordance was found in the flora present in CF lung tissue and the sputum of CF patients and more than 82% concordance was found between microbial families scored in the control sputum samples and those scored in the lung tissue samples in our study (table S5).",

The community profiles in both subject groups were highly variable from one individual to another, although greater intersubject variability was found in the control cohort. Some of the most marked findings in this study are commonalities identified among the CF sputum samples, best visualized in the family-level PCA (Fig. 2, B and C). In this analysis, the cluster containing 16 CF samples is highly focused in one region of the graph, with all the samples overlapped with one another (indicating statistical congruence), even when considering the first three principal components (Fig. 2C), which together describe nearly half of the total variance in the analysis.",

At the phylum level, the third principal component stratified CF patients along a Firmicutes-Proteobacteria axis (Fig. 2A); such differences in microbial communities between patients are likely to have clinical significance. From the PCA, it is also clear that the CF signature is not determined by one or two pathogenic species. Instead, the signature consists of the presence or increased abundance of more than half a dozen microbial families and the absence or decreased abundance of many other microbial families compared with healthy controls. Thus, the signature is that of a defined but complex microbial community characteristic of CF patients, including groups not routinely detected or analyzed in clinical culture.",

For instance, the ratio of Veillonellaceae to Micrococcaceae was much higher in controls than in CF cases, even though neither family contains widely recognized CF pathogens; the CF and control groups were completely separated on the basis of this metric, with values roughly greater than 1 characterizing the control group and values less than 1 characterizing the CF group (Fig. 2D). The ability to stratify the disease and control groups based on these taxa could form the basis of new molecular diagnostic tests. The ability to do so based on taxa not routinely monitored in the clinic suggests that there is much to learn about the ecology of pulmonary microbial communities and that this knowledge is likely to inform treatment of CF patients. On the other hand, pathogenic taxa that are unmonitored in the clinic might resist nonspecific antimicrobial therapies, exhibit virulence, and contribute to disease. The lungs of CF patients show infection and inflammation; thus, it is also possible that taxa absent from the CF samples and present in the control samples have the job of protecting the pulmonary system, similar to the role played by protective microbial species identified in the gut (33\u201336) wherein commensal organisms inhibit pathogen outgrowth, expression of virulence genes, or inflammation. Such protective communities could be displaced by pathogens in the CF airways or selected against as a result of prolonged antibiotic therapy. Negative correlations between microbial community diversity and pathogen growth are known in model CF communities (37).",

Although it is possible that antibiotic treatment accounts for the lower diversity we observed in the lungs of CF patients, there are several reasons to consider this hypothesis unlikely. On the basis of the findings reported in the literature, patterns of response to prolonged antibiotic treatment in the lung appear to differ significantly compared with the responses in the gut to episodic antibiotic administration (38\u201342, 44). Because many CF patients are treated on an ongoing basis with multiple antibiotics that often have long half-lives and accumulate to high concentrations in lung tissue, changes to microbial community structure in response to additional antibiotic treatments may be muted. Evidence suggests that the clinical benefits that arise from subsequent additional antibiotic treatments do not result from the elimination of pathogenic bacterial populations but rather from noncanonical modes of action against pathogens such as suppression of virulence (47\u201349) or direct anti-inflammatory activity of the antibiotic compounds (50\u201352).",

Sputum samples transit the upper respiratory system during collection; however, the high viscosity of sputum minimizes its mixing with fluids in the upper respiratory tract (for example, saliva) (29). On the other hand, the upper respiratory system is contiguous with the lung, and its microbial consortia possibly affects the etiology of CF. Temporal variation in mucus properties and the geography of production inside the lung could affect the geography and efficiency (cells per milliliter of sputum vis-\u00e0-vis cells per gram of lung tissue) of sampling.",

We chose sequencing of the V4/V5 region of the 16S gene on the 454 Titanium platform over alternative methods including 16S gene clone sequencing (12, 14, 15), temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (11), length heterogeneity PCR (10), T-RFLP analysis (12, 13, 62), and microarray approaches such as the Phylochip (19) for a variety of reasons. Although full-length 16S gene sequences are routinely obtained when sequencing clones and aid phylogenetic assignment at high resolution, V4/V5 sequences can be classified with very high confidence at lower levels of phylogenetic resolution (64, 65). All of these methods are subject to biases introduced at early steps including DNA extraction and PCR amplification and during the preparation of sequencing libraries and the sequencing procedures. Specific procedures can be established to minimize these biases and should be regularized across samples such that intersample analyses detect sample-dependent rather than procedural variation (the differences in primers and sequencing platform between sputum and lung explant samples are the reasons we limit the comparison of the disparate sample types to presence/absence).Molecular bar coding and large sample sets are necessary to reduce per-sample costs in high-throughput screening, and accurate library quantification (59) is critical to obtain adequate representation of all the samples.",

Sequence reads with hits were omitted from subsequent analyses. The results were insensitive to moderate changes in the parameter values. Custom code that was run in the Matlab (MathWorks) environment was used to check for and trim primer sequences and eliminate 454 reads shorter than 150 bases. To compare with a more stringent filtering procedure, we alternatively filtered 454 reads from selected samples in the MOTHUR environment for quality, alignment frame (perfect start required against the curated Silva bacterial database), maximum homopolymer size (no greater than 8), the absence of ambiguous bases, and chimeras (chimera slayer algorithm) after removal of human sequences. Although some additional sequences were removed, the resulting distribution of sequence classifications was not significantly altered, indicating the use of classification confidence filtering (indicated as Classification, below) in rejecting problematic sequences from the classification results. PGM reads representing the explant samples were filtered similarly in the MOTHUR environment, but with a minimum length requirement of 125 bp rather than 150 bp, and without the chimera removal step. PGM reads (317,081) remained after these filtering steps, with the 125-bp requirement dominating the attrition of reads.",

The results were relatively insensitive to variation of the \u201cconfidence level\u201d parameter between 50 and 80% at these levels of phylogenetic resolution.

Taxa with overall occurrence greater than 0.03% or representation of at least 0.01% in three or more samples were included (12 phyla, 41 families). For each sample, 1000 read classifications were sampled 100 times with replacement. This type of subsampling is commonly used to empirically describe the statistics of a given data set.
