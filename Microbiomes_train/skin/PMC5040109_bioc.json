To do this effectively, an understanding of how microbes survive in vivo is needed. Though much can be inferred from bulk approaches to characterizing complex environments, essential information can be lost if spatial organization is not preserved. Here, we introduce a tissue-clearing technique, termed MiPACT, designed to retain and visualize bacteria with associated proteins and nucleic acids in situ on various spatial scales. By coupling MiPACT with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to detect rRNA in sputum samples from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, we demonstrate its ability to survey thousands of bacteria (or bacterial aggregates) over millimeter scales and quantify aggregation of individual species in polymicrobial communities. By analyzing aggregation patterns of four prominent CF pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sp., and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, we demonstrate a spectrum of aggregation states: from mostly single cells (A.\u00a0xylosoxidans), to medium-sized clusters (S.\u00a0aureus), to a mixture of single cells and large aggregates (P.\u00a0aeruginosa and Streptococcus sp.). Furthermore, MiPACT-HCR revealed an intimate interaction between Streptococcus sp. and specific host cells. Lastly, by comparing standard rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization signals to those from HCR, we found that different populations of S.\u00a0aureus and A.\u00a0xylosoxidans grow slowly overall yet exhibit growth rate heterogeneity over hundreds of microns. These results demonstrate the utility of MiPACT-HCR to directly capture the spatial organization and metabolic activity of bacteria in complex systems, such as human sputum.",

Here, we demonstrate the power of an enhanced optical clearing method, MiPACT, to survey important aspects of bacterial physiology (aggregation, host interactions, and growth rate), in situ, with preserved spatial information when coupled to rRNA detection by HCR. Our application of MiPACT-HCR to cystic fibrosis patient sputum revealed species-specific aggregation patterns, yet slow growth characterized the vast majority of bacterial cells regardless of their cell type. More broadly, MiPACT, coupled with fluorescent labeling, promises to advance the direct study of microbial communities in diverse environments, including microbial habitats within mammalian systems.",

In all of these cases, the relationship between microbial and host cells is influenced by the features of the microenvironment, which change over time and can be challenging to measure. Nevertheless, it is essential to characterize the nature of these important associations if we seek to understand and/or control them. Spatial organization is a defining parameter in any environment, and it is likely that by impacting bacterium-bacterium or bacterium-host associations, or by creating gradients of nutrients or toxins that affect bacterial growth rates, spatial organization affects bacterial survival (4). The current toolset for understanding microbial communities associated with animal host environments provides limited spatial information (e.g., thin sectioning) (5,\u20137) or lacks it entirely (bulk measurement of abundance, via metagenomics and transcriptomics) (8,\u201310). Building upon a tissue-embedding and clearing technique, the passive clarity technique (PACT) (11,\u201313), we developed MiPACT (microbial identification after PACT) to permit the study of diverse bacterial pathogens residing in cystic fibrosis patient sputum. While PACT preserves spatial and molecular information and allows for efficient clearing as well as protein and transcript labeling via use of fluorescent probes, we incorporated key modifications to ensure (i) stabilization of amorphous sputum samples, (ii) high retention of bacteria, and (iii) efficient labeling of bacterial rRNA via hybridization chain reaction (HCR) (14, 15) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Though developed in the context of CF, MiPACT-HCR can be readily applied to diverse host-microbe systems.",

Sputum buildup and the resultant chronic infections lead to severe lung damage and eventual respiratory failure (17). CF patients routinely expectorate infected sputum, which provides tractable samples for in situ analysis of pathogens (6, 18, 19). Until recently, Pseudomonas\u00a0aeruginosa was the most prevalent pathogen isolated from CF patients, and P.\u00a0aeruginosa colonization is well known to correlate with disease progression in CF (16, 20, 21). Therefore, the majority of studies addressing the biogeography of CF have focused on P.\u00a0aeruginosa. FISH analysis of thin sections of CF lung or smears of CF sputum have revealed that P.\u00a0aeruginosa can exist both as single cells and in large clusters and that P.\u00a0aeruginosa grows more slowly in situ than in typical laboratory cultures (6, 7).",

Indeed, culture-independent studies have revealed that individuals harbor a distinct microbial ecosystem whose species composition can vary over time and treatment regimens (10, 22). Though recent studies have attempted to gain a perspective on the distribution of particular clone types as a function of lung geography, these studies have been herculean, requiring microdissection, cultivation, and sequencing of thousands of regional isolates (5, 19, 23). Recognizing the need to study CF pathogens in situ to gain information relevant to the design of accurate in vitro models, we sought a method that would permit rapid scanning of large spatial areas at various magnifications, as well as one that would permit microbial identification and study at the single-cell level. Here, we describe our usage of MiPACT-HCR to study three important attributes of diverse pathogens in CF sputum: aggregation patterns, bacterium-host interactions, and growth rates.",

To provide more structural stability, we replaced acrylamide with 4% 29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (29A:1B)4P0, providing additional cross-linking (Fig.\u00a01a). Use of (29A:1B)4P0 preserved sputum integrity and allowed for clearance in SDS (Fig.\u00a01b). Samples took 3 to 14\u00a0days to fully clear (Fig.\u00a01b). Because sputum is composed largely of host-derived DNA and mucins (24), we labeled DNA with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mucins with rhodamine-conjugated lectin (wheat germ agglutinin [WGA]) after clearing to obtain a structural context. Imaging revealed a high degree of compositional variation between samples (Fig.\u00a01c). For example, sputum samples from patients 1 and 2 were composed largely of lectin-stained mucin, with interspersed DAPI-bright host cells. Sputum 5 was composed almost entirely of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), consistent with findings that PMNs are a major component of CF patient sputum (25). PMN cell boundaries were outlined by a network of extracellular DNA (Fig.\u00a01d), potentially a result of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (26). While intersample heterogeneity was evident, sampling different regions of a single sputum sample revealed that intrasample composition was relatively homogenous (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material).",

There was no significant loss of DAPI-stained logarithmic- or stationary-phase bacteria after clearing of pure cultures embedded in (29A:1B)4P0 hydrogel blocks (see Fig.\u00a0S2a in the supplemental material). FISH staining with saturating probe concentrations of the universal bacterial probe EUB338 after MiPACT (see Fig.\u00a0S3a in the supplemental material) revealed that the Gram-positive microbe S.\u00a0aureus required treatment with lysostaphin after clearing via SDS, while the Gram-negative P.\u00a0aeruginosa did not require lysozyme treatment (see Fig.\u00a0S3b). In sputum, autofluorescence makes bacteria, particularly slowly growing cells, difficult to demarcate by FISH (see Fig.\u00a0S4 in the supplemental material). Therefore, we employed HCR, a FISH amplifying technique which has previously been used to fluorescently label RNA in zebrafish embryos, brain tissue, and environmental microbes (15, 27, 56). HCR entails hybridizing target RNA with a DNA probe that triggers amplification of fluorescently labeled DNA hairpins into polymer chains via a specific initiator region (14, 15). To directly compare FISH and HCR, FISH with a dilabeled AlexaFluor 594 EUB338 probe and HCR with an initiator EUB338 probe and AlexaFluor 594 hairpins were performed separately on stationary-phase cultured cells embedded in (29A:1B)4P0 and cleared for 5\u00a0days. HCR increased the average fluorescence intensity of P.\u00a0aeruginosa cells by ~68-fold and S.\u00a0aureus cells by ~42-fold above levels obtained with FISH.",

Some species-specific probes tested, including those specific for A.\u00a0xylosoxidans, were excluded due to their inability to withstand the stringent hybridization and wash conditions necessary for HCR specificity (see Materials and Methods). Object-based colocalization analysis after HCR multiplexing was performed to further validate HCR specificity. Greater than 90% of objects (discrete HCR-identified cells or aggregates with a size of >4 voxels) in sputum were concurrently identified by using two separate universal probes (see Fig.\u00a0S6). Moreover, >90% of objects identified by the class/genus-specific probes used in sputum colocalized with EUB338 but not with other class/genus-specific probes (see Fig.\u00a0S6).

                    "text": "Once optimized for retention and identification of bacteria in sputum, we utilized MiPACT-HCR to measure bacterial aggregation in situ. Bacterial aggregates are thought to contribute to the persistence of pathogen populations in chronic infections, including those in CF patients (1, 28,\u201330), yet direct evidence for this is sparse (6, 19, 31). We examined distribution patterns of Staphylococcus sp. in sputum sample 5.1 (culture positive for S.\u00a0aureus and A.\u00a0xylosoxidans) by using a Staphylococcus-specific probe. Cultured bacteria were analyzed in parallel with magnification \u00d725 sputum surveys to calibrate our expectations for the signal size of single bacterial cells (see Fig.\u00a0S7 in the supplemental material). The mean fluorescence volume of objects in stationary-phase cultures of S.\u00a0aureus was 12.1\u00a0\u00b5m3. In sputum, Staphylococcus cells existed in a range of intermediate aggregates, with only 6% of objects being greater than 1,000\u00a0\u00b5m3 (see Fig.\u00a0S7a). The Staphylococcus size distribution in sputum cleared for 5 or 14\u00a0days was similar, signifying that clearing preserves a range of bacterial aggregate sizes (see Fig.\u00a0S2b in the supplemental material). Taking advantage of the large-scale surveying enabled by MiPACT, we next acquired \u00d710 magnification Z-stacks of sputum sample 5.1, analyzing thousands of objects in sputum volumes of ~0.1 to 0.3\u00a0mm3. Like the \u00d725 magnification surveys, Z-stacks at \u00d710 magnification revealed that Staphylococcus was chiefly visible as small to medium aggregates (85% of objects ranged in size from 50 to 1,000\u00a0\u00b5m3) (see Fig.\u00a02a and S7a). In contrast, Betaproteobacteria showed very little aggregation; 71% of objects fell in the smallest bin (<50\u00a0\u00b5m3) (Fig.\u00a02b; see also Fig. S7b in the supplemental material). Because S.\u00a0aureus is the most common pathogen cultured from CF patients (21), we monitored aggregation in samples from three distinct areas of sputum 5 (5.1A, 5.1B, and 5.1C) (see Fig.\u00a0S8a in the supplemental material). Also, three temporal samples from patient 5 (5.1, 5.2 [103\u00a0days after 5.1], and 5.3 [1 day after 5.2]) and a sample from patient 4, also culture positive for S.\u00a0aureus, were analyzed. All samples demonstrated a similar pattern of small- to medium-sized aggregates (see Fig.\u00a0S8b). Next, we took advantage of the straightforward multiplexing enabled by HCR (15) to concurrently probe Betaproteobacteria and Staphylococcus sp. in different regions of sputum 5.1 (see Fig.\u00a0S9 in the supplemental material). Both were present in all areas of sputum 5.1 tested, but their relative abundance differed between regions (see Fig.\u00a0S9).",

While surveying sputum sample 1 with the EUB338 probe, we unexpectedly found bacteria with a distinctive filamentous morphology. Patient 1 had previously produced a sputum sample that was culture positive for Streptococcus anginosus, and probing sputum 1 with a Streptococcus-specific probe mixture revealed a dense bacterial population (Fig.\u00a02d). The largest proportion of Streptococcus signal volume (which ranged from ~10 to 300,000\u00a0\u00b5m3 at \u00d710 magnification) came from large (>1,000\u00a0\u00b5m3) aggregates (Fig.\u00a02d).

After performing \u00d710 surveys in sputum, we focused on large bacterial aggregates with a 25\u00d7 objective (Fig.\u00a03). Multiplexing of sputum 1 for both Streptococcus and Pseudomonas revealed that aggregates were mostly monospecies, with little visible interaction (Fig.\u00a03a). Pseudomonas aggregates existed in a range of sizes, with large biofilms having diameters up to ~50\u00a0\u00b5m (Fig.\u00a03b). PMNs could be seen surrounding, and in some cases within, the biofilm structure (Fig.\u00a03b). With finer resolution, it became apparent that the large Streptococcus aggregates visible at \u00d710 had morphologies indicative of association with an interior substrate (Fig.\u00a03c and \u200bandd).d). To determine the substrate, we stained samples of sputum 1 with DAPI and WGA after HCR with Streptococcus-specific probes. Staining revealed that the areas inside Streptococcus aggregates were in fact host cells with single-lobed nuclei (Fig.\u00a03d). Each host cell boundary stained brightly with WGA, potentially indicative of polysaccharide moieties on the host cell surface (Fig.\u00a03d and \u200bande).e). These results exemplify the ability of MiPACT-HCR to identify novel bacterium-host interactions.",

Recent studies demonstrated slow in situ S.\u00a0aureus growth rates in CF sputum (35) and slow-growth-specific regulation networks in P.\u00a0aeruginosa (36), underscoring the importance of careful growth measurements in situ for designing in vitro models that faithfully recapitulate in vivo physiology. Many species show a linear relationship between growth rate and rRNA abundance (37), but a number of challenges impede the calculation of precise growth rates in sputum from FISH data alone: rRNA abundance can be completely decoupled from growth rate in some species (37), at low growth rates rRNA abundance ceases to linearly correlate with growth rate (7), and sputum autofluorescence can overwhelm signals from slowly growing cells (see Fig.\u00a0S4 in the supplemental material). To address these problems, we refrained from estimating specific growth rates of individual cells, instead opting to describe the growth rates of bacterial populations with respect to logarithmic- and stationary-phase standards, analyzed in parallel. We first verified that the FISH signal of both S.\u00a0aureus and A.\u00a0xylosoxidans decreased in stationary phase (see Fig.\u00a0S10a in the supplemental material). We then determined that FISH signal from logarithmic cells did not substantially decay even after 14\u00a0days of clearing (see Fig.\u00a0S10b). Lastly, we used HCR to distinguish bacterial signals from background autofluorescence and to select for the desired genus in a mixed population. For analysis, HCR-identified objects were outlined and EUB338 FISH fluorescence (the proxy for growth rate) within the outlines was quantified (Fig.\u00a04a). EUB338 was chosen as the FISH probe due to its robustness and hybridization to a separate rRNA locus, preventing probe competition.",

We then calculated the percentage of objects that crossed a threshold above which 90% of logarithmic-phase cultured cells fell (corresponding to a doubling time of \u22481\u00a0h). Regions 5.1A1, 5.1B1, and 5.1C1 demonstrated mostly low growth rates, with 0%, 4.3%, and 0.2% of objects reaching signal threshold (Fig.\u00a04c). Interestingly, subsample 5.1C2 demonstrated an increase in growth rate compared to its neighbors, with 20.8%, of objects reaching threshold (no objects in 5.1A2 and 7.0% of objects in 5.1B2 reached threshold) (Fig.\u00a04d). Temporal samples from patient 5 (sputum samples 5.2 and 5.3) did not reach threshold (Fig.\u00a04e). Samples 4A and -B and -C, from a different S.\u00a0aureus culture-positive patient, contained slowly growing bacteria as well, with only 2.7%, 4.1%, and 2.0% of objects, respectively, above threshold (Fig.\u00a04f). In order to determine if aggregate size correlated with our proxy for growth rate, we separated S.\u00a0aureus objects (from Fig.\u00a04c to \u200btof)f) into quartiles with respect to object size and plotted against mean fluorescence intensity from FISH. Fluorescence intensity increased significantly with increasing object size, signifying that larger aggregates may have experienced higher growth rates (see Fig.\u00a0S10c and d in the supplemental material). This was possibly due to the greater susceptibility of single cells to antibiotics (34). Interestingly, cultured, planktonic S.\u00a0aureus cells also showed a positive correlation between object size and fluorescence intensity (see Fig.\u00a0S10e). This is consistent with previous studies showing that RNA abundance and cell size increase with higher growth rates (38). Further study would be needed to determine what, if any, correlation exists between aggregate size and cell size in situ.",

In our CF patient sputum samples, P.\u00a0aeruginosa, Streptococcus sp., A.\u00a0xylosoxidans, and S.\u00a0aureus aggregation patterns varied, suggesting that broader, species-specific cellular interaction trends occur in vivo. Our results also reinforced that in vivo CF pathogen aggregates, particularly in regards to S.\u00a0aureus and A.\u00a0xylosoxidans, are considerably smaller than typical laboratory biofilms (34), an important observation when attempting to model biofilms for this context in the laboratory. We have also demonstrated that MiPACT-HCR, in combination with FISH, provides an accessible method for assessing growth rates in situ. Using this strategy, we found low growth rates for S.\u00a0aureus and A.\u00a0xylosoxidans, consistent with the few in situ measurements existing for these CF pathogens (6, 7, 35). While most of the populations surveyed were slow growers, there were pockets of relatively fast growth, illustrating the heterogeneity in in vivo growth rates that is beginning to be described in the literature (35). Indeed, due to concomitant expectoration of sputum plugs from different airways, and from the gradients of nutrients and oxygen existing with various sputum plug geometries (18), heterogeneity within the same expectorated sample is expected. Furthermore, particular sputum environments may favor one bacterial species or another, leading to the compositional heterogeneity that we observed in the same sputum sample.",

All images and Z-stacks were collected in 12-bit mode, with at least a 1,024-by-1,024 scan format and a line averaging of 2. Image reconstructions were made with Imaris imaging software (Bitplane) or the FIJI distribution of ImageJ (39, 40). Image analysis was chiefly performed using the 3D object counter plug-in (41) in FIJI to identify and quantify fluorescently labeled objects. The R package was used to make box plots and for t\u00a0test analysis (42).",

All HCR for growth rate measurements was performed with hairpins conjugated to Alexafluor488. After the typical HCR hairpin wash, all samples were hybridized with EUB338 di-labeled with CY5 in 25% formamide for 24\u00a0h. Samples were then washed in 84\u00a0mM FISH wash buffer for 3\u00a0h at 48\u00b0C in a water bath with no shaking. Samples were incubated with RIMS/DAPI for at least 24\u00a0h at RT with gentle shaking before imaging. During image acquisition, laser power and gain settings were adjusted for each sample in the HCR channel (Alexafluor488) so that the brightest objects were just below saturation. Laser power and gain settings for the FISH channel (CY5) were adjusted for so that the brightest objects in logarithmic phase culture standards were just below saturation. Once adjusted for logarithmic standards, the FISH settings were kept constant for the stationary-phase standard and for all sputum samples. For image analysis, the 3D object counter from ImageJ was used to perform segmentation from the HCR channel. The redirect option was used to measure fluorescence of each HCR-identified object in the FISH channel. The threshold and minimum size settings in 3D object counter were kept constant for all samples in a set. Objects were binned by average fluorescence intensity, and then the relative frequency of each bin was calculated by dividing the number of objects in each bin by the total number of objects for each sample. Histograms were then created from the relative frequency of each bin.",

(A) Optical density of S.\u00a0aureus and A.\u00a0xylosoxidans cultures for growth curves plotted with the integrated density of cell fluorescence obtained by FISH with a EUB338 probe dilabeled with Cy3 from culture samples taken at each point along the growth curve. Error bars represent standard errors. For A.\u00a0xylosoxidans, sample sizes from the earliest time point (5.5\u00a0h) to the last time point (30.5\u00a0h) were 78, 150, 465, 1,276, 1,504, and 1,303 cells, respectively. For S.\u00a0aureus, sample sizes from the earliest time point (4\u00a0h) to the last time point (29\u00a0h) were 318, 954, 795, 1,139, 2,738, 395, and 193 cells, respectively. (B) Average fluorescence intensity shown for S.\u00a0aureus logarithmic cultures cleared for 5\u00a0days (used as the standard in growth rate experiments) and 14\u00a0days, compared to S.\u00a0aureus stationary-phase cultures cleared for 5\u00a0days (used as the standard in growth rate experiments). Growth rate measurements were performed as described for Fig.\u00a04, with a STA3 HCR probe and hairpins conjugated to AlexaFluor 488, and a EUB338 FISH probe conjugated to Cy5. (C) All 6,757 STA3-positive objects that were analyzed from sputum samples 4, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 (Fig.\u00a04) were broken up into quartiles by object size and graphed on a scatterplot of object size versus average fluorescence intensity. Box plots show average fluorescence intensity of the four quartiles for sputum samples (D) and for stationary-phase cultured S.\u00a0aureus cells (E). A Welch\u2019s two sample t\u00a0test was applied to each adjacent quartile pair for both plots. Quartile 2 had a significantly increased average fluorescent intensity compared to quartile 1 (P < 2.2e\u221216 [D]; P = 1.2e\u22125 [E]), quartile 3 had a significantly increased average fluorescent intensity compared to quartile 2 (P < 1.2e\u221213 [D], P < 2.2e\u221216 [E]), and quartile 4 had a significantly increased average fluorescent intensity compared to quartile 3 (P < 2.2e\u221216 [D]; P < 2.2e\u221216 [E]). Plotting and analyses for the results shown in panels C, D, and E were performed in R. Download ",
