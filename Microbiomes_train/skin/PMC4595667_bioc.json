Although the pathogenesis of small airway obstruction and emphysematous destruction responsible for the progressive airflow limitation in COPD has been associated with the host innate and adaptive inflammatory immune response (2\u20134), the antigens that drive this response remain poorly understood. The British hypothesis, that smoking compromises the host response, allowing colonization and infection of the lower respiratory tract by organisms that cause chronic bronchitis and a decline in FEV1, has been rejected on the basis of a prospective longitudinal study conducted by Fletcher and associates (5). This study showed that many people with chronic bronchitis never developed airflow limitations and that many others developed severe airway obstruction in the absence of chronic bronchitis (5, 6). Sethi, Murphy, and colleagues reawakened interest in the possible role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of COPD by showing that acute exacerbations of COPD were commonly associated with the emergence of new bacterial strains that could be isolated from the sputum and protected bronchial brushings (7). Moreover, Hurst and associates extended these observations by showing that frequent exacerbations of COPD within the same individual are associated with an accelerated rate of decline in lung function leading to COPD (8).",

In contrast, the long-held view that the lung was sterile below the larynx persisted until Hilty and associates (13) used these techniques to challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the microbiome in bronchial brushings and washings from human lungs. Their new data suggested that lower airways of patients with asthma and COPD contained a microbiome that became less diverse and was associated with the emergence of potential pathogens (13). These results were criticized as artifact produced by contamination of the bronchial brushings and washing as they passed through the upper airways. This criticism was refuted by Erb-Downward and colleagues (14) and Sze and colleagues (15) in studies that demonstrated a human lung microbiome in samples obtained either by brushing the airways of explanted lungs where the upper airways were absent (14) or by rapidly freezing the explanted lung solid to allow peripheral lung samples to be removed without disturbing the central airways (15). The present report extends these observations by examining the microbiome in relation to emphysematous destruction of the lung surface and providing preliminary evidence that this destruction is associated with the development of a host immune response to this microbiome. Some of the results of these studies have been previously reported in the form of abstracts (16\u201319).",

If an OTU was significantly different between these two groups and matched the direction of correlation found in the phyla analysis, it was considered a potentially important OTU. In addition, OTUs identified by Boruta feature selection (30) after random forest analysis, as discriminative for control and GOLD stage 4, were also analyzed using linear mixed-effect models and compared with microCT, quantitative histology, and gene expression data.

These comparisons show that Shannon diversity is negatively related to CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration and also that Shannon diversity was positively correlated to lung surface area. OTU richness was also negatively correlated with CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration. Further analysis shows that neutrophil infiltration was negatively associated with the presence of Proteobacteria, Comamonadaceae, Pseudomonas, and Betaproteobacteria OTUs (Tables 2 and \u200band3).3). In addition, it also shows that eosinophil infiltration and elastin content were positively associated with Actinobacteria OTUs and B-cell infiltration with Propionibacterium, Micrococcaceae, and Atopobium OTUs.",

We identified 859 genes whose expression was associated with the presence of bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum at an FDR cutoff of less than 0.1 (Table E6). DAVID analysis indicated that the down-regulated genes were involved mostly with zinc finger domain regions (FDR\u2009<\u20092.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210), whereas the up-regulated genes were involved in pathways with disulfide bonding, signal peptides, membrane, and defense response (FDR\u2009<\u20092\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123). This finding does not change if an FDR cutoff of 0.05 is used instead of 0.10 (data not shown). In addition, Proteobacteria were associated with 235 genes below an FDR of 0.1 (Table E6). No pathways were identified from the down-regulated genes, but the up-regulated genes were involved in pathways for splicing, cilium, cell projection, and cell\u2013cell junctions (FDR\u2009<\u20090.1). When the most important predictive bacterial OTUs were analyzed for a correlation with human host gene expression only H. influenzae was associated with a single gene below an FDR cutoff of 0.1 (C21orf51, FDR\u2009=\u20090.05). The GSEA analysis comparing host gene expression versus the microbiome from protocol 2 with those reported here from protocol 1 shows that the same genes were up- and down-regulated in relation to Shannon diversity and OTU richness (Tables E5 and E7, and Figures E4 and E5).",

They also extend these observations by showing that both a touchdown PCR (protocol 1) used to amplify the V3\u2013V5 region and nested PCR (protocol 2) used to amplify the V1\u2013V3 region of the same bacterial 16S rRNA gene showed a decline in OTU richness in association with emphysematous destruction of the lung surface (Figure 1A and Figure E1A). Both methods also showed differences in the microbial community composition between control lung tissue and tissue from patients with GOLD stage 4 COPD (Figure 1B and Figure E1B). In addition, they confirm and extend earlier reports (13) by showing (Figure 2) that both the Proteobacteria and to a lesser extent the Actinobacteria expand in COPD compared with controls whereas the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla contract as the alveolar surface is being destroyed by emphysema in lungs affected by COPD. Most importantly they show that these changes produce a measureable host response in lung tissue.",

Therefore it is a concern that some of the OTUs identified as important by the random forest analysis in this study (noticeably Flavobacterium and Streptococcus) also do not align to genera identified as potential contaminants (33). Even though the negative controls included with our samples showed these same OTUs were either absent or greatly reduced in our negative control samples (Figures E2 and E3), we cannot conclusively rule out contamination as playing a role in some of the bacteria identified (e.g., Flavobacterium, E. meningoseptica, and Dialister). Therefore these findings need to be interpreted with caution until more precise methods of ruling out contaminating organisms are developed.",

                    "text": "A random forest analysis showed (Figure 2B) that the OTUs best able to distinguish between lung tissue from control subjects and patients with severe GOLD stage 4 COPD had both positive and negative effects. For example, H. influenzae was observed to be virtually absent in very severe GOLD stage 4 COPD and to increase in association with the numbers of terminal bronchioles seen in the milder forms of COPD. This could suggest a protective phenomenon that has been previously demonstrated in mice, where simultaneous inoculation of H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae onto the upper respiratory mucosal surface showed that H. influenzae out-competes S. pneumoniae for the mucosal surface by inducing a host response that brings in neutrophils to destroy the S. pneumoniae (34). These observations suggest the hypothesis that H. influenzae is capable of causing infection and producing acute exacerbations in the early stages of COPD (7). Moreover, it is also consistent with the hypothesis that the decline in terminal bronchioles and increase in emphysematous destruction associated with progression of COPD destroys the habitat that favored the emergence of H. influenzae and allows a different set of microbes to emerge, colonize, and infect lung tissue in late-stage COPD. In addition, the tissue vacated by H. influenzae might provide a niche for certain exotic bacteria, such as E. meningoseptica, that correlate with the inflammatory immune cell infiltration and tissue remodeling that correlate with progression of COPD in this study. However, additional studies that take into account all of the reported corrections for contamination will need to be performed to get the best description of the host response to the microbiome in COPD.",

For example, the expanded Proteobacteria phylum (Figure 2) contributed all five of the individual OTUs associated with neutrophil infiltration and one of four of the OTUs associated with B-cell infiltration (Tables 2 and \u200band3).3). The smaller expansion of the Actinobacteria phylum contributed three of four OTUs associated with B-cell infiltration as well as a strong association with eosinophil infiltration. In contrast, the Firmicutes phylum did not contain any OTUs associated with specific responses, and the Bacteroidetes phylum contained only E. meningoseptica that helped separate the control from the GOLD stage 4 COPD cases. Collectively, these data suggest that OTUs located within the phyla that expand as the alveolar surface is destroyed stimulate the host response to a greater degree than OTUs in the phyla that contract. Moreover, they suggest the hypothesis that the organisms that compete successfully for the contracting bronchiolar and alveolar surface are recognized by the host immune surveillance system, which normally does not respond to the bacterial microbiome of the lung.",

Moreover, the GSEA analysis showed that many of the bacteria associated with changes in host genes were directionally the same using both protocol 1 and protocol 2. In addition, the analysis of protocol 2 based on DAVID showed that Shannon diversity was positively associated with genes in the dynein, coiled coil, cilium, and microtubule motor activity pathways (FDR\u2009<\u20090.0004) required to clear the mucosal surface. On the other hand, a negative association existed between Shannon diversity and gene expression involving genes in the immunoglobulin, glycoprotein, and Fc \u03b3 receptor III pathways (Table E7), which are related to the immune response.",

On the basis of these findings we postulate that the persistent low-level inflammatory immune response that has been associated with the progression of COPD (4) is primarily driven by OTUs from within the phyla that expand on a diminishing bronchiolar and alveolar surface with progression of COPD (21). Furthermore, we suggest that the milieu created by these changes allows particular OTUs from within these expanding phyla to punctuate this progressive decline with acute exacerbations of COPD.",

The heterogeneity of the disease within individuals and the observation that terminal bronchioles are destroyed before the onset of emphysematous destruction make it possible to assess the response at different levels of tissue destruction (21), but future studies of larger numbers of cases that include better methods of assessing the host response to specific microbial antigens are needed to confirm the present results. Despite this obvious shortcoming the experimental approach described here provides preliminary evidence in support of the hypothesis that there is a host response to the microbiome in COPD and that it is primarily directed at OTUs within the expanding Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla that have successfully competed for space on a reduced alveolar surface. Furthermore, even though none of the patients receiving a transplant had an exacerbation at the time of transplantation, we postulate that the milieu present within the lung microbiome might encourage the emergence of strains from within the expanding Proteobacteria phylum, which is known to contribute many of the organisms that produce acute exacerbations of COPD (36, 37).",
