Alternatively, these polymorphisms may amplify the sensitivity of the biliary epithelium to microbial antigens, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis. Thus far however, genetics has only explained a fraction of disease risk, suggesting that environmental factors are also important. Among a host of potential candidate environmental factors, gut microbial components are of interest as they may mediate intestinal inflammation by local effects and hepatic inflammation through the entero-hepatic circulation of microbial factors, as shown in the cholangitis model in rats with bacterial overgrowth.8 The first treatment trials in PSC were performed with antibiotics and, although so far not proven clinically effective, antibiotics do seem to influence disease activity parameters.9 The aim of this study was to compare the structure of the intestinal microbiota of UC patients with PSC [PSC-UC] and without PSC [UC] in order to identify a PSC-specific microbial profile.",

Existing tissue biobanks were reviewed to identify individuals with PSC-UC and UC with available endoscopic colonic biopsies. The diagnosis of UC was made by accepted clinical, endoscopic and pathological criteria.10 The diagnosis of PSC was made by accepted clinical, radiological and pathological criteria including: chronically elevated liver enzymes; standard radiological evidence of PSC on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; and/or liver biopsy consistent with PSC; and exclusion of a secondary cause of cholangitis.5,11 Subjects were excluded if, at the time of endoscopic biopsy, they were receiving antibiotic, ursodeoxycholic acid, corticosteroid, immunosuppressant or biological therapy. Subjects with a previous orthotopic liver transplant were also excluded. Following review of biobanks and application of exclusion criteria, n = 19 Oslo PSC-UC, n = 18 Oslo UC, n = 12 Calgary PSC-UC and n = 12 Calgary UC subjects were identified. MSH provided a further control group of n = 26 UC subjects [Supplementary Figure 1, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]. To minimize the confounding effect of mucosal inflammation on microbial composition only subjects with an endoscopic Mayo score \u2264 1 at the time of biopsy were included in final analyses; Oslo PSC-UC n = 19, Oslo UC n = 9, Calgary PSC-UC n = 12, Calgary UC n = 12, MSH UC n = 18 [Table 1]. Data collected included UC disease duration, current medications, and endoscopic Mayo score at time of biopsy. Subjects in the UC cohort were screened to rule out PSC by review of their history, liver enzymes, liver synthetic function and, where available, imaging studies. Additional data collected from PSC-UC subjects included: PSC disease duration, liver enzyme values, and liver synthetic function. Three additional healthy controls from MSH with snap-frozen, and RNAlater solution [Qiagen, Hilden, Germany] preserved endoscopic biopsies were also included in the study, solely to assess the effect of biopsy preservation method on colonic tissue microbial composition; these subjects were not included in any other analyses.",

Eleven additional organisms were detected in significantly different proportions of individuals in the three cohorts.

Recent studies in mice have implicated the intestinal microbiota as one such candidate.4 Human studies have added weight to this hypothesis, demonstrating that microbial antigens are present in specimens from PSC livers and that bacteria may be detected in biliary cultures from PSC patients.16 A recent report from a singe centre, examining a small cohort of PSC, UC, and non-inflammatory controls using a phylogenetic microarray demonstrated decreased microbial diversity and richness in PSC compared with UC subjects. In addition, the relative abundance of uncultured Clostridiales II was demonstrated to be significantly lower in PSC compared with UC, a finding we did not replicate.17 Despite this initial report, to date studies of the contribution of the intestinal microbiota to PSC have been few. A contributory factor to the paucity of data in this area has been the difficulty in characterising the intestinal microbiota by culture-dependent techniques. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed the characterisation of complex microbial communities in a culture-independent manner. These techniques use bacterial DNA sequences as signatures, allowing the estimation of organism identity, relative abundance, and function; 16S ribosomal RNA [rRNA] gene sequencing has become the widely accepted method used to most accurately determine intestinal bacterial composition.18\n",

We focused on the recruitment of homogeneous case and control cohorts to reduce potential confounding; however, despite these efforts, significant heterogeneity between study populations may have hampered our ability to detect associations. Study cohorts significantly differed by location of recruitment sites, IBD disease duration, proportion of 5-ASA use and biopsy preservation method, all of which may have hindered our ability to detect microbial associations with PSC phenotype in UC. From the technical point of view, although we used state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing technology [Illumina sequencing by synthesis], it is possible that a greater depth of sequencing might have discovered lower-abundance organisms associated with PSC.",

It demonstrates the challenges associated with microbiota studies due to the remarkable variation in the microbiome driven by a variety of factors including body site, age, location, lifestyle, diet, and host genetics, and in addition the importance of standardisation of phenotype and sample processing in these studies.21,22 Mirroring the early experience in genetic association studies, current microbiota studies may not be adequately powered to detect significant microbiota\u2013phenotype associations, and future studies are likely to require larger numbers. We demonstrated the strong effect of recruitment site on intestinal microbial composition in this study. This effect will be important to take account of in the design of future multicentre microbiota studies, and suggests that care will have to be exercised in generalising results from individual studies to the general PSC population. Accurate phenotyping of PSC subjects with and without UC in future studies will be essential to ensure case and control populations are as homogeneous as possible, and this will be an ongoing challenge. Whether the more general intestinal microbial profile of faecal samples or the more specific, localised profile of endoscopic tissue samples is optimal for the study of microbiota in PSC remains an open question. Information in this regard is provided by a report focusing on a treatment-na\u00efve cohort of Crohn\u2019s disease patients, which demonstrated that stool samples did not reflect microbial dysbiosis in a way similar to that of mucosal tissue samples at either taxonomic or functional levels. Mucosa-associated organisms, however, were not restricted to any particular intestinal location and were readily observed in faecal and tissue samples, although at differing abundances.2 Until consensus emerges on the optimal biospecimen type for characterization of the intestinal microbiota, in our opinion future studies should provide for the collection of both biospecimen types in their study design. Next-generation sequencing technologies continue to advance with a corresponding decrease in cost, allowing an increase in the number of sequences per sample to be generated. The result of this change is that deeper sequencing will be feasible in future studies, with the consequence that lower-abundance organisms may be characterised, potentially uncovering novel microbial associations with PSC not observed in this study. Whereas characterizing the composition of the intestinal microbiota in UC subjects with and without PSC was an important first step, greater mechanistic insights into PSC pathogenesis may be derived by the determination of microbial function in PSC cases and controls.",
