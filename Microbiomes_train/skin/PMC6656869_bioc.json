Stool samples are generally considered the reference standard but are not practical to obtain in the intensive care unit (ICU), and thus, rectal swabs are often used. However, the reliability of rectal swabs for gut microbiome profiling has not been established in the ICU setting. In this study, we compared 16S rRNA gene sequencing results between rectal swab and stool samples collected at three time points from mechanically ventilated critically ill adults. Rectal swabs comprised 89% of the samples collected at the baseline time point, but stool samples became more extensively available at later time points. Significant differences in alpha-diversity and beta-diversity between rectal swabs and stool samples were observed, but these differences were primarily due to baseline samples. Higher relative abundances of members of the Actinobacteria phylum (typically skin microbes) were present in rectal swabs than in stool samples (P\u2009=\u20090.05), a difference that was attenuated over time. The progressively increasing similarity of rectal swabs and stool samples likely resulted from increasing levels of stool coating of the rectal vault and direct soiling of the rectal swabs taken at later time points. Therefore, inferences about the role of the gut microbiome in critical illness should be drawn cautiously and should take into account the type and timing of samples analyzed.",

Briefly, in this observational cohort study, we prospectively enrolled consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure from any cause. We collected rectal swabs and/or stool samples at baseline (days 0 to 2 from intubation) and at the middle (days 3 to 6) and late (days 7 to 10) intervals of follow-up starting at the time of intubation and continuing for up to 10\u2009days if the patient remained in the ICU. Rectal swabs were collected according to a standard operating procedure (i.e., placing the patient in a lateral position, inserting the cotton tip of the swab into the rectal canal, and rotating the swab gently for 5 s), unless clinical reasons precluded movement of the patient (e.g., severe hemodynamic or respiratory instability). Stool samples were collected when available, either by taking a small sample from an expelled bowel movement (before cleaning of the patient and disposal of the stool) or from a fecal management system (rectal tube) placed for management of diarrhea and liquid stool collection. For comparisons with healthy gut microbiota, we also included 15 stool samples obtained from healthy volunteers used for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT stool). We extracted bacterial DNA and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V4 region) using an Illumina MiSeq system with standard protocols as previously described (10) and as detailed in Text S1. Sequencing data were analyzed for alpha/beta-diversity and taxonomic composition using R software. To assess longitudinal changes of alpha-diversity over time as well as to account for the effects of potential confounders on the associations between sample type and gut microbiota profiles, we constructed a set of multivariate models (Text S1), adjusting for the following potential confounders: (i) early enteral nutrition (initiation of gastric or enteral feeds within 48\u2009h of ICU admission); (ii) severity of illness by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores; (iii) presence of rectal tube (indicator of severe diarrhea); (iv) obesity; (v) clinical diagnosis of sepsis.",

Patients with stool samples available had baseline demographics (age, sex, body mass index [BMI]) similar to those of the patients without stool samples (Fig.\u00a01A) but had higher SOFA scores and longer duration of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation (Wilcoxon P\u2009<\u20090.001).

Of note, FMT stool samples were more similar to stool samples from ICU patients than to rectal swabs by beta-diversity analysis (Fig.\u00a02B). By stratifying rectal swabs based on follow-up interval, visualization of beta-diversity data with principal-coordinate analyses (PCoA) revealed that the rectal swabs in the late interval were compositionally more similar to the stool samples than to the rectal swabs obtained earlier (Fig.\u00a02C). By PERMANOVA, a statistically significant temporal effect for changes in beta-diversity values was found only for rectal swabs (P\u2009=\u20090.002) and not for stool samples. Next, in the subset of patients with both stool and rectal swabs available at different intervals, we examined the relative impact of patient identity versus the sample type variable on the beta-diversity data (effectively asking whether different sample types obtained from the same patient were more similar to each other than to same sample types obtained from different patients). By PERMANOVA, the sample type was the only variable significantly associated with differences in beta-diversity values (P\u2009=\u20090.002) (Table\u00a0S3); i.e., knowing whether a community taxonomic profile was derived from a rectal swab or from a stool sample was more important than knowing from which patient the sample was taken. In further sensitivity analyses, we examined the potential impact of different methods of stool sample acquisition (collection from a rectal tube bag versus from bowel movements) but did not find any significant alpha-diversity or beta-diversity differences (Fig.\u00a0S3).",

Actinobacteria abundance declined significantly over time only in rectal swabs and not in stool samples (Fig.\u00a0S4). At the genus level, stool samples had higher relative abundances of members of the Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Enterococcus, and Parabacteroides taxa, which are considered typical members of the gut microbiome in critically ill patients (Fig.\u00a0S5). Examination of the taxonomic composition at the genus level for 10 patients who had both sample types available at different follow-up intervals showed marked discordance between the rectal swabs and the stool samples (Fig.\u00a0S6).",

                    "text": "Systematic differences in alpha-diversity and beta-diversity by sample type were largely attributable to the baseline samples acquired at time points close to ICU admission. At these early time points, 87% of the available samples were rectal swabs and most (58%) of the patients were not receiving enteral nutrition. Stool presence in the rectal vault may have been limited, leading to \u201cunsoiled\u201d swabbing of the rectal mucosa and perirectal skin, with a resulting disproportionately higher abundance of skin bacteria (i.e., members of the Actinobacteria phyla) than would normally be expected for gut microbiota profiles (11). The temporal convergence of microbial profiles between rectal swabs and stool samples observed in our study suggests that progressive recovery of gut motility during the ICU course and stool presence in the rectal vault may have improved the reliability of \u201csoiled\u201d rectal swab sampling, although we did not qualitatively score the macroscopic appearance of swabs as performed previously in the study by Bansal et al. (9). In addition, our study design with periodic sampling in predefined intervals rather than on consecutive days hindered our ability to detect day-to-day dynamic changes of gut microbiota communities and limited the number of follow-up samples in our cohort. Thus, analyses in the late interval have low statistical power and may have also been affected by informative censoring, i.e., patients not contributing late follow-up samples due to rapid clinical improvement and discharge from the ICU or due to clinical deterioration and early ICU death. Since we were not able to perform head-to-head comparisons of rectal swabs and stool samples obtained at the same time, the notable discordance of microbial community profiles by sample type observed in the small subset of patients with longitudinal samples of both types requires cautious interpretation, given that it was not possible to account for patient-level temporal variability.",

Despite their availability, rectal swabs may offer biased representations of the presumed gut microbial communities, especially when sampling is conducted early in the course of critical illness. Consequently, analyses of gut microbiota studies need to take into account both the actual sample types used and the timing of sample acquisition, because rectal swabs and stool samples are not interchangeable for the purpose of microbiota sequencing profiling. Accurate and reproducible delineation of the role of the gut microbiome in critical illness will require consistent sampling protocols, recording of clinical variables, and longitudinal assessments.",
