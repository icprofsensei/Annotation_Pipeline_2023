The 16S rRNA gene Illumina iTag sequencing was used to elucidate microbial diversity and explore differences between ISS and cleanroom microbiomes. Statistical analyses showed that members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were dominant in the samples examined but varied in abundance. Actinobacteria were predominant in the ISS samples whereas Proteobacteria, least abundant in the ISS, dominated in the cleanroom samples. The viable bacterial populations seen by PMA treatment were greatly decreased. However, the treatment did not appear to have an effect on the bacterial composition (diversity) associated with each sampling site.",

For example, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria) but not Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) species are dominant on the ISS in terms of viable and total bacterial community composition. The results obtained will facilitate future studies to determine how stable the ISS environment is over time. The present results also demonstrate the value of measuring viable cell diversity and population size at any sampling site. This information can be used to identify sites that can be targeted for more stringent cleaning. Finally, the results will allow comparisons with other built sites and facilitate future improvements on the ISS that will ensure astronaut health.",

Since built environments are known to have specific microbiomes [6], it is of the highest interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientific community to explore the environmental microbiome of the ISS as a closed environment. Moreover, the National Research Council (NRC) specifically recommended that NASA study changes in microbial populations in response to selective pressure associated with microgravity, which characterizes life aboard the ISS [7]. Previous studies show that permanent changes have occurred within the microbial species during experiments aboard the ISS [8, 9]. Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses are now broadly implemented in many microbiology-related scientific fields, especially in microbial ecology [10, 11] and human microbiome projects [12, 13], use of these techniques for closed habitats has just begun [14] and warrants more research.",

However, differentiating viable and yet-to-be-cultivable microbial populations requires an appropriate sample processing technology [15]. The use of the reagent propidium monoazide (PMA) before DNA extraction eliminates cells with a compromised membrane. The PMA-based assay thus allows for a more accurate approximation of the viable microbial community in terms of richness as well as abundance [15]. Due to the technically rigorous methods required for culturing many microorganisms, characterization of human-associated microbial populations in the ISS environment remains a significant challenge. However, it is important to monitor the presence of any opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms. As long-duration human missions are planned in the future, detection of human pathogens and possible mitigation practices must be developed. In addition, understanding of the ISS microbiome could facilitate the necessary maintenance of this closed habitat and thereby assist in preventing degradation of its components by some microorganisms [4].",

Importantly, considerable prior knowledge of the microbial communities associated with these cleanrooms exists from prior studies. The ISS has been exposed to these communities indirectly by the fact that some of the cargos sent to the ISS were packaged in these specific NASA cleanrooms. As in the case of the ISS closed habitat, the Earth-based cleanrooms are controlled for humidity, temperature, and circulation. Furthermore, NASA quality assurance engineers perform periodic audits to ensure that certified-facility cleanliness levels conform to the requirements delineated for both the ISS and Earth cleanrooms. The ISS environment is zero gravity with exposure to space radiation and elevated carbon dioxide levels. By necessity the air is re-circulated whereas on Earth the cleanrooms are constantly replenished with fresh air. An important difference is human habitation, which does not occur in the Earth cleanrooms. However, the human traffic in Earth cleanrooms is actually rather high (at least 50+ people in a given working day) when compared to the ISS where only 6 astronauts are allowed at a single time.",

Microbial burdens estimated via traditional cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent methods are given in Table\u00a02. The bacteria capable of growth in nutrient-rich media were in the range of 105\u00a0CFU per gram in the ISS HEPA filter sample and an order of magnitude greater (106\u00a0CFU per gram) for the ISS Debris. Relatively, the bacterial populations were larger in the ISS Debris sample than in the JPL cleanroom debris samples. When compared to the ISS Debris, the JPL-SAF Debris harbored an order of magnitude smaller bacterial population (105\u00a0CFU per gram) and the JPL-103 Debris sample was two orders of magnitude fewer (1.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009104\u00a0CFU per gram). In general, cultivable fungi were less represented than bacteria in all samples tested. The cultivable fungal population was two logs less for the ISS samples when compared to their bacterial counts, whereas the JPL cleanroom samples exhibited one-log difference. The ISS Debris possessed a similar fungal burden as that of the JPL-SAF Debris sample, which is higher than the more stringent JPL-103 area.

Among 41 bacterial strains isolated and identified, 36 belonged to 29 different species, five strains were only identified to the genus level. The majority of the identified isolates belong to Firmicutes and only four strains were affiliated to the members of the Proteobacteria group. The highest number of isolates was represented by Bacillus and Staphylococcus genera. While Bacillus was dominant in both ISS samples, Staphylococcus was only present in ISS Debris. Both genera were either absent or underrepresented in the JPL-SAF and JPL-103 samples. Single representatives of other spore-forming lineages were also identified (Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, and Solibacillus). Notably, five strains belonging to the B. anthracis-cereus-thuringiensis group were isolated from the HEPA filter, and more detailed phylogenetic, pathogenic, and whole genome sequence characterizations are underway to confirm the functional characteristics of these isolates. The pathogenic properties specific to B. anthracis were not present in these five strains (data not shown).",

Bacillus species were predominant when traditional cultivation methods were employed (Additional file 1: Table S1), but Bacillus pyrosequences were not retrieved. When PMA-treated samples from the ISS samples were compared to the Earth-analog cleanroom samples, the dominant phyla were found to be very similar (Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes).

Since Illumina sequences were short (~150\u00a0bp each), it was not possible to reliably resolve taxonomic affiliation beyond the genus level. We characterized high-quality reads using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier [17] and summarized community composition at multiple taxonomic levels. Among the ISS-associated samples, profiles were dominated by Actinobacteria, Bacilli, and Clostridia, while samples from the JPL-associated sites maintained higher levels of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria (Fig.\u00a01). At the family level, the differences between ISS and JPL profiles were substantial, with complete distinction between the two sites using actinobacterial members alone\u2014the ISS samples were dominated by Corynebacterium, while the actinobacterial groups among JPL samples were predominantly Geodermatophilaceae.",

When compared on the family level, sequences associated with any family did not exceed more than 10\u00a0% of the total sequences. Characteristics of bacterial phyla that are dominant during this study are depicted in Table\u00a03. A clear-cut trend was noticed on the presence of bacterial phylum dominance on the ISS as well as in the Earth-analog cleanroom samples. Viable sequences arising from Actinobacteria were the most abundant in the ISS HEPA and ISS Debris samples (~95 and ~66\u00a0%, respectively), while Proteobacteria was present in the least numbers (0.41 and ~3\u00a0%, respectively). Among these three dominant phyla, the lowest percentage was found for Firmicutes and differed significantly between cleanroom samples as well (JPL-SAF: 11.05\u00a0% and JPL-103: 0.98\u00a0%). In-depth analysis showed that the ISS HEPA sample accumulated more sequences of the genus Corynebacterium than ISS Debris sample. In addition to the latter, the ISS Debris had sequences associated with the order Actinomycetales and the genus Staphylococcus. In contrast, the JPL-SAF Debris sample possessed larger numbers of Bacillus and unclassified Proteobacteria genera sequences, whereas JPL-103 Debris mimicked ISS locations and members of Actinobacteria were more dominant.",

Hierarchical clustering of samples using genus taxonomic profiles resulted in clustering of samples by collection site but not strong clustering of paired PMA or no PMA samples (Fig.\u00a02). Both the negative binomial test and Fisher\u2019s exact test provided valuable information and supported the hierarchical clustering scenario. Searching for differentially abundant genus-level groups with significant P values using the negative binomial test, we saw that the vast majority of differentially abundant taxa were relatively depleted in the PMA-treated group. The only well-represented genera that were relatively enriched were Clostridium (0.34\u00a0% vs. 2.46\u00a0%, P\u2009=\u20090.009) and Rheinheimera (0.005\u00a0% vs. 0.472\u00a0%, P\u2009=\u20097E-06). In contrast, genera such as Streptococcus, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Neisseria were all relatively enriched in the untreated samples. Alpha diversity estimators also indicated a significant drop in diversity associated with PMA treatment. On average, PMA samples had 48\u00a0% fewer OTUs than their untreated pairs (paired T-test P\u2009=\u20090.004). This consistent reduction in the PMA samples was also true for Faith\u2019s diversity, Chao1, and Shannon diversity measures (Fig.\u00a03) and is consistent with the depletion of many taxa identified by differential abundance analysis.",

Figure\u00a04 displays PCoA plots associated with the R1 dataset. The samples from the same site are highly similar in composition regardless of PMA treatment. Using Procrustes analysis, we compared PCoA plots generated for both the R1 and R2 datasets. In this case, Procrustes analysis was employed to transform the R2-based principal coordinate set (by rotation, scaling, and translation) to minimize the distances between corresponding points in the R1 principal coordinate space. We found that virtually identical distances were derived between the R1 and R2 PCoA plots, further supporting the clustering of PMA and untreated paired samples. This high-resolution comparison stood in contrast to broader composition comparisons, such as the hierarchical clustering above. At the OTU level, the bacterial composition was strongly associated with the sampling site, and the reduced overall diversity of PMA treatment did not dramatically impact the composition relative to sample origin.",

The JPL-SAF Debris sample revealed the highest diversity that are viable and the highest number of sequences.

Irrespective of the sample origin, the viable community profile was highly similar to the total community profile, revealing no significant differences in PERMANOVA or MRPP indices. However, the differences between the viable and total community profile were outweighed by the substantial differences of the ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom microbiome, which ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 concerning the chance-corrected within-group agreement (Additional file 1: Table S4). Bacterial and fungal taxa that showed a significant difference between ISS and Earth-analog cleanroom samples are presented in Additional file 3: Figure S2.",

Individuals living and/or working in built environments are often susceptible to health issues associated with microorganisms [18, 19]. Moreover, the microbial ecology of ISS remains largely unknown, as study efforts have been mostly focused on microbiological surveillance using cultivation procedures. The NRC recommended use of state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques to develop better microbial monitoring of future closed habitat(s) and response system(s) against potential biohazards originating from microbiological sources, using the ISS as a test bed [1, 4]. Exploration of the microbial diversity associated with unusual built-in environments such as the ISS would further contribute to the indoor microbiome research.

The ISS is a very unique environment due to microgravity, and a suitable Earth analog of this ecosystem is not available. The cleanrooms used for comparison in this study are environmentally controlled and represent oligotrophic conditions in an Earth-based setting. Comprehensive characterization and cataloguing of microbial species in NASA cleanrooms has been taking place since the 1970s. This extensive data set renders these facilities the best-characterized closed environments with limited human traffic that the ISS samples can be compared with [20\u201324]. A lower incidence of cultivable microorganisms in Earth cleanrooms than ISS surfaces suggests that regular thorough maintenance and cleaning practices are required to reduce microbial burden in closed habitats.",

The utilization of PMA combined with Illumina MiSeq technology for exploring viable microbiome of ISS-related environmental surfaces is not yet reported. The NGS technology resulting in information on millions of base pairs might have included genetic information from dead cells including contaminant DNA associated with the sample processing reagents [30, 31]. Thus, PMA treatment would eliminate these contaminants, making it possible to elucidate viable microbiomes. However, it was documented that PMA might not work for all kinds of microbial populations, especially spores where the dye was not able to penetrate the dead but intact spores [32]. Despite this, none of the other current methodologies can precisely estimate viable populations; PMA treatment has the highest potential to lead to the substantial differentiation between dead and live cells [15]. The statistical analysis of the viable bacterial community in this study revealed the significant variance in viable microbiome (Fig.\u00a04; Additional file 1: Table S3 and S4), between the ISS and the cleanroom samples.",

Hence, particulates associated with ISS HEPA filter might have been exposed to drier conditions than the crew living quarter debris (relative humidity >50\u00a0%) and therefore the microorganisms that could withstand dry conditions only survived in the HEPA filter. Any microbial species that could withstand a prolonged period of time (~40\u00a0months during this study) requires survival capabilities against harsh conditions, and members of the Actinobacteria phylum are known to withstand desiccation, dry conditions, and high pH [33, 34], which explains their abundance in ISS HEPA filters (~95.28\u00a0%; Table\u00a03).

The dominance of Actinobacteria might be due to the presence of astronauts who live and perform work activities on board the ISS. However, characterization of astronauts\u2019 skin microbiome is warranted and such studies will add more insights into the source of these bacteria associated with the ISS environmental surfaces and atmosphere. Actinobacteria have been previously reported in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, and these non-spore-forming bacteria were considered a potential contamination risk of spacecraft due to their resistance to desiccation and ultraviolet radiation [34]. In this study, the viable population of the Actinobacteria did not constitute high population of the Earth cleanrooms, although this can be explained by the different gowning procedures required before entering these facilities unlike practiced in the ISS. In this study, both the ISS HEPA and ISS Debris samples contained high number of viable Corynebacterium sequences whereas Propionibacterium sequences were more in the ISS Debris sample. Since these microorganisms require special growth conditions, they were not isolated when traditional cultivation methods were employed during this study. Although the Propionibacterium species represent natural skin commensals, P. acnes is considered an opportunistic pathogen that leads to various infections [36, 37]. Similar concerns refer to Corynebacterium, which has received attention for being a genus containing several opportunistic pathogens [38]. Even though viable sequences of these opportunistic pathogens were retrieved from both ISS locations, their virulence characteristics are to be studied before correlating their influence on human health in a closed habitat. The risk of acquiring infection from opportunistic bacterial and fungal pathogens might pose a threat to crewmembers\u2019 health and needs to be studied in the future.",

This trend has previously been seen in the studies of cleanroom-associated microbiomes when Sanger sequencing or DNA microarray method(s) were attempted, where human-associated Proteobacteria constituted the dominating phylum [11, 15, 39]. Low abundance (<100 sequences) of Gammaproteobacteria, human commensals, in ISS samples appears reasonable since at any given time only a maximum of six astronauts are present [40]. Despite more human traffic in Earth cleanrooms, lower abundance of Gammaproteobacterial members were noticed. This might be due to the fact that appropriate countermeasures (cleaning) were in place to prevent contamination in these indoor facilities. The high abundance of Acinetobacter and Brevundimonas in the ISS Debris sample showed that these microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature and associated with the debris [41] suggesting that their presence cannot be avoided. The members of the oligotrophic class Sphingomonodaceae were more abundant in the JPL-SAF sample and were previously found to persist in these nutrient-deprived environments [42].",

This indicates that co-inhabiting astronauts might have shed more skin microorganisms that were captured by the vacuum cleaner than the HEPA system. The cultivation-dependent method confirmed the presence of several Staphylococcus species in the ISS surface samples and these species were not isolated from other samples investigated during this study. In contrast, the higher abundance of viable Bacillus species in the JPL-SAF (Class 10\u00a0K) sample suggests that they might have originated from the surrounding soil [43]. Lower abundance of Bacillus species in the more stringent JPL-103 cleanroom (Class 1\u00a0K) further reiterated that appropriate maintenance could regulate microbial presence in a much cleaner indoor environment [42].",

                    "text": "The dominant cultivable isolates of bacteria from both ISS air and ISS surfaces were spore-forming Bacillus. As members of this genus are common inhabitants of soil and dust, they were highly probable to be cultured from the ISS samples on a nutrient-rich media. When the phylogenetic affiliation results for the cultivable strains were compared to the NGS results, only Illumina-derived deep sequencing yielded Bacillus sequences. In our previous efforts, Bacillus eluded detection when traditional Sanger sequencing [44], PhyloChip G2 technology [45], or 454-pyrosequencing analysis of amplicons were employed [11]. Likewise, in this study, the pyrosequencing method again did not retrieve sequences of spore formers. In contrast, the Illumina method frequently yielded the sequences indicative of the spore formers, including members of the genus Bacillus and Paenibacillus. The absence of Solibacillus and Brevibacillus sequences might be either attributed to the specificity of the iTag primer sets or the efficiency of the DNA extraction method employed. However, the Promega Maxwell-16 DNA extraction system used in this study was successful in extracting nucleic acids from the pure cultures of Solibacillus and Brevibacillus. Despite the same sample preparation, the Illumina-based sequencing generated more reads (40\u20132400 times; average ~100 times), thus providing a deeper coverage of microbial diversity than the 454 platform. Choosing an appropriate technology is important when abundance and richness of the microbial diversity are considered. Although Illumina can be employed to understand yet-to-be cultivated microorganisms, the use of well-established traditional techniques should not be completely abandoned.",

The abundance of the fungal molds in indoor environments was reported to be associated with invasive infections and allergies [46, 47]. Therefore, a high number of fungal isolates from the ISS locations confirmed a need for continuous monitoring of the ISS for fungal populations. Aspergillus niger was the predominant isolate, and although it does not have the potential to cause disease at the same rate as other Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus, A. flavus), it was correlated with pulmonary and ear infections [48]. Aspergillus species are repeatedly isolated in indoor microbiomes [49]. The detection of multiple isolates of A. niger is consistent with its frequent presence in built environments including ISS surfaces [50]. However, its survival capability, proliferation, and molecular alteration in response to ISS microgravity conditions need to be studied further. On the other hand, A. niger is known for production of many beneficial substances. The potential for production of novel beneficial secondary metabolites under microgravity conditions needs to be explored for use in diverse biotechnological and pharmaceutical fields [51, 52].",

The NGS data, supported by traditional microbiology techniques and selective molecular bioburden estimation assays, provided a preliminary but detailed report on the ISS environmental microbiome. Future work will be able to build on these initial results by determining how stable that environment is over time. In contrast with the JPL cleanrooms, the most common organisms in the ISS environment were members of the Actinobacteria that are frequently associated with humans. As on the ISS, human traffic is common in the cleanrooms, but clearly the more stringent procedures possible on Earth are more effective in eradicating these organisms. The current results provide a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of future ISS procedural changes. This study also allowed an evaluation of the utility of coupling PMA treatment with NGS sequencing for more accurate estimation of viable population. The bacterial diversity of each sample decreased after the PMA treatment but this was strongly associated with the sampling site. Since exposure to viable organisms is best minimized, it is important to know which areas are most problematic and hence should be avoided and/or targeted for more stringent cleaning conditions. It is clear from the results presented here that viable cell studies with PMA can provide this information. It was also found that the relative numbers of various types of viable cells in each sample closely resembled the distribution obtained when all (dead and viable) cells were considered. This is likely to be a usual result unless the population at a sampling site has been recently and dramatically changed such that the prior dominant organisms have been replaced in only the pool of viable cells.",

Particle counts are not routinely measured aboard crewed spacecraft. A study conducted during space shuttle mission STS-32 (January 1990) found that the particle size distribution approximated a class 100,000 cleanroom for particles <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm, a class 400,000 cleanroom for particles 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm to <10\u00a0\u03bcm, and a class 3000 cleanroom for particles >10\u00a0\u03bcm [53, 54]. The particle size distributions are defined using cleanroom standard definitions (FED-STD-209 1992). The HEPA filters used aboard the ISS retain 99.97\u00a0% particles of 0.3\u00a0\u03bcm via a pleated borosilicate media. A 20-mesh (841-\u03bcm sieve openings) inlet screen located at the filter element\u2019s face removes larger debris and fibers. The pleated, non-woven borosilicate HEPA filter media was installed by Flanders Filters, Inc. (Washington, NC) in the filter element housing. Flanders Filters, Inc.\u2019s commercial \u201cNaturalAire\u201d cut-to-fit filtration media has the greatest similarity to the ISS HEPA filter media (http://flandersfilters.com/products/naturalaire/). Twenty-one filter elements are distributed throughout the ISS in several modules and astronauts replace them on a scheduled maintenance cycle ranging from 2.5 to 5\u00a0years, depending on the location. The part number of the HEPA filter system analyzed during this study was SV810010-1 and the serial number was 0049. The HEPA filter element analyzed during this study was manufactured in September 1998, installed in ISS on January 2008, and returned aboard space shuttle flight STS-134/ULF6 in late May 2011. This filter was installed in ISS Node 2 and was in service for 40\u00a0months, although the typical service time is only 30\u00a0months for this location. Typically, ground testing is performed to characterize a filter element\u2019s pressure drop at various process air flow rates [53] after retrieval from the ISS, but in this case, the HEPA filter remained untouched in its shipment packaging from the time it was removed from the ISS until particulates were recovered at JPL for microbial characterization. The particulate materials collected from this sample were designated as ISS HEPA during this study.",

The vacuum cleaner bag components are representative of the collected debris (lint, food particles, skin/hair, and miscellaneous debris) that had been airborne in the cabin but had collected over time on the filter element inlet screen. The molecular microbial community analysis for the ISS vacuum bag debris (ISS Debris) was previously documented [14]. These results were utilized here for comparative purposes. The previous molecular characterizations of the ISS Debris sample were extended here with Illumina-based deep sequencing using archived DNA aliquots [14]. Sample characteristics of the ISS Debris are described in Table\u00a01. Briefly, during the period of ISS Expeditions 30 and 31, reports by some crewmembers cited differences in the cabin environment compared to earlier experience as well as allergic responses to the cabin environment. One of the noted observations was a high level of visible dust in the ISS Node 3 cabin, to the extent it was sticking to the walls. Flight surgeons indicated that this had been reported not just in Node 3 but also throughout the US on-orbit segment and expressed a concern for crew health. Dust on the ISS is expected, with humans being major contributors (via skin shedding, eating, exercising, etc.). Other sources such as on-orbit maintenance activities can release dust from sources such as payloads and systems, clothing, and visiting vehicles. As a precautionary measure, in the middle of 2012, an investigation was launched to define and mitigate dust sources and to determine if exposure to dust might elicit an adverse effect on crew health. As a result of these crewmember reports, particulate and fiber debris samples were collected during ISS Expedition 31 using a handheld portable vacuum cleaner and returned to Earth aboard Soyuz flight 29S in early July 2012 for analyses. Details of the novel \u201cPrime\u201d vacuum cleaner developed for NASA habitats were reported elsewhere [55]. Portions of the samples were aseptically collected for microbiological testing at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center (JSC), with the remaining bag and its contents repacked in a biological hood, sealed, and shipped to NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) for particle size testing, as well as to JPL to determine their molecular microbiological composition. The vacuum cleaner bag was shipped via FedEx at room temperature with instructions that the samples not be irradiated in transport.",

Cleanroom certification is based on the maximum number of particles greater than 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm per cubic foot of air. The air within Class 1\u00a0K cleanrooms is maintained at fewer than 1000 particulates per cubic foot, Class 10\u00a0K cleanrooms are allowed to harbor a density of 10,000 particles per cubic foot, and so on. The cleanroom samples were from (a) the JPL-SAF cleanroom floor where various Mars mission spacecraft were built (Class 10\u00a0K; JPL-SAF Debris) and (b) JPL building 103 where non-mission critical activities were conducted (Class 1\u00a0K; JPL-103 Debris). The vacuum cleaner bag debris from the JPL-SAF and JPL-103 buildings was transported to the microbiology laboratories for storage. Sample processing was carried out immediately after aseptic collection of the materials, usually within 7\u00a0days from the retrieval of the vacuum bags from the cleanrooms. Both Earth-analog samples were processed at the same time as the ISS Debris samples. However, the ISS HEPA sample was received ~3\u00a0months later and hence was analyzed separately.",

For the comparison of bacterial pyrosequence and Illumina data and fungal pyrosequence analysis, multivariate statistical analyses of community profiles were performed using an \u201cin-house R-script\u201d employing the libraries vegan, ape, gplots, mgcv, and GUniFrac [81]. First, each dataset composed of OTU abundances per sample was rarefied to the lowest number of reads and a Bray-Curtis index was calculated. This procedure was repeated 10,000 times and the average Bray-Curtis distance was calculated for each dataset in order to avoid biases arising from rarefication. The Bray-Curtis distance was then utilized to calculate principal coordinate (PCoA) analyses, PERMANOVA (1000 permutations), and MRPP (1000 permutations).",
