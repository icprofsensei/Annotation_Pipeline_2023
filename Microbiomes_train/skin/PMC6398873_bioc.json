Obesity is characterised by proinflammatory adipose tissue macrophages that secrete high levels of IL-17, a cytokine which is also induced by ETBF in murine models of colon cancer.9 26 27 Given the reciprocal relationship between the microbiome and the immune system, it is logical to hypothesise that obesity-associated microbial dysbiosis, combined with a state of chronic inflammation, contributes to the increased risk of colon cancer among obese individuals. In support of this hypothesis, animal models of colon cancer (Apc1638N) have demonstrated that a high fat diet or genetically (ob/ob) induced obesity can significantly alter the microbiome leading to a loss of Parabacteroides distasonis and an increase in proinflammatory factors.19 In a separate model of colon cancer (K-rasG12Dint), faecal transfer from high-fat fed mice with intestinal tumours to genetically susceptible mice on a standard diet replicated the disease phenotype.28 Thus, it appears that a high fat diet may be sufficient to change the microbiome into a tumour-promoting community independent of obesity and glucose response. As these data demonstrate, there are a variety of dysbiotic states that exist in obese individuals, which could further enhance the inflammatory state of the GI tract leading to an increased risk of CRC. No human studies to date have addressed the obesity-associated differences in the microbiome and its relationship to CRC however.",

Thus, we began our analysis by characterising the effect of 16S rRNA variable region and sequencing methods (16S rRNA or WGS) on observed OTUs and Shannon diversity for prediction of CRC. Unfortunately, we could not fully test the effect of nucleotide extraction as the Feng et al study did not provide this information. We chose to focus on alpha diversity for this analysis given that it is a low-resolution measure, which allows for comparison across studies. Using multilevel modelling to predict CRC status, we calculated the average log2 OR (logit) for each study when these level 2 predictors (variable region and sequencing method) were included in the model. The results of this analysis demonstrated that alpha diversity and obesity vary by study but do not significantly change the probability of having CRC (figure 1A,B; online supplementary figure S1). Between the studies that used different extraction techniques, Zeller (GNOME DNA Isolation Kit, MP Biomedical) vs Baxter and Zackular et al (Power Soil, Mo Bio), we did not observe an effect of extraction technique on the relationship between alpha diversity and probability of CRC (figure 1A,B). Further, the predictive ability of 16S rRNA data, alpha diversity, to classify CRC varies among studies but using WGS does not improve this predictive ability nor does variable region choice (figure 1A,B). Overall, among the potential confounders we tested, we did not observe a significant effect on the ability of alpha diversity to classify CRC cases and controls when controlling for obesity.",

Confirming previous microbial studies of stool from healthy (non-CRC) individuals,25 we also found significantly lower Shannon diversity in individuals that are obese without CRC from two of the 16S rRNA data sets (Baxter and Zeller et al [WGS]) and lower richness in the Zeller et al (16S) data; unadjusted Mann-Whitney U tests did not show this same result comparing individuals with and without obesity (figure 2A; online supplementary figure S2A and table 2). Supporting previous meta-analyses, however, studies with N<100 subjects displayed similar trends but did not reach statistical significance. When we asked if this same trend of lower Shannon diversity was present in obese individuals with CRC, we saw no association, with the exception of the Feng et al dataset, which demonstrated a significantly higher alpha diversity with higher BMI both as continuous and categorical models, but not in the unadjusted analysis (figure 2B; online supplementary figure S2B and table 2). These results may be due to geography and diet of Asian populations.

The first approach was a classical mediation test, in which we constructed three tests. First, we estimated the OR of individuals with higher BMI being more likely to be classified as having CRC. Second, we estimated the same relationship between BMI and CRC status while controlling for the mediating effect of differentially abundant bacteria. Meaning, if the bacterium mediates the relationship between BMI and CRC probability, then the OR for BMI will decrease. Third, we calculated how much change in the OR occurred from the first to second model. Thus, from this change in ORs, we estimated how much of an effect including each taxa had on increasing or decreasing the probability of being classified as CRC for each one unit increase in BMI. From this analysis, we identified several taxa that increased or decreased the probability of CRC (online supplementary table 2) and the overall presence or absence of each taxa in cases and controls (online supplementary table 3). Species from the Bacteroides, Ruminococcus and Prevotella genera as well as Bifidobacterium catenulatum decreased the probability of CRC with increasing BMI, except for two species of Prevotella which increased CRC probability. The mediation effect of these taxa, however, was relatively weak; less than 1% change in OR (change in probability of CRC, OR range=\u22129e-05 to \u22120.01) (online supplementary table 2), with the majority showing a negative effect and only 8/34 showing a positive effect; none showed a significant mediation effect (online supplementary table 2).",

Using the machine learning method random forest, we calculated importance scores among obese individuals at the OTU or genus level using 10-fold cross-validation in individuals with adenomas or CRC. These values were then used to calculate area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) using age and sex as covariates or the microbiome alone. Among all obese individuals, the average of all AUC values predicting CRC cases at the OTU and genus level was 0.66 (0.47\u20130.84) and 0.68 (0.47\u20130.94), respectively (figure 3B). Similarly, among obese adenoma cases, average AUC values at the OTU and genus level were 0.61 (0.48\u20130.86) and 0.60 (0.52\u20130.73), respectively (figure 3A), demonstrating high heterogeneity among studies in predicting CRC or adenomas in obese individuals. Last, we sought to validate CRC classifiers developed by Baxter et al and Zeller et al by agnostic application of our random forest classifier on each dataset using all genera or OTUs. Overall, the microbiome by itself or controlling for BMI, age and sex had low and variable AUC values (OTU; AUC=0.53\u20130.79; Genus; AUC=0.59\u20130.81) in most studies. We were able, however, to validate the classifier from the Baxter et al and Feng et al studies; our AUC values were 0.79 (Baxter et al) and 0.81 as compared with Baxter et al (AUC=0.84) and Feng et al (AUC=0.96). Although we could not approach the classifier values from the Zeller et al study (AUC=0.84; without FOBT), this was likely due to the difference in their approach in building the classifier. In general, these data indicate that the microbiome together with clinical data, and likely FOBT or similar tests, could have diagnostic utility.",

Second, we identified a weak effect of the majority of species associated with both BMI and CRC on risk of CRC. Last, we show the microbiome, by itself or modelled with age and sex, is insufficient to classify adenomas or CRC from obese controls. However, when controlling for clinical variables and BMI, we are able to achieve similar levels of CRC classification to other studies.45 Overall, by combining species-level resolution from 16S rRNA and WGS data, we were able to define the microbial community structure and function at a high resolution, revealing overall a weak effect of the microbiome on mediating CRC risk among individuals with obesity as compared with those with normal BMI.",

                    "text": "While this study did not identify any strong universal BMI-associated microbial biomarkers of CRC, many mechanisms are likely key in driving the increased risk of CRC in obese individuals that we could not account for in this study. These include tumour location (left vs right), mutation profile, differentiation, mismatch repair status and diet, many of which are able to differentiate individuals with obesity among those with CRC.46\u201349 A high fat diet, however, may be more important than BMI or obesity in driving the deleterious changes in the microbiome in individuals with obesity. In support, feeding a high-fat diet to K-rasG12Dint mice is sufficient to drive tumourigenesis from 30% to 60%.28 Moreover, when faeces from high fat fed mice (K-rasG12Dint) are transferred to healthy (K-rasG12Dint) mice, tumour burden is increased along with diminished immune cell recruitment.28 This was prevented, however, when supplemented with butyrate, which also increased Bifidobacterium abundance as compared with mice not supplemented with butyrate.28 We also found several species of Bifidobacterium lower in individuals with obesity among those with and without CRC. Interestingly, butyrate and butyrate producing bacteria were shown to be increased in African-American men after switching to a traditional high fibre, low-fat rural African diet.50 Again, similar to the results of high-fat feeding promoting CRC, which was abrogated with butyrate treatment, the aforementioned study found that the high-fat Western diet of African-Americans was associated with higher secondary bile acids, known promoters of carcinogenesis. Together, these studies indicate that a high fat diet, specifically from saturated fats, may be interacting with the microbiome to create a proinflammatory environment conducive to colon carcinogenesis.",
