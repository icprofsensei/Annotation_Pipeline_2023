Samples were obtained at baseline and after four days following use of neutral soap and stopping regular hygiene products, including shampoos and deodorants. DNA was extracted using the MoBio Power Lyzer kit and 16S rRNA gene sequences determined on the IIlumina MiSeq platform, using QIIME for analysis. Results. Our analysis confirmed skin swabbing as a useful method for sampling different areas of the skin because DNA concentrations and number of sequences obtained across subject libraries were similar. We confirmed that skin location was the main factor determining the composition of bacterial communities. Alpha diversity, expressed as number of species observed, was greater in arm than on scalp or axilla in all studied groups. We observed an unexpected increase in \u03b1-diversity on arm, with similar tendency on scalp, in the South Asian group after subjects stopped using their regular shampoos and deodorants. Significant differences at phylum and genus levels were observed between subjects of the different ethnic origins at all skin sites. Conclusions. We conclude that ethnicity and particular soap and shampoo practices are secondary factors compared to the ecological zone of the human body in determining cutaneous microbiota composition.",

A wide variety of microbes including viruses [6], bacteria [1\u20133] and fungi [7,8] are capable of colonizing the skin, with differing distributions. Variations in the cutaneous microbiota of healthy individuals are associated with the ecological zones of the skin, including the sebaceous, dry, or moist environments [3,9]. Differences in skin microbiota also have been associated with host factors, including age, diet, and gender, as well as environmental factors, such as climate and geographic location [4,10]. Skin microbiota differences have also been associated with conditions such as dandruff, acne, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis [7, 11\u201314]. Despite the variation in environmental factors, less temporal variability is observed in the same individual than inter-individual variability at the same skin site [1, 15].",

Culture methods and identifying taxonomic classification through phenotypic characteristics including microscopic features and biochemical tests [16, 17], provided the basis for our knowledge of the microbiota, but was biased by differences in culturability of the taxa. Advances in DNA processing and analysis have allowed the study of bacterial communities by sequencing specific regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA with increasing depth [2, 10, 12, 18]. The sequence data can be used in analyses of phylogeny and bacterial community structure, without the bias of culture.",

The study subjects were all healthy adult males, without a history of dandruff or other skin condition. From each subject, skin samples were obtained 72 hours apart from the scalp (occiput), axilla, and inner forearm (extensor surface) using a swabbing technique with duplicate swabs, as described [2], and used in the Human Microbiome Program (HMP) analyses [25]. Samples were obtained before (baseline: time 1) and after subjects stopped using their regular shampoos and deodorants when they used a generic neutral soap (follow-up; time 2). The generic neutral soap was used for the whole body and was used any time that the subject took a bath or a shower. Each swab head was placed in an Eppendorf tube and frozen at -20\u00b0C until DNA was extracted.

Several features were observed: the samples primarily clustered by skin site, and in most cases, for each group of subjects, the samples collected at the two times points were highly similar. One interesting observation is that both the scalp and axilla skin microbiomes of the African-American group were clustered closely to each other. In addition, the scalp microbiome at time 2 in the South Asian group was significantly different (p = 0.01; Adonis test) from time 1 and closer to the arm microbiome at times 1 and 2. In analyses of the community variation using pairwise unweighted UniFrac distances among skin locations (Panel B in\nS3 Fig), the arms had significantly less intragroup variation than the axilla or the scalp, and the axilla had the greatest intragroup variation. In terms of intergroup variation, the mean pairwise distances were significantly greater for arm vs axilla than for the intragroup differences, providing evidence that the community structures of these two sites are distinct.",

For the arm samples, African-Americans showed the greatest homogeneity while South Asians showed the least. For the scalp, the heterogeneity of the samples from South Asian and East Asian men were significantly greater than in the other four groups. Among the groups, South Asian samples showed the greatest heterogeneity at two (arm and scalp) of the three sites, and major differences compared to the samples from the other groups (Fig 3, Panel C).

Only the South Asian men had substantial variation between the baseline and follow-up samples, as observed in all three locations (Fig 4, Panel A). When we compared the number of genera present in each skin site across all of the groups, the axilla had the fewest (726), the arm had the most (1284), and the scalp was intermediate (1034). These differences in the number of genera were consistent at both time points (Fig 4, Panel B).

The largest differences in relative taxa abundances between the ethnic groups involved the scalp; the South Asian men showed the most divergent taxa compared to the other groups, but multiple differences involving diverse taxa were significant across other groups. The arm showed other major differences, with the fewest in the axilla. The East Asian men had numerous taxa that were significantly more abundant in the arm than in the other five study groups (including Class Alphaproteobacteria, as well as genus Deinococcus from phylum Deinococci-Thermi at all 5 taxonomic levels). For the axilla samples, the most significant differences involved the African-American and Caucasian-American subjects.

However, in this study, the extent and quality of the bacterial DNA extraction, as evaluated by the mean number of sequences obtained, did not differ for the three cutaneous sites in the six different groups studied, and the range of taxa identified at substantial levels (7/42 phyla at > 0.1% representation, and 213/1362 genera at >0.01% representation) provides one form of evidence for sufficient sampling. In the absence of a gold standard to ascertain the taxa truly present at any site in humans, these observations extend the validation of the methods used for sampling, DNA extraction, and sequencing analysis. That the representation of Propionibacterium species in scalp colonization was lower than in prior studies [1, 37] may be partially explained by differences in 16S rRNA primers and sequencing techniques.",

Similarly, the axillary microbiota of the East Asian men also was highly homogenous and significantly different from the other groups, and comparable differences were found for the South Asian subjects compared with the other ethnic groups. One explanation for such differences could be the ethnic diversity in an ABCC11 allele SNP, with high (70\u201395%) frequency of the A/A genotype among East Asians compared to Africans & African Americans (<5.0%) or Caucasian-American individuals (20%) [43]. ABCC11, which encodes an apical efflux pump, is critical for development of characteristic axillary odor; SNP G538A, prominent among Asians, leads to a nearly complete loss of the typical odor components in axillary sweat [44]. Other axillary microbiota differences, such as significantly lower abundance of Staphylococcus species and greater abundance of Corynebacterium species, were recently reported in subjects with the A/A genotype [45]. In any event, the amount of inter-individual variation between subjects suggest that much larger groups would need to be tested to reliably ascertain substantial differences in the cutaneous colonization patterns.",

The skin microbiota was thus stable despite that subjects stopped the use of regular shampoos and deodorants for a 72-hour period. However, these results differ from a recent report [46], in which there was significant microbiota temporal variability in cutaneous sites. Potential explanations for the differences include that in the prior study, samples were collected by the study subjects themselves while in our study all samples were collected by the same researcher (JR). Second, although Flores et al. studied the variability in skin microbiota during a 10-week period, we assessed variability within three days. However, stability of the skin microbiota in the longer term has been shown [1]. Third, the sampling locations in the prior study were forehead and palms versus scalp, arm, and axilla in our study. The only temporal variability we observed involved the arm and scalp microbiome for the South Asian men. This variability may reflect cessation of the regular shampoos and soaps and the use of generic standard soap that we provided, since we did not find any other difference among the six different groups in relation to the number of showers taken daily or for any other cleansing practice.",

Such observations suggest that changing soaps and shampoos may not have substantial impact on the underlying microbial population structure. However, the major differences in the South Asian group in samples before and after cessation, especially arm and scalp, indicate that such effects may occur. Determining the basis for these differences may provide insights into the plasticity of the cutaneous microbiome, and how it may be altered by specific interventions.",
