In sprawling metropolitan habitats, the \u201curban microbiome\u201d may represent a mix of human-associated and environmental taxa. Here we carried out a baseline study of automated teller machine (ATM) keypads in New York City (NYC). Our goal was to describe the biodiversity and biogeography of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in an urban setting while assessing the potential source of microbial assemblages on ATM keypads. Microbial swab samples were collected from three boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn) during June and July 2014, followed by generation of Illumina MiSeq datasets for bacterial (16S rRNA) and eukaryotic (18S rRNA) marker genes. Downstream analysis was carried out in the QIIME pipeline, in conjunction with neighborhood metadata (ethnicity, population, age groups) from the NYC Open Data portal. Neither the 16S nor 18S rRNA datasets showed any clustering patterns related to geography or neighborhood demographics. Bacterial assemblages on ATM keypads were dominated by taxonomic groups known to be associated with human skin communities (Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria), although SourceTracker analysis was unable to identify the source habitat for the majority of taxa. Eukaryotic assemblages were dominated by fungal taxa as well as by a low-diversity protist community containing both free-living and potentially pathogenic taxa (Toxoplasma, Trichomonas). Our results suggest that ATM keypads amalgamate microbial assemblages from different sources, including the human microbiome, eukaryotic food species, and potentially novel extremophilic taxa adapted to air or surfaces in the built environment. DNA obtained from ATM keypads may thus provide a record of both human behavior and environmental sources of microbes.",

Although the number of built environment and urban microbial ecology studies has expanded greatly in recent years, the majority of research to date has focused on mass transit systems, city soils, and plumbing and ventilation systems in buildings. ATM surfaces, potentially retaining microbial signatures of human inhabitants, including both commensal taxa and pathogens, are interesting from both a biodiversity perspective and a public health perspective. By focusing on ATM keypads in different geographic areas of New York City with distinct population demographics, we aimed to characterize the diversity and distribution of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, thus making a unique contribution to the growing body of work focused on the \u201curban microbiome.\u201d In New York City, the surface area of urban surfaces in Manhattan far exceeds the geographic area of the island itself.

The majority of studies have sought to describe microbial biodiversity and assess ecological patterns of \u201cpristine\u201d natural habitats such as oceans (2), lakes (3), soils (4, 5), sea ice and glaciers (6), and even clouds (7). More recently, however, a number of studies have aimed at directly assessing human contributions and their impacts on microbial communities. Studies of the built environment have sought to understand how building architecture and engineering, in conjunction with human behavior, may influence the microbes that we encounter during our time spent indoors (which represents 87% of our time on average [8]). Such studies have aimed at capturing the microbial communities associated with both air and surfaces in homes (9, 10), hospitals (11, 12), classrooms (13), offices (14, 15), and restrooms (16), as well as community assemblages within plumbing systems (17,\u201319) and an expanding set of other indoor microhabitats.",

To date, urban environmental sequencing work has sought to describe microbial communities associated with urban air (20,\u201324), rodents (25), and urban soils in green roofs, city parks, and road medians (26, 27), as well as surfaces within urban transit systems (28, 29).

The geography, population density, and accessibility of demographic data in NYC provide a unique case study\u2014in terms of floor space, the \u201cindoor biome\u201d of Manhattan is three times as large as the geographic area of the island itself (30). With this focus on NYC, we aim to facilitate the assessment of different factors that may govern microbial biodiversity and community structure in specific urban habitats. The ATM keypad can be considered a highly trafficked surface that routinely comes into contact with human inhabitants, similarly to railings, seats, and turnstiles in urban transit systems (28, 29). Several culture-based studies of ATMs around the world have previously been carried out (31,\u201333), but no study to date has yet applied high-throughput sequencing methods to deeply characterize all taxa which may be present on ATM keypads. In the present study, we sampled ATM keypads across eight neighborhoods in three NYC boroughs, where US Census data indicated the presence of demographically distinct populations of local residents (Fig.\u00a01). Our goal was to broadly characterize the microbial assemblages recovered from ATM keypads, using an environmental sequencing workflow that concurrently recovered bacterial/archaeal taxa (16S rRNA gene amplicons) as well as microbial eukaryote communities (18S rRNA gene amplicons). The parallel collection of sample metadata and neighborhood census data also allowed us to assess whether microbial biogeography in NYC was correlated with ATM characteristics, local population demographics, or geographic factors. Statistical analyses were further implemented to determine the potential source of ATM microbial assemblages (e.g., the human microbiome, air, food, etc.) as well as potential biomarkers associated with different sample classes.",

The sampling strategy was designed to target geographic areas with distinct ethnic and population demographics, known as neighborhood tabulation areas (NTAs), defined by the NYC Department of City Planning (see Materials and Methods). The majority of ATMs were sampled from indoor locations (62 samples were taken inside buildings or vestibules); however, a small subset of ATM keypads represented outdoor sample locations (4 samples [included in the 16S rRNA sequencing run only]). During initial analysis of 16S and 18S rRNA datasets, control samples formed a distinct grouping separate from the ATM samples in Unifrac principal-coordinate analyses (PCoAs) (see Fig.\u00a0S1\u00a0in the supplemental material). Upon further investigation, our initial SourceTracker analysis revealed that a significant proportion of ATM sequences represented microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were also present in ambient air controls (Fig.\u00a0S2 and S3). Examination of OTU tables suggested that the microbial OTUs present in control samples represent a mix of aerial microbes (e.g., fungal species and bacteria attached to dust particles, pollen, etc.), microbes present in the cotton swabs when purchased from the manufacturer, and \u201ckit microbiomes\u201d consisting of microbes derived from laboratory reagents (we recovered many known kit-associated bacterial genera such as Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Deinococcus, Sphingobium, and Corynebacterium [34]) or potential contamination introduced at some point during PCR and sequencing protocols. The OTUs sequenced from blank control samples most likely represent microbes from a combination of these sources; after assessing control samples and conducting SourceTracker analysis, we adhered to stringent data filtering protocols and subtracted all control sample OTUs from the entire data set.",

However, the presence or absence and relative abundances of other minor taxonomic groups were much more variable across samples. In the 16S rRNA data set, the most abundant bacterial phyla across most samples were Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (Fig.\u00a02A); these taxa are representative of human skin communities and have been previously shown to dominate urban surfaces in the Boston subway system (28). At the class level, Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Clostridia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria showed the highest relative abundances across most samples (Fig.\u00a02B). The Alphaproteobacteria are considered a widespread and metabolically diverse group of environmental bacteria and have also been shown to be associated with urban transit system surfaces (28). Only nine archaeal OTUs were observed at low relative abundances and restricted to a few samples in the final abundance-filtered OTU tables. Further work is needed to determine whether Archaea can truly be considered \u201crare taxa\u201d on ATM keypads or, alternatively, whether the 16S rRNA primer set used in this study prevented recovery of the majority of archaeal taxa; alternative primer sets or shotgun metagenomic sequencing is needed to provide further insight. In the 18S rRNA data set, fungal OTUs represented the largest taxonomic proportion in most samples, with metazoa and unassigned OTUs (those with no BLAST hit) representing two other taxonomic categories with high relative abundances across most samples (Fig.\u00a03). Protist lineages (Amoebozoa, Alveolata, Rhizaria) had low diversity, were present at much lower relative abundances, and showed more variability across samples. The majority of protist sequences were derived from Alveolata and represent free-living ciliates, particularly Oligohymenophorea and Colpodea, which are taxa commonly found in freshwater and soil habitats (35, 36). Three samples contained a >1% relative abundance of Entamoeba species (samples 632, 637, and 661 from ATM keypads in West Brighton and midtown), a genus of protists classed within the phylum Amoebozoa and generally associated with the intestinal tract (37). One sample contained a >10% relative abundance of Silicofilosea protists (sample 633 from West Brighton), an amoebal member of the Rhizaria group known to be associated with bacterivory and fungivory in soil ecosystems (38). Free-living trichomonads (Monotrichomonas carabina and Ditrichomonas honigbergii [39, 40]), as well as a gut-associated commensal (Pentatrichomonas hominis) typically found in humans and other mammals (41) and a species closely related to the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis that was originally isolated from avian sources (Trichomonas sp. strain 5 AP-2012; GenBank accession no. JX512960), were also recovered from ATM keypads. Recent studies suggest that both of these host-associated trichomonads may exhibit zoonotic characteristics (i.e., transmission between humans, domesticated animals, and wildlife) (42). Toxoplasma, another zoonotic protist taxon (43), was also detected at >3% relative abundance on one ATM keypad (sample 632 from West Brighton).",

Other factors such as date and time of sampling and material of ATM keypad (metal or plastic) also did not reveal any clear clustering of microbial communities (data not shown). Four outdoor ATMs were included in our sample set but were not included in 18S rRNA sequencing; while these four ATMs clustered together in 16S rRNA PCoAs, the corresponding outdoor samples were obtained from the same neighborhood (Chinatown, Manhattan). Small groups of samples from other neighborhoods were also observed to cluster together in our 16S rRNA data set (Fig.\u00a04A), making it impossible to separate the influences of neighborhood and indoor/outdoor ATM location.",

None of these methods produced strong groupings in PCoAs, suggesting that the lack of sample clustering across NYC ATMs represents a biologically valid result. However, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) tests revealed that the majority of sample groupings in unweighted Unifrac PCoAs are nonetheless statistically significant (Table\u00a01). Borough and neighborhood were found to be statistically significant for both 16S and 18S rRNA datasets; additionally, ATM location (indoor/outdoor), population demographics (race), and Illumina run were statistically significant only in the 16S rRNA data set, and site type was statistically significant only in the 18S rRNA data set. These PERMANOVA results suggest that there may be some subtle differences in microbial community fingerprints across sample groups (e.g., that are revealed only by comparisons of Unifrac phylogenetic distances, as in this statistical test) that are not otherwise apparent in broader community comparisons such as those performed by PCoAs (Fig.\u00a02).",

Data filtering and rarefaction did not effectively reduce or eliminate this technical artifact, and the Illumina run was found to be a strongly statistically significant sample grouping in PERMANOVA tests of Unifrac distances (P = 0.0001; Table\u00a01). The persistence of such a technical artifact has been similarly reported in other recent studies (14). However, in our case, the 18S rRNA amplicons from eukaryotic communities were sequenced on a single Illumina run and thus provided an independent assessment of PCoA patterns. Eukaryotic PCoAs did not show any large differences in the microbial patterns by site (Fig.\u00a04D and F).",

Although this study included only four ATMs located outdoors (gold stars in Fig.\u00a05), ATM location did not seem to influence the proportion of \u201cunknown\u201d sources for microbial OTUs, which was high across most samples. The most common identified sources of microbes on ATM keypads appeared to be household surfaces such as televisions, restrooms, kitchens, and pillows. In our SourceTracker analysis, we included data previously obtained from human hands and palms (44) as well as from other body sites such as the nose, ear, and gut (45). However, human skin and other body sites were not identified as dominant sources of ATM microbes in our SourceTracker analysis, despite the inclusion of 46 samples from two studies representing human skin (44, 45).",

In 16S rRNA datasets, geographic location (borough/neighborhood) represented the only sample grouping exhibiting no significant enrichment or depletion of microbial taxa. However, this pattern was not consistent for eukaryotes, where 7 to 36 biomarker taxa were attributed to geographic location in the 18S rRNA data set. Among all sample groups, the highest numbers of biomarker taxa were reported for \u201clocation\u201d of ATMs within the 16S rRNA data set (keypads located indoors versus outdoors; Fig.\u00a0S5); however, the type of site (bank, restaurant, gas station, etc.) and the population demographics associated with each NTA (predominant race group) were also associated with a low number of biomarker taxa in both 18S and 16S rRNA data (Fig.\u00a06). Fungi comprised the majority of eukaryotic biomarkers identified in the 18S rRNA data set (Fig.\u00a06A) and included both common species and specialized taxa. For example, the fungal species Aspergillus niger and Occultifur externus were both found to be enriched on ATM keypads sampled in Central Harlem South. Aspergillus species are ubiquitous and widespread fungal species associated with outdoor and indoor air (46, 47), and A.\u00a0niger is a species heavily utilized in industrial processes (48) and the cause of black mold disease in many fruit and vegetable crops (49). In contrast, O.\u00a0externus is a recently described novel species originally isolated from plant litter in Portugal (50). Furthermore, the xerophilic foodborne mold Xeromyces bisporus was reported as another fungal biomarker in NYC neighborhoods with predominately white population demographics (Fig.\u00a06A); this fungal species has been reported to grow at extremely low water activity levels that are lower than those seen with any other known organism (51).",

The absence of biogeographic patterns could be explained by a number of factors. ATMs are subject to high use in urban areas such as NYC and could be subject to human-driven homogenization of the microbial communities present on keypads. In any given neighborhood, transient users of ATMs (tourists, commuters, visitors from other NTAs, etc.) might be common and might reduce/eliminate any specific microbial community signatures which might be associated with the population demographics in a given NTA (e.g., those related to age group, ethnicity, etc.).

X.\u00a0bisporus is a foodborne mold originally isolated from licorice and associated with spoilage of high-sugar foods such as cakes and confectionaries (51). Although we cannot confirm the original source of X.\u00a0bisporus OTUs on ATM keypads, it seems plausible that this fungus had been transferred from people who had recently handled baked goods, particularly in a commuter-heavy area such as midtown Manhattan, where there are many nearby convenience stores and caf\u00e9s selling this type of food product to business workers. A previous metagenomic analysis of the NYC subway system also detected food signatures across surfaces in the urban transit system (29), suggesting that genomic material from meals is routinely transferred around NYC by human inhabitants and may thus represent a common component of the urban microbiome.",

                    "text": "The human microbiome represents an obvious source of microbial communities on ATM keypads; however, SourceTracker analysis did not pinpoint human skin or any other body site as a primary source of microbes (Fig.\u00a05). In contrast, outdoor air and household surfaces\u2014kitchens, restrooms, pillows, and televisions\u2014were the most commonly identified source habitats. Household surfaces may effectively collect microbial communities from various sources (food, family members, pets, dust) and thus represent a pool of microbes originating from different habitats. This is in contrast to swab samples collected directly from human body sites (see, e.g., the published datasets [44, 45] used as human sources in this study), which represent the personalized microbiome associated with a single person. Since each ATM keypad in New York City is most likely utilized by hundreds of people each day (and may come into contact with air, water, and microbes from different urban surfaces), the microbial communities obtained in this study may represent an \u201caverage\u201d community that is effectively pooled from vastly different sources (14). An alternative and potentially more plausible hypothesis is that the SourceTracker algorithm may be highly sensitive to the primer region and sequencing platform used to generate the \u201csource\u201d training sequences. The samples from the household surfaces representing the majority of assigned sources for ATM keypads were generated using the same primer set and sequencing technology utilized in this study (Illumina HiSeq/MiSeq data using the 515F/806R primers to amplify the 16S rRNA gene [10, 53]), which may explain why these household surfaces were identified as source habitats. In contrast, human microbiome \u201csource\u201d samples were generated using different primer sets and sequencing platforms (e.g., Roche 454), and the distinct rRNA region and lower-throughput nature of the sequencing technology may confound the ability of SourceTracker to assess source/sink habitats between these samples. Overall, the vast majority of ATM microbial communities were derived from an \u201cunknown\u201d source, and it is also possible that this unassigned community fraction represents human-associated microbes that SourceTracker was unable to recognize.",

Technical artifacts in the 16S rRNA data set were obvious and persistent (Fig.\u00a04C); future studies should aim to sequence all samples on a single Illumina run, in order to avoid the introduction of technical artifacts that may confound data analysis. Low-diversity microbial communities were unexpectedly recovered from \u201ccontrol\u201d samples, requiring stringent data filtering to remove all potential contaminant OTUs. The collection protocol for ambient air control samples may have inadvertently collected species from airborne dust; alternatively, the manufactured swab samples we utilized may not have been entirely sterile. Regardless, our stringent data filtering protocol ultimately resulted in a significant reduction of sequences per sample\u2014representing a level of coverage that was sufficient for microbial ecology analyses but a sequencing depth that was far from ideal (particularly for the 16S rRNA amplicons which were not sequenced as exhaustively as those of the eukaryotic 18S rRNA). Thus, our analyses may have failed to detect some microbial diversity and community patterns that might only have become apparent with extremely deep sequencing of ATM keypads (e.g., rare biosphere biomarker taxa), especially in lower-coverage bacterial/archeal samples.",

Additional, complementary analyses will be needed to determine whether the detected species are metabolically active and whether some species can survive on ATM keypads for extended periods of time. Although we detected DNA signatures from potential pathogens on ATM keypads, more-targeted studies will be needed to confirm the source, viability, and distribution of such pathogenic species on urban surfaces. For example, the human pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis cannot be differentiated from closely related zoonotic species using 18S rRNA loci alone (Maritz et al., submitted) and in this study we could not confirm the likely source of eukaryotic pathogen species. Future studies of the urban microbiome should also include an expanded examination of ATMs in both indoor and outdoor locations. LEfSe biomarkers in our 16S rRNA data set (see Fig.\u00a0S5\u00a0in the supplemental material), as well as previous studies of urban transit systems (28), have indicated that indoor/outdoor location is a significant factor structuring microbial communities. Depletion/enrichment of indoor and outdoor biomarkers may be especially relevant for eukaryotic taxa, especially for pollen and airborne fungal spores. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess such patterns in the present study, as the subset of eukaryotic 18S rRNA data included only samples from indoor ATMs. In addition, there is a need for expanded studies that investigate shifts in ATM microbial communities over time, as well as for more-intense sampling covering a wider geographic area (including sample collection across other cities worldwide). Our study provided only a small snapshot of microbial communities, in terms of time points and the number of ATMs sampled. Nonetheless, the present data set has provided a significant baseline for microbial diversity on ATM keypads, broadly encompassing two taxonomic domains. The detection of microbial biomarker taxa in this study provides a jumping-off point for future study design and hypothesis testing, hinting at potential large-scale trends that may influence the distribution and persistence of microbes on highly trafficked urban surfaces.",

To process raw Illumina data, paired-end reads were merged using join_paired_ends.py, a minimum overlap of 10\u00a0bp, and a 15% error rate in the overlapping bases. Joined reads were subsequently demultiplexed using split_libraries_fastq.py with the rev_comp_mapping_barcodes flag; a minimum Phred quality score of 20, allowing 5 poor-quality bases before read truncation; and an 0.70 minimum fraction of consecutive high-quality base calls to include reads. Merged sequences that passed quality filtering thresholds were subsequently clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the pick_open_reference_otus.py workflow (56) with 10% subsampling and de novo clustering of failure reads. Any resulting singleton OTUs were discarded (the minimum cluster size was set at 2 reads). A 97% clustering cutoff was used for 16S rRNA OTU picking, representing a standard approach in microbial ecology studies of bacteria/archaea. A more stringent 99% clustering cutoff was used for 18S rRNA OTU picking, as the 18S rRNA gene is typically more conserved and less variable in eukaryotic genomes (57) and because the use of a higher clustering cutoff is also in line with many comparable environmental sequencing studies of eukaryotes (58). For OTU picking, initial reference-based OTU clustering was carried out against Greengenes 13_8 (97% OTUs) for 16S rRNA data (59) and SILVA 119 (99% OTUs) for 18S rRNA data (60).

In this curated database, taxonomic hierarchies were standardized and corrected, and some protist sequences were manually added to improve representation of some groups (Maritz et al., submitted).

Second, any OTUs without a BLAST hit were subsequently compared to the entire SILVA 111 database (99% OTU representative sequences) containing reference sequences from all three domains. The taxonomy from the top BLAST hit was again accepted for any OTUs matching the reference database, and failed sequences were denoted as \u201cunassigned.\u201d In both taxonomy assignment steps, the minimum E value cutoff for BLAST searches was set at 1e-20, and the top BLAST hit was taken for each representative OTU sequence; sequences were denoted as \u201cunassigned\u201d if they did not return any results meeting this E value cutoff criterion.",

Next, any OTUs that failed to align to reference rRNA databases or were flagged as chimeric were removed. OTU tables were subsequently subjected to abundance-based filtering, removing low-abundance OTUs representing less than 0.0005% of total reads in the data set (using the min_count_fraction 0.000005 flag in QIIME for filter_otus_from_otu_table.py, following the methods described in reference 64). Finally, initial exploration of data and SourceTracker analysis (see below) suggested that a large proportion of environmental OTUs were derived from blank samples sequenced as controls.

Demultiplexed 16S rRNA sequences from ATM keypads were subjected to closed-reference OTU picking (using the pickTheseOTUs.sh script as described in reference 68), and the resulting OTU table was merged with closed-reference tables from published studies (downloaded from GitHub: https://github.com/jfmeadow/BEMAFinalAnalysis/tree/master/individual_biom_tables). Closed-reference OTU picking was necessary for SourceTracker analysis, as this database-dependent approach avoids potential erroneous/chimeric OTUs and further enables the concurrent analysis of datasets obtained using different 16S rRNA primer sets, read lengths, and sequencing platforms. Among the ATM samples in this study, blank controls were also marked as potential sources of microbial communities in order to identify any potential contamination introduced during PCR and sequencing. Unfortunately, SourceTracker analysis was not possible for our eukaryotic data set because of the comparative lack of published 18S rRNA studies from urban and built environments, database limitations, and the prevalence of other markers used for other eukaryotic studies (internal transcribed spacer [ITS] rRNA, etc.).",
