Recent murine studies have shown that cutaneous microbes can influence the development of skin immunity and disease.5, 6, 9 Determining whether cutaneous microbes play a role in the initiation of AD could provide an opportunity to reduce the development of atopic disorders. To investigate the skin microbiome in infants before the development of AD, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing of skin samples from a birth cohort and determined that shifts occur in the skin microbiome over the first 6\u00a0months of life, with site-specific bacterial communities changing in composition and diversity over time. We also identified a difference in staphylococcal colonization at a site of AD predilection that predates the presentation of disease, with patients who went on to be affected at a later date colonized by fewer Staphylococcus species. Birth method and feeding method did not appear to affect skin bacterial communities at the sites and time points studied in this cohort, but other studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

This biogeography of the skin microbiome has been observed in older children and adults.26, 34 In previous infant skin microbiome studies, site-specific differences were not evident in the first 3\u00a0months of life because infants were studied at a single time point immediately after delivery or were sampled at a single time point and analyzed in age cohorts of 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 6 to 12\u00a0months.27, 28 The present study differed by sampling the same cohort of infants over a 6-month interval (day 2, month 2, and month 6) and observed site-specific differences as early as the second day of life, a time point not previously investigated. The bacterial diversity of 1 skin site, the Pf, shifted at time points differentially from the 3 other sites studied. Because this specific skin site has not been examined in a cohort this young, the results might be related to a unique aspect of infant skin physiology, exposure, or both or specific to this cohort. Interestingly, the body site differences in bacterial communities also reflect observed site differences in immune cell density and composition from human skin.35, 36, 37, 38 Investigating site-specific differences in host-microbial interactions can enhance our understanding of the predilection of certain skin regions for dermatologic diseases.",

The increasing Shannon diversity observed in the first year of life in this infant cohort supports previous work that showed increased evenness or similar numbers in each taxa in bacterial communities from 3 skin sites in a cross-sectional study.27 During puberty, significant shifts in skin bacterial communities likely reflect the changes in skin physiology and systemic hormones.26 Changes in the skin microbiome observed in these infants potentially reflect the influences of waning maternal hormones, as well as the continued development of infant skin. For example, lipophilic Propionibacterium species are relatively abundant on the facial sites at neonatal day 2 but decrease substantially at later time points. This corresponds to the high sebaceous activity triggered by maternal hormones in the first days of life, which wane significantly in the weeks after birth.40 These findings lead to additional questions, including whether neonatal skin disorders, such as cephalic pustulosis (also known as neonatal acne), attributed to maternal hormones potentially might also be affected by alterations in skin bacteria.",

The relatively low abundance of pathogenic staphylococcal species on the Af of 2-month-old infants who later had AD at 12\u00a0months of age is intriguing in the context of this prior work in mice. Whether cutaneous exposure to commensal staphylococci during early infancy can have a similar effect remains unknown, and further investigation is needed to understand whether this might influence the development of AD. The absence of S aureus in AD lesions of this cohort was somewhat surprising, given that this species is associated with AD.29, 41, 42, 43 A\u00a0culture-based analysis of infant skin demonstrated S aureus colonization in approximately 21% of AD lesions among infants in their first year of life.44 The differences might be related to inherent differences in the study populations and/or the severity of sampled skin lesions between the study groups.",

The small sample size and rare number of cesarean deliveries in the current study potentially contribute to the lack of statistically significant differences between the skin microbiota of infants born vaginally or by means of cesarean section at the earliest time point in this study, day 2 of life. Although this study analyzed different sites over a longer timeframe than the previous work, a larger study would be needed to address this question. Birth method might determine skin colonization very early in life; however, environmental exposures and skin physiology might predominate in shaping bacterial communities after this initial delivery. The skin barrier and FLG mutations are additional aspects of skin physiology that have been studied in relation to atopy. Although approximately 10% of subjects in BASELINE publications and the Irish population have FLG mutations, the current cohort had fewer FLG mutations than expected because of sampling effects. Because a large proportion of patients with AD do not carry FLG-null alleles, the results in the current cohort avoid the potential effects of FLG mutations and remain relevant to AD. With interest in the potential immunologic effects of neonatal exposures to skin microbes,6, 46 characterizing the early skin microbiome in neonates with and without FLG mutations and the timeframe for possible development of immune tolerance would be of significant clinical importance.",

Early studies of the skin microbiome will identify possible associations between specific microbes and human health and disease, but extensive further research will be required to unravel the pathophysiology and key mechanisms involved. Longitudinal sampling of the same subjects as internal controls and the initiation of sampling soon after birth were features of this study that improve the ability to identify distinct microbial patterns that could provide insight into the skin microbial milieu before the development of skin disease. As a result, we were able to define the site specificity and longitudinal shifts of the skin microbiome in the first 6\u00a0months of life, as well as the difference in relative abundances of commensal staphylococci before the development of AD. Additional investigations are needed to test whether site-specific differences in skin microbes influence the development of AD.",
