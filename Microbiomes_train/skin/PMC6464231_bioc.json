Disruption of the gut microbiota (or dysbiosis) is associated with pathological intestinal conditions such as obesity and malnutrition, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, and chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases [1\u20134]. The recent increase in clinical microbiome studies has been facilitated by advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, which offer rapid and comprehensive culture-independent techniques, mostly relying on DNA sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene [5].",

Except for settings where mucosal biopsies are available, such as during colonoscopies, stool samples are the \u201cgold standard\u201d starting material for this purpose [6]. However, their acquisition can be challenging. Most importantly, timing can be jeopardized if a study participant does not produce a stool sample within the desired time window. Furthermore, immediate transport and adequate storage is difficult during evenings and on weekend days. These organizational drawbacks may be overcome if rectal swabs are used instead. In fact, they can be obtained at specific time points, thus preventing prolonged periods between sampling and storage. As shown by previous studies, microbiota profiles of rectal swab samples are, to some extent, similar to the ones of fecal samples, even though contamination with skin bacteria can occur and may be caused by incorrect sample collection [6\u20139]. To our knowledge, so far only few studies have used rectal swabs for microbiota sampling in a clinical setting. Published work mainly focused on healthy subjects and on patients with inflammatory bowel disease [6, 10]. Therefore, little is known about the applicability of rectal swabs during chemotherapy and antibiotic treatment, interventions which are both known to affect the intestinal microbiome [11, 12]. In this study we report on the usability of rectal swabs for microbiota sampling in a longitudinal cohort of high-risk hematological and oncological patients undergoing chemotherapy and antibiotic treatment.",

For each individual, specimens were collected simultaneously. To account for different sampling times, storage conditions, primer pairs and DNA extraction batches, we included technical replicates for volunteer H1 (S1 Table). Moreover, as the transport medium may impact microbiome profiling at several steps and influence bacterial survival/growth, DNA extraction and PCR efficiency, we obtained a second deep rectal swab from four of the volunteers immediately after the first swabWhile a Cary-Blair medium (composition: Na2HPO4 1.1 g/l, C2H3NaO2S 1.5 g/l, NaCl 5.0g/l, CaCl2 0.09 g/l, agar 5.6 g/l) is used as a standard solution in our swabs, the second swabs were transported and frozen in saline solution (0.9% NaCl).

PCR amplification primers targeting the V3-V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were designed by Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) using a proprietary layout based on established methods (S2 Table) [19, 20]. To monitor possible errors due to contaminations or read-to-sample miss-assignment, primers for 8 control samples with specific barcodes were also included (S2 Table). PCR reactions contained 1X Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity Master Mix (New England BioLabs, GmbH, Frankfurt Am Main, Germany), 0.5 \u03bcM each forward and reverse primers, and 15\u201320 ng of genomic DNA template. Reactions consisted of 30 s at 94\u00b0C; 30 cycles of 10 sec at 95\u00b0C, 20 sec at 55\u00b0C and 10 sec at 72\u00b0C; and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 2 min. Each sample was amplified in duplicate and purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP PCR Purification system (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Purified amplicons were quantified using the fluorometric PicoGreen dsDNA reagent. A pooled sample was created by combining equimolar amounts of the 96 individual amplicons and sent to Eurofins Genomics for library quality control and sequencing. Libraries were mixed with 1% PhiX genomic control library and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq v3 as 300-bp paired-end runs.",

Reads had to possess the full barcode free of errors, be longer than 200 bp after removal of the variability region and quality trimming, and have a minimum of 30 bp overlap with no mismatches during merging of paired-end reads. Joined reads, which had to be longer than 400 bp, were then quality filtered during demultiplexing with QIIME v. 1.9 [22], allowing a minimum Phred quality score of 20 and no ambiguous bases. Failed sequencing was considered for samples having a number of reads lower than the negative sample(s) included in the run. Chimeric sequences were then removed with USEARCH v. 6.1 [23]. Samples containing less than 2,000 sequences were heuristically considered not adequate for accurate profiling of the bacterial community composition and omitted for subsequent analyses. OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) picking and taxonomic classification were performed with QIIME. Open-reference OTU clustering and taxonomy assignment of sequences were performed with UCLUST [23] against the Silva database Release 119 [24] at the 97% similarity level. OTUs with a number of sequences < 0.01% of the total number of sequences were discarded as a second level of quality-filtering. After conducting a rarefaction test to determine the sufficient number of sequences for an accurate estimation of species diversity, the OTU table was finalized using a rarefaction level of 2,000 sequences per sample.",

The analysis included samples from a patient and seven healthy volunteers as well as a mock bacterial community with known composition (S1 Table). Overall, highly consistent and reproducible results were obtained, proving that our new pipeline allows microbiota analysis of complex human intestinal samples. Specifically, we obtained a high number of reads from both stools and rectal swabs (range 12,490\u2013415,602, median 93,112). Although the gDNA concentration from stools was higher than that from rectal swabs, this difference was not maintained during PCR amplification nor reflected in the sequencing output (S1 Table).",

Besides overall similarities of the taxonomic profiles, few differences in the individual identified taxa were detected (Fig 1A). In particular, the relative abundance of Enterococcaceae was higher in the patient swab sample (p<0.01), and Anaeroplasmataceae were more abundant in the patient stool (p<0.05), while stool samples from the healthy volunteers showed a significantly lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae and a higher proportion of Ruminococcaceae, compared to the swab samples (p<0.001). As expected, the patient showed a completely different microbiota profile compared to the healthy subjects (Fig 1B). Interestingly, our validation samples did not reveal higher abundances of skin commensals in swabs compared to stools, as seen in the patient samples (see below). In fact, Corynebacteriaceae were only detected in the patient samples and in two healthy subjects (H1 and H5), while the Streptococcaceae family was present in very low abundance in all rectal swabs from healthy individuals (mean of all samples: 0.2%).",

Previous studies have already compared rectal swabs with samples from different origins [6\u20139]. We validated the pipeline for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing on rectal swabs and stools obtained from seven healthy volunteers and one patient, confirming reproducibility of the results. Between swab- and stool-derived microbiota profiles we found some small differences, which may partly be due to dissimilarities in the sampled body sites (rectal mucosal wall versus stool), as previously reported [33]. Since it was not our aim to prove equality of these two sampling techniques, only this small number of comparative specimen from volunteers or patients were collected. Furthermore, the relatively low number of contaminant reads found in sterile swabs and negative controls is within the range of previously reported contamination of laboratory consumables [29], and is therefore expected not to confound the taxonomic composition of the patient samples.",

Unfortunately, few studies have so far reported the actual adherence to their sample collection protocol, but, as an example, the exclusion of up to 16% of patients due to insufficient samples possibly indicates adherence problems [27]. From our experience, the sample yield in the present study is very high, demonstrating a practical advantage of rectal swabs over stool samples. There were no adverse events related to obtaining deep rectal swabs in this patient cohort. However, the current study was not designed to assess safety and we are not aware of other studies systematically assessing adverse events of this sampling technique in a similar patient cohort. Nevertheless, rectal swabs are broadly implemented in hematological and oncological departments in Germany for several years now, further supporting our safety observations.",

The DNA quantity extracted from swab samples showed very divergent values including negative ones. However, we found no relation between the amount of DNA and sequencing output. This suggests that differences in DNA yields were caused by technical issues producing inaccurate negative values, i.e. the phenol and ethanol used during DNA isolation might have interfered with the signal intensity of the DNA quantitation assay, producing inaccurate negative values. After omitting samples with less than 2,000 reads, 405 of 418 samples (96.9%) could be included for further analyses. In comparison to previous studies performed in the setting of hematological and oncological patients, our rectal swab processing and sequencing yielded even a higher number of reads per sample than in stool samples [27, 34]. Importantly, the amount of DNA extracted from most of the rectal swabs (range 600 pg\u20145.5 \u03bcg), after depletion of host DNA, might allow metagenome sequencing (e.g. on an Illumina platform), which nowadays produces high quality data with as little as 10 pg of starting material [35, 36].",

In a recent stool sample-based study comprising 34 patients receiving induction chemotherapy for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia [34], a wide range of alpha diversity among baseline samples was observed, with a mean Shannon index of 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7\u20132.4; range, 0.1\u20133.5). Similarly, in the present cohort, the mean Shannon index at baseline was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.4\u20133.0; range 0.01\u20134.5). The observed rates of domination on family (83.5% of samples) and genus level (57% of samples) are also comparable to their reported rate, with domination found in 79.2% of the samples [34]. In our cohort, Enterococcal domination was the most frequently observed one, as previously reported [27, 34]. In line with previous studies, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the microbial diversity over the course of chemotherapy [11, 27, 34] and after antibiotic exposure [12, 27, 34].",

We identified a relatively high number of patient samples in which typical skin commensals (Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus) were present or even dominated the microbiota profile of the samples. This difference was not seen in the validation samples from a patient and various healthy volunteers. While we cannot rule out that these taxa represent actual skin microbiota of the patients resulting from flawed sampling technique, one could hypothesize that the high antibiotic burden and ongoing chemotherapy led to a shift towards these taxa in the distal intestinal microbiome. In half of the cases with observed domination by skin commensals, we found an increased abundance of the respective genus in the previous or subsequent sample, suggesting a true and possibly treatment-related change in the microbiota composition of the upper rectal mucosa. Interestingly, high relative abundances of skin bacteria, most frequently Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., were also observed in studies using stool samples [27, 34]. Corynebacterium was reported to be more frequently found in rectal mucosal biopsies than stool samples in one study performing 16S rRNA gene sequencing on samples from healthy volunteers [33], suggesting that they may not only be part of the anal skin flora but also that of the rectal mucosa. Further studies are needed to address this issue including a larger number of comparative stool and rectal swab samples from patients.",

The characteristics of the rectal swab sample collection, including diversity metrics and domination frequencies, are comparable with those of similar clinical cohorts using stool samples. Our results confirm previous findings about the impact of chemotherapy and antibiotic exposure on microbial diversity. The increased abundance of skin commensals may possibly be related to chemotherapy and antibiotic exposure in this specific cohort, rather than contamination with skin bacteria during sampling. This observation needs to be investigated in future studies in more detail. In conclusion, rectal swabs have a number of practical advantages possibly leading to higher sample adherence and patient compliance. The total amount of DNA recovered from rectal swabs should also be sufficient for metagenome sequencing, which could provide more comprehensive insights into the functional and metabolic potential of the microbial community.",
