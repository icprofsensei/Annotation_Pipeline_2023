The ability of textiles to host or otherwise sequester microbes has been well documented; however, their reciprocal potential for liberating airborne bacteria remains poorly characterized. In response, a multi-season survey of bacterial bioaerosols was conducted in the origin and terminus of residual paths which are specifically designed to isolate soiled hospital textiles as they are moved to laundering. This survey used conventional optical particle counting which incorporated multi-channel fluorescence in conjunction with molecular phylogenetic analyses to characterize the bioaerosols liberated during soiled textile storage\u2014immediately before and after the occupation of a modern hospital. Although outfitted with a HEPA filtration system, the number of airborne particles presenting fluorescing optical signatures consistent with airborne bacteria and fungi significantly increased in textile holding rooms soon after the hospital\u2019s commissioning, even though these isolated residual areas rarely host personnel. The bioaerosol liberated during textile storage was characterized using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes. Gene copies recovered by quantitative PCR from aerosol collected in co-located impingers were consistent with fluorescence gated optical particle counting.",

Since typically less than 1\u00a0% of microbes can be recovered by culture from any environment [3], ecological observations from many culture-based studies can no longer be considered robust in this context. While results from culture-based studies are widely regarded as quantitative (colony-forming units (CFU)), the magnitude of quantitative recovery as CFU from field studies is at best an indicator and can only verify the presence of a culturable pathogen as defined by classical perspectives.

Several investigations on the subject ensued until comprehensive (modern) reviews emerged nearly two decades later, many with military experience as their driver. Whyte and coworkers [9] leveraged pre-Vietnam era reports on human shedding of infectious \u201cdust\u201d to air to determine bacterial bioaerosol emission rates from hospital and reported what would be expected when conventional clothing was worn, with a range of between 300 and 19,000 bacterial particles/min; the higher value of which is close agreement with ranges recently reported by quantitative PCR analysis of aerosol associated with clothed students in an isolated classroom setting [10].",

Like their garment counterparts, these textiles are constructed of a wide range of natural and synthetic materials. With respect to microbial associations with non-uniform textiles, a substantial cohort of contemporary literature also exists; some investigations in this arena, however, treat non-uniform textiles as immobile surfaces, regardless of their density or patient interface. Bedding, pillow cases, and privacy curtains have been the subject of numerous culture-based studies where potential nosocomial pathogens have been recovered by culture and by modern forensic genetics. Borkow and coworkers (2008) implicated bed linens and other non-uniform textiles as active partitioning sources, positing that \u201ccontaminated textiles might be an important source of microbes contributing to indirect contact and aerosol transmission of nosocomial-related pathogens\u201d [12]. This report paralleled a compelling 2008 editorial to the Hospital Disinfection Society that compiled converging lines evidence suggesting pajamas and bed sheets can be a significant source of nosocomial pathogens in indoor air [13].",

Using accepted industrial hygiene methods, air was sampled in MRSA infection wards. Airborne MRSA-containing particles were isolated in all mean aerodynamic diameter ranges between 7 and 0.65\u00a0\u03bcm and averaged between 2 and 3\u00a0\u03bcm diameter before bed making but were >5\u00a0\u03bcm during bed making activities. The number was significantly higher than otherwise identical aerosol background for as long as 15\u00a0min after bed making and MRSA was detected on many proximal surfaces. The results suggest that MRSA was recirculated in the air (in relatively high numbers) and directly associated with the movement of contaminated bed linen. Also, investigating the occurrence of airborne microbe transmission in connection with contaminated textiles (and other dry surfaces) was a British study which surveyed the Liverpool adult cystic fibrosis (CF) center [15]. This report characterized the extent of environmental contamination with an epidemic strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa quantified using\u00a0a PCR assay specific for the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES). While no persistent environmental reservoirs were found, LES was detected in the majority of air samples from inside patients\u2019 rooms, the adjacent ward, proximal corridor, and the outpatient clinic. This study suggested that textiles contributed to aerosols which may have played a significant role in patient-to-patient spread of LES.",

Driven by concern over nosocomial infection rates after the extended implementation (and enforcement) of hand-washing practices in the health care industry at large, interdisciplinary research teams have brought renewed attention to the potential for bioaerosol generated by the common perturbations and movement of contaminated textiles; whether those textiles are on humans (pajamas/uniforms), are in/on bedding, or otherwise serve as some other functional barriers (curtains/aprons). In this context, Beggs and coworkers [18] published a series of articles consistent with the notion that airborne transmission of bacteria [may] contribute significantly to hospital-acquired infections; included in this series were considerations of some textiles mediating the transport of microbes.",

In the USA, soiled linen handling practices are surveyed periodically by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, which requires bagging, limits volumes and caps holding times for centralized textile collection. There are many case studies of aerobiological sampling in health care settings but those implicating textiles as a bioaerosol source, have been limited by the following factors: (i) low replicate sampling designs, (ii) the use of conventional culturing assay techniques, (iii) the use of \u201cgrab\u201d sample paradigms, and (iv) a relatively small number of observations compared to the actual numbers of environments. Modern observations of airborne microbial numbers in health care settings are rare and only beginning to emerge in literature. With this perspective in mind, we used molecular bioaerosol surveys complimented with fluorescent-optical particle characterization to\u00a0determine how moving soiled textiles can contribute to bacterial bioaerosol loading during routine residuals handling in a modern hospital.",

A wideband bioaerosol sensor (WIBS v4.0) similar to that previously described by Healy and coworkers [23] collected air at 1\u00a0L/min and used dual-wavelength excitation and fluorescence detection, while simultaneously measuring characteristic optical diameter from scattered light. With the portable WIBS variant used here, fluorescence was induced by sequential exposure to UV irradiation from flashlamps filtered at 280 and 370\u00a0nm. Fluorescence emitted due to 280-nm excitation was detected in two wavebands, 310\u2013400\u00a0nm (type a) and 420\u2013650\u00a0nm (type b), using dedicated photomultipliers. Fluorescence emitted due to 370-nm excitation was detected between 420 and 650\u00a0nm (type c). Optical diameter was determined by light scattered from exposure to a 635-nm laser; it is reported here as an equivalent optical diameter (EOD) and defined as the diameter of a spherical particle, with a fixed refractive index (calibrated with 2.0 and 2.8\u00a0\u03bcm latex beads in air at 25\u201345\u00a0% RH), scattering the same light intensity as the measured (bio)aerosol. Following the annotation introduced by Perring [24], fluorescence was categorized as one of the three types, which considers intensity calibrated to a known threshold in three excitation and emission bandwidths\u2014individually and in specific combinations. Here, we observed, classified, and counted particles based on one of three dominant fluorescence motifs, where emission was observed in a single channel (type a), concomitantly in two adjacent channels with the same excitation (types a and b), or concomitantly in all three channels with different excitation as well as emission (types a, b, and c).",

PCR products were normalized using a SequalPrep\u2122 kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), pooled, lyophilized, purified, and concentrated using a DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Zymo, Irvine, CA). Pooled amplicons were quantified using Qubit Fluorometer 2.0 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and each pool was diluted to 4\u00a0nM and denatured with 0.2\u00a0N NaOH at room temperature. The denatured DNA was diluted to 15\u00a0pM and augmented with 25\u00a0% of PhiX DNA (manufacturer\u2019s control) immediately prior to sequencing. Paired-end sequencing was performed with version 2.0 of the Miseq Control Software, using a 500-cycle reagent kit (v 2.0). The resulting sequences were sorted by barcodes in the paired reads with a python script and assembled using PHRAP [28, 29]. These assemblages were trimmed over a moving window of five nucleotides until their average quality met or exceeded 20. Pairs that did not assemble, or trimmed sequences with more than 1 ambiguity (any non-specific base call) or shorter than 200\u00a0bp, were discarded. Potential chimeras were identified with UCHIME (usearch6.0.203_i86linux32) [30] using the Schloss SILVA reference sequences [31] and removed from subsequent analyses. Assembled sequences were aligned and classified with SINA 1.2.11 [32] using the conglomerate of bacterial sequences in SILVA 115NR99 [33].

Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) describing the airborne bacteria recovered were produced by clustering sequences with identical taxonomic assignments. Explicet v2.9.4 (www.explicet.org) [34] was used to visualize and compare the relative abundance of bacterial bioaerosol collected during the early summer and early winter, at the origin and terminus of soiled textile storage (Fig.\u00a04). This process generated 167,556 sequences of average length 300\u00a0nt. The average number of sequences per sample was 41,889 (a minimum of 32,602 and a maximum of 50,913). The median Goods coverage score for bioaerosol libraries generated here was >99.65\u00a0%, indicating that the depth of sequencing was sufficient to describe the diversity within these samples [35, 36]. Alpha diversity was calculated at the rarefaction point of 32,950 sequences with 1000 bootstrap re-samplings (rarefied Goods coverage, p values via two-part analyses [37]).",

In this context, relative microbial exposures in health care settings are apportioned between contact surfaces (touch) and aerosol association (inhalation and fomite); the balance of those exposures is currently unknown [18, 42]. What is now known about bioaerosols in this context is that they originate from all persons, regardless of health status [10, 43], as well as the broad variety of service textiles (bedding, uniforms, privacy curtains, etc.) [44, 46], wastes [46, 47], and building materials unique to the modern health care environment [48]. Considering that mandatory personal hygiene (e.g., hand washing) [17] and cleaning practices are up to the most modern standards and assessments, nosocomial diseases remain at alarming levels; this precipitates better characterization of occupational bioaerosol as a last frontier needed for expanding risk assessment in this arena [49].",

The contemporary optical loading and phylogenetic characterization presented in this demonstration study are consistent with this hypothesis. This survey capitalized on a unique opportunity to characterize (bio)aerosols in isolated textile handling rooms, just prior to, and following their commissioning into full hospital service. It is only through isolation\u2014either in the field or in laboratory-based chamber studies\u2014that the magnitude and character of bioaerosol from these sources may be reliably estimated. Toward this practical isolation condition, unique here was the fact that soiled textiles, originally held in a HEPA-filtered patient area, communicated\u00a0bioaerosol to a terminal storage room through a single conduit with a single commodity\u2014soiled textiles, bagged, or otherwise. Given it was far removed from the source (nine floors), the fact that the terminal holding room is, by design and operational policy, sealed, unventilated, and rarely occupied, the particle characterizations and bacterial assemblages recovered here suggest that soiled textile handling liberates significant quantities of bacterial bioaerosol in the absence of immediate human intervention. With specific respect to linen holding sites and chutes, their design and operation are intended to be under negative pressure with respect to their immediate surroundings, a condition which was episodic in the originating textile holding room monitored here. With the service load of hospital linens, it is not surprising that the dominant bacterial bioaerosol assemblages observed here are found in abundance associated with human hair, skin, and to a lesser degree gut. Given the resolution of the Illumina platform and the most common primers and pipelines used to process bacterial phylogenetic data, the more dominant gene sequences in assemblages observed here are the same as those reported from recent bioaerosol studies of selected wards [41] and isolated classrooms [10]; however, the relative abundances of the dominant genera are markedly different, which may be due to different sampling schemes (dry filters) and sequencing/processing platforms used (e.g., pyrosequencing, QIIME). Although the dominant genera observed contain species that are known nosocomial pathogens, they cannot yet be unambiguously identified in these types of data sets given the resolution of the bacterial DNA primers associated with the most current Illumina platforms.",

Multi-channel fluorescence appears to\u00a0provide a surrogate for real-time bioaerosol reporting; this is particularly true for many settings in health care environments, given the low potential for environmental interferences in the relatively clean atmosphere found in filtered air in this (HEPA) and other hospitals.",
