Thirteen of 26 wounds harbored pathogens according to culture analyses, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common (13/13). Candida (1/13), pseudomonas (1/13), and streptococcus (7/13) were less prevalent. Contralateral skin was associated with comparatively low densities of bacteria, and overt pathogens were not detected. According to DGGE analyses, all wounds contained significantly greater eubacterial diversity than contralateral skin (P < 0.05), although no significant difference in total eubacterial diversity was detected between wounds from which known pathogens had been isolated and those that were putatively uninfected. DGGE amplicons with homology to Staphylococcus sp. (8/13) and S. aureus (2/13) were detected in putatively infected wound samples, while Staphylococcus sp. amplicons were detected in 11/13 noninfected wounds; S. aureus was not detected in these samples. While a majority of skin-derived DGGE consortial fingerprints could be differentiated from wound profiles through principal component analysis (PCA), a large minority could not. Furthermore, wounds from which pathogens had been isolated could not be distinguished from putatively uninfected wounds on this basis. In conclusion, while chronic wounds generally harbored greater eubacterial diversity than healthy skin, the isolation of known pathogens was not associated with qualitatively distinct consortial profiles or otherwise altered diversity. The data generated support the utility of both culture and DGGE for the microbial characterization of chronic wounds.",

                    "text": "Clinical laboratory investigations of chronic wound infections commonly rely upon bacterial isolation by culture, which most efficiently detects numerically dominant organisms amenable to growth on laboratory media. While this is a useful and well-established approach for the detection of many common pathogenic bacteria associated with wound infections, it may underestimate microbial diversity (45). Thus, various culture-independent methods have been assessed in a limited number of studies as potential adjuncts or replacements of culture for the microbial characterization of chronic wounds (11, 18, 23). Culture-independent investigations of the bacterial diversity utilizing pyrosequencing (11), PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (8), other DNA fingerprinting techniques (39), and quantitative PCR (qPCR) (31) have generally identified a greater range of bacteria than traditional culture techniques, and taxa not previously detected in wounds have been reported. For example, Hill et al. (23) used 16S rRNA gene clone sequence analysis and culture to assess the microbial composition of a chronic venous leg ulcer. Acinetobacter sp. was detected by culture in both swabs and tissue samples; swab samples yielded Proteus sp. and Candida tropicalis, whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis was only isolated from tissue samples. Importantly, however, molecular analysis of the same samples identified clones that were closely related to the cultured organisms, together with species that had not been isolated from the samples (Morganella morganii, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Peptostreptococcus octavius). A study conducted by Davies et al. (8), which assessed the microbiota of healing and nonhealing chronic venous leg ulcers, also reported greater eubacterial diversity according to PCR-DGGE than culture. Of the sequences obtained in the Davies study, 40% were organisms which had not been isolated from the same samples using culture (8). These are among a limited number of reports in regard to the ability of molecular techniques to identify a distinct range of organisms in wounds and also illustrate the importance of sampling techniques and sample sites for the outcome of analyses (23).",

The similarity scores ranged from 10 to 60%, with the average similarity score below 50%, indicating that, generally, skin surface and wounds were colonized with divergent consortial profiles. However, clustering can be seen for a minority of DGGE profiles derived from wound and skin consortia in the results in Fig. 1. This is explored further via principal component analysis of similarity matrix scores (Fig. 2) in which two major clusters are apparent. While one of these represents a combination of skin and wound profiles, the other is composed primarily of skin-derived consortial profiles. Comparisons between diversity indices derived from individual wound and skin samples (Table 4) revealed marked differences in eubacterial diversity between all the wound and skin samples and those where no pathogens were cultured (P < 0.05), although significant differences were not detected between wound and skin cohorts where pathogens were isolated.",

PCR amplicons with homology to coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in 8/13 and Staphylococcus sp. in 3/13 of the wound samples where no pathogens were isolated (data not shown). For both tissue and skin samples, the most prevalent genera were Staphylococcus and Bacillus; the latter were not detected by culture. Additionally, a greater number of obligate anaerobic organisms were identified in both the skin and tissue isolates by DGGE than by culture. According to PCR-DGGE analyses, of the 22 genera identified in the wound tissue samples and 21 genera in skin swabs, four were unique to the wounds (Klebsiella sp., Abiotrophia sp., Escherichia coli, and Peptoniphilus sp.) and three were unique to the intact-skin swabs (Kocuria rhizophila, Morexellaceae sp., and Rhodocyclaceae sp.).",

Wound infection is commonly defined according to the presence of pathogens and colonization densities exceeding \u2265106 organisms per gram of tissue and the development of significant tissue damage and clinical signs of infection (32, 36, 37).",

The current study investigated the relationship between the isolation of overt pathogens from wounds, as defined by established culture methods, and eubacterial diversity, assessed using PCR-DGGE. These techniques were also used to compare the bacterial composition of wounds and contralateral healthy skin sites. Semiquantitative culture, often used clinically as an indication of infection severity (22, 25, 35, 41), was adopted, providing a means by which culturable pathogenic organisms could be detected and a relevant comparator for PCR-DGGE.",

Additionally, 2 of 13 samples (E and M) were also associated with Candida sp., Pseudomonas sp., and hemolytic group G streptococci. Coliforms were isolated from seven samples, of which six also harbored skin and/or enteric flora, indicating putative colonization or contamination. A moderate growth of coliforms was noted for patient sample Z, which was not considered to be associated with infection based on clinical details. A scant culture of E. coli was also isolated from sample A. While E. coli and other coliforms may be considered pathogenic and thus significant in specific wound cultures, such as gastrointestinal surgical wound sites, in the context of the current study, sample A was classified as not harboring wound pathogens due to the low numbers of E. coli isolated and the wound type from which it was isolated.",

Several sequences obtained using DGGE analysis could not be identified to species level, an observation which is commonly associated with this method. Isolation methods detected a more limited range of taxa than DGGE from both wound tissue and skin swabs. Additionally, a greater number of obligate anaerobic organisms were identified in both the skin and tissue isolates using the PCR-based technique than the culture, despite the fact that validated anaerobic isolation methods were used. Interestingly, a higher proportion of those taxa present on the contralateral (control) skin sites occurred in wounds which did not harbor overt pathogens than in those from which pathogens had been isolated. Within the 13 tissue samples where pathogens had been isolated, 11 produced no bands (i.e., PCR amplicons) which matched to the contralateral skin swab profile, whereas all tissue samples where no pathogens had been isolated were associated with least one or more matching skin swab bands. Previous diversity profiling studies of the human skin microbiota by Gao et al. (17) and Grice et al. (21) suggest that while there is comparatively little interindividual compositional similarity in healthy skin microbiotas, high levels of conservation between the contralateral skin sites in individuals can be demonstrated (17, 21). On this basis, contralateral intact-skin samples may provide an insight into the normal microbiota of the site and thus, the microbial composition of skin prior to wounding.",

                    "text": "Primary colonizers of wounds are reportedly often members of the autochthonous skin microbiota due to their proximity to the tissue injury (4, 5). However, delayed healing may enable adventitious bacteria to proliferate and thus compete against autochthonous species. Additionally, since the microbiota of healthy skin is likely to be water and nutrient limited (6), hydration and nutrient availability may have a marked influence on the microbial composition of wounds. The restricted nutrient and moisture content of healthy skin may limit the proliferation of fastidious organisms and thus select for Gram-positive bacteria, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, corynebacteria, and propionibacteria (6, 7). In contrast, the comparatively nutrient-rich environment of a wound may facilitate the growth of a wider variety of organisms, including S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, streptococci, enterobacteriaceae, and other facultative anaerobic species (6, 9). The transition from healthy skin to colonized/infected wound may therefore be associated with the clonal expansion of bacteria not normally associated with health. In most cases, wounds were colonized by more diverse microbial communities than healthy skin, but the overall eubacterial diversity of wounds which harbored pathogens and those from which no pathogens were isolated did not differ significantly. It could be agued that this observation highlights the utility of culture as a straightforward means of detecting wound pathogens. However, it also indicates the need for further investigations of potential associations between microbial profiles and clinical outcome, because the contribution of altered microbial colonization to causality remains poorly understood, in contrast to the involvement of overtly pathogenic species, which are more readily detectable by culture (25). Previous analysis of chronic wound diversity by Dowd et al. (11) using pyrosequencing, DGGE, and rRNA gene shotgun sequencing identified several genera and species not isolated upon culture, a method which in general failed to identify the primary bacterial populations of the wounds tested (11). Importantly, sequence analyses of DGGE amplicons within the current study indicated that wounds which did not harbor pathogens were associated with a greater proportion of normal skin bacteria than were infected wounds.",

Both DGGE and culture have distinct characteristics: culture is relatively simple to implement, cost effective, and can detect numerically dominant culturable pathogens. It is, however, limited by the culturability of target bacteria. Conversely, DGGE can be used to analyze complex communities while facilitating the identification of unculturable organisms which may only represent as little as 1% of the total bacterial population (33).
