Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of 3,237 samples from 42 time series of microbial communities from nine different ecosystems (air; marine; lake; stream; adult human skin, tongue, and gut; infant gut; and brewery wastewater treatment), we introduce a new method to detect typically rare microbial taxa that occasionally become very abundant (conditionally rare taxa [CRT]) and then quantify their contributions to temporal shifts in community structure. We discovered that CRT made up 1.5 to 28% of the community membership, represented a broad diversity of bacterial and archaeal lineages, and explained large amounts of temporal community dissimilarity (i.e., up to 97% of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity). Most of the CRT were detected at multiple time points, though we also identified \u201cone-hit wonder\u201d CRT that were observed at only one time point. Using a case study from a temperate lake, we gained additional insights into the ecology of CRT by comparing routine community time series to large disturbance events. Our results reveal that many rare taxa contribute a greater amount to microbial community dynamics than is apparent from their low proportional abundances. This observation was true across a wide range of ecosystems, indicating that these rare taxa are essential for understanding community changes over time.",

A key unknown is how often rare taxa become abundant and hence play a potentially greater role in the ecology of a given system. However, there are a small but growing number of studies that have documented the dynamics of rare microbial taxa and provide some insights. For example, in the Arctic Ocean, rare microorganisms exhibited biogeography, indicating that some rare taxa, like more abundant taxa, have distributions based on their ecological requirements (19). In a sulfide-rich artesian spring, rare taxa exhibited patchiness over 1 mm (20), which also suggests that rare taxa can have clear distributions at fine spatial scales. Additionally, some coastal sand communities have rare members that do not often become abundant, suggesting that these members have a minimal influence on biogeochemical processes (21). Conversely, in other coastal sand communities, rare microbial taxa were shown to be as sensitive as prevalent taxa to environmental changes caused by an off-shore oil spill (22). The discrepancy between the latter two studies highlights our modest knowledge of the potential contributions of rare taxa and especially calls into question whether such conclusions are transferable to other ecosystems. Therefore, to understand the general importance of rare microbial taxa, their contributions to the larger community and their dynamics, we must systematically interrogate microbial communities from a variety of ecosystems by using consistent methods.",

We introduce a simple method for identifying CRT from temporal studies of diverse microbial communities and apply this method to a suite of time series data sets generated by using 454 pyrosequencing or Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Each data set contained a large percentage of very rare taxa, as typical for microbial communities (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material). These data sets were previously analyzed by using a closed-reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-picking protocol (27) for direct comparison of their temporal patterns (see Table\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material) (28). Because this OTU-picking protocol discards reads that do not match reference sequences at a minimum of 97% identity, it minimizes the rare OTUs arising from sequencing or PCR errors. The closed-reference protocol also avoids the \u201cOTU splitting\u201d that may occur when OTUs are defined by using a de novo protocol. We show that within many ecosystems, CRT contributed to temporal patterns of microbial diversity disproportionately to their relative abundances, suggesting an important role for CRT in structuring microbial communities over time. We also explicitly examine the influences of sampling frequency, study duration, and sequencing depth on the detection of CRT.",

The first data set was a human-skin-associated community (male M3, right palm, 8,230 taxa) sampled approximately daily for 1\u00a0year and sequenced with Illumina technology (rarefied to 5,031 reads per sample). The second data set was a less rich temperate lake community (Trout Bog epilimnion, Wisconsin, 1,816 taxa) sampled periodically over 4\u00a0years with more intensive sampling during the ice-free season and sequenced with Illumina (rarefied to 5,134 reads per sample). The third data set comprised a marine surface water site in the western English Channel L4 (2,017 taxa) that was sampled approximately monthly for 6\u00a0years and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing (rarefied to 3,526 reads per sample). We subsampled these time series along a range of sampling intensities and study durations and then calculated the percentages of CRT (see Fig.\u00a0S3 in the supplemental material). From these analyses, it is clear that sampling intensity has a greater influence on the detection of CRT than the study duration does. Analysis of the impact of the number of samples included in a study revealed the same pattern across ecosystems (see Fig.\u00a0S3), suggesting that sampling intensity is the most critical factor and should be taken into consideration when designing studies to explore CRT dynamics. Temporal sampling intensity will be an ecosystem-specific parameter that depends on the anticipated rate of community turnover or average life span of microorganisms in the system (30).

We found that each community included taxa that exhibited rare-to-prevalent dynamics. The incidence of CRT ranged from 1.5 to 28% of the total community membership (Fig.\u00a01A) (b value, >0.90; relative abundance, >0.5%); however, it is important to note that when comparing CRT contributions to different ecosystems, these values should not be interpreted as absolute. To determine the contribution of CRT to the temporal dynamics of the community (temporal community dissimilarity), we calculated the fraction of Bray-Curtis similarity attributable to CRT (Fig.\u00a01B and 2; see Materials and Methods), which ranged from 0 to 97% of the total community dissimilarity between time points (Fig.\u00a02). This is because when CRT were abundant, their dynamics often explained a large fraction of the community dissimilarity. Interestingly, some ecosystems, such as the human gut (Fig.\u00a02C), exhibited relatively more punctuated contributions of CRT to community dissimilarity over time, while other ecosystems, such as air (Fig.\u00a02A), exhibited a more consistent contribution of CRT.",

In our data sets, this would be indicated by a taxon that was below the limit of detection, achieved abundance at one time point, and subsequently returned to undetectability; we refer to taxa exhibiting this dynamic as \u201cone-hit wonders.\u201d We wanted to understand how many CRT could be designated one-hit wonders, which would allow us to refine hypotheses about the potential for immigration events to affect community dynamics. We found that while the majority of CRT were detected at multiple time points, a subset of CRT were detected only when they bloomed, possibly because of immigration followed by a bloom and a crash (one-hit wonders: median, 9% of detected CRT; minimum, 0%; maximum, 53%, Fig.\u00a01C). Generally, those communities that had relatively higher levels of temporal variability (i.e., air and stream communities) had more one-hit wonders than communities that were more stable (i.e., lake hypolimnia) (28). An exception to this were the brewery wastewater treatment communities, which were relatively stable but had high percentages of one-hit wonders; however, this time series also had a low sampling intensity, which could contribute to an increase in CRT as discussed above. Another scenario is that a one-hit wonder was always present but below the limit of detection. Because the percentage of one-hit wonders was moderately correlated to the sampling intensity (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, \u22120.51; P = 0.0005), longer or more intensely sampled time series may reveal multiple occurrences of a conditionally rare taxon that was originally designated a one-hit wonder.",

The epilimnion was warm and oxygenated and had high light penetration, while the hypolimnion was cold and anaerobic and had low light penetration. Usually, thermal stratification weakens every spring and autumn as cool air causes the epilimnion temperature to decrease and meet the hypolimnion temperature, initiating seasonal mixing. Previous work showed that the microbial community structure and chemistry recovered to their predisturbance state within 20\u00a0days after the forced mixing in summer and that the hypolimnion community was more sensitive to mixing than the epilimnion (32).

The first group of CRT were probably driven by key environmental conditions associated with the phenomenon of mixing (i.e., oxygenation of the hypolimnion, redistribution of nutrients in the water column) and were unaffected by seasonal differences. This dynamic suggests that these CRT were rare but always present. The second group of CRT likely gained a competitive advantage given the novel environmental conditions caused by the forced mixing in summer. For example, OTU 333636, a member of the deltaproteobacterial family Haliangiaceae (Fig.\u00a04B), bloomed after anaerobic conditions had been reestablished in the hypolimnion immediately following the forced mixing event but while the temperature remained elevated above typical seasonal averages (31), suggesting that this CRT thrives in warm and anaerobic waters, which would never have occurred during natural mixing events. The third group of CRT likely had seasonal constraints, and the fourth group of CRT may use multiple strategies to adapt to an increasing biomass, or similar but unmeasured environmental niches were established periodically.

Our previous analysis suggested that the longer a community is observed, the more the perceived magnitude of the changes in community structure is reduced, suggesting very low rates of community change over long-term observations (28).

However, while our strategy identifies taxa that can be targeted for further analysis, it does not explicitly reveal the ecological mechanisms of CRT within a community. These mechanisms are diverse and numerous, and determining the ecological properties of individual taxa is difficult and costly (33,\u201335). However, we provide one example in which we capitalized on a temporal lake study to deduce CRT ecology by contrasting routine dynamics with a disturbance. In doing so, we were able to distinguish CRT that responded to both natural and forced mixing events from those that responded only to a forced event. These methods provide a springboard for hypothesis generation and are useful for understanding the contributions of CRT to different types of ecological dynamics. For example, in the context of human microbial consortia, similar analyses may be done in instances of pathogen invasion or pathobiont formation to understand when, how, and under what environmental conditions a typically rare or invasive member of the human microbiome is able to thrive following such a disturbance.",

Although the ecological roles of many rare taxa are unknown, it has been suggested that rare taxa are not necessarily important for the comparison and interpretation of microbial community patterns (10, 38). As more data from temporal studies of microbial communities are collected, it is likely that the dynamics of CRT will play an increasingly important role in our understanding of both the subtle temporal variability (39) and the disturbance responses of microbial communities. Furthermore, we know that some rare taxa play critical ecological roles in ecosystems, for example, diazotrophs in seawater (40), bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers in soils (41, 42), and methanogens in guts (43). Thus, detection of CRTs will provide clues as to the identities of rare taxa that play previously unknown but equally critical ecological roles. Finally, studies that use unsaturated sequencing efforts to infer community assembly rules may attribute the appearance of new taxa to dispersal, when these taxa may instead already persist in the community in low abundance or in a dormant state (24). Therefore, close inspection of CRT dynamics in sufficiently sequenced communities will provide insights into the different roles of dispersal and blooms in community dynamics.",

Furthermore, our analysis revealed synchronous dynamics of many CRT within a community and suggests that some CRT may be indicators of environmental changes that are unmeasured, providing clues about the identities of more subtle physical, chemical, or biological drivers of microbial dynamics.

This approach involves the partitioning of a time series into as many window subsets as possible given the number of observations and calculation of the number of CRT detected within each window. For example, a 250-time-point series would first be divided into one 250-point window, two 249-point windows, three 248-point windows, etc. Subsampling of a data set to fewer sequences per sample (rarefaction) was performed by using the multiple_rarefactions.py script in QIIME v. 1.6.0 (50). We also rarefied the observed taxa classified as CRT by generating replicated, subsampled data sets at systematically varied sampling effort (i.e., number of samples). The percentage of CRT was calculated for each subsampled data set as described above. To extrapolate rarefaction curves to a standard sample size, the three parameters of the function\n",
