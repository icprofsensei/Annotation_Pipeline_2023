The microbiology of skin \u2013 a unique interface between the host and environment - is a major research focus in human health and skin disorders, but is less explored in other mammals. Here, we report on a cross-population study of the skin-associated bacterial community of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), and examine the potential for a core bacterial community and its variability with host (endogenous) or geographic/environmental (exogenous) specific factors. Skin biopsies or freshly sloughed skin from 56 individuals were sampled from populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and South Pacific oceans and bacteria were characterized using 454 pyrosequencing of SSU rRNA genes. Phylogenetic and statistical analyses revealed the ubiquity and abundance of bacteria belonging to the Flavobacteria genus Tenacibaculum and the Gammaproteobacteria genus Psychrobacter across the whale populations. Scanning electron microscopy of skin indicated that microbial cells colonize the skin surface. Despite the ubiquity of Tenacibaculum and Psychrobater spp., the relative composition of the skin-bacterial community differed significantly by geographic area as well as metabolic state of the animals (feeding versus starving during migration and breeding), suggesting that both exogenous and endogenous factors may play a role in influencing the skin-bacteria. Further, characteristics of the skin bacterial community from these free-swimming individuals were assembled and compared to two entangled and three dead individuals, revealing a decrease in the central or core bacterial community members (Tenacibaculum and Psychrobater spp.), as well as the emergence of potential pathogens in the latter cases. This is the first discovery of a cross-population, shared skin bacterial community. This research suggests that the skin bacteria may be connected to humpback health and immunity and could possibly serve as a useful index for health and skin disorder monitoring of threatened and endangered marine mammals.",

The largest mammalian organ in direct contact with the environment is the skin, and the skin of marine mammals is a particularly interesting surface because it is in constant contact with seawater microorganisms, which are generally orders of magnitude more populous than airborne microorganisms surrounding terrestrial mammals [4], [5]. Additionally, seawater microorganisms can exhibit population shifts related to altered environmental conditions [6], [7] that have the potential to influence the composition of microbes residing on marine mammal skin.",

Further, specific groups of bacteria were associated with most individuals studied, regardless of whale age or sex [8]. These findings suggest that humpback whales may harbor specific skin-bacterial associates. However, documenting if and how skin bacterial communities vary between humpbacks from different populations and geographic areas is necessary to understand the extent of this host-bacterial specificity. Importantly, documenting the presence of a core, or central, microbial community across all members of a population of marine mammals may provide an indication of a relationship that is fundamental to the host [9], [10].",

This species is found in all oceans, and the structure, dynamics and ecology of many populations have been well-studied [11], [12]. Humpback whales migrate annually from mid- to high latitude feeding grounds to low latitude breeding and calving grounds [13]\u2013[17], and some individuals hold the most extensive mammalian migration on record [18]. The ubiquity and migratory nature of this species provides an opportunity to study the impact of various oceanic conditions on the composition of the skin microbiota. Furthermore, humpback whales fast while on migration and throughout the breeding season, and so there is also an opportunity to evaluate how routine metabolic stress may affect microbial communities. Lastly, this species is vulnerable to human impacts in many parts of its range, and the effects of those impacts can be cryptic. Understanding the relation of the skin microbiome to health and geography may enhance monitoring and conservation efforts of populations.",

At first mention, it might seem nonsensical that the surface epidermis, a layer of dead skin, has any connection to health. However, in humans there is evidence suggesting links between the composition of the skin-bacteria and inflammatory, allergic conditions [19]. Also, shifts in skin-bacteria together with an altered host immune response may lead to the development of skin diseases or disorders [20]. There has been much less attention towards the study of marine mammal skin, microbes and health. Historically, microbes have been observed on the skin of odontocetes, and antibiotic production by these cells was thought to prevent colonization of the skin by pathogens [21]. Additionally, captive cetaceans exposed to water purified with oxidizing agents (chlorine or ozone - aimed to reduce microbial abundances in the seawater) resulted in the animals developing skin infections that may have been linked to a lack of beneficial microbes on their skin [22]. It is clear that an understanding of skin-bacteria on normal, healthy marine mammals is necessary before any connections about health can be explored. Importantly, this framework will be useful to recognize if and how skin-bacteria differ on unhealthy animals, including the growing number of marine mammals displaying skin lesions and disorders [23].",

Samples were also collected from a South Pacific breeding area (American Samoa, winter 2009) and a North Atlantic feeding area (the Gulf of Maine, summer 2009) (Table S1). Skin was obtained by biopsy sampling techniques on the upper flank near the animal's dorsal fin [24]. Additionally, humpback whales shed pieces of skin from during high-energy surface behaviors [25] and these can originate from any skin surface on the body. Freshly dislodged samples were collected using nets and sieves. Marine mammals have been shown to shed the surface epidermis regularly [22], and therefore sloughed skin is likely only slightly older in age than the biopsied skin. Additionally, some samples were obtained from the suction cup used to attach acoustical tags to whales (Table S1). Skin samples were handled using sterile tools, with the exception of sloughed skin nets and sieves which were only rinsed with seawater between uses. However, skin was in contact with these nets and sieves for a very short amount of time (seconds). Skin was kept on ice for no more than 10 hours before freezing. Samples of seawater were also obtained with the Hawaii samples, and collection methods outlined previously [8]. We also requested samples from stranding and entanglement response networks to compare free-swimming whales to individuals that were potentially health-impaired. As detailed in Table S2, the samples available to this study included two live whales entangled in fishing gear and three whales sampled after death.",

After removal of sequencing and PCR-related noise and quality trimming [31], the total number of sequences was reduced to 536,055 with an average read length of 261 bp. An additional 10,768 sequences were found to be chimeric and removed. In order to identify non-bacterial sequences, the data were classified using first the RDP [32] and secondly using the Silva taxonomy training sets with a Bayesian classifier. Sequences identified as chloroplasts (1,885) were subsequently removed from the dataset. A distance matrix was constructed of the sequences, and sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the average neighbor algorithm at a 97% similarity level. In order to verify the taxonomy of sequences, representative sequences from unclassified OTUs (\u223c2000 sequences) were aligned using the SINA web aligner and imported into a Silva 106 non-redundant database using the ARB software [33]. After aligning the sequences in the database, sequences (152) further identified as chloroplasts or mitochondria were removed, and sequences belonging to a number of candidate groups that were not included in the training set were re-classified. The finalized dataset included 522,954 sequences with an average length of 261 bp, grouped into 9,088 OTUs. In order to compare the alpha and beta diversity of samples of equal sample size, the samples were randomly sub-sampled to a depth of 3,663 sequences, which corresponded to the lowest number of sequences recovered in the dataset for an individual sample.

Oligotyping analyses were performed on 148,974 Tenacibaculum and 140,729 Psychrobacter reads using the oligotyping pipeline version 0.9 (available from http://oligotyping.org). To reduce the impact of noise, minimum substantive abundance (M) of an oligotype was set to 50 for both runs, as a result of which, any oligotype with most abundant unique sequence with less than 50 reads was removed from the final results. Oligotyping analysis of Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter spp. reads resulted in 98 and 53 oligotypes, respectively. Noise removal with M discarded 2.00% and 0.73% of Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter spp. reads, respectively.",

A distance matrix was constructed using Bray-Curtis similarity, and both nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination (2-dimensional representation of bacterial community structure) and hierarchical clustering analysis (CLUSTER) (similarity dendrogram) were used to explore groupings of the samples without pre-defined sample classes. PERMANOVA tests were used to test for significant differences in bacterial community composition between pre-defined sample groups, e.g., whales sampled in different geographic areas, and were conducted using a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix of relative abundance data with 9999 permutations under Type II sum of squares and a reduced model. Significance levels were confirmed using Monte Carlo simulations. When significant differences were identified between sample categories, similarity percentages test (SIMPER) was preformed to assess each OTU's contribution to a pre-defined sample group. Multidimensional scaling analysis on samples using Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter spp. oligotypes were performed using Morisita-Horn distance measure.",

Rarefaction analysis of the 3,662 SSU rRNA gene sequences per sample revealed that the majority of the whale-skin bacterial communities reached a plateau at <100 OTUs (Figure 1). The average observed number of bacterial OTUs associated with whale skin varied among 71\u201399 with some variation among samples (Table 1). There was no significant difference in the richness of the skin-bacterial communities (measured by OTU abundance) among geographic areas (Mood's Median Test, chi-square\u200a=\u200a2.92, df\u200a=\u200a3, p\u200a=\u200a0.404), and other measurements of diversity and evenness were also comparable (Table 1). OTU abundance from all of the humpback samples was significantly less than seawater (Mann Whitney Test, W\u200a=\u200a2346, p<0.01, Table 1, Figure 1), suggesting that factors shaping the skin and seawater microbial communities are distinct.",

The majority of whale skin samples were associated with bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria, and many skin samples also contained bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes and Alphaproteobacteria. Two genera, Tenacibaculum (Bacteroidetes) and Psychrobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) were found to be abundant within the majority of whale skin samples (Figure 3b), and collectively made up a large portion, 55\u201375%, of the skin-bacterial community (Table 3). SIMPER analysis showed that dissimilarities in the abundance of the different Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter spp. OTUs, as well as several other bacterial groups, contributed to the differences in the skin-bacteria of whales from different geographic areas (Table S2). SIMPER analysis also demonstrated that the locations with more similar skin-bacteria (American Samoa and Hawaii) harbored sequences affiliated with Cardiobacteria and Aquabacterium spp., which were not present in the results of samples from the other locations (Table S2). Animals sampled in American Samoa and Hawaii were not actively feeding (except for one nursing calf which were not included in the analysis), and therefore their metabolism is catabolic compared to the anabolic (feeding) metabolism of whales in Alaska and the Gulf of Maine. This metabolic difference was found to correspond significantly to the composition of the skin-bacteria, regardless of geographic area (Table 2). The differences in skin-bacteria related to metabolic state were largely attributed to different sequence variants of Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter spp. (in addition to some other taxa, Table 4).",

Five of the OTUs (27, 41, 436, 257 and 403) were present in all samples except those from Alaska.

Similar to the trends for the entire community, PERMANOVA analysis revealed that the Tenacibaculum spp. oligotypes differed in composition with the distinct metabolic states of the whales (Table 5). Additionally, the Tenacibaculum spp. oligotypes differed by sample type (biopsy or sloughed skin), suggesting that skin age and/or anatomical location of the skin plays a role in shaping these communities (Table 5).",

The Psychrobacter spp. sequences grouped into several distinct phylogenetic lineages, and were also related to sequences recovered from dolphin blow (Figure 7). Oligotyping analysis of the sequence variations within the Psychrobacter spp. OTUs revealed 53 distinct sequence types, and these were found to differ significantly by geographic location as well as metabolic state (Table 5). As seen for Tenacibaculum spp., the Psychrobacter spp. oligotypes were most similar for whales sampled in American Samoa and Hawaii (Figure 6B).",

These sequences appear to be specific to humpbacks, and are secondly related to sequences recovered from dolphin blow. The dolphin blow interacts with the blowhole epidermis and thus it is possible that dolphins also harbor specific strains of Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter on their skin. The role or interactions of these microorganisms with humpback skin, and possibly with other marine mammals, is of considerable interest as their interactions may be linked to host health.",

Sequences belonging to this genus have most commonly been recovered from cold environments including Antarctic soil, sea ice and deep-sea environments, and the genus is generally referred to as psychrophilic and osmotolerant [51], [52]. Additionally, sequences have been found associated with krill and ascidians [53], [54]. One possible reason that Psychrobacter spp. are so prevalent on humpback skin may be related to their tolerance of the \u2018extreme\u2019 type conditions of the skin surface. In the course of a single year, these animals are exposed to a large temperature range, on the order of \u223c6\u201325\u00b0C between their seasonal feeding and breeding areas. As noted previously, some migrations are the longest of any known mammal [18], and likely create a stressful type environment for survival of many bacteria. The genome of P. arcticus strain 273-4 does provide genetic evidence for survival under cold and stress conditions, including changes in membrane composition and synthesis of cold shock proteins [55], and it is possible that humpback-associated Psychrobacter spp. also possess these qualities.",

Water temperature as well as seawater nutrients typically vary between the subtropical (Hawaii, American Samoa) and mid- to high-latitudes (Alaska, Gulf of Maine) examined in this study, and these environmental differences may impact skin-bacteria. The structure of the bacterial community was most similar between animals sampled in Hawaii and American Samoa, and it appears that a feature of the oligotrophic tropical water, and/or a change in animal physiology, may be related to this trend. The animals from Hawaii and American Samoa exhibited catabolic metabolisms at the time of sampling. Similar shifts in microbes have been associated with changes in metabolic state and nutrient flux in other animals, but have previously only been observed in the gut microbiome [57]. For the whales, these catabolic periods may be associated with physiological-based factors previously observed in humans, which may directly affect the skin. These include decreased repair and replacement of the skin cells (and other cells with typically high turnover), decreased production of immune-related cells as well as decreased adiposity, and increased blood pressure [58]. These catabolic states may also be related to decreased wound healing [59]. The connection between metabolism, skin-bacteria and wound healing is particularly important for marine mammals due to the high incidences of lesions reported in many populations [23]. For example, it is possible that wound healing is prolonged when animals are in their breeding grounds. In this scenario, skin bacteria producing antibiotics or other defenses may be critical for protection of the whales.",

This finding could be linked to the fact that the biopsied skin contained epidermis and dermis down to just before the blubber, whereas the sloughed skin was more representative of surface dead skin (stratum corneum). However, the stratum corneum does appear to be a major location in which the bacteria colonize. Anatomical location may also play a role in structuring the bacterial community. The biopsy samples were all taken from the same location on the animal (near dorsal fin), whereas the sloughed skin was removed during breaching activities from unknown locations on the animal. Repeated skin samplings of different anatomical locations from captive animals may be necessary to fully resolve the more subtle influences of anatomy on skin-bacteria. It should also be noted that the nets used to collect the sloughed skin were not sterilized prior to sampling and therefore some bacterial cells may have been transferred among samples or from the environment. Future studies using sloughed skin should consider net sterilization or single-use samplers in order to minimize the potential for cross-contamination.",

Histological analysis of sectioned tissues may further reveal cells embedded within the epidermis. Human skin primarily supports microbial cells on the epidermis, but microbes are also found within the dermis, including hair shafts, sweat glands and sebaceous glands [60]. The specific structure of humpback skin has not been previously studied, but the epidermis of other species of whales are 15\u201320 times thicker than humans and excessively smooth, thus providing barrier properties to the environment, as well as limiting the attachment by microbes and penetration by pathogens [22], [23], [61], [62]. Additionally, marine mammal skin is thought to provide an innate barrier as well as programmed immune protection [63]. These features collectively suggest that bacteria are most likely restricted to the epidermal surface.",

Our results represent a wide demographic sampling of humpback whales with no obvious health impairment. It indicates some notable differences from live entangled and dead humpback whales, although available sample sizes are small. Entanglement can cause acute death, as well as chronic health effects from injury, infection and impaired mobility [64]. The live entangled whales in this study were thought to have been entangled for an extended period and exhibited mild external signs of impairment in large whales, such as pale skin, a proliferation of cyamids (whale lice) and diminished body condition [65], [66]. The differences in skin bacteria from free-swimming whales also suggest an altered health state, although we cannot exclude the possibility that bacteria were introduced and exacerbated by the foreign materials entangling the whales. Skin-bacteria from dead animals also differed from the trends reported for the free-swimming animals. Most striking was the appearance of pathogenic and predatory bacteria such as Clostridia and Bdellovibrio spp. in the deceased and entangled individuals. The emergence of these bacteria is probably related to the decay of the skin as well as a likely decrease in host immune functions and possibly also the alteration in body temperature. Interestingly, these animals tended to harbor fewer of the core bacterial community members (compared to normal animals), which further suggests that host-controlled features are probably related to the presence of these possible mutualistic or commensal populations. In laboratory studies, an alteration in the abundance of the major skin-bacterial associates has been demonstrated in mice experiencing skin disorders [67]. The microbe-host dysbiosis model introduced by Scharschmidt and Fischbach [20] explains how an imbalance in the composition of the skin microbes (perhaps caused by exogenous factors) can lead to an alteration of the host immune response. Alternatively, there may be host-susceptibility factors that cause an alteration of the host immune response (e.g., excess inflammation), which in turn triggers an endogenous shift in the skin-microbial community. Changes in both microbiota and immune response could cause a negative feedback cycle, in which both parameters become even more significantly altered.",

This skin surface barrier and its associated core bacterial community may be an important component to maintaining health and preventing lesion formation. However, many features of this microbial association remain uncharacterized. Future studies examining the metabolism and antibiotic production of widespread Tenacibaculum and Psychrobacter spp. associates on humpbacks are needed, as well as determining whether these bacteria are more broadly found on other species of marine mammals. Additionally, examining how these cells are able to maintain residence on humpback skin is important for a broader understanding of the features that pathogen or lesion-associated bacteria may use to preserve their invasion. Finally, future studies of animals with skin lesions or disorders and other characterized health and inflammation disorders will greatly advance our understanding of the connection between the skin microbiota and health. Some of these future studies may have broader implications for mammalian skin health, including humans, and offer an opportunity to study skin-microbial adaptations under exposure to remarkably diverse environmental conditions. Overall, understanding the connections between the skin surface bacterial communities, lesion formation and animal health may aid our conservation efforts of these important animals in a time of unprecedented change to the ocean environment.",
