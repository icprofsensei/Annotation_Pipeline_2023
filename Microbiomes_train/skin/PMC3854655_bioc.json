One of the grand challenges in the study of metagenome data involves reconstructing the different microbial genomes from a mixture of sequence reads. This is referred to as the metagenome assembly problem. Due to the high species complexity and the short length of sequencing reads from current sequencing technologies, the genome reconstruction goal becomes more difficult to attain if not impossible. Also within a community, microbes (or organisms) vary in abundance, diversity, complexity, genome lengths and may have not been individually sequenced before. Likewise, the current sequencing technologies produce large volume of sequence reads, and reads that may have varying error idiosyncracies [5]. As such,the metagenome assembly problem is complex and challenging [6] and is often subject to further analysis as a collection of short reads.",

These methods align reads or contigs using global and local sequence alignment algorithms (characters) to identify regions of similarity between sequences [15]. The second approach contains unsupervised clustering methods that identify groups of similar sequences within metagenome samples. This grouping of similar sequences is commonly known as \"binning\" problem. Different groups in a particular sample is also referred to as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and the number of OTUs gives an approximation of species diversity in a sample [16-18]. OTU-based approaches are not constrained due to the absence of a complete coverage in taxonomic databases. Several environmental samples contain microbial organisms that have never been laboratory cultured, and as such do not exist in genomic databases.",

LSH algorithm maps the original dimension of input sequences into reduced dimensional space by randomly choosing subset of sequence positions. LSH-based method is also used by Buhler et. al. [26] to detect all pairs of similar segments within long genomes. Our LSH-function is enriched to use gapless, subsequences of fixed length (w-mer), which helps us to reduce the number of false positives and improve cluster quality. The LSH-Div algorithm follows a greedy and iterative framework for assigning OTUs (or clusters) to each sequence. LSH-Div further uses these OTU assignment results and introduces standard species richness metrics which bring more explanation to clustering results.",

Since, the synthetic dataset was simulated from 43 species-specific gene sequences, 43 was considered to be the ground truth. Figure \u200bFigure33 shows the number of OTUs at various distance cutoff levels for LSH-Div. We use two synthetic datasets that were simulated to have reads with less than 3% and 5% errors.

Specifically, we implemented the k-mer distance cutoff (from ESPRIT) to estimate the OTUs for different inputs varying from 0.01 to 0.10. For the validation purpose, we first compute the maximum pairwise global alignment distance for each OTU produced by ESPRIT and report as the final result, the maximum score obtained across all the different OTU assignments. We also report the validation results by computing the maximum pairwise k-mer distance and the global alignment distances for each OTU, produced by LSH-Div. These results are reported in Table \u200bTable2.2.
