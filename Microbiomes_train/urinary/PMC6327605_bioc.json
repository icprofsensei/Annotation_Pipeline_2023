However, it was only with the development of 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing that it was established that most body sites are colonized with bacteria, but the urinary tract was not tested in the Human Microbiome Project [4]. Recently, the microbiota unique to the urinary tract have been reported both in males and females [5, 6]. In females, the microbiota seem to be more complex with higher interindividual variability than in males [7], but no clear relation with urinary tract infections (UTIs) has been demonstrated until now. No evident core microbiota have been found yet, however, this could possibly be present when grouping by age [7, 8].",

However, the beta-diversity after (categorized) antimicrobial drug use was significantly different (p\u2009<\u20090.005), meaning that the use of antimicrobial drugs is clearly associated with a different composition of the microbiota. This difference was still present after adjustment for sex, age, diabetes and kidney function (p\u2009<\u20090.005) (Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a02). Since other antimicrobial drug prescriptions prior to the last prescription before sampling could also have influenced the genitourinary microbiota, a confounder that represented the number of other antimicrobial drug prescriptions since approximately 1995 was added in a sensitivity analysis. This did not influence the results (p\u2009<\u20090.005). In another sensitivity analysis where macrolides were added to antimicrobial drug use, the community structure was also different after antimicrobial drug use (p\u2009=\u20090.03) and borderline significant after adjustment for confounders (p\u2009=\u20090.05).",

We only considered the last prescription before urinary sampling, which most likely has had the strongest influence on the genitourinary microbiota. However, it could be assumed that other prior prescriptions could also have influenced the genitourinary microbiota, but additional adjustment for the number of prior drug prescriptions did not influence the results. Due to this and due to the cross-sectional study design, our results do not differentiate between antimicrobial treatment as a cause for dysbiosis versus the possibility that long-term dysbiosis was the cause of UTIs and subsequent antimicrobial treatment. This must be considered, since it has been hypothesized that UTIs are the result of dysbiosis of the microbiota in the genitourinary tract [16]. There are several arguments in favor of the hypothesis that dysbiosis of the genitourinary microbiota has caused UTIs, resulting in antimicrobial treatment. First, several of the antimicrobial drugs groups that have been prescribed to our participants, e.g. sulfonamides and trimethoprim (J01E) and nitrofuran derivatives (J01XE) are mainly, if not solely, prescribed for urinary tract infections by general practitioners (GPs) in the Netherlands. Second, in our population the dysbiosis was persistent for years after stopping the antimicrobial drugs. Although, this could also mean that antimicrobial drugs can have a persistent effect on the genitourinary microbiota.",

Differences were demonstrated in the urinary microbiota of kidney transplant patients who received prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment compared to healthy controls, indicating that the genitourinary microbiota may be modified by antimicrobial drugs use [17]. In contrast to our study, the genitourinary microbiota of patients using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had a decreased microbial diversity compared to healthy controls. This may be due to current versus past antimicrobial drug use, age and use of immunosuppressive medication of the kidney transplant patients, and the fact that this group differs from community-dwelling elderly [17]. Another study has already shown associations between the urinary microbiota and UTIs. Differences were shown in the microbiota of women on the day of surgery between women who did or did not develop a post-operative UTI [18]. However, one might also argue that changes in microbiota caused by antimicrobial drugs increase susceptibility to UTIs. For instance, it was shown in a cohort with 113 women that 27% experienced at least one recurrence within 6\u2009months after an initial UTI, whereas in a cohort of 179 Finnish women 44% had recurrences [19, 20]. Also, it was shown in mice that transient exposure to Gardnerella vaginalis, a member of the vaginal microbiota, can trigger E.coli reservoirs in the bladder to cause a UTI [21], which might be an effect of antibiotic use. In our population, Lactobacillus, which is thought to play a role in the prevention of UTIs in women [22] was lower in the participants who used antimicrobial drugs. Also, a depletion of Lactobacillus iners in urine has recently been associated with postoperative UTI risk. This study also showed that enrichment of a diverse mixture of uropathogens was associated with postoperative UTI [23]. We found that E.coli was higher in the participants who had used antimicrobial drugs. It is not clear what the cause is or the consequence, and therefore further studies to elucidate the causal relationship between the genitourinary microbiota and the use of antimicrobial drugs are needed.",

The Rotterdam Study has prospectively gathered records without prior knowledge of research hypotheses. This includes data on drug prescriptions obtained from a collaborative database of all community pharmacies in the Ommoord area. Furthermore, the performed analyses compared the total microbiota compositions instead of comparing individual elements separately. However, our study also has some limitations. First of all, we only had a small sample size, but even in these small groups we could detect significant differences in microbiota. A second possible limitation may be that all participants were 70\u2009years or older, whereas it has been shown that the diversity of gut microbiota declines after the age of 70 [24], and it has been assumed that the urinary microbiota also change with age [7, 25]. Although, the genera found in the genitourinary microbiota in our study were also found by others, our findings should be extrapolated with care to younger individuals, especially premenopausal women [7]. A third limitation is the methods that we used. We collected midstream urine samples compared to urinary catheterization used in some other studies. Unfortunately, the latter is difficult to accomplish in a community-dwelling cohort of healthy elderly. The participants obtained clear instructions for collecting clean-catch midstream urine and diverse collection methods have indicated that the urinary microbiota is not simply the consequence of contamination or urethral colonization [7, 17]. However, it should be kept in mind that it has been shown that the microbiota from voided urine contains a mixture of urinary and genital tract bacteria and therefore we called it the genitourinary microbiota [26]. Additionally, we used centrifugation to precipitate the bacteria to obtain enough DNA for analysis, but this could have introduced bias, since centrifugation will enrich for bacteria that pellet well. In this study, we excluded three participants from the analyses, due to too little bacterial DNA being present in their sample. This has also occurred in another study (3 out of 16) [7], indicating that it is not always possible to obtain sufficient DNA from urine with the present techniques.",

Differences between users of antimicrobial drugs in alpha-diversities were tested using a linear regression analysis with the Shannon alpha-diversity as the response variable and the time category of last antimicrobial drug use as the explanatory variable. Differences in beta-diversities were tested using the MiRKAT package, in which it is possible to test the association between a microbiome community and a phenotype with the aid of semi-parametric kernel machine regression [35]. The analyses on the alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were adjusted for age, sex, diabetes (use of anti-diabetic medication) and kidney function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) according to the CKD-EPI equation) [36]. In a sensitivity analysis, an additional confounder was included which gave the number of prescriptions of all antimicrobial drugs since start of the collaborative drug database (1st January 1995). The MaAsLin package was used to determine genera that caused the largest differences between groups [37]. In this analysis, the time category of antimicrobial drug use was linearly included as variable of interest, and age, sex, diabetes and kidney function were included as confounders. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.",
