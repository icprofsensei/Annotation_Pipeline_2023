                    "text": "Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a major health problem, accounting for approximately 75,000 new cases annually and resulting in 16,000 cancer deaths each year in the Unites States [8]. Muscle invading bladder cancer, which accounts for approximately 30% of new cases of UC each year is by far the most dangerous form of UC, with a 50% mortality rate at 5\u2009years. Superficial UC, which is usually not life threatening, has a substantial risk to recur after initial treatment and hence requires regular surveillance cystoscopy and often retreatment markedly increasing the inconvenience, risk and cost. It is plausible to hypothesize that changes or differences in the urinary microbiome could be associated with different risk of superficial or muscle-invading cancer as well as the risk of recurrence of superficial disease. Many studies have examined the relationship between the host microbiome and cancer susceptibility in systems other than the urinary tract [9]. Many studies have focused on the association of intestinal microbiota and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. There are, however, few studies of the urinary microbiome in individuals with UC and the role of the urinary microbiome in bladder cancer has not yet been elucidated. Nevertheless, there are intriguing potential relationships between urinary tract microorganisms and UC: (i) schistosomal infection is clearly associated with an increased risk of UC, intriguingly most often of squamous histology, a relatively uncommon histology among all individuals with UC [10] (ii) carcinogen exposure of the urinary epithelium is clearly a cause of UC in experimental and human studies; it is plausible that there may be a role of bacterial communities in the urinary tract influencing the metabolism of carcinogenic compounds and increasing or decreasing the risk of UC [11, 12] and (iii) the role of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, an attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the treatment of superficial UC may not be just from inducing inflammation [13]; local microbiota may directly inactivate BCG in the bladder or modulate urothelial sensitivity to BCG [14]. Overall the bladder microbiome may also promote or inhibit UC pathogenesis and progression [14]. Xu and colleagues in a small study of patients with UC (n\u00a0=\u20098) found differences in the urine microbiome compared to healthy individuals, such as enrichment of the genus Streptococcus in patients\u2019 urine [1]. Bao et al. reported differences in the urine microbiome among patients in whom superficial UC recurred compared to those in whom it did not [15].",

Delineating the differences, if any, between these two methods of urine sampling will be important in designing studies of large numbers of individuals which will be necessary to elucidate the role of the urine microbiome in bladder cancer.",

The average length of the male urethra is 20\u2009cm compared with 4\u2009cm in females [21]. Given the shorter length of urethra in females there may be more ascending bacteria entering the bladder, and hence the propensity for females to have urinary tract infections; therefore the urine microbiome of the bladder and urethra may be more similar in females compared with males. Indeed in males with lower urinary tract symptoms, voided specimens contained more lower urinary tract microbes than catheterized specimens [5]. Other sex specific factors to consider include hormonal and sexual activity differences. However, Wolfe et al examined urine samples from adult women only by 16\u2009s rRNA gene sequencing and found that voided urine samples contained mixtures of urinary and genital tract bacteria whereas parallel urine samples collected by transurethral catheter and suprapubic aspirate were similar to each other [17].",

Although there were no statistically significant differences in most microbiome metrics in samples from the same individual collected by mid-stream voided urine and from the bladder by cystoscopy, there were differences in beta diversity in males. This suggests that the urinary microbiome of the two collection methods are not equivalent to each other, at least in males, which is the sex bladder cancer occurs most frequently, and therefore the same collection method should be used within a given study. It is currently unknown whether the urine microbiome from voided urine versus a sample obtained from the bladder would be better as a screening tool for bladder cancer. The urethral microbiome which is likely more reflected in a voided sample, could potentially play a pathogenic role too. For population based studies a voided urine specimen in much easier to collect and has lower associated risks, but the microbiome of this sample is not equivalent to a sample obtained directly from the bladder in males.",

While the sample size in this study is still relatively small, the ability to compare collection methods in the same individual does increase the strength of this study. In addition, urinary samples generally have a low abundance of bacteria and as with any low abundance microbiomes there is potential for contamination [23]. Our inclusion of both positive and negative controls serves to minimize this concern. While it was documented whether there was antibiotic use within three months of the collected urine sample, using stool microbiome as a reference with substantial recovery within this time period [24], it is unknown if more distant use of antibiotics can have a lasting more pervasive effect on the urine microbiome. Additionally intraurethral lubricant jelly was used on all subjects for cystoscopy; it could be hypothesized that this may transmit distal urethral microbes into the bladder in between voided urine specimen collection and cystoscopic specimen collection.",
