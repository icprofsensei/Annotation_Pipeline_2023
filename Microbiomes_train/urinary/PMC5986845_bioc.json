Midstream voided urine specimens were collected using the clean-catch method. The bacterial composition was determined by sequencing the hypervariable (V4) region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Extraction negative controls (no urine) were included to assess the contribution of extraneous DNA from possible sources of contamination.

Although the vast majority of genitourinary bacteria, which includes bacteria from the urethra, vagina, vulva, and bladder, cannot be cultured by standard clinical microbiology urine culture methods [7, 8], they can be identified using high throughput 16S rRNA sequencing or new enhanced urine culture techniques [2, 4, 8\u201310]. The presence of urinary bacteria does not indicate UTI, as the bacteria that comprise the resident urinary microbiome differ from those associated with clinical UTIs [5, 6, 11, 12]. While few studies have examined the diversity of the urine microbiome, current evidence links microbial diversity in catheterized urine specimens with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) and response to treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms, especially those associated with UUI [13, 14]. Midstream voided urine microbiome diversity also has been associated with lower urinary symptoms, as well as with hormonal status and body mass index [15]. These preliminary findings are consistent with other non-urine microbiome studies showing that human microbiome diversity may influence health status. For example, low gut microbiome diversity is associated with inflammatory bowel disease [16, 17], while high vaginal microbiome diversity is associated with bacterial vaginosis [18].",

The older age of adults with CKD along with accompanying comorbidities may influence midstream urine microbiome diversity and could influence urinary symptoms and bladder health. Diabetes leads to high ambient urinary glucose levels, which may increase bacterial growth and influence urinary microbiome diversity. Severe reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) also may influence bacterial growth via its effects on production of uromodulin, produced exclusively by the renal tubules [19\u201322] and promotes urinary excretion of bacteria [23]. Urinary symptoms are troublesome for older adults with CKD, and we have previously demonstrated a high burden of urinary symptoms among older adults with CKD receiving diuretics [24].",

Diuretic use was an inclusion criterion because the study was specifically designed to examine urinary symptoms in adults with CKD receiving diuretics. Patients were excluded from the study if they were receiving any immunosuppression medications, had a history of a neobladder or ileal conduit, had used antibiotics within the past 4\u00a0weeks or had any active cancer treatment or urinary instrumentation within the past 6\u00a0months. A total of 135 patient participants were asked to enroll in the study, 103 provided consent, and 99 contributed completed urinary symptom questionnaires. One participant withdrew consent from the study after completing the questionnaires, and five participants did not provide a urine sample. An additional 11 samples were contaminated, and 5 had too few sequence reads. Thus, the analyzed cohort with detectable urine DNA included 77 participants (41 females and 36 males).",

All steps were performed in a UV irradiated, HEPA-filtered PCR workstation to minimize potential contaminants. The amount of DNA in each sample was quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The microbial composition was determined by sequencing the hypervariable (V4) region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene, as previously described [2, 14]. The V4 region is about 250 base-pairs long and can be used to classify most bacteria to the genus level. Sequencing-ready libraries were generated using a 2-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The V4 region was amplified using modified universal primers 515F and 806R. In a limited cycle PCR, Illumina sequencing adapters and dual-index barcodes were added to the amplified targets. Extraction negative controls (no urine) were included to assess the contribution of extraneous DNA from possible sources of contamination. The final PCR products were purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and pooled together in equimolar concentrations to create a final library of barcoded fragments ready for sequencing. The samples were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq bench-top sequencer rendering 250 base-pair paired-end reads (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequencing data was deposited in SRA accession SRP127363.",

The ribosomal database project classifier (RDP) [30] was used to generate taxonomic classifications of the sequencing reads from phylum to genus level. Samples were subsampled at a depth of 2000 sequencing reads; five samples were eliminated from downstream analysis due to not meeting this threshold. The taxonomic information was then used to split the sequences into bins using a 97% similarity threshold to assign operational taxonomic units (OTUs), using the clustering algorithm built into the Mothur software; this resulted in 8658 OTUs. The relative abundance of taxonomic classifications was calculated at the genus level for each sample using the R package Phyloseq (v. 1.19.1). Taxa that did not constitute 1% of the total sequencing reads and/or greater than 40% of a single sample\u2019s sequencing reads comprise the taxa category \u201cOther.\u201d Samples were clustered using only the identified taxa to assess variance using distance matrices and the Bray\u2013Curtis index in the R package vegan (v. 2.4.3), producing a dendrogram in which the short branches link similar samples and longer branches link more dissimilar samples; this segregates the dendrogram into distinct groups or clades. Unclassified sequencing reads and reads that were grouped into the \u201cOther\u201d category were not used for clustering. The relative abundance graph was then aligned to the dendrogram to delineate the clades of the tree by the predominant organism, termed \u201curotype,\u201d above a defined threshold. We also plotted the proportion of sequences per genus across all patient samples to help visualize the total number of genera represented in the midstream voided urine samples. Alpha diversity was assessed using three types of measurements. The total number of unique taxa was estimated by the CHAO measure, and the species richness was measured by the inverse of the Simpson index. The Shannon index was used to assess both the richness and evenness or equality of representation of taxa within an environment. Higher values of these indices indicate higher diversity.",

The midstream urine microbiome diversity measures were examined by demographic characteristics and by comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, UUI and CKD stage) in the total sample. Due to a non-normal distribution, the diversity measures were log-transformed for analyses. To determine significance of differences in diversity measures, the unpaired t test was used to compare log-transformed values by a given characteristic and geometric mean values were reported. The ANOVA test was used to examine significant differences in log-transformed diversity measures across CKD stages 3, 4 and 5. If the overall test was significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05), then log-transformed diversity measures for CKD stages 4 and 5 were compared to CKD stage 3 using an unpaired t test. Linear regression was used to examine the adjusted association of demographic characteristics and comorbidities with log-transformed diversity measures as the dependent variable. Models include age, BMI and eGFR as continuous variables and male sex, diabetes, and white race as dichotomous variables. Analyses were completed using STATA v13.",

Thus, most urine samples with a dominant urotype (>\u200950% of sequences) contained several other prominent genera. In most samples, each genus was detected as a low proportion of all sequences. Table\u00a02 shows the midstream urine microbiome diversity measures (Inverse Simpson, CHAO and Shannon indices) by demographic characteristics and comorbidities. No significant difference was noted relative to age, sex, ethnicity or either diabetes or obesity status. Overall, diversity measures were higher among men versus women, but the differences did not meet statistical significance. In contrast, significant differences in diversity measures were observed for those reporting UUI versus those without UUI. In the total study group, diversity measures also differed significantly with respect to CKD stage (Table\u00a03). The highest diversity measures were associated with CKD stage 3, whereas the lowest diversity measures were generally noted with CKD stage 5.

The association of urine microbiome diversity with urinary health measures remains poorly explored. One study analyzed urine obtained by transurethral catheter and found that a more diverse urinary microbiome for women correlates with less robust treatment response for UUI with an anticholinergic treatment [13]. In that study, compared to women with less diverse urine microbiomes, those with more diverse microbiomes either required a higher dose of the anticholinergic for the same response or did not respond to the anticholinergic at all [13]. Another smaller study of 10 women with UUI and 10 women with normal bladder function found that lower urine microbiome diversity from transurethral catheterized specimens was associated with increased UUI severity [31]. Others have also reported lower midstream urine microbiome diversity in women with interstitial cystitis compared to women without urinary symptoms [32, 33]. Additionally, one previous small study of midstream urine specimens from 16 persons age 20\u201370\u2009+\u2009years showed that midstream urine microbiome diversity generally decreased with age with the lowest diversity noted in adults aged\u2009\u2265\u200970\u00a0years [34].",

This association will require additional study to determine contributing factors such as alterations in urinary antimicrobial peptides. In the renal tubules, the tacky uromodulin proteins stick to bacteria; this leads to formation of larger particles that are more readily excreted by the kidney [19, 23] and reduces the risk of a UTI [19\u201322]. It is possible that kidney function decline alters the secretion of uromodulin and other antimicrobial peptides into the urine, which may influence urinary microbiome diversity, but this remains an untested hypothesis. While uromodulin concentrations generally decrease as GFR declines [35], large inter-individual variability in uromodulin urine concentrations exists. Other unmeasured factors, such as vaginal and urethral bacterial growth, may also be influenced by kidney disease and alter the urine microbiome diversity.",

Despite these limitations, the use of voided samples avoids the participant burden of urinary catheterization and the potential for alteration of the urinary microbial community. The microbes detected in this analysis cannot be confirmed to originate from the bladder itself. However, the characteristics of the midstream urine microbiome in women have similarities to urine microbiomes in catheterized urine specimens [4, 14, 15]. Few studies have examined the voided urine microbiome characteristics in men [36, 37].",
