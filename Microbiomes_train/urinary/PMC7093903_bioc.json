In this study, we analyzed the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the urinary metagenome of the kidney transplant and healthy subjects using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Our data suggest an increased abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the kidney transplant subjects. In addition, the antibiotic resistance genes identified in the transplant subjects were predominantly composed of multidrug efflux pumps (MDEPs) which are evolutionarily ancient, commonly encoded on chromosomes rather than plasmids, and have a low rate of mutation. Since the MDEPs had a low abundance in the healthy subjects, we speculate that the MDEPs may enhance the fitness of bacteria to survive in the high stress environment of transplantation that includes multiple stressors including surgery, antibiotics, and immunosuppressive agents.",

Exposure to clinical levels of antibiotics can promote mutations inducing enhanced antibiotic resistance and the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. Following kidney transplantation, infections remain a major complication, and the most common type of acute infection following solid organ transplantation is bacterial [3, 4]. Consequently, subjects are frequently treated with prophylactic antibiotics, for example, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, which we previously reported can induce increased levels of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the urinary metagenome [5]. Specifically, we reported increased levels of dihydrofolate synthase/folylpolyglutamate synthase, two enzymes that can increase folate production but are not blocked by sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in subjects that developed urinary tract infections following transplantation.",

Based on the genetic analysis of bacterial genomes, it is estimated that there are more than 20,000 antibacterial resistance genes (ARGs) comprising approximately 400 different types [6]. ARGs are evolutionarily ancient and were present before the advent of antibiotics indicating that ARGs have biological functions in addition to inhibiting effects of antibiotics. In vitro studies have shown that ARGs can inhibit transcription and modulate metabolism suggesting important biological functions in natural ecosystems [7]. Thus, the contribution of antibiotics and resistance to antibiotics is not well understood in terms of resilience or susceptibility to adverse outcomes including infection or graft rejection in kidney transplantation.",

Beta-lactamases are usually expressed on plasmids and can generate new specificities of resistance within days due to the accumulation of point mutations. In contrast, another class of ARGs is the multidrug efflux pumps (MDEPs), which are encoded in the bacterial chromosomes, expressed in all members of a species, and mutate slowly, and thus are not selected by exposure to antibiotics. The MDEPs are ancient genes present in prokaryotes, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes including mammals. An important example in clinical medicine is p-glycoprotein, which can be responsible for resistance to chemotherapy agents. There are five types of MDEPs in bacteria which have diverse functions including quorum sensing and detoxification of heavy metals, bile salts, and bacterial metabolites. Since the MDEPs emerged early in evolution their original functions were not to convey resistance to antibiotics; nevertheless, the efflux pumps are effective mechanisms to generate antibiotic resistance [8, 9].",

The raw reads were filtered to remove human sequences and were assembled into 1,429,333 contigs (). We identified ARGs in 10 out of 21 transplants, and 19 out of 25 controls. To compare the metagenomes of the kidney transplant and control subjects, we performed Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) which projected separation of the two groups based on the ARGs identified in each sample with 26.5% of the variance defined by the first principal coordinate (Figure 1). Variance of the control group ARGs profile was primarily encompassed in the first principal coordinate, whereas the variance of the transplant resistome was predominantly within the second principal coordinate.",

Next, we determined the predicted spectrum of antibiotic resistance genes based on the metagenomes in each group. Analysis of the relative abundance of ARGs indicated a more diverse profile in the transplant subjects compared with control subjects (Figure 5(a)). In addition, a comparison of the specificity of the resistance profiles showed different profiles in the two groups (Figure 5(b)). For example, the transplant subjects indicated resistance to 16 of the 17 antibiotics class analyzed. In contrast, the control subjects indicated resistance to a subset of the antibiotics that included bacitracin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolone, fosmidomycin, penicillin, and tetracycline. In addition to these antibiotics, the transplant subjects were also resistant to aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fosfomycin, norfloxacin, kasugamycin, lincomycin, macrolides, and polymyxin. Thus, transplant subjects have a broader profile of antibiotic resistance and a greater abundance of antibiotic resistance genes that is often an order of magnitude greater than in the control subjects.",

Only 3 ARGs were abundant in the control subjects: ermf (a methyl transferase), pbp2b (beta-lactamase), and rosa (efflux pump/potassium antiporter); however, all 3 were identified at extremely low absolute levels in the transplant group. Interestingly, 14 (above 0.1 gene abundance) unique ARGs were identified in the transplant urinary metagenome suggesting a diverse baseline repertoire of ARGs.

We detected changes associated with gender in both the transplant and control groups; however, a Principal Coordinate Analysis showed that the strongest association was between transplant versus control (Figure 7(b)).

For example, out of 44 different ARGs detected, 29 were unique to the transplant subjects (Figure 4). Also, we detected an average of 16 different ARGs in transplant group versus only 2 in control. Interestingly, the putative specificity of the antibiotic resistance was also different. In the control subjects, resistance was predicted to bactrim, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolone, fosmidomycin, penicillin, and tetracycline, all antibiotics that are previously or currently used in clinical or agricultural practice. In contrast, the transplant subjects projected resistance to aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fosfomycin, norfloxacin, kasugamycin, lincomycin, macrolides, and polymyxin antibiotics that are often administered for more serious clinical indications. The most striking observation in our study was the type of ARGs that were detected in the transplant versus control subjects. 18 of the 36 ARGs in the transplant group were classified as multidrug efflux pumps (MDEPs), whereas only 2 were detected at a significant level in the control group. SIMPER analysis showed that MDEPs contributed 65.7% towards dissimilarity among the groups.",

                    "text": "The MDEPs differ in the multiple aspects from the other ARGs. There are five major types of MDEPs including ABC (ATP binding cassette), MATE (toxic compound extrusion family), MFS (major facilitator super family), SMR (small multidrug resistance family), and RND (resistance/nodulation division family) [8, 9]. We identified MDEPs from 4 of the 5 types of efflux pumps including 2, 0, 8, 1, and 6 from the ABC, MATE, MFS, SMR, and RND types, respectively (Figure 7(c)). Thus, the MDEPs were derived from multiple diverse types of efflux pumps. MFS multidrug efflux pumps genes (emea, emrd, mdtg, mdth, mdtk, mdtl, mdtm, tetc), and RND (acrb, macb, mdte, mdtf, mdto, tolc), were among the abundant antibiotic classes compared to ABC (bcr, isa) and SMR (emre). Of note mdtk, acrb, and bcr were highly abundant among the MFS, RND, and ABC, respectively (Table 2, Figure 7(c)). The MDEPs are ancient elements present in prokaryotes, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes that exert important biological functions unrelated to antibiotic resistance including quorum sensing, virulence, detoxification, and biofilm formation. In cancer subjects, the MDEPs can promote resistance to chemotherapy agents. In bacteria, the MDEPs can promote resistance to antibiotics. The MDEP genes are commonly encoded within the genome and structural components are highly conserved in all members of a given bacterial species and subject to low rates of mutation. A single MDEP can convey resistance to multiple antibiotics. Since the MDEPs are ancient genes it is likely that antibiotic resistance by MDEPs is an emergent property not dependent on recent mutations suggesting that MDEPs are not selected due to exposure to antibiotics. In contrast, the development of resistance to higher concentrations or new structures in plasmid encoded ARGs is rapid and can occur within hours to days [14].",

Transplantation produces multiple stressors including ischemia/reperfusion, exposure to antibiotics, and immunosuppressive agents. Thus, microbiota with relevant MDEPs may have increased fitness and provide the bacteria with a selective advantage in a stressed environment such as induced by transplantation. This could guide the specific changes in the microbiome we documented following transplantation. Further delineation of the effects of high levels of MDEPS in transplant subjects' merits further investigation.",
