Prebiotic consumption, which changes the gastrointestinal microbiota in a way that benefits host health, is one potential treatment being explored to alleviate these conditions. Accordingly, we aimed to determine the effects of fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and galactooligosaccharide (GOS) consumption on changes in the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and biological and behavioral markers of stress among adults.",

Each study beverage was consumed daily for 4-weeks with a 2 to 4-week washout between study periods. Fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of each period. Following fecal DNA extraction, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq. Sequence data were analyzed with DADA2 and QIIME 2. Taxonomy was assigned with the GreenGenes 13_8 99% OTU reference database. Statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 using linear mixed modeling with time, treatment, and the time by treatment interaction as fixed effects and participant and period as random effects.",
