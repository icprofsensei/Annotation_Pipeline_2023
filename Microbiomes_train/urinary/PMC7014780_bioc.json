Next, we generated a new dataset of cfDNA in amniotic fluid collected from uncomplicated pregnancies or those complicated with clinical chorioamnionitis at term, a common heterogeneous condition that can occur in the presence or absence of intra-amniotic infection [10]. We report a first, detailed study of the properties of cfDNA in amniotic fluid.

We quantified microbial cfDNA by alignment of sequences to microbial reference genomes [11, 12] (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). We identified two classes of noise, which we addressed using a bioinformatics workflow that implements both novel and previously described filtering approaches [13, 14] (Fig.\u00a01a). The first type of noise can be classified as \u201cdigital crosstalk\u201d and stems from errors in alignment and contaminant sequences that are present in microbial reference genomes, including human-related sequences or sequences from other microbes. Digital crosstalk affects distinct segments of a microbial genome and gives rise to inhomogeneous coverage of the reference genome. We computed the coefficient of variation in the per-base genome coverage for all identified species (CV, computed as the standard deviation in genome coverage divided by the mean coverage) and removed taxa for which the CV differed greatly from the CV determined for a uniformly sampled genome of the same size (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section), because this indicated that a significant number of sequences assigned to the genome are due to digital crosstalk.\n",

We reasoned that the total biomass of environmental DNA would be consistent for samples prepared in the same batch. LBBC filters environmental contaminants by performing batch variation analysis on the absolute abundance of microbial DNA quantified with high accuracy. The core elements of LBBC can be implemented using any metagenomics abundance estimation algorithm which makes use of sequence alignment to full microbial genomes. In our analysis, we estimate the genomic abundance of each species using a maximum likelihood model implemented in GRAMMy [12] (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). GRAMMy helps ameliorate the impact of closely related genomes [12]. From the relative abundance of species, we compute the absolute number of molecules in a dataset corresponding to a specific species, considering differences in genome sizes for all identified microbes. The total biomass of microbial DNA is then estimated as the proportion of sequencing reads derived from a species, multiplied by the measured biomass inputted in the library preparation reaction. Recent approaches have identified environmental contaminants by (i) looking for batch-by-batch covariation in the relative abundance of microbes measured by metagenomic sequencing or (ii) examining the (inverse) correlation between biomass of the sample and the relative abundance of microbial DNA in the sample [13, 14]. These studies have shown the dramatic effect of environmental contamination in low biomass settings. LBBC effectively combines these two prior approaches into one. Using this analysis applied to the metagenomic cfDNA datasets described below, we estimate that the total biomass of environmental, contaminant DNA can exceed 100\u2009pg (range of 0 to 230.4\u2009pg). This is a small amount of DNA (<\u20091% of sequencing reads) that nonetheless can significantly impact the interpretation of metagenomic sequencing results. We further incorporated a known-template, negative control in the library preparation procedures to identify any remaining contaminant sequences. The use of a negative control is recommended for metagenomics studies [9] and was implemented in our previous work [2, 15]. Here, we compared the microbial abundance detected in samples to those in controls to set a baseline for environmental contamination. This analysis indicated that, on average, only 46% of physical contaminant species determined by LBBC are removed using comparison to a negative control alone, supporting the need for the additional filters implemented in LBBC.",

We computed a confusion matrix (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section) and determined the accuracy of the test to be 0.886 (no information rate, NIR\u2009=\u20090.386, p\u2009<\u200910\u221210). Without LBBC, the test achieved a sensitivity of 100% but a specificity of 3.3%, and an accuracy of 0.000 (as most samples have both E. coli and Enterococcus). Applying a simple filter that excludes taxa with relative abundance below a pre-defined threshold (RGE >\u20090.1) led to an accuracy of 0.864 (sensitivity of 81.5%, specificity of 96.7%); however, such filtering does not remove sources of physical or digital noise at high abundance and may remove pathogens present at low abundance. After applying LBBC, we observed far fewer bacterial genera outside of Escherichia and Enterococcus in samples from patients diagnosed with UTI (Fig.\u00a01c). LBBC did not remove bacteria that are known to be commensal in the female genitourinary tract, including species from the genera Gardnerella and Ureaplasma [16]. For male subjects without UTI, we detected a single Lactobacillus species among all subjects, consistent with the view that the male urinary tract is sterile in the absence of infection. For patients with UTI, the urinary microbiomes were less diverse in males compared with females, as previously reported [17]. These examples illustrate that LBBC conserves key relationships between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria.",

Circulating cfDNA in maternal plasma has emerged as a highly valuable analyte for the screening of aneuploidy in pregnancy [18], but no studies have examined the properties of cfDNA in amniotic fluid. No studies have furthermore assessed the utility of amniotic fluid cfDNA as an analyte to monitor clinical chorioamnionitis, the most common diagnosis related to infection made in labor and delivery units worldwide [19]. Traditionally, it was thought that clinical chorioamnionitis was due to microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (i.e., intra-amniotic infection), which elicits a maternal inflammatory response characterized by maternal fever, uterine tenderness, tachycardia, and leukocytosis as well as fetal tachycardia and a foul-smelling amniotic fluid [20, 21]. However, recent studies in which amniocentesis has been used to characterize the microbiologic state of the amniotic cavity and the inflammatory response [amniotic fluid interleukin (IL)-6\u2009>\u20092.6\u2009ng/ml [22]] show that only 60% of patients with the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis have proven infection using culture or molecular microbiologic techniques [10]. The remainder of the patients has clinical chorioamnionitis in the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation (i.e., sterile intra-amniotic inflammation) or without neither intra-amniotic inflammation nor microorganisms in the amniotic cavity [10]. Therefore, the emergent picture is that clinical chorioamnionitis at term is a heterogeneous syndrome, which requires further study to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes [23]. We analyzed 40 amniotic cfDNA isolates collected from the following study groups of women: (1) with clinical chorioamnionitis and detectable microorganisms (n\u2009=\u200910), (2) with clinical chorioamnionitis without detectable microorganisms (n\u2009=\u200915), and 93 without clinical chorioamnionitis (i.e., normal full-term pregnancies) (n\u2009=\u200915). Microorganisms were detected by cultivation and broad-range PCR coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry or PCR/ESI-MS (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). Data from several independent clinical assays were available, including levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), white and red blood cell counts, and glucose levels (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section).",

The data provide unique insight into the properties of amniotic fluid cfDNA. For women carrying a male fetus, we used the coverage of the Y chromosome relative to autosomes to estimate the fetal fraction of cfDNA in amniotic fluid (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). The fetal fraction ranged from 6.0 to 100% and was strongly anticorrelated with inflammatory markers such as IL-6 [24, 25] (Spearman\u2019s rho of \u2212\u20090.763, p\u2009=\u20091.34\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124, n\u2009=\u200920; Fig.\u00a02a). We attribute this observation to the recruitment of immune cells to the amniotic cavity during infection [26, 27]. We next used paired-end read mapping to determine the fragment length profiles of cfDNA in amniotic fluid (Fig.\u00a02b). We found that amniotic fluid cfDNA was highly fragmented (median length 108\u2009bp) and lacked the canonical peak at 167\u2009bp typically observed in the fragmentation profile of plasma cfDNA [18, 28]. To determine size differences between fetal and maternal cfDNA in amniotic fluid, we computed the median fragment length for molecules derived from the X and Y chromosomes in cfDNA from male pregnancy samples. We hypothesized that if all cfDNA in a sample originated from the male fetus, the median fragment lengths for the X- and Y-aligned DNA would be equivalent, and, conversely, in samples with a large fraction of cfDNA originating from the mother, a length discrepancy may arise. Using this approach, we found that fetal-derived cfDNA was shorter than maternal-derived cfDNA (up to 31\u2009bp shorter; Fig.\u00a02c). Previous reports have similarly noted that fetal cfDNA in urine and plasma is shorter than maternal cfDNA [29, 30].\n",

After applying LBBC with a relaxed batch variation minimum to account for species-level analysis (\u03c32min\u2009=\u20091\u2009pg2), no bacteria were detected in the normal pregnancy group (Fig.\u00a02d), in line with recent studies that point to a sterile amniotic cavity and placenta in the absence of infection [31, 32]. The cfDNA sequencing assay detected only 6 of the 14 bacterial genera identified by bacterial culture or PCR/ESI-MS, and was unable to identify a fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, detected by PCR/ESI-MS (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). We asked if these false negatives were due to LBBC filtering. Relaxation of the filtering thresholds revealed that Ureaplasma was removed in four samples by the batch variation filter; other false negatives were not due to LBBC filtering. Interestingly, in all cases of chorioamnionitis without detectable microorganisms, no bacterium was identified (Fig.\u00a02d), in line with previous evidence showing that chorioamnionitis and intra-amniotic inflammation can occur in the absence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity [10]. Last, in two samples, we identified a high burden of viral DNA, including papillomavirus in one sample and bacteriophage in another (Fig.\u00a02d), demonstrating the utility of cfDNA paired with LBBC to detect viruses in the amniotic fluid.",

Though batch effects can arise at any step, we found some steps are more prone to contamination and hence batch effects, in particular the cfDNA extraction batch, while others had very little effect, e.g., the sequencing instrument. Other possible batch effects include the date of processing (influencing reagent batch) and location where samples were prepared (e.g., in a clean room or in a lab environment with multiple experiments being performed); the sources of contamination in metagenomic sequencing and batch effects have been reviewed recently [9, 33].",

This last point is of importance, because of the several popular algorithms for metagenomic sequence classification, including Metaphlan, which relies on reduced reference genomes [34]. Such approaches preclude the ability to estimate sequencing coverage uniformity across the genome, required for the CV filter that is part of LBBC [12].

Amniotic fluid samples were obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis performed for evaluation of the microbial and inflammatory status of the amniotic cavity in patients with clinical chorioamnionitis, whereas women approaching term underwent an amniocentesis for assessment of fetal lung maturity. Twenty of the 40 samples were from mothers pregnant with male fetus. Clinical chorioamnionitis was diagnosed by the presence of maternal fever (temperature >\u200937.8\u2009\u00b0C) accompanied by two or more of the following criteria: (1) uterine tenderness, (2) foul-smelling amniotic fluid, (3) fetal tachycardia (heart rate >\u2009160 beats/min), (4) maternal tachycardia (heart rate >\u2009100 beats/min), and (5) maternal leukocytosis (leukocyte count >\u200915,000 cells/mm3) [20, 24]. Amniotic fluid samples were transported to the clinical laboratory in a sterile capped syringe and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including genital Mycoplasmas. The clinical tests also included the determination of amniotic fluid white blood cell (WBC) count [35], glucose concentration [36], and Gram stain [37]. Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity was defined as a positive amniotic fluid culture and/or polymerase chain reaction with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) (Ibis\u00ae Technology\u2014Pathogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) test result [38].

We determined the coverage exclusively in these regions with high mappability scores to extrapolate the coverage of the whole chromosome. The fetal fraction was determined as 2Y/A for subjects who were known to be pregnant with male fetuses, where Y and A are the inferred sequencing coverage of the Y chromosome and autosomes, respectively. To confirm the accuracy of the measurement, we ran the algorithm on samples from subjects with female fetuses, which we would expect to have a zero fetal fraction.

Human-unaligned reads were retrieved and aligned to an annotated NCBI microbial database using BLAST [11] (blastn, NCBI BLAST 2.2.28+). After read alignment, a maximum likelihood estimator, GRAMMy (version 1), was used to adjust the BLAST hits [12]. The adjusted hits to each taxon and respective genome size of each taxon were used to compute the taxon genome coverage. The ratio of each taxon\u2019s genomic coverage to that of human chromosome 21 was used to compute the relative genomic abundance of each taxon in each sample.",

Genomes were aggregated into 1-kbp bins and the number of alignments within each bin was determined. The coefficient of variation (the standard deviation in alignments per bin divided by the mean number of alignments per bin) was calculated for each taxon in the sample. Given the number of alignments to a specific taxon and the taxon size, we randomly generated reads across the genome to simulate uniform sampling. The CV of this simulated taxon was calculated (CVsim). The difference between the CV and CVsim (\u0394CV) was then determined to look at coverage statistic discrepancy. CV and \u0394CV were calculated for every taxon in every sample in the cohort. Taxa were removed if they exceeded a maximum allowable \u0394CV value.",
