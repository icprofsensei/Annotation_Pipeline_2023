Antibiotic-treated bacteria and bacteria residing in biofilm can be difficult to culture. In this study we used culture-based and 16S rRNA gene-based culture-independent methods (fingerprinting, cloning, and pyrosequencing) to determine the microbial diversity of biofilms on 24 urinary catheters. Most of the patients were catheterized for <30 days and had undergone recent antibiotic treatment. In addition, the corresponding urine samples for 16 patients were cultured. We found that gene analyses of the catheters were consistent with cultures of the corresponding urine samples for the presence of bacteria but sometimes discordant for the identity of the species. Cultures of catheter tips detected bacteria more frequently than urine cultures and gene analyses; coagulase-negative staphylococci were, in particular, cultured much more often from catheter tips, indicating potential contamination of the catheter tips during sampling. The external and internal surfaces of 19 catheters were separately analyzed by molecular methods, and discordant results were found in six catheters, suggesting that bacterial colonization intra- and extraluminally may be different. Molecular analyses showed that most of the species identified in this study were known uropathogens, and infected catheters were generally colonized by one to two species, probably due to antibiotic usage and short-term catheterization. In conclusion, our data showed that culture-independent molecular methods did not detect bacteria from urinary catheters more frequently than culture-based methods.",

Up to 25% of hospitalized patients need urinary catheters; however, catheterization is associated with increased risk of infection in the urinary tract, and >40% of all nosocomial infections in hospitals and other health care units are attributed to catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) (21). The presence of a catheter predisposes the patient to acquire infections by providing access to uropathogens into the bladder along its external and internal surfaces, which develop into biofilms on the catheters and uroepithelium (41). The risk of UTI is associated with the duration of catheterization. The daily increase in prevalence of bacteriuria after catheterization is estimated to be 3 to 10%, and bacteriuria occurs for almost all patients with an indwelling catheter over 30 days (48). Exposure to antibiotics can delay the onset of bacteriuria in catheterized patients; however, the effect is relatively short. The prevalence of bacteriuria will eventually reach the same level in patients with or without antibiotic treatment after 14 days (19).",

When the suspected catheter is removed, the catheter can be used for microbiological culture. However, on the surfaces of catheters bacteria grow in biofilms, which are structured communities of microorganisms surrounded by their extracellular products. Biofilm bacteria differ in their behavior and in phenotypic form from their planktonic counterparts. They grow poorly on agar plates when recovered from their natural or pathogenic ecosystems, and generally only planktonic cells can be cultured (7). Antibiotic usage, inappropriate culture conditions, and viable but nonculturable bacteria may also cause false-negative culture (51). To improve the recovery of the biofilm attached to the catheters, swabbing (32) and sonication (20) of the catheter have been used, and greater sensitivity was achieved by both approaches. In addition, pathogens can gain access to catheters extra- or intraluminally (42), and the microbial population on the two sides of the catheter can be different (15); hence, analyzing one side of the catheter or the catheter tip alone may be insufficient to detect all of the microbes on the catheter.",

CoNS and Enterococcus spp. are considered relatively avirulent and are more frequently recovered from asymptomatic infections than from symptomatic infections.

For instance, to investigate chronic wound microbiota several studies (9, 13, 38, 44, 45) have applied denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), cloning, and pyrosequencing, which have revealed a substantially higher level of bacterial diversity than found by conventional culture. Another major advantage of molecular methods compared to culture-based methods is that detection of bacterial DNA is unaffected after antimicrobial exposure; however, positive molecular detection may originate from DNA from dead bacteria. This issue can be overcome by only extracting DNA from intact bacterial cells (22, 35, 36). Notably most of the hospitalized patients with an indwelling urinary catheter (up to 80%) receive antimicrobial therapy due to indication of infection (21, 23), and this may greatly influence the outcome of culture.",

The PCR incubation conditions of the second PCR were as follows: initial activation of the hot start polymerase at 98\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 15 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 5 s, 56\u00b0C for 20 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s, with final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min, and the number of cycles was reduced to 15. Bands of \u223c500 bp were cut out and purified as described above. The amplified fragments with adapters and tags were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen). Tagged samples were mixed in approximately equal concentrations (4 \u00d7 106 copies/\u03bcl) to ensure equal representation of each sample. DNA samples were sequenced on the 75\u00d775 Titanium GS PicoTiterPlate (PTP) by using a GS FLX pyrosequencing system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche).",

These four catheters were also the only ones from which two species were identified, whereas all the other PCR-positive catheters were colonized with a single species according to DGGE analysis. Of the six discordant catheters, three catheters (catheters 8, 9, and 13) were PCR positive on the external surface, while the remaining three catheters (catheters 1, 4, and 6) were PCR positive on the internal surface.

For each sample, the number of pyrosequencing reads after quality filtering by AmpliconNoise was >5,000, which provides higher sampling-depth than DGGE and cloning. From the external surface of catheter 12, Actinomyces and Pseudomonas were detected by all three molecular methods. However, pyrosequencing identified one more genus than DGGE and cloning in the other three samples. Enterobacter hormaechei was found on both the external and the internal surfaces of catheter 7, in addition to Klebsiella and, in addition to Actinomyces, Pseudomonas was detected on the interior of catheter 12. However, due to the relatively short length of the amplicons and the high degree of sequence similarity within Klebsiella and Pseudomonas genera, species-level assignment was not achieved.",

The authors of that study examined 14 catheters removed after 14 days of catheterization using 16S rRNA gene PCR and cloning. They found that all eight catheters from patients without systemic antimicrobial treatment were colonized by multiple species (estimated average of >20 species), with extensive variation between the external and internal surfaces, whereas only one of the six catheters removed from patients receiving systemic antibiotics was PCR positive, and only a single species was identified on both sides of the catheter. Thus, antimicrobial agents significantly reduce the microbial diversity on the catheters, which was also observed in our study. In the present study, 13 of the 14 patients with available medical records were treated with antibiotics during catheterization, and PCR was positive in 12 of them. All of the PCR positive catheters were colonized by one to two species (1.3 on average), as shown by DGGE. Even when pyrosequencing with >5,000 sequences per sample was used, only one or two bacterial genera dominated 99.9 to 100% of the sequences for each sample (Table 2). The low diversity of the biofilm indicates that antibiotics or antibiotic prophylaxis kill some species but selected for a few and possibly resistant ones. Other likely factors contributing to the observed low diversity that we observed here are the relatively short catheter indwelling period (generally <30 days) and the microbial competition for resources resulting in the exclusion of some species.",

This is suggested by the FISH micrographs (Fig. 2) and indicated by the finding that six catheters had discordant PCR results between the inside and outside, and four of the seven concordant PCR-positive catheters had different species on the two sides of the catheters. This heterogeneous distribution of bacteria has also been observed in a number of biofilm-related infections, such as chronic wounds (26, 44) and the respiratory tracts of cystic fibrosis patients (5).",

A. denitrificans has been isolated from various clinical specimens, such as urine, eye swabs, and pleural fluid, but no detailed reports about its clinical significance are available (47). A. neuii is a rare pathogen, which has mainly been reported to cause abscesses, but it has also been found in UTIs, skin lesions, bacteremia, endocarditis, etc. (16, 46). The two corynebacteria (uncultured Corynebacterium sp. and C. jeikeium) were only identified by DGGE. Corynebacteria constitute part of the normal skin flora, which makes it difficult to distinguish between infection, colonization, and contamination with these organisms. However, they are now recognized with increasing frequency as opportunistic human pathogens (17). Both corynebacteria were found on the inside of the catheters; hence, they were more likely colonizers than contaminants. We found E. coli, the most commonly isolated Gram-negative organism in CAUTIs, only once, and other common species such as Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp. and Providencia stuartii were not detected at all. This was expected because these species are normally only isolated when infection is suspected. Only 24 catheters were analyzed; therefore, the species identified are not representative for our facility and should not be compared to other studies.",

                    "text": "We provide here the first comparison of molecular and culture investigations of microbes on urinary catheters. Overall, culture of catheter tips by the rolling-plate method yielded significantly higher positive rates, which was unexpected since culture-independent molecular methods are generally more sensitive than culture for detecting bacteria in biofilm-related infections (11, 44, 49). However, the applied semiquantitative Maki's roll-plate method for catheter culture was originally developed for intravenous-catheter-related infections with a cutoff of 15 colonies per culture plate for distinguishing contamination (31). Its application on urinary catheters has never been studied. The urethra, which is normally colonized by many different bacteria from the vagina, skin, or feces, contains more microbes than the insertion site for intravenous catheters. Thus, using Maki's roll-plate method for urinary catheters may lead to overestimation of infection. Potential contamination is indicated by the finding that CoNS, including S. epidermidis, were isolated from 13 of the 24 catheter tips, whereas only three catheters were positive for Staphylococcus species by DGGE analysis and none of the urine cultures (Table 1). CoNS are previously reported to account for 20 to 30% of isolates from short-term catheters and less than 10% from long-term catheters (34). Since CoNS are frequently found on skin and mucosal membranes as part of the normal human microbes, the risk of urethral contamination during catheter removal is considerable. Rinsing the catheter tip with sterile phosphate-buffered saline before culturing may help to remove the loosely attached contaminating bacteria (15). Similarly, after the catheters are used for roll-plate culture, contaminants are significantly reduced; hence, the samples used for molecular studies here were less affected by contaminants. On the other hand, roll-plate culture probably also removed significant amounts of bacteria from the catheter surfaces in some cases, and the applied molecular methods were not sensitive enough to detect the remaining ones. Consequently, PCR had a lower positive rate than catheter tip culture.",

The differences could be reasoned by the presence of bacteria in biofilms colonizing only the catheter without a detectable level of planktonic bacteria in the urine (32), or the loosely attached bacteria were removed from the catheter by roll-plate method. Despite of this potential limitation, the overall findings in the present study suggest that culture of urine is still recommended for the routine diagnosis of CAUTI, whereas the catheter tips may overestimate microbial presence and diversity. This is in agreement with the most recent recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/pscManual/7pscCAUTIcurrent.pdf), which state that urinary catheter tips should not be cultured and are not acceptable for the diagnosis of a UTI.",

DGGE is a method based on separating different DNA sequences according to their melting behavior (33), which has a relatively low resolution compared to cloning and next-generation sequencing technologies. DGGE and cloning identified the same species in all four samples. However, 454 pyrosequencing identified one more genus in three samples. Hence, it was likely that some of the other 16S rRNA gene PCR-positive samples contained more species than were revealed by DGGE. To detect the additional bacteria in the samples, all samples could have been analyzed by pyrosequencing; nevertheless, due to the cost of pyrosequencing, it was only used to evaluate DGGE results in the four samples.",

There are a few widely used broad-range 16S rRNA gene primers. Although \u201cuniversal,\u201d these primers differ in their taxonomic coverage, the degree of specificity of primers for different organisms, and the extent of phylogenetic information generated by the target 16S rRNA gene fragment (27). Cloning bias may also occur due to a different ligation efficiency of TA cloning system when cloning diverse insert pools (37). Similarly, 454 pyrosequencing is associated with various biases, such as those caused by emulsion PCR, systematic base calling errors, etc. Even so, the 454 pyrosequencing reads may be used to compare the proportional read abundance of a given species with itself across samples (3). Thus, the pyrosequencing data indicated that the proportions of Enterobacter and Klebsiella in the population were nearly the same on the two sides of catheter 7, whereas the proportions of Actinomyces and Pseudomonas were unequal on the two sides of catheter 12. For the purpose of absolute quantification, quantitative PCR with primers specific for an organism or an organism group is more suitable.",

In comparison, quantitative PCR is a fast culture-independent molecular method and has been used routinely in many clinical microbiological departments. Choosing the appropriate quantitative PCR assay requires a priori supposition of the pathogens involved in contrast to these other methods. To detect and identify the causative agents quickly and without a priori supposition of the involved bacteria, the new PLEX-ID system may be a good candidate. This technology can in theory identify all present microbes in a sample within 6 h by using multiple primer sets to amplify multiple regions of the bacterial genomes, followed by mass spectrometry analysis (14).",

Surprisingly, culture-independent molecular methods did not detect bacteria more frequently than culture-based methods. Thus, based on this pilot study, urine cultures seem to be sufficient for the routine diagnosis of CAUTI, which, however, should be confirmed by other studies. Caution should be taken when using catheter tips for diagnosis to avoid contamination, and loosely attached bacteria should be removed by rinsing the catheter with, e.g., phosphate-buffered saline. 16S rRNA gene fingerprinting did not detect more bacterial species than culture-based methods from the urinary catheters, whereas deep sequencing using next-generation sequencing tools may uncover more species. Finally, the species identified are not representative for our facility and should not be compared to other studies.",
