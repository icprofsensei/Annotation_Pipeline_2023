Conventional metagenomic sequencing, however, does not integrate information about the host, which is often critical to distinguish infection from infectious disease, and to assess the severity of disease. Here, we explore the utility of high-throughput sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) after bisulfite conversion to map the tissue and cell types of origin of host-derived cfDNA, and to profile the bacterial and viral metagenome. We applied this assay to 51 urinary cfDNA isolates collected from a cohort of kidney transplant recipients with and without bacterial and viral infection of the urinary tract. We find that the cell and tissue types of origin of urinary cfDNA can be derived from its genome-wide profile of methylation marks, and strongly depend on infection status. We find evidence of kidney and bladder tissue damage due to viral and bacterial infection, respectively, and of the recruitment of neutrophils to the urinary tract during infection. Through direct comparison to conventional metagenomic sequencing as well as clinical tests of infection, we find this assay accurately captures the bacterial and viral composition of the sample. The assay presented here is straightforward to implement, offers a systems view into bacterial and viral infections of the urinary tract, and can find future use as a tool for the differential diagnosis of infection.",

First, the assay implements a genome-wide measurement of cytosine methylation marks comprised within cfDNA\u2014marks that are highly cell, tissue, and organ-type specific\u2014to determine the cell and tissue types that contribute to the mixture of host cfDNA in a sample. Several recent studies have shown that profiling CpG methylation marks in urinary or plasma cfDNA, via whole-genome sequencing, targeted sequencing, or PCR assays, can be used to determine their tissues of origin and to quantify tissue-specific injury in various diseased settings (6\u20138). Here, we explore this concept for the monitoring of injury due to infection. Second, the assay quantifies the relative abundance of microbes via WGBS of cfDNA. Several studies have investigated the utility of conventional, metagenomic sequencing of cfDNA for infection testing in clinical samples (2, 4, 9, 10).

More than 80,000 patients receive lifesaving kidney transplants worldwide each year (11). Immunosuppression after transplantation is required to manage the risk of rejection but leaves patients vulnerable to viral and bacterial infection. BK polyomavirus (BKV) infection has emerged as a serious risk factor for allograft survival. BKV reactivation occurs in up to 73% of kidney transplant recipients and leads to BK polyomavirus nephropathy (BKVN) in up to 8% of patients (12, 13). Renal biopsies are currently required to confirm BKVN and to distinguish BKVN from BKV reactivation without nephropathy (BKV+/N\u2212). While BKVN histology is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of tissue, biopsies from BKV+/N\u2212 patients are similar to those without reactivation (12). It remains unclear whether BKV reactivation alone induces kidney damage. Bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) affects \u223c43% of kidney transplant recipients in the first 42 mo posttransplant (14). There is a disagreement in the literature regarding the appropriate balance between mitigating the risks of infectious complications and adverse effects of antimicrobial treatment for UTI. In this study, we describe a urinary cfDNA assay that can identify viral and bacterial infectious agents and can quantify the degree of host injury related to UTI.",

We downloaded 112 genome-wide methylation datasets representing 16 different tissue types (Dataset S1) (19\u201323) and determined tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using Metilene (24). We compared CpG methylation profiles of each tissue group in a 1-versus-1 approach and found 91,275 DMRs, with an average length of 453 bp. Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the methylation density measured across all DMRs revealed global tissue-specific clustering, with 3 heterogeneous clusters representing blood, gut, and a diverse group of other solid organ tissues (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). To identify both global and local structural features within reference methylomes, we applied uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP) (25). We found that UMAP further resolves reference methylation profiles into clusters composed of specific cell types (Fig. 1 D and E). For example, among myeloid cells, cell types with similar lineages such as macrophages and monocytes clustered more closely than those from other lineages on the UMAP projection. These analyses confirm that genome-wide methylation profiles are cell, tissue, and organ-type specific, and can in principle inform its tissue of origin, as described previously (6, 7, 26\u201328).",

For sex-mismatched donor\u2013recipient pairs, the proportion of ddcfDNA can be estimated by evaluating the coverage of the Y chromosome relative to the autosomal chromosomes (Materials and Methods) (2, 33). We verified that the proportion of ddcfDNA measured by sequencing of bisulfite-treated cfDNA matched the proportion of ddcfDNA measured using conventional sequencing (n = 36 matched samples, Spearman\u2019s rho = 0.97, P < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216; Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, Fig. S2), and then quantified the proportion of ddcfDNA in urine for all sex-mismatched donor\u2013recipient transplant pairs (n = 46). We observed a very large range of ddcfDNA values across all samples (3 to 99%). Superimposing the ddcfDNA proportion on the PCA and UMAP projections revealed that samples with a higher proportion of ddcfDNA landed closer to the reference cluster composed of kidney tissue (Fig. 2 A and B; n = 44; 2 samples from a patient that received both a kidney and bone marrow transplant were excluded from this analysis, because the donor fraction represents the summation of kidney DNA and engrafted bone marrow-derived cells for this case).

To overcome this limitation, we computed the absolute concentration of tissue-specific cfDNA by multiplying the proportion of tissue and cell type-specific DNA obtained using the approaches above with the concentration of total host-derived cfDNA in the sample (Materials and Methods). We observed marked temporal dynamics of the concentration of cfDNA from different cell and tissue types in absence of infection (no-UTI, Normal and Early groups, Fig. 3A). Recovery of postoperative stress in the first 3 d after transplantation was associated with a marked increase in cfDNA from most tissues. This signal of early postoperative injury decayed to a low baseline within 10 d after transplantation, and after 3 mo posttransplantation quiescence was observed with markedly low amount of cfDNA from all cell and tissue types in absence of infection.",

In addition, we found that this cfDNA measurement can distinguish BKVN from BKV reactivation without nephropathy (BKVN vs. BKV+/N\u2212, mean kidney cfDNA, 21.9 and 6.9 ng/mL, respectively; P = 7.9 \u00d7 10\u22123), and BKV+/N\u2212 from Normal (mean kidney cfDNA, 6.9 and 1.5 ng/mL, respectively; P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123). The concentration of leukocyte cfDNA was elevated in urine from patients diagnosed with BKVN (mean, 19.0 vs. 1.9 ng/mL in Normal; P = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22123) and BKV+/N\u2212 (mean, 4.0 vs. 1.9 ng/mL; P = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22122) but could not distinguish BKVN from BKV reactivation without nephropathy (P = 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22122) (Fig. 3C). Together, these experiments point to the utility of the assay presented here to noninvasively distinguish nephropathy and inflammation due to BK virus infection. The kidney cfDNA concentration in samples collected from patients within the first 3 d after transplantation, a period during which we observed significant postoperative injury (Fig. 3A), was also elevated (12.4 ng/mL) and could not be differentiated from the concentration measured in samples from patients with BK disease (P = 0.30 and 0.20 when compared to BKVN and BKV+/N\u2212, respectively). This last observation underlines the importance of paired metagenomic evaluation to distinguish infection- and non\u2013infection-related host injury.",

Bisulfite treatment is known to lead to DNA degradation (37), and this was corroborated by our cfDNA sizing assay. We found that bisulfite-treated cfDNA is on average 10.1 bp shorter than untreated cfDNA (n = 38 matched samples). We furthermore found that the mean fragment length of host-derived cfDNA was negatively correlated with the white blood cell proportion (Spearman\u2019s rho = \u22120.45; P = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123; n = 51) and was shorter for samples from patients with bacterial infection than from patients without bacterial UTI (P = 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22122; mean length of 93 and 101 bp, respectively; Fig. 3F and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). This observation is in line with previous reports that leukocytes create a degradative environment for DNA (38, 39).

A corollary of bisulfite treatment is a decrease in cytosine content, and a reduction in overall read complexity.

We determined the relative representation of bacteria and viruses in these datasets, using approaches previously described (2, 3, 40) (Materials and Methods). We computed the representation of microbial genomes relative to human genome copies and expressed this quantity as relative genome equivalents (RGE) (Materials and Methods). Fig. 4A shows a close quantitative agreement between the species abundance measured for bisulfite-treated and untreated cfDNA, confirming that it is possible to broadly identify microbial cfDNA via shotgun sequencing of bisulfite-treated cfDNA (Fig. 4A; Spearman\u2019s rho = 0.72, P < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216).",

Of these positive urine cultures, 11 had a single identifiable bacterium (Escherichia coli, n = 4; Enterococcus faecalis, n = 3; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, n = 2; Enterococcus faecium, n = 1; Klebsiella oxytoca, n = 1), while a single sample presented 2 different bacterial species (E. faecalis and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus).

This work is motivated by the need to integrate information about host\u2013microbe interactions in clinical metagenomic assays in order to distinguish infection from infectious disease, and to assess the severity of disease. The assay reported here takes advantage of genome-wide profiling of CpG methylation marks comprised within cfDNA to quantify the contributions of different cell and tissue types to the mixture of cfDNA in the sample, and thereby the degree of host damage. Compared to conventional metagenomic cfDNA assays (2, 10), this assay requires a single additional experimental step, bisulfite treatment of the cfDNA isolate, which is inexpensive and can be completed within approximately 2 h. The library preparation requires DNA isolated from just 1 mL of urine and costs approximately $65. A minimum number of 60 million paired-end reads were collected per sample, which can be achieved for $100 to $300, depending on the sequencing platform used. We expect advances in DNA sequencing technology to further decrease the cost of this assay.",

Patients diagnosed with BKVN had elevated kidney-specific cfDNA in urine compared to a normal control group. BKV reactivation without nephropathy was also characterized by elevated levels of kidney-specific DNA but not to the same degree as BKVN. Our findings suggest that there may be kidney damage occurring before the onset of nephropathy. Biopsies provide information only on the sampled region of the kidney and do not capture the inherent heterogeneity of BKV infection within the kidney allograft and disease progression. The assay described here may find use as a noninvasive alternative to conventional biopsy to screen for BKV-related kidney injury.",

In respiratory infection, host transcriptional profiling of the peripheral blood has been shown to provide a means to characterize the host response to viral and bacterial infection, and to discriminate between infectious and noninfectious states (45). Host-response molecular signatures thereby offer a diagnostic approach orthogonal to approaches that focus on viral and bacterial pathogens. Recently, Langelier et al. (46) described a diagnostic approach that combines transcriptional profiling and metagenomic sequencing of tracheal aspirate to classify lower respiratory tract infection. Here, we show that a cfDNA assay can be used to screen for infectious agents and to quantify the degree of host damage. The strength of this assay lies in its simplicity of implementation, its noninvasiveness, and its ability to directly interrogate host damage, the metric that is most relevant to classify infectious complications in the framework proposed by Casadevall and Pirofski (5).",
