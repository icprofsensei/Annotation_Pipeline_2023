The urinary tract, however, was widely thought to be sterile until only recently, when extended culture techniques and the detection of microbial DNA definitively demonstrated microbial communities of great diversity within this site.[1\u20133] Currently, culture-independent microbial characterization using the sequencing of highly conserved DNA regions, such as the ribosomal RNA gene locus (rDNA), is widely-accepted as a useful, sensitive tool to explore microbial populations. These next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are particularly useful in characterizing microbes that may be difficult to culture or that are present in low abundance (the \u201crare biosphere\u201d).[4] Therefore, the composition and diversity of the urinary microbiome has likely been drastically understated, in part, due to dependence on culture methods to identify resident species.",

Using NGS methods, multiple studies have demonstrated that perturbations in the urinary microbiota appear to correlate with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS).[5\u201313] The clinical significance and utility of these alterations, however, remain unclear, primarily due to challenges that persist for the characterization of microbes from low biomass specimens, such as urine.",

Studies examining the urinary microbiome thus far demonstrate wide variation in their ability to consistently detect microbial species. In many studies, approximately half of patient samples do not have bacterial sequences of sufficient quality for analysis[2, 6, 14]; in other studies, this efficiency could be improved with the use of multiple amplification steps[11], but this may introduce new biases that could skew results. This low sequencing efficiency is likely due to the combination of low biomass and the unique qualities of urine, which include high variability in osmolality/salt content, high abundance of PCR inhibitors, and fluctuating levels of cellular material, all in all making urine a challenging biological fluid to study. The question remains as to whether these sequence-negative samples are truly negative for microbes or whether our detection methods are inadequate to fully characterize these specimens. Until this question can be answered, it remains a very real possibility that the subset of samples analyzed, the \u201csequence-positive\u201d group, may represent a unique subgroup within the analyzed population with higher microbial loads, whose findings cannot be generalized to the larger sample population.",

Despite these challenges, alterations in the fungal microbiota (the \u201cmycobiome\u201d) in the absence of frank infection have been demonstrated in multiple human diseases, such as hepatitis [15], atopic dermatitis [16], inflammatory bowel disease [17\u201319], cystic fibrosis [20], allergy/atopy [21], asthma [22], and psoriasis [23, 24]. As yet, only a few analyses have examined aspects of the urinary mycobiome. Candida spp. have been detectable in urinary samples by culture,[5\u20138] demonstrating their viability. Fungi were also detectable in urine from patients with urological chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS) using the targeted Ibis T-5000 Universal Biosensor system.[25] Interestingly, fungi were detected more frequently in UCPPS patients during symptomatic flares, while no significant differences in the bacterial microbiota could be identified, implicating fungi as important players in lower urinary tract symptomatology. Even in this culture-independent study, however, fungi were detected in less than 10% of patients overall. Again, it is unclear if this low number is representative of the absence of fungi in the majority of subjects or represents severe limitations in our current technologies.",

Fungal levels were assessed using the Fungiquant primers (forward: 5\u2032-GGRAAACTCACCAGGTCCAG-3\u2032; reverse: 5\u2032-GSWCTATCCCCAKCACGA-3\u2032)[26] that recognize a highly-conserved segment of the fungal 18S rDNA region, while bacterial levels were assessed using 16S rDNA primers (forward: 5\u2019-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3\u2019; reverse: 5\u2019-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGC-3\u2019), a universal primer with broad specificity for bacteria. The qRT-PCR protocol employed an initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by an elongation step at 72\u00b0C for 30 min. Relative quantity of bacterial and fungal DNA yields, consistent from experiment to experiment, was calculated by the comparative CT method (2-\u0394\u0394CT method)[27] and normalized to a DNA standard curve derived from a mixed bacterial and fungal culture that remained constant over all tests. Samples with greater than 3% variance between duplicates were reanalyzed in duplicate. An aliquot of 1 \u03bcl of the PCR product was evaluated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.",

The appearance of this non-cellular pellet material was observed with refrigeration (>2 hours) of urine samples prior to processing and with high-speed centrifugation (16,000 rcf). Post-centrifugation pellets from larger urine volumes (>50 ml) also would frequently contain this material, even when pelleted at lower speeds (1500\u20135000 rcf) and processed at room temperature. Microscopic examination of these samples revealed a range of crystalline forms, typically amorphous urates or phosphates, depending on urinary pH. When these microcrystal salts appeared, DNA quality, as assessed by OD260/OD280 ratios, was significantly lower. Relative microbial DNA yields were also consistently lower, suggesting that larger crystal burden interfered with DNA purification (S1 Fig). One such post-centrifugation specimen (shown in Fig 4A) demonstrates a red-orange, sandy pellet, the \u201cbrick-layer\u2019s dust\u201d characteristic of amorphous urates. Confirmation of crystal composition was supported by microscopic analysis (Fig 4B) as well as chemical properties; these pellets could be dissolved by either heating to a temperature >60\u00b0C or adding sodium hydroxide. In a smaller subset of alkaline urine specimens, refrigeration or high-speed prolonged centrifugation resulted in a light-colored sandy pellet, which could be identified as amorphous phosphates by microscopy (Fig 4C). Chemical composition was confirmed by solubility in glacial acetic acid and resistance to dissolution with heating[45]. Other crystal forms were occasionally noted, such as the \u201cenvelope\u201d-type crystals characteristic of calcium oxalate (Fig 4D inset), but these did not typically constitute any sizable portion of the crystalline material. We were able to minimize the appearance of crystalline salts through a combination of expedient processing (within 4 hours of sample acquisition), the avoidance of refrigeration, and optimization of sample size and centrifugation speed.",

Fungi are thought to be low abundance in most body sites and are structurally more robust and difficult to lyse. Multiple challenges in the identification and characterization of fungal species, such as incomplete annotation in common databases, inconsistent taxonomic classification, and variable conservation of the ribosomal locus across divisions of the fungal kingdom[46], complicate studies of fungi in any biologic niche. The combination of these problems with the technical difficulties of working with urine specimens has left previous explorations of the urinary fungal microbiota inadequate to examine anything more than a few, well-characterized species.[25] Given the experiences of others attempting fungal isolation in low biomass specimens, such as blood, we anticipated that substantial modifications of typical protocols used for the isolation of bacteria from urine would be necessary to assess adequately the fungal populations present. As optimal depth of sequencing requires the highest concentrations of DNA possible, we hypothesized that successful fungal DNA extraction for sequencing would require concentration of cellular material from larger volumes of urine, multiple disruption steps to break down fungal cell walls, and inactivation of the abundant PCR inhibitors present in urine. An iterative approach to the optimization of fungal DNA extraction confirmed these suspicions, with multiple modifications from commonly-used standard DNA extraction methods needed to provide consistent, good quality fungal DNA for sequencing-based assessments.",

Approximately 40% of low volume specimens (e.g. 1 ml urine) did not provide adequate sequencing depth for analysis (<1000 reads per sample), while samples >10 ml consistently provided excellent depth of coverage in ~95% of samples. While this volume threshold had previously been suggested[44], our data provides objective confirmation that such a threshold is important for microbial analyses. Unexpected was the discovery that the best results were not associated with the largest, initial sample size, with an optimal sample size of 25\u201330 ml. We believe that this is due to an increase in urinary salts with larger sample volumes beyond a critical point that begins to interfere with DNA isolation. In this study, we utilized urine from asymptomatic subjects; patients with lower urinary tract symptoms tend to restrict fluids as a method to control their symptoms, resulting in urinary salt concentrations that are typically higher. Use of larger sample volumes of 50 ml or greater could unintentionally bias results, artifactually decreasing yields and diversity in patients with urinary symptoms. We selected the 25\u201330 ml volume to avoid this bias for routine use across study populations in the exploration of urinary symptom pathogenesis.",

While this result may seem counter-intuitive, our data suggest that this decrease in fungal DNA seen with higher centrifugation speeds and larger sample volumes is due to the accumulation of amorphous crystals common in urine that interfere with DNA extraction and amplification by PCR. While centrifugation at higher speeds may provide better pelleting of cellular matter, the lowest speed appears sufficient for this purpose; this is the speed routinely used to pellet eukaryotic cells. While lower concentration samples tended to demonstrate similar yields with centrifugation at 5000 rcf, the 1500 rcf centrifugation speed was more reliable across the population and was not associated with any significant loss of material in any samples tested. In addition, the lower speed reduces pelleting of microscopic crystals and de novo crystal formation seen at ultracentrifugation speeds. As we wanted to create a standardized protocol for all samples, we chose this lower speed. In addition, centrifugation at these speeds is readably achievable with most clinical centrifuges that can be found in outpatient centers, which may make rapid processing of samples in the clinical setting feasible. While it is possible that other methodologic variations, such as filter-based concentration methods or magnetic bead separations, could provide improved results, our initial attempts using these methods did not appear promising.",

Subsequent mechanical disruption using silica beads and thermal digestion at 95\u00b0C was followed by division of the sample into 2 smaller batches to allow an effective secondary digestion with proteinase K to inactivate any contaminating DNases. After addition of synthetic carrier DNA to each batch, sample DNA was subsequently isolated by binding to a commercial DNA-binding column. We attempted multiple other variations on our protocol that are not described in this paper, such as preheating the DNA elution buffer to 37\u00b0C or performing a second elution from the DNA-binding column in a small volume, as none of these possibilities made significant differences in the resulting DNA concentrations.

Contamination from nearby sites, such as skin, urethra, and vagina (in women), can contribute heavily to the microbial content of voided samples[44]. When compared directly (Fig 3), fungal levels in samples from women were 2-3- fold higher than those seen for men. While this could reflect a difference in the urinary fungal content between genders that may be a product of the differing anatomy of the lower urinary tract between genders, it may also merely reflect differences in contamination from nearby urogenital sites. As a result, this paper does not seek to make conclusions about the composition of the urinary mycobiome, but instead sought to explore the solutions needed to characterize microbial content from urine specimens. Larger scale studies, which are currently underway, using a multitude of samples will be needed to explore the urinary mycobiome. However, while the samples used in this study were voided in origin, we have since confirmed that this enhanced protocol is successful at producing sufficient quality fungal DNA to obtain good depth of sequencing from a limited number of catheterized urine samples and those obtained by suprapubic aspirate.",

When DNA quantities are barely in the range of detection, small variations in sample quantity or quality or even minor fluctuations in physiologic conditions may result in large misleading population shifts. If certain benign urologic conditions are associated with changes in the overall abundance of fungi in urine, as has been suggested for UCPPS,[25] then methods that fail to adequately represent the population at the lower, baseline levels will underrepresent the populations present in these circumstances. It is likely in that situation that culture-independent microbial analyses will incorrectly identify the upregulation or novel appearance of particular taxa, providing misleading conclusions about disease pathophysiology. These problems are compounded by the fact that urine composition and concentration is highly variable, even within a single individual. Certain disease conditions are associated with systematically smaller void volumes, which might also significantly bias such results. The increased DNA concentration and quality achieved using this optimized approach seek to minimize these biases and provide the most accurate results in the use of sequencing-based methods to define the urinary mycobiome.",

No single extraction method is reliable and optimal for all species in all specimens. While our results from a range of subjects and specimens confirmed the efficacy of this optimized protocol in aggregate, there were individual variations in fungal community patterns. Our optimized protocol as defined was not always the most effective for every subject assessed. The greatest variations occurred with centrifugation conditions; it is likely that for subjects for whom there is a lower urinary salt content there would be improved results with higher centrifugation speeds. Such biases are inevitable for all stages in the process of culture-independent sequencing-based identification of microorganisms.

After adding the indicated amount of sodium phosphate to each sample, each specimen was processed according to the optimal DNA isolation protocol. (A) Fungal and (B) bacterial DNA yields from these samples were calculated by quantitative PCR in triplicate. Profound decreases in microbial DNA yields, despite equal starting DNA quantities, occur with increasing phosphate concentrations. This decrease is directly dependent on phosphate concentration, as seen in plots of the log of the phosphate concentration against the log of the fungal (C) and bacterial (D) DNA yields.",
