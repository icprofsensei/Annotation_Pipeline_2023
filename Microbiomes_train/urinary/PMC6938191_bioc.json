However, organisms such as Lactobacillus and Ureaplasma are slow-growing and standard methodology is not designed to grow these species.2,3 Yet, advancements in molecular target analysis technology, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, has allowed for the identification of a wide variety of naturally occurring species and led to the understanding of the complex composition of the human urinary tract.",

Inclusion criteria included males greater than 18 years old who presented to outpatient urology clinic for evaluation of either gross or microscopic (\u22653 red blood cells per high-powered field) hematuria, according to American Urological Association guidelines. Exclusion criteria included those with urolithiasis on computed tomography scan for hematuria evaluation, probiotic use, nitrite positive urinalysis, previous antibiotic use within 6 months prior to presentation, instrumentation of lower urinary tract within past year, or a previous diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma, or history of overactive bladder or urge incontinence. Those who met the study criteria were included in the final study population.

Our cohort consisted entirely of males by design, but were also primarily in the seventh decade of life and overweight. We chose to exclusively study male patients as the female urinary microbiome has been found to be inherently different,2 likely due to hormonal and anatomic influences. With regard to our cohort mean age, our findings showed a lack of observed difference between those with similar mean age.

We excluded patients that had radiographic evidence of urolithiasis due to the emerging research that the urinary and intestinal microbiomes are associated with urinary stone formation, indicating that unique groups of bacteria are likely present in those with urinary stone disease and could potentially impact our findings.24 Patients with UTIs identified through standard laboratory means within the past 6 months were excluded from this study to reflect the numerous publications that demonstrate the incidence of UTIs is associated with changes in microbial diversity.5,7 Those patients with documented overactive bladder or urinary incontinence were also excluded given recent findings that demonstrate a variation of UM species in those with these conditions.25,26 Probiotic use is thought to alter urogenital microbiota in small clinical studies and molecular biology investigations.27 Additionally, the administration of Lactobacillus casei has been shown to alter the recurrence of superficial bladder cancer,28 so patients who reported taking an oral probiotic were not incorporated into our study. Lastly, previous studies that have looked at microbiota and bladder cancer have used patients with pre-existing urothelial carcinoma and it is therefore unclear whether any observed changes in the microbiome are secondary to the malignancy or are contributing to the development of the disease process. Through careful patient selection, our work hopes to further contribute to the growing body of evidence that seeks to understand this relationship.",

Since bacteria and microbial processes are known to interact with environmental exposures that can lead to human disease and immunological function,9 we hypothesized there would be a difference in the bacterial community in those with a smoking history. However, our study found no significant differences in terms of alpha diversity, beta diversity, or taxonomy after FDR corrections. This warrants further attention with a larger study population to not only validate these findings, but seek to better understand the potential role of metabolic byproducts of tobacco consumption on the pathophysiology of bladder cancer.",

A recent study by Wu et al in China compared a small group of patients with variable grades of bladder urothelial cancer against controls evaluated for non-neoplastic processes and found both increased bacterial richness and a dysbiosis of urinary microbial communities in the cancer group.32 Our study was unable to conclude this difference. Conversely, Bucevic Popovic et al in Croatia similarly studied the urinary microbiome with regard to bladder cancer and found no significant difference in those with and without cancer.11 It is unclear what role ethnicity, geographics, diet, and other patient characteristics plays in the urinary microbiome that may lead to our conflicting results in the context of previously published literature. Additionally unclear is at what point a potential dysbiosis of the urinary microbiome might play on malignant pathophysiology. This question thus far seems not to be addressed in the available literature and we hoped our study can contribute to this discovery. Based on our admittedly small subgroup, we would think that it is actually the neoplastic process that causes a shift in microbial diversity rather than the shift being the instigating feature.",

                    "text": "There are several limitations to our study. First, this is a small sample size and as a result the findings are observational and often do not meet strict scientific statistical significance. We hope to augment our cohort with a larger sample size and prolonged follow up to both strengthen our findings and determine if any of the initially negative evaluations eventually develop a urothelial malignancy. Additionally, we used mid-stream urine samples to collect our specimens, which introduces the possibility of distal urethra and urogenital skin contamination.8,12 We chose this method rather than more invasive approaches such as catheterization or suprapubic aspiration due to its practicality and potential to be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. Interpretation of our results must also be undertaken cautiously, as we are sampling from the unique geographic and demographic cohort that our institution serves, and there are likely differences in microbiota across different diets, geographies, and other yet to be identified influences. There we also did not use duplicate or triplicate samples to confirm the lack of sample contamination. Finally, our study focused on bacterial communities and did not specifically address the urinary mycobiome or virome that, although less abundant than bacteria, may play a role in the microbial balance.",

First, there is great potential to augment current diagnostic tools both in the smoking and non-smoking population by comparing microbiomes. Diagnostic techniques for bladder cancer rely on surveillance and repeat biopsies, but predictive models and tests are currently either poor or nonexistent. A relatively non-invasive test such as a urine sample, even as an adjunct to predictive models, would represent a significant contribution to the diagnostic model. In particular, stratification by smoking history and by development of bladder cancer would allow for applications to distinct clinical scenarios. Second, there is the future possibility of prophylaxis by adjusting the microbiome of the genitourinary tract to influence outcomes that could range from disease progression to recurrence. By applying knowledge of the microbiomes in patients who do not develop bladder cancer, we may at some point be able to adjust the bladder microbiome to decrease the risk of bladder cancer development, perhaps by probiotic inoculation. Future studies can utilize the results of this initial study to investigate such therapeutic potential.",
