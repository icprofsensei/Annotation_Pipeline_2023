Currently, LC has a low five year survival rates relative to other cancers, and thus, novel methods to screen for and diagnose malignancies are necessary to improve patient outcomes. Here, we report on a pilot-sized study to evaluate the potential of the sputum microbiome as a source of non-invasive bacterial biomarkers for lung cancer status and stage. Spontaneous sputum samples were collected from ten patients referred with possible LC, of which four were eventually diagnosed with LC (LC+), and six had no LC after one year (LC-). Of the seven bacterial species found in all samples, Streptococcus viridans was significantly higher in LC+ samples. Seven further bacterial species were found only in LC-, and 16 were found only in samples from LC+. Additional taxonomic differences were identified in regards to significant fold changes between LC+ and LC-cases, with five species having significantly higher abundances in LC+, with Granulicatella adiacens showing the highest level of abundance change. Functional differences, evident through significant fold changes, included polyamine metabolism and iron siderophore receptors. G. adiacens abundance was correlated with six other bacterial species, namely Enterococcus sp. 130, Streptococcus intermedius, Escherichia coli, S. viridans, Acinetobacter junii, and Streptococcus sp. 6, in LC+ samples only, which could also be related to LC stage. Spontaneous sputum appears to be a viable source of bacterial biomarkers which may have utility as biomarkers for LC status and stage.",

The overall five year survival rate for lung cancer has improved very little over the last 30 years, with only 15% of patients living for five or more years after initial diagnosis [2].

Changes in the bacterial loads for key species, for example, have been linked to oral squamous carcinoma, colorectal cancer and oesophageal cancer [9]. Within the context of lung cancer, a link between H. pylori seropositivity and risk of lung cancer has been investigated through the use of serum samples from patients with lung cancer and age-matched controls [10]. Although, no correlation was reported, it did show that a number of people with lung cancer tested seropositive for H. pylori and there is a possibility it could be present in the lung cancer microbiome. The use of serum in this study highlights how the microbiome-cancer links have been investigated using cancers, such as oral [11\u201314] and colorectal [15\u201317] where sampling can be minimally invasive. However, the enclosed nature of the lung complicates sample collection and has involved sampling using bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BAL), tissue from excised lungs obtained during transplantation surgery [18], or indirectly through serum [10].",

                    "text": "In our previous study, we have used sputum to suggest chemical biomarkers linked to lung cancer. Sputum is a complex of mucus, microorganisms, cellular debris and other particles trapped in the lungs by mucus. It provides a non-invasive method of obtaining upper bronchial tract samples that also involves minimal patient discomfort [19]. The production of sputum is a symptom of inflammatory lung airway diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, asthma, and cystic fibrosis, it is often used to provide insight into the underlying malignancies [20]. Indeed, conditions such as asthma [21], COPD [18, 22, 23] and cystic fibrosis [24] have used microbial profiling techniques to reveal potentially important insights into the role that microbes may play in disease aetiology, progression and treatment. Sputum from lung patients has been used to explore, albeit in a culture-dependent method, the microbial flora and the level of antibiotic resistance [25]. A further, culture-independent study using amplicon sequencing suggested that, in sputum, there are significant differences between lung cancer patients and controls, particularly within the Granulicatella, Abiotrophia, and Streptococcus genera [26]. However, to date, there has been no study into the metagenomic composition of the sputum microbiome in lung cancer. Therefore, resolution at the species level of taxonomy has not been possible, and the functional capacity of the microbiome has not been investigated. Other respiratory conditions have been studied with this method, such as cystic fibrosis, though with relatively small sample numbers, such as two [27], five [28], and ten [29].",

Furthermore, we identify the relative abundances of Granulicatella adiacens, and six other bacterial species, Enterococcus sp. 130, Streptococcus intermedius, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter junii, and Streptococcus sp. 6, as a potential, non-invasive and novel biomarker for lung cancer, and lung cancer progression.",

Sequencing files were uploaded to MG-RAST (v3.2) [33] as FASTQ files. Paired-end reads were joined using the facility available within MG-RAST, with non-overlapping reads retained. Sequences were dereplicated and dynamically trimmed using the default parameters for FASTQ files, and human sequences removed by screening against the Homo sapiens (v36) genome, available via NCBI. The MG-RAST pipeline used an automated BLASTX annotation of metagenomic sequencing reads against the SEED non-redundant database [34]. SEED matches can be matched to identity at various taxonomic levels; including genus and species levels. Organism abundances were modelled and exported from MG-RAST using the \u2018Best Hit Classification\u2019 after alignment to the M5NR database, with alignment cut-off parameters set at an e-value maximum of 1 x 10\u22125, a minimum identity of 97%, and a minimum alignment of 15. Functional abundances were modelled and exported from MG-RAST using \u2018Hierarchical Classification\u2019. SEED matches can also be related to metabolic information, again at different levels of classification. The coarsest level of organization; the generalized cellular function was termed level 1, and the finest, individual subsystems level 3. To normalise for potential variations in sequencing efficacy, sequence abundances were transformed into percentages based upon the total read abundance for each sample at each taxonomic or functional level. Statistical analysis was completed using the MetaboAnalyst 2.0 [35] facility and MINITAB 14 package. Multiple hypotheses testing was not corrected for during statistical analyses. Sequence files can be viewed on MG-RAST via the IDs listed in S1 Table and raw sequence reads, after removal of host DNA, have been deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive under study primary accession number PRJEB9033 and secondary accession number ERP010087.",

From this method of analysis, G. adiacens was identified as having positive correlations (P value of regression relationship less than 0.001 in all instances) with six other bacterial species (Fig 5) in positive lung cancer samples, but not in negative lung cancer samples. Additionally, when LC+ cancer stages were plotted against targeted bacterial abundance, a pattern with disease progression was observable.

The lung cancer microbiome has been detailed, at the genus level, in female non-smokers from Xuanwei, China, through the use of amplicon sequencing. Interestingly, significant differences were only detected between sputum samples, and not buccal samples, suggesting a localised effect in the bronchial tree of the lung [26]. This study suggested a potential role of household coal burning exposure, and its effect on the lung microbiome in patients with lung cancer, rather than tobacco smoking, which is the most common cause of lung cancer in more economically developed countries [37]. In this pilot-level study, we looked to address this, and to develop a more in-depth view of the microbiome with clinically relevant samples.",

Furthermore, we have also identified G. adiacens as having a significant positive relationship with six other bacterial species, Enterococcus sp. 130, Streptococcus intermedius, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter junii, and Streptococcus sp. 6. This significant correlation is only observed in patients positive for lung cancer. The Granulicatella genus has been identified as being significantly higher in the sputum of non-smoking lung cancer cases [26], suggesting that it may be a true reflection of lung cancer state, rather than a by-product of tobacco smoking. The Granulicatella genus, and G. adiacens specifically, is a difficult organism to culture, which may be the limiting factor that explains the minimal study that has been conducted into it [38]. It has however, been associated with endocarditis [39] and septicaemia [40]. The sputum microbiome is an understudied area within respiratory microbiology. This may be surprising given that the production of sputum is typically a symptom of lung dysfunction but may reflect the fact that comparison to \u2018healthy\u2019 samples is difficult. This stated, many of the bacterial genera and species that we identified in the LC- patients have also been reported in previous studies investigating changes in the sputum microbiome associated with lung disease [26, 41]. This suggests that our observations are robust and represent an accurate reflection of the bacterial composition of the lung microbiome.",

Of the six other bacterial species associated with G. adiacens in LC+ patients, none appear to have been previously linked to lung cancer in the literature. They may also be responding to a changes in the cancerous lung, or potentially, exist in a synergistic relationship with G. adiacens which enables their higher abundance. Regardless of the biological basis for these significantly higher abundances seen, they nevertheless have the potential to act as biomarkers for lung cancer, in regards to both lung cancer status, but also in staging, due to the pattern of abundances seen in Fig 5. Clearly, given the small scale nature of this pilot study, albeit large for metagenomic studies, these findings should only be taken as suggestive. For example, it is possible that false positives are reported as a result of multiple hypotheses testing in the correlation analyses. Furthermore, due to the limited study size, we were unable to separate our patient cohort into individual test and validation cohorts\u2013which is the \u2018gold\u2019 standard for biomarker discovery studies. We were also limited in the statistical tests that could be performed such as controlling for multiple hypothesis testing and non-parametric analysis. These points stated, it is highly relevant that our findings were still in line with previously reported studies identifying members of the Granulicatella genus as biomarkers for lung cancer status, thereby implying the veracity of our results. Validation of the bacterial species identified in this study, primarily G. adiacens, as potential biomarkers of lung cancer status and stage must be completed in larger cohorts which possess sufficient statistical power to allow for true sensitivity and specificity rates to be calculated.",

Here we have found a total of four Level 2 classifications that are significantly higher in patients positive for lung cancer, including those involved in arginine use, urea cycle, putrescine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) utilisation, and invasion and intracellular resistance. Interestingly, elevated levels of polyamines, such as putrescine and GABA, been associated with a range of cancers including lung malignancies [43]. Polyamines offer a rich nitrogen source of bacteria, and elevated levels associated with lung cancer could explain why there are significantly more associated alignments in positive lung cancer cases. At Level 3 of functional classification, seven functions were significantly higher, and three significantly lower, in the positive lung cancers. Some of these increases reflected Level 2 changes, but others, such as higher levels of iron siderophore sensors and receptor system alignments, further suggest that changes in the cancerous lung are reflected by changes in the lung microbiome. Elevated iron levels are associated with lung cancer [44], and as iron is essential for many cellular functions in bacteria, it is not unexpected that elevated levels of iron associated with lung cancer would result in a selective pressure to reflect this in the microbiome. Functional changes are not unexpected in the lung microbiome as a response to malignancy formation, but this study is the first to confirm that such synergy exists. This suggests that a systems biology approach towards studying the lung microbiome is required to better understand this relationship.",

Therefore, it offers a viable alternative to radiography based diagnoses for high-throughput, non-invasive, and low-risk screens [45]. However, it should be appreciated that sputum production is localised to the upper bronchial tract, and particularly the bronchial tree. As microbiome studies in other respiratory diseases have shown, including in COPD [18] and cystic fibrosis [24], spatial differences can exist within the lungs and therefore, sputum should only be taken as representative of the microbiome in the upper bronchial tract. Furthermore, the microbiome present within sputum samples is likely to consist of a number of taxa present within the oral cavity, which may be present at orders of magnitude greater than those taxa with are present within the lower respiratory tract. Although this may impair the potential insight into the lung microbiome gained through the use of sputum, it does not exclude it as a viable sample medium to be used in screening for lung cancer.",

However, due to the small sample number in this pilot study, more work is needed to confirm these suggestive relationships, and whether they are observable in earlier stage lung cancers, and whether they are able to differentiate between different LC histology.",
