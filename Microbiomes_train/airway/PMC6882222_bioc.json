The mainstay of pneumonia management is early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy targeting the causative pathogens, balanced with preventing antibiotic overuse and emergence of resistance [2]. Thus, timely and accurate identification of causal pathogens is imperative yet remains challenging due to reliance on culture-based methods with low sensitivity and long turnaround times (48~72\u2009h to actionable results [3]). Recently developed rapid polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) tests represent a significant advancement in the field [4], but these tests can only detect the presence/absence of selected panels of pathogens, and thus are not comprehensive enough in breadth or resolution. Culture-independent methods using next-generation sequencing of microbial communities may help overcome the limitations of current diagnostic testing [5\u20137].",

The advent of Nanopore metagenomic sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies [ONT], UK) has offered unprecedented capacities for real-time, detailed profiling of microbial communities at species level (including viruses and fungi) [12\u201315].

Selection of cases was done prior (and thus without knowledge) of DNA sequencing or host-response biomarker experiments. We diagnosed clinical pneumonia based on consensus committee review of clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic data per established criteria [20]. Through the selection process described above, we identified 14 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia: nine with culture-confirmed diagnosis (culture-positive pneumonia group) and five with negative cultures (culture-negative pneumonia group). Culture-positivity was deemed when a probable respiratory pathogen was isolated in clinical microbiologic cultures of respiratory specimens obtained at the discretion of treating physicians (endotracheal aspirate [ETA] in 7 cases, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BALF] in 2 cases [case 2, case 3]). In culture-positive cases, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done as per standard practice at UPMC\u2019s clinical microbiology laboratory, and results were interpreted based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria [21]. We also included eight subjects (controls) who did not have evidence of lower respiratory tract infection and were intubated either for airway protection (n\u00a0=\u20095) or respiratory failure from cardiogenic pulmonary edema (n\u00a0=\u20093).",

For the purposes of comparing ETA sequencing results with clinical microbiologic cultures, we utilized baseline samples in 20/22 subjects, because baseline samples were closer to the timing of clinical microbiologic specimen acquisition for diagnosis of index pneumonia (not ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP]). In two subjects, we utilized ETAs obtained on the fifth day post-intubation (instead of their baseline samples) because in one case (case 10, Additional file 1: Figure S1) the day 5 sample was obtained closer to the timing of clinical cultures for clinical suspicion of VAP, whereas in case 15 the day 5 sample was obtained at a time point that earlier clinical suspicion of pneumonia was refuted and antibiotics were stopped (congestive heart failure control). We utilized only a single specimen per patient in order to maintain our diagnostic inference analyses on patient-level (and not sample-level). From plasma samples taken at the same time with ETAs, we measured plasma procalcitonin levels [19]. We recorded demographic, physiological, and laboratory variables at the time of sample acquisition, from which we calculated clinical pulmonary infection scores (CPIS) [23], and reviewed the antimicrobial therapies administered for the first 10 days from intubation.",

We performed direct-from-sample sequencing and we did not use isolated organisms from clinical cultures for sequencing. However, metagenomic microbial DNA sequencing in clinical respiratory samples is technically challenging because of the high amounts of contaminating human DNA that can overwhelm the sequencing output (ratio of human:microbial DNA >\u200999:1 [24]. Therefore, we applied a human DNA depletion step in ETA samples that utilized a detergent-based (saponin) method for selective lysis of human cells and digestion of human DNA with nuclease, as recently described [16]. We extracted genomic DNA with the DNeasy Powersoil Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and assessed the efficiency of human DNA depletion by comparing quantitative PCR (qPCR) cycle threshold (Ct) of a human gene (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase - GAPDH) and the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region) [25] between samples subjected to depletion vs. not (depleted vs. undepleted samples).",

This microbial enrichment step allowed for generation of sufficient numbers of microbial reads by Nanopore sequencing in depleted samples (median 6682 reads, average proportion 48% of total reads), whereas in undepleted samples the sequencing output was overwhelmed by human DNA (only 1% of reads were of microbial origin) and effectively was unusable (Fig.\u00a01a). Although this enrichment step allowed for generation of analyzable sequencing output in depleted samples (i.e. 48% of total reads), we sought to define whether the depletion protocol altered the underlying microbial communities in any detectable way. For that reason, we compared 16S rRNA gene sequencing profiles between depleted and undepleted samples. We elected to perform 16S-based comparisons because amplicon-based sequencing methods are unaffected by the amount of contaminating human DNA. Importantly, depleted and undepleted samples by 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated no significant differences in alpha or beta diversity (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1b,1b, c), suggesting that the underlying microbial community in depleted samples was closely representative of the raw, undepleted samples that were not subjected to any additional processing.\n",

Subject 9 was a lung transplant recipient who had been receiving antifungal therapy for a positive sputum culture for Aspergillus fumigatus. Clinical decompensation with acute respiratory failure raised concern for bacterial co-infection and initiation of intensive broad-spectrum antibiotics. BALF culture grew again Aspergillus fumigatus, which was the dominant pathogen detected by Nanopore, without any other sequencing evidence of bacterial infection (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3c).3c). Thus, in this case with probable invasive fungal infection, Nanopore sequencing only identified a confirmed fungal pathogen and ruled out the presence of bacterial pneumonia.",

Nanopore detected high abundance of both S. aureus and Klebsiella oxytoca on day 5 sample, revealing that the culture-negative community consisted of abundant previously identified pathogens, which were likely not viable at the time of the day 5 BALF acquisition due to ongoing antibiotic therapy.

Eventually, the patient was proven to be fungemic with delayed growth of Candida glabrata on initial blood cultures prompting addition of antifungal therapy. Nanopore sequencing on ETA sample from day 1 post-intubation showed high abundance of Candida glabrata and Candida dubliniensis with very low abundance of bacterial reads, confirming the absence of bacterial pneumonia and demonstrating fungal colonization of the allograft. Of note, in two other culture-negative cases, Nanopore also detected high abundance of Candida albicans (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3d),3d), whereas in the last case, both Nanopore and 16S sequencing identified abundant oral bacteria with no typical respiratory pathogens.",

Despite not meeting diagnostic criteria, 5/8 cases empiric antibiotics were prescribed empiric antibiotics early in their course for initial consideration of possible pneumonia. Five samples were dominated by common oral bacteria, such as Rothia and non-pneumoniae Streptococcus species [33, 34]. However, in the other three samples, Nanopore and 16S sequencing detected potential respiratory pathogens (e.g. S.aureus, H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae) that were likely airway colonizers not causing clinical infection, notion supported by clinical improvement despite early discontinuation of antibiotics and/or low procalcitonin levels (Additional file 1: Figure S1). No significant fungal DNA presence was detected by Nanopore sequencing in the control group (Fig. \u200b(Fig.33e).",

Our analyses highlighted global microbial community structure and species-level compositional differences associated with culture-positivity and clinical diagnosis of pneumonia.

The high concordance of our sequencing results with clinically-obtained microbiologic studies, despite the use of different samples (research ETAs vs. clinical ETA or BALF) highlights the robustness of DNA-based sequencing approaches for pathogen identification. Obviating the need for ex-vivo growth for organisms, direct-from-sample sequencing can offer comprehensive snapshots of the component microbes of the communities at the time of sample acquisition. Sequencing methods are thus robust to specific growth condition requirements or the impaired viability of organisms due to antecedent antimicrobials [35]. In exploratory analyses of the sequencing output, Nanopore also provided antibiotic resistance information by detecting clinically relevant resistance genes that matched the phenotypic resistance on antibiograms (e.g. mecA detection/absence in MRSA/MSSA cases, respectively). Overall, rapid metagenomic sequencing closely matched the results of current, reference-standard diagnostic methods in our cohort, which typically take 2\u20133\u2009days for allowing appropriate antibiotic adjustments to occur. Thus, with further external validation in additional cohorts, nanopore metagenomics have the potential to shorten the time to etiologic diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial therapy selection.",

In such cases, early de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotics could be further supported by sequencing results. Nonetheless, in 3/5 airway controls, potential respiratory pathogens were detected in high abundance by both Nanopore and 16S sequencing, in the absence of other supportive evidence of pneumonia. Such cases highlight an important clinical challenge that can emerge from the high sensitivity of sequencing technologies for identifying pathogenic organisms missed by cultures. Detection of abundant DNA from respiratory pathogens in the airways of mechanically-ventilated patients does not translate into a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia or need for antibiotic administration. As the field of sequencing-based diagnostics is nascent, we currently do not have diagnostic thresholds for distinguishing colonizing vs. infecting organisms, similar to the ones considered for culture-based methods based on numbers of colony-forming units [38]. However, the distinction between colonization and infection cannot be based solely on culture results or microbial DNA sequencing outputs, but needs to be an integrative one, incorporating clinical, radiographic, and systemic/focal host-responses [39\u201341]. With the introduction of RNA-based sequencing, a simultaneous assessment of microbial community profiles with the corresponding host transcriptomics at the local level may offer further diagnostic insights [40]. At the same time, knowledge of colonizing organisms in critically-ill patients can facilitate more targeted choices for initial antibiotic regimens in the event of a secondary infection, such as VAP.",
