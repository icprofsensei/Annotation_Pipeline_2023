However, very little is known about the influences of working on a pig farm on the human nasal microbiota. We longitudinally collected samples from 30 pig farms (air and nasal swabs from humans and pigs) in Switzerland from 2014 to 2015. As controls, nasal swabs from cow farmers and individuals with no contact with farm animals were included. An analysis of the microbiota for all samples (n\u2009=\u2009609) was performed based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing (MiSeq) and included the investigations of source-sink dynamics. The numbers of indoor airborne particles and bacterial loads in pig farms were also investigated and were highest in winter. Similarly, the microbiota analyses revealed that the alpha diversity values of the nares of pig farmers were increased in winter in contrast to those of samples from the nonexposed controls, which displayed low alpha diversity values throughout the seasons. Source-sink analyses revealed that bacteria from the noses of pigs are more commonly coidentified within the pig farmers' microbiota in winter but to a less extent in summer. In addition, in winter, there was a stronger intrasimilarity for samples that originated from the same farm than for samples from different farms, and this farm specificity was partially or completely lost in spring, summer, and fall. In conclusion, in contrast to nonexposed controls, a pig farmer\u2019s nasal microbiota is dynamic, as the indoor-air microbiota of pig farms drives the composition of the pig farmer\u2019s nasal microbiota in a season-dependent manner.",

Many studies have monitored the overall air quality inside pig farms (4,\u20139) and the possible transmission of zoonotic bacteria (10,\u201314). The majority of studies have focused on sampling during a very short time period or even only one point in time and therefore do not address possible seasonal variations in pig farms. In Switzerland, there is a mean temperature variation of 18\u00b0C throughout the year, with low temperatures in winter, high temperatures in summer, and intermediate temperatures in spring and fall (15). These temperature shifts lead to different behaviors and farm management habits in the pig farming industry. In winter, openings such as doors and windows are closed, and a lower ventilation rate is taken up to minimalize heat loss. There are studies that have investigated seasonal variabilities of bacteria, archaea, and fungi in the air of pig buildings, and they have found a seasonal effect (16,\u201319). However, none of these studies have investigated the influence of this variability on the human nasal microbiota. Recent studies have found evidence that there is substantial exchange of microbial communities among humans and the animals with which they are in close contact (14, 20, 21). In a previous study, we also showed the presence of a specific microbiota pattern for each investigated pig farm in winter by a cross-sectional approach (14). The present study used a longitudinal approach to address the seasonal variability of the nasal microbiota of pig farmers as well as the nasal microbiota of pigs and the air inside the pig confinement building. We utilized Illumina MiSeq sequencing in combination with the recently developed DADA2 pipeline (22). The present study was performed to address the following questions. (i) What changes occur in the human nasal microbiota throughout the seasons in individuals with and without close contact with farm animals? (ii) Are these potential changes driven by the airborne microbiota and are they farm specific?",

The numbers of reads per sample ranged from 3,364 to 127,393. The 26,203 SVs were classified into 48 phyla, of which 4 dominant phyla made up >97% of the overall abundance (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) (Fig. 3). The relative abundances of phyla and families were similarly distributed across seasons for each sample type (Fig. 3A and \u200bandB).B). We tested for significant differences of families and phyla between subsequent seasons for all sample types using an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-like differential expression (ALDEx) analysis. There were significant differences between fall and winter in families and phyla from pig farmers, differences in the phyla Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria in air samples, and significant differences in both phyla and families in pigs for all comparisons (see Table S3). In pig farmers and air, the fraction of significant phyla and families was less than 10%, and in pigs, the significant fraction was higher with up to 25% (see Fig. S2).",

Unsurprisingly, our data indicate that most of the microbial variation (57%) could be explained by the sample type (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA], P\u2009=\u20090.001) (see Table S4). The location effect of the various farms was stronger for pig (24%), air (37.4%), and pig farmers (29.3%) and weaker for cow farmers (9.7%) compared to the overall contribution.

This is consistent with other studies that investigated the microbiota of the nasal vestibule, the nasopharynx, and the trachea in a longitudinal manner (25,\u201327). However, there was a significantly lower alpha diversity in summer in nasal samples from pig and cow farmers than in winter in our study. This change in alpha diversity was not seen in nonexposed controls who probably spent most of their time in indoor environments (offices and homes). Importantly, air samples and nasal samples from pigs showed the same trend as the nasal swabs from pig farmers, with increased alpha diversity values in winter. Previous studies also found higher diversity in winter than in summer for both bacteria and fungi in the air in pig confinement buildings (16, 17).",

Nevertheless, a significant effect of season on the microbiota was observed in the human-derived sample types from pig and cow farmers but not nonexposed individuals. In young children and adults, it has also been shown that season acts as a major factor in driving the dynamics of the nasal microbiota (25, 28). In contrast to our findings, De Boeck et al. reported no correlation between season and microbial composition in healthy humans (29). However, they only collected one sample per study participant, and it is likely that the interindividual variation was too strong to detect seasonal correlations.",

Depending on the sample type comparison, this strong specificity is partially or fully lost in the following seasons. These differences can also be explained by the aforementioned hypothesis. Due to the low temperatures in winter, windows and especially doors are opened less frequently, and the airborne bacteria from the indoor air may be less likely to be diluted with outdoor air. This would increase the impacts of humans, pigs, and possibly various other sources in the pig building on the microbial composition and would ultimately promote the emergence of a farm-specific microbiota. A higher frequency of opening doors in spring, summer, and fall would lead to a decrease of this farm-specific effect.",

By collecting different sample types from the same farm throughout the year, it was possible to show that the farm-specific effect is strongest in winter and partially or even completely lost in the subsequent seasons. A further strength of the study is that the recruitment of cow farmers and individuals without contact with farm animals as control groups made it evident that the nasal microbiota of people with a farming lifestyle are more heavily affected by seasonal changes than those of individuals who spend the majority of their lives in an indoor environment.",

The periods of the seasons were chosen on the basis of previously observed temperature patterns in Switzerland based on meteorological data from the last ten years (15). Winter and summer were characterized with cold (mean, 8\u00b0C) and warm (mean, 25\u00b0C) temperatures, respectively, while spring and fall were represented by moderate temperatures (mean, 18\u00b0C). Among the overall 30 visited farms, 10 were naturally and 20 were mechanically ventilated. With the exception of very few, windows were always closed in winter and also during the other seasons. However, all the doors were systematically opened during the hot days (always in summer and sometimes also in spring and fall).",

We measured mass fraction of inhalable particles (PM10). Units were expressed in microgram per cubic meter, and the log-transformed values were visualized. Sampling was performed in the central pen at a height of approximately 1\u2009m for 10 min (one read every 10\u2009s). The average PM10 concentrations were calculated for each farm, and seasonal differences were determined with a linear model (lmer function). Simultaneously and at the same location, airborne bacteria were sampled with a Coriolis \u03bc air sampler (Bertin Technologies, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) at a flow rate of 300\u2009liters/min for 10\u2009min. Airborne particles were collected into a sterile cone containing 15\u2009ml 0.005% Triton X-100 solution. Repeated sampling was not performed on the same day or during the same week to assess variations. However, in the international ISO norm (ISO16000-18) concerning the sampling of cultivable airborne fungi, it is mentioned that either 4 or 5 replicates representing a total volume of 300\u2009liters are sufficient to assess daily exposure and variability, which is 10 times less than in our study (3,000\u2009liters in total).",

Instances of the centered log-ratio transformation values were generated (aldex.clr function), and significant differences were assessed. Overall significant differences were investigated via an omnibus test (generalized linear model and Kruskal Wallis tests for one-way ANOVA with Benjamini-Hochberg [BH] correction [33]; aldex.glm function), and significant differences between seasons were assessed using Wilcoxon rank tests with BH correction (33) (aldex.ttest). Alpha diversity was assessed with the functions estimate (richness) and diversity (Shannon diversity indices [SDIs]). Significant differences between seasons were assessed with linear regression models with random effects to correct for clustering on location level, as several samples originated from the same location, and to correct for clustering on the individual identification (ID) level, as there were multiple samples from the same human individual (one sample per season). The regression model was calculated with the lmer function from the lmeTest package.",

Significant clustering between seasons was determined by permutational multivariate analysis of variance using 1,000 Monte Carlo permutation tests (PERMANOVA; adonis function) followed by Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction for multiple testing (33). The post hoc tests were performed with stratification for clustering on season level for pig and air samples, as the pig samples came from a different animal each season and the air sample was not taken at the exact same spot each time. Therefore, it was not possible to calculate the influence of season on variance for these sample types.",
