Anaerobic bacteria decrease in relative abundance with older age and disease progression, and may impact host inflammatory state. Persons with CF suffer from recurrent pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) that are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Our objectives were to examine the effect of broad-spectrum (BS) vs narrow-spectrum (NS) anaerobic antibacterial treatment on bacterial diversity, and on pulmonary function recovery.",

Alpha diversity (relative abundance) was calculated via Shannon Index and Inverse Simpson formulas and \u03b2 diversity (similarity in community composition) by Morisita-Horn (MH). Differences in diversity indices and PFTs were compared with regard to BS vs NS anaerobic activity, and statistical significance determined by GLS regression.",

The differences in \u03b2 diversity suggest BS therapy can have a lasting impact on community composition. As those receiving NS therapy had similar or better recovery of pulmonary function than those with BS, there is no indication that NS therapy leads to worse clinical outcomes. A limitation may be that children receiving BS therapy tended to have more severe disease.",
