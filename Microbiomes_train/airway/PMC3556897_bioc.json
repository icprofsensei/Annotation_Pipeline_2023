There is now mounting evidence that the reason this complication primarily affects jaw bones, and usually after invasive dental procedures or oral trauma, is because microbial biofilms in the mouth and saliva gain access to the exposed jaw bone and play a significant role in the necrosis of the bone and thus the etiopathogenesis of this condition.6\u20138 Recent investigations have shown that BP drugs inhibit oral wound healing and facilitate bacterial colonization on bony surfaces where both BP and biofilm bacteria colocalize.9,10 Therefore, the clinical problem of BRONJ is essentially a nonhealing biofilm-mediated osteomyelitis of the jaw.11\u201313",

This line of investigation could provide rationale in the future for BRONJ therapeutics and targeted antimicrobial therapy. Our working hypotheses were that individuals with BRONJ harbor different microbial assemblages than nonaffected patients, that changes in microbial assemblages occur when host cells shift from a primarily planktonic (e.g., saliva) to surface-attached (e.g., biofilms) lifestyle, and that BRONJ patients have a higher proportion of lysogenic bacteria and their integrated prophage could influence host pathogenicity.",

Samples of saliva for microbial analysis and biofilm cultivation were collected from 10 individuals recruited for this study at the Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry, University of Southern California. Five patients affected by BRONJ and 5 non-BRONJ control patients met all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study, and informed consent was obtained from each patient. No patients with cognitive, language, and hearing problems were recruited, to ensure that all patients could provide their own consent. The individuals in the BRONJ and control groups were matched by age, sex, ethnicity, disease, and BP use, including type, dose, and duration. For inclusion in this study, BRONJ diagnosis had to be established by standard clinical and radiographic protocol as per the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons diagnostic criteria.3 All patients in the study were diagnosed by one of the study investigators (P.P.S.). Male and female adult patients with a history of intravenous or oral BP therapy for \u22651 year were recruited for this study, and stage I-III lesions of BRONJ were used for study inclusion to ensure that all patients had bone exposed in the oral cavity for >8 weeks as per the definition of BRONJ. To minimize confounding variables or effect modifiers, patients were excluded from the study if they: 1) had active cancer or recent cancer (<3 year history); 2) had salivary gland hypofunction or xerostomia as determined by clinical criteria17 regardless of the underlying pathology or medication associated with these conditions; 3) had any oral or gastrointestinal pathology, such as self-reported active reflux or reflux history, or mucositis determined by clinical examination, which could potentially alter oral microbial community composition; 4) had an active oral or systemic infection; 5) had received any local or systemic antimicrobial therapy for any condition within 6 months; or 6) were at \u22651 year of BP therapy discontinuation.",

Saliva for all study subjects was collected at the same time by a standardized draining method as described previously,19 with patients sitting and in the upright head position. Saliva was collected for 5 minutes in a Proflow sialometer (Amityville, NY) or until \u22650.5 mL of saliva was collected (0.1 mL/min average). Samples were immediately transfered to sterile chilled plastic tubes with 10% glycerol added and then frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored in an \u221280\u00b0C freezer until being transported to the J. Craig Venter Institute in San Diego for further analysis. Before analysis, the saliva samples were slowly thawed, combined with a nutrient-depleted Todd-Hewitt (TH) buffer, and mechanically homogenized. Density-gradient centrifugation through Nycodenz (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) was used to separate microbial cells (collected from the interface) and viruses (collected from the supernatant). The virus fraction was passed through a series of filters of decreasing pore size (1.2, 0.8, and 0.2 \u00b5m) to remove residual cellular contamination, and the flow-through was collected for final purification and microscopic enumeration. A fraction of the microbial cells was reserved for microscopic enumeration and the remainder was passed through the same series of filters that were used for virus purification. The 0.22-\u00b5m filters were reserved for microbial community DNA extraction. Saliva samples were used to create anaerobic biofilm starter cultures with TH media, ascorbic acid, and cysteine HCl. Starter cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight under anaerobic conditions to mimic in vivo conditions because the organisms associated with BRONJ identified to date are predominantly anaerobes or facultative anaerobes in areas of sequestrum with little blood supply or oxygen. Cultures were mixed, transfered to separate 12-well plates and incubated under anaerobic conditions. Media was refreshed until mature biofilms formed (~5 days). Microbial cells and viruses were extracted from biofilms as described for the saliva samples.",

Furthermore, research on the infectious aspects of jaw diseases in general has focused on the internal development and the pathogenicity of dental biofilms, and relatively little attention has been given to the source of the biofilm microorganisms, such as saliva.28 Oral bacteria exist in a planktonic state in saliva before colonizing oral and dental surfaces as biofilms, such as exposed bone and soft tissue surfaces in patients with BRONJ. Therefore, a better understanding of salivary pathogens and saliva-derived biofilms could lead to new approaches for diagnosing and managing oral infectious diseases.28 Human viruses are also frequent inhabitants of the mouth, yet until now no information existed on the presence or the role that viruses may play in BRONJ despite the fact that viruses are known to heavily influence gene transfer among microbes, virulence, and the population pathobiology of microbial biofilms.",

This trend is often observed in other natural environments.29 The finding of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria being the dominant phylotypes found in patients is consistent with recent in vivo molecular findings of affected bone and soft tissue specimens in BRONJ patients.30,31 This suggests that saliva may be one source for bone colonization and infection in patients with BRONJ in addition to other possible sources such as odontogenic or periradicular infections.32 Further, planktonic salivary diversity may be influenced by the microbial niche of the dentition. We found that BRONJ patients had fewer teeth on average and some were edentate compared with the control group. Because patients with teeth have a different microbial flora than edentulous individuals, this could influence microbial findings. However, the small size of the patient population, the nature, and the scope of the present study does not allow for any statistical analysis or meaningful conclusions in this respect.",

As a reference, the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Human Genome Project has been generating similar reads per samples from various human micro-biome samples, including the oral cavity, and investigators have shown that 1,000 sequences per sample is sufficient to address the taxonomy question.33 Additionally, metagenomic identification of bacteria in general determines the presence of specific DNA but not viability; because bacterial DNA can remain PCR-detectable for up to 1 year after cell death, metagenomics may overestimate current bacterial load.34 Further, a single microbiologic examination can not determine if specific bacteria are permanent or transient residents or are primary pathogens or merely bystanders to disease. Laboratory contamination or contamination by nonhuman bacteria is also a potential problem in studies such as this one, which we sought to minimize by our methodology. Our results of the types of bacteria present suggest low contamination because they are consistent with recent reports of identified oral species in a similar context.30,31 However, the lack of detection of any obligate anaerobes in our study, in contrast to those earlier studies, is a limitation and is likely due to the nature of our study, which involved analysis of salivary pathogens and not BRONJ lesions directly. Finally, our results showing differences in microbial and viral abundance or morphotypes between samples or groups may be due to inherent differences in adherence or biofilm formation potential of organisms. Such differences should not be considered to be solely due to other covariates such as disease state.",

Microbial cultures in patients with BRONJ traditionally have not been helpful in directing therapy, because specific pathogens have not been identified and most of the associated biofilm organisms are noncultivable35\u2014thus the need for metagenomic approaches. Importantly, viruses had not been identified or described in this condition before the present study. Their presence may account for some of the virulence and pathobiology of biofilm microbes. The presence of viruses existing as prophage could also account for some of the antibiotic resistance that has been reported in BRONJ-related microbes.31 Collectively, this translational research has overcome critical barriers to progress in this field and informed our understanding of the pathogenesis of BRONJ. Future investigations with larger populations conducted prospectively to correlate metagenomic findings with disease progression and treatment response over time may allow for more accurate diagnostics and prognostication. Continuing in this line of investigation will be critical in the future for informing clinical approaches to disease intervention and the realization of targeted antimicrobial therapeutics for jaw osteonecrosis.",
