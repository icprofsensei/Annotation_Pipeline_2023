This uncultivable fungus is an obligate pulmonary pathogen that in immunocompromised individuals causes pneumonia, a major life-threatening infection. Long-read PacBio sequencing was used to assemble a core of subtelomeres of a single P.\u00a0jirovecii strain from a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen from a single patient. A total of 113 genes encoding surface proteins were identified, including 28 pseudogenes. These genes formed a subtelomeric gene superfamily, which included five families encoding adhesive glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins and one family encoding excreted glycoproteins. Numerical analyses suggested that diversification of the glycoproteins relies on mosaic genes created by ectopic recombination and occurs only within each family. DNA motifs suggested that all genes are expressed independently, except those of the family encoding the most abundant surface glycoproteins, which are subject to mutually exclusive expression. PCR analyses showed that exchange of the expressed gene of the latter family occurs frequently, possibly favored by the location of the genes proximal to the telomere because this allows concomitant telomere exchange. Our observations suggest that (i) the P.\u00a0jirovecii cell surface is made of a complex mixture of different surface proteins, with a majority of a single isoform of the most abundant glycoprotein, (ii) genetic mosaicism within each family ensures variation of the glycoproteins, and (iii) the strategy of the fungus consists of the continuous production of new subpopulations composed of cells that are antigenically different.",

Using a new DNA sequencing technology generating long reads, we could characterize the highly repetitive gene families encoding the proteins that are present on the cellular surface of this pest. These gene families are localized in the regions close to the ends of all chromosomes, the subtelomeres. Such chromosomal localization was found to favor genetic recombinations between members of each gene family and to allow diversification of these proteins continuously over time. This pathogen seems to use a strategy of antigenic variation consisting of the continuous production of new subpopulations composed of cells that are antigenically different. Such a strategy is unique among human pathogens.",

However, the biology of this pest remains difficult to study in the lab because of the lack of any established methods for in vitro culture.

Moreover, a mechanism of surface antigenic variation, to which ca. 5% of the genome is dedicated, seems crucial to escape from the human immune system during colonization, although the details have not been understood so far. Surface antigenic variation is a common strategy among major microbial human pathogens: for example, Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, Candida, Neisseria, and Borrelia. It relies on various genetic and/or epigenetic mechanisms aimed at expressing only one or few of them at once (7). Such systems often involve gene families encoding surface antigens localized at subtelomeres, presumably because these regions of the genome are prone to gene silencing, which is used for mutually exclusive expression, and possibly enhanced mutagenesis (8). Moreover, the formation of clusters of telomeres at the nuclear periphery may favor ectopic recombinations (8), which can be responsible for the generation of new mosaic antigens.",

The molecular mechanism was then assumed to be also active in P.\u00a0jirovecii, as suggested by studies using PCR-based technologies. Antigen diversity was believed to be generated by recombination between members of a single family of ca. 80 subtelomeric genes encoding isoforms of the major surface glycoprotein (msg) (9,\u201311). A single copy of these isoforms would be expressed in each cell thanks to its localization downstream of a subtelomeric expression site, the upstream conserved element (UCS) present at a single copy in the genome. The UCS includes the promoter of transcription, the protein start, and the leader sequence responsible for translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum for final incorporation into the cell wall (12, 13). The mechanism for exchange of the expressed msg gene is thought to be by recombination at a 33-bp-long sequence that is present at both the end of the UCS and the beginning of each msg (the conserved recombination junction element [CRJE]). The exchange of the expressed gene seems relatively frequent and would explain how different msg genes can be expressed in each population (12). The CRJE sequence encodes at its end a potential lysine-arginine recognition site for kexin endoprotease, which might be involved in the maturation of the antigen. Kutty et al. (14) provided evidence for frequent recombinations among msg genes creating potentially mosaic genes. All of these observations were made using conventional cloning procedures and PCRs, and these mechanisms have yet to be understood in a more extensive genomic context.",

The analysis of this data set and laboratory experiments permit a new classification and the characterization of six subtelomeric msg families, demonstrate the presence of pseudogenes, and provide important new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for antigenic variation. Moreover, our observations suggest a unique strategy of antigenic variation consisting of the continuous production of new subpopulations composed of cells that are antigenically different.

The different gene families are clearly individualized as clades, with the exceptions of (i) msg-II, which appears as a subclade of msg-I, and (ii) msg-I, which seems to include two subclades. Using an alternative classification method that does not rely on a single particular MSA (JACOP [Fig.\u00a01a]), the placement of msg-II as a subclade of msg-I was not confirmed, whereas the subclades of msg-I were. Due to the differences in the gene structures and the recombination events reported below, we believe that (i) msg-I and msg-II should be treated separately, and (ii) msg-I should be considered a single family, including two subclades. Figure\u00a01b shows the analysis of trimmed CDS sequences allowing the placement of the msg-VI family, which appeared as a clade on its own, while the classification of the other families remained essentially unchanged.

Except those of the family msg-I, each msg gene presented one or two introns at its 5\u2032 end, as well as a presumptive TATA box upstream of the ATG and an initiator motif (Cap signal) at presumptive sites of initiation transcription (Fig.\u00a02a; see Fig.\u00a0S2 in the supplemental material). The members of family I had only the conserved recombination junction element (CRJE) at the beginning of their single exon. These observations suggested that members of family I can be expressed only upon recombination of their CRJE with that of the single-copy UCS, which encompasses a promoter, whereas all members of the other five families are expressed independently. Three of the six full-length outlier genes seemed not to be expressed since they had no CRJE and missed a TATA box (Table\u00a0S1). Twenty-six partial genes were truncated by the end of the contig so that only three bona fide partial genes were identified, which, however, missed the TATA box, signal peptide, and/or GPI anchor signal, and thus were probably not expressed or not correctly processed (msg44, msg89, and msg99).",

Most motifs included several conserved cysteines and leucines, which resembled the previously identified Pfam MSG domain (see Fig.\u00a0S4 in the supplemental material). Interestingly, conserved leucines were often separated by two to six residues. The beginning of motif 10 corresponded to the end of the previously identified Pfam Msg2_C domain. Accordingly, Pfam predictions identified one to five MSG domains (often partial) per protein of all families and a single Msg2_C domain in each Msg-I protein (see Fig.\u00a0S5 and Table\u00a0S2\u00a0in the supplemental material). The Msg2_C domain was not predicted in families II and III, although they harbored the corresponding motif 10, suggesting that this domain is divergent in these families. The Ncoils predictor revealed three to five coiled-coil motifs spread along members of families I, II, and III, whereas unstructured regions were predicted at the C terminus of Msg proteins of families I, III, V, and VI (Fig.\u00a0S5).",

We investigated this issue among the different msg families using three different numerical methods: two allowing analyses of large sets of genes for screening, and one analyzing only four genes at a time for more sensitive analysis. Two to 18 potential mosaic genes and their putative parent genes were detected within each of families I to IV, involving sometimes partial genes or pseudogenes (Fig.\u00a04 and Table\u00a02). On the other hand, only one potential mosaic gene was identified in family V and none in family VI (P = 0.06). Eight of the 30 mosaic genes detected shared with one parent a perfectly or almost perfectly identical fragment of ca. 100 to 1,000 bp, often close to the site of the predicted recombination events (Fig.\u00a04b; see Fig. S8 at http://www.chuv.ch/microbiologie/en/imu_home/imu-recherche/imu-research-groups/imu-research-phauser/imu-supplementary_data.htm). These latter cases suggested very recent recombination events. BLAST comparison revealed that the regions between the msg genes were more homologous to intergenic regions on other contigs close to msg genes of the same family than those of the other families. These homologous regions sometimes shared identical sequences of 100 to 300 bp. This suggested that recombinations between msg genes may sometimes also involve the flanking intergenic regions. The putative parent genes of mosaic genes were randomly distributed among the two subclades of family I, suggesting that this family must be considered a single entity (see note 5 in Text\u00a0S1).",

The ST-rich regions present in P.\u00a0jirovecii Msg glycoproteins (except those of family IV) are sites of oxygen-linked glycosylation commonly involved in cell to cell adhesion (20). Moreover, most of these glycoproteins were predicted to be adhesins (see note 7 [62] in Text\u00a0S1). Consistently, their structure fits the model of modular organization of fungal adhesins with ST-rich regions at the C terminus and a ligand binding domain at the N terminus (20, 21). Linder and Gustafsson (21) proposed that, in addition to their role in adhesion, the oxygen-linked glycosylations of the ST-rich region confer rigidity to the protein in order to present outward the ligand domain. Thus, the N-terminus regions of the P.\u00a0jirovecii adhesins may correspond to ligand binding domains. The fate and function of the glycoproteins of family IV remain enigmatic since they lack the ST-rich region, are only weakly predicted as adhesins (see note 7 in Text\u00a0S1\u00a0and Table\u00a0S4 at http://www.chuv.ch/microbiologie/en/imu_home/imu-recherche/imu-research-groups/imu-research-phauser/imu-supplementary_data.htm), and may not be attached to the cell wall in the absence of a GPI anchor signal. The conserved leucines separated by two to six residues present in all msg families are similar to leucine zipper motifs, which are often involved in protein-protein nonspecific binding and protein dimerization (22). The latter function is also carried out by the PE-rich region present in msg families V and VI (23). The conserved coiled-coil domains discovered in Msg families I to III are often involved in the formation of heteromultimers and protein complexes (24, 25). On the other hand, the unstructured regions at the C terminus present in four Msg families are not informative because these regions can have several different functions (26). These observations suggest that the Msg adhesins may form homo- or hetero-oligomers at the cell surface, possibly implying a further level of antigen variation that has never been envisaged so far.",

Very interestingly within the scope of protein annotation, this mechanism permits by itself definition of the members of a protein family without having to rely upon the cutting of a phylogenetic tree at an arbitrary height. The frequency of these recombinations remains to be quantified precisely, but it is likely to be reduced in msg families V and VI. The genetic mechanisms involved in the creation of mosaic genes may include a single homologous recombination leading to a telomere exchange or two homologous recombinations leading to a gene fragment conversion or exchange (models are shown in Fig.\u00a0S12 at http://www.chuv.ch/microbiologie/en/imu_home/imu-recherche/imu-research-groups/imu-research-phauser/imu-supplementary_data.htm). Such recombinations could also produce partial genes if they occur between homologous regions that are not located at the same position along the recombining genes. Our results suggest that this is rare because we identified only three partial msg genes out of 113. This conclusion is also consistent with the fact that different motifs are conserved along the sequence of the Msg proteins of each family. Our data suggest that pseudogenes might also be involved in the generation of mosaic genes and thus might constitute a reservoir of sequences that can be integrated into functional antigens. The pseudogenes may result from accumulation of mutations in the absence of expression and thus of selective pressure. This phenomenon could be enhanced by mutation and recombination rates within the subtelomeric gene families higher than those in the rest of the genome (8). The presence of the pseudogenes in the subtelomeres might simply correspond to the state between their birth and their future decay. However, they could also be maintained within the subtelomeres through indirect selective pressure because of their role as a reservoir of fragments for the creation of mosaic genes.",

The exchange of the single expressed gene by recombination at the CRJE sequences might be facilitated by the localization of the msg-I genes closest to the telomeres, because this may in turn facilitate telomere exchanges (a model is shown in Fig.\u00a05). These recombinations could be homologous in nature because the full identity over 33 bp might be sufficient as is the case in fungal cousins (28). However, they could also be site specific because the imperfect inverted repeat present in the CRJE is a common motif used by site-specific recombinases (29). Up to three msg-I genes were present at the end of the subtelomeres. There is no reason to exclude that transfer of more than one msg-I gene to the expression site at once also occurs, followed by polycistronic expression. The polypeptide produced could then be chopped by the endoprotease Kex-1 at the end of each CRJE and each Msg-I anchored to the cell wall separately through its own GPI signal. Interestingly, we detected msg-I pseudogenes linked to the UCS by using PCR in our sample. The cells expressing such truncated antigens may not be selected over time during the infection because of their likely deficiency in adhesion to host cells.

As far as msg families II to VI are concerned, the RNA-seq data are compatible with constitutive or temporally regulated expression of all genes in each cell driven by the promoter present upstream of each of these genes.

This strategy is further suggested by other characteristics of Pneumocystis spp. First, there is a high variability of the subtelomeres between P.\u00a0jirovecii isolates (4), which is consistent with frequent subtelomeric recombinations. The subtelomeres of the isolate we studied here also differed greatly from those of the same chromosomes reported by Ma et al. (4) (see note 6 in Text\u00a0S1). Second, sexuality could be obligatory in the cell cycle (2, 3) because ectopic recombinations between subtelomeres occur during meiosis, within the bouquet of telomeres formed (8). The likely primary homothallic sexuality of Pneumocystis spp. (32) avoids the need to find a compatible partner and thus increases mating frequency, which is believed to favor genetic diversity (33). Moreover, the genetic diversity might be enhanced by mating between the numerous coinfecting strains that are generally present in P.\u00a0jirovecii infections (15). Third, the presence of several msg families may allow the formation of the Msg hetero-oligomers that we envisage above, which could further enhance the cell surface complexity.",

Candida glabrata contain one subtelomeric family of ca. 20 adhesins (7). Trypanosoma brucei presents a large reservoir of sequences used to create mosaic genes of a single surface antigen family made up of about 1,000 genes located in subtelomeres as well as on minichromosomes (7). In the latter organism, pseudogenes provide segments to mosaic functional antigens (34), a phenomenon that might also occur in P.\u00a0jirovecii. Plasmodium falciparum harbors one subtelomeric antigen family of ca. 60 members (7). These three organisms present a single gene family subject to mutually exclusive expression involving silencing in several cases. Thus, their populations are homogenous antigenically but may vary over time when the expressed gene is exchanged. Such a strategy might be imposed by sterile niches such as blood and the urinary tract. This contrasts sharply with the putative strategy of antigenic variation of P.\u00a0jirovecii consisting of the continuous production of a mixture of cells antigenically different. The latter strategy may be associated with the particular niche within lungs since this niche tolerates the presence of low abundance fungi as members of the natural lung microbiota. This strategy might allow presenting most cells as different organisms to the immune system and thus having them tolerated during colonization. A similar strategy might be used by Candida albicans living in nonsterile mucosal niches. Indeed, its unique adhesin family presents a high number of serine CUG codons that are ambiguously translated into serine or leucine, thus creating variability from individual genes (35).",

Second, genetic mosaicism within each msg family probably ensures variation of the surface glycoproteins. Third, the strategy of the fungus seems to consist of the continuous production of new subpopulations composed of cells that are antigenically different. Such a strategy is unique among human pathogens and might be associated with the particular niche within host lungs. Given the role of surface antigen variation and regulation in immune avoidance in other human pathogenic organisms, we postulate that antigenic variation may provide a similar role in the life cycle of P.\u00a0jirovecii.",

Four genomic regions were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA extracted as described previously (38). Each PCR product was cloned into the plasmid pCR4-TOPO using the TOPO TA Cloning kit for sequencing (Life Technologies, Inc.). Both strands of the insert of 15 clones for each genomic region were sequenced with M13 primers using the BigDye Terminator kit and the ABI Prism 3100 automated sequencer (both from PerkinElmer Biosystems). Among the 17 clinical specimens collected, only one generated identical sequences for all clones of all genomic regions. Since ca. 15 clones per genomic region were analyzed, a second eventual coinfecting strain in this specimen should not represent more than ca. 7% of the P.\u00a0jirovecii population. This specimen was selected for all experiments performed in the present study. It was from an HIV-infected patient. The genotype of the P.\u00a0jirovecii strain present in this specimen was as follows (the nomenclature refers to that used by Hauser et al. [38]): allele B of internal transcribed spacer 1 of the nuclear rRNA gene operon (T at position 2, 2\u00d7 T at positions 8 to 10, A at position 11, T at position 17, T at position 22, TC at positions 46 to 47, 10\u00d7 T at positions 54 to 62, GAGG at positions 71 to 72, and TTA at positions 111 to 113), allele 8 of the variable region of the mitochondrial 26S rRNA gene (4\u00d7 A at positions 54 to 57, T at position 85, C at position 248, and G at position 288), the reference allele of the intron of the nuclear 26S rRNA gene (GenBank accession no.

This enrichment raised the proportion of P.\u00a0jirovecii DNA from a few percent to ca. 55% as determined a posteriori by high-throughput sequencing. Because only small amounts of DNA are recoverable from a clinical specimen and in absence of an in vitro culture system, a sufficient amount of DNA for high-throughput PacBio sequencing was obtained by random amplification. Five microliters of DNA was randomly amplified in a 50-\u03bcl reaction using the Illustra GenomiPhi HY DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare). This amplification proved to create artificial molecules made of inverted repeats of several kilobases, which were revealed by PacBio sequencing. The reads from these molecules were eliminated by bioinformatics (described below). DNA was then purified using the QIAamp DNA blood minikit (Qiagen) followed by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 10\u00a0\u03bcg glycogen.

PacBio subreads were extracted from the raw h5 files using DEXTRACTOR (https://github.com/thegenemyers/DEXTRACTOR/). The average length of the extracted subreads was 5.2\u00a0kb, with a maximum length of 42\u00a0kb. We removed human-derived reads by mapping them against the human reference genome using BLASR (smrtpipe 2.3 [cutoff corrected score of <55,000). Reverse-complementary artificial reads created by the random amplification were next filtered out (cutoff match length of \u22651,000 bp) after mapping them onto themselves using DALIGNER (https://github.com/thegenemyers/DALIGNER/) (v1.0 [options -A and -I]). The cleaned reads were assembled using the tool FALCON (39) (v0.2 [options length cutoff=8000m and length_cutoff_pr=1000]). PacBio reads were remapped onto the assembly using BLASR and used to evaluate and flag the remaining human contigs. Human-derived contigs were subsequently removed. A total of 2.2\u00a0Gb of P.\u00a0jirovecii DNA sequences corresponding to a 200-fold coverage of the genome were gathered. The assembly was polished to remove residual PacBio errors using Quiver (smrtpipe 2.3 [5 iterations]) (40). The final polished genome assembly included 8.1\u00a0Mb in 219 gap-free contigs ranging from 234 bp to 386\u00a0kb, with an NG50 of 108\u00a0kb and 57% of the genome in 28 contigs larger than 100\u00a0kb. The P.\u00a0jirovecii PacBio assembly obtained in the present study covered 96% of that we previously obtained by other sequencing methods (6) and contained ca. 0.5\u00a0Mbp of subtelomeric sequences. The combination of both our assemblies covered 97% of the assembly of Ma et al. (4). Controls consisting of PCR amplification of specific subtelomeric regions from the same DNA sample confirmed the accuracy of the nucleotide sequence of the polished PacBio assembly, although few errors in repetitive homopolymer regions were detected (see note S8 in Text\u00a0S1).",

The profiles were calibrated against the scrambled genome (window approach, size 60). Using pfsearchV3 (44), the assembled genome was searched for homologous matches with the DNA profile. Curated matches were extracted and aligned against each other using MAFFT (version 7.305) (45). After manual curation and trimming, the alignments were divided into five groups based on neighbor joining (percentage of identity) using Jalview (v2.8.1) (46). One representative candidate per group was selected, and a new profile based on its sequence was generated and calibrated as described above. These DNA msg profiles were used to find and annotate a first set of 75 msg genes in the assembly. A combination of BLASTX, GeneWise, in-house tools, and manual curation was applied using the protein Msg profile to extend and correct these annotations to the set of 113 msg genes analyzed in the present study. The msg genes reported here were all manually curated with respect to their start, stop, and intron coordinates.",

MAFFT (45) alignments of various sets of genes were analyzed by both methods. RAT was used with default settings (i.e., using windows of one-tenth of the length of the alignment and an increment size equal to half of the window size). Bellerophon was used with default settings (i.e., windows of 300 bp and Huber-Hugenholtz correction). RAT can detect several recombination events, whereas Bellerophon reports a single one per mosaic gene. The more sensitive method, TOPALi (v2.5 [http://www.topali.org/]) (60), which is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), was then applied on the potential mosaic genes, and its putative parent genes were detected by the two screening methods. These three genes were aligned using MAFFT (45), with an additional gene chosen randomly in the same msg family since TOPALi requires input of four genes. The efficacy of the three methods to detect mosaic genes was assessed by the analysis of artificial chimeras produced in silico with related genes, as well as with sets of orthologous genes from different fungal species (results not shown).

The vast majority of the events detected at the protein level corresponded to those detected at the DNA level (results not shown).",

The PCR conditions included an initial denaturation step of 3\u00a0min at 94\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles consisting of 30\u00a0s at 94\u00b0C, 30\u00a0s at the annealing temperature, and 1\u00a0min per kilobase to be amplified at 72\u00b0C. The reaction ended with 5\u00a0min of extension at 72\u00b0C. The annealing temperature and the MgCl2 concentration were optimized for each set of primers and ranged from 51 to 60\u00b0C and from 3 to 6\u00a0mM, respectively. Sequencing of both strands of the PCR products was performed with the two primers used for PCR amplification, as well as the BigDye Terminator DNA sequencing kit and ABI PRISM 3100 automated sequencer (both from PerkinElmer Biosystems).",
