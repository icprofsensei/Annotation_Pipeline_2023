This case-control study examined the salivary microbiota in patients with digestive tract cancer (DTC) and evaluated their differential distribution based on the cancer sites. We collected saliva samples from 59 patients with cancer in any part of the digestive tract (tongue/pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and large intestine) and from 118 age- and sex-matched control subjects. There was no significant difference in periodontal status between DTC patients and control subjects (P = 0.72). We examined the bacterial diversity and composition in saliva by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Salivary bacterial diversity in DTC patients was significantly higher than that in control subjects [number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), P = 0.02; Shannon index, P < 0.01; Chao1, P = 0.04]. Eleven differentially abundant OTUs in DTC patients were identified using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method. Based on the cancer sites, the diversity of salivary bacteria was especially higher in tongue/pharyngeal or esophageal cancer patients than in control subjects. Among the 11 differentially abundant OTUs in DTC patients, an OTU corresponding to Porphyromonas gingivalis was more abundant in the saliva of all groups of DTC patients compared to that in control subjects, and an OTU corresponding to Corynebacterium species was more abundant in all groups other than gastric cancer patients (P < 0.01). In addition, the relative abundances of OTUs corresponding to Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus parasanguinis II, and Neisseria species were significantly higher in tongue/pharyngeal cancer patients compared to their abundances in control subjects (P < 0.01). The relative abundance of an OTU corresponding to the Neisseria species was also significantly higher in gastric cancer patients and that of an OTU corresponding to Actinomyces odontolyticus was significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients (P < 0.01). These results suggest that the salivary microbiota might be associated with various digestive tract cancers.",

It has an indispensable role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the human body. Digestive tract cancer (DTC) is a malignant disease and is one of the most common cancers worldwide. In Japan, approximately 300,000 individuals are diagnosed with DTC annually (Hori et al., 2015). Among Japanese females, colorectal and gastric cancers are the first and fourth leading causes of cancer-related deaths, respectively, while among Japanese males they are the third and second leading causes, respectively (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 2018). Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that smoking, alcohol intake, obesity, underweight, and low consumption of vegetables and fruits are lifestyle factors associated with DTC (Kabat et al., 1994; Bosetti et al., 2000; Engel et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2003; Ferrari et al., 2007; Freedman et al., 2007; Paskett et al., 2007; Botteri et al., 2008; Leung et al., 2008; Varela-Lema et al., 2010; Rado\u00ef et al., 2015; Shaukat et al., 2017). In addition, several studies have suggested the involvement of bacteria in several types of cancers, especially in organs continuously exposed to microbes, by the induction of chronic and persistent inflammation or the downregulation of host immunity (Allavena et al., 2008; Dalton-Griffin and Kellam, 2009; Tjalsma et al., 2012; Mima et al., 2015).",

Considering that the oral microbiota is constantly swallowed along with saliva and delivered to the digestive tract, it is reasonable to consider that the oral microbiota is a possible risk factor for DTC, even in cancer sites that are distant from the oral cavity. In fact, Fusobacterium nucleatum, a periodontal disease pathogen, that usually inhabits the oral cavity is frequently detected and is abundant in colorectal carcinoma tissue (Mima et al., 2015; Nosho et al., 2016). Moreover, it is assumed that the causal link between oral microbiota and DTC differs by organs, because each digestive tract organ has a specific environment and an indigenous bacterial community. Evaluation of the characteristics of salivary microbiota in DTC patients according to the cancer sites may help in the elucidation of the microbial etiology of DTC, and aid in prediction or diagnosis of DTC.",

The quality-checked reads were demultiplexed by examining the 8-base tag sequence, and then forward and reverse primer sequences were trimmed. The quality-checked reads derived from 177 subjects of this study were extracted and used for further analysis. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were constructed by clustering quality-checked reads, excluding singleton reads, with a minimum pairwise identity of 97% using UPARSE (Edgar, 2013) as described previously (Takeshita et al., 2016). All quality-checked reads were mapped to each OTU with \u226597% identity using UPARSE (Takeshita et al., 2016). Chimeras were identified using ChimeraSlayer and removed from analysis (Haas et al., 2011). The taxonomy of representative sequences was determined using BLAST against 889 oral bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences (HOMD 16S rRNA RefSeq version 14.51) in the Human Oral Microbiome Database (Chen et al., 2010). Nearest-neighbor species with \u226598.5% identity were selected as candidates for each representative OTU. The taxonomy of sequences without hits was further determined using an RDP classifier with a minimum support threshold of 80% (Wang et al., 2007). The number of OTUs were calculated following rarefaction to 5,000 reads per sample using the vegan package of R and were used as an index of bacterial diversity in this study.

Concerning oral conditions, tongue/pharyngeal cancer patients demonstrated more decayed teeth, while gastric cancer patients demonstrated fewer decayed teeth compared to control subjects. Gingival inflammatory condition based on BOP in tongue/pharyngeal, esophageal, or colorectal cancer patients was more severe than in the control subjects and oral hygiene status based on plaque index was better in gastric or colorectal cancer patients.

The salivary bacterial diversity was higher in DTC patients than that in control subjects. This result was consistent with other observed indices of bacterial diversity, such as Simpson index and phylogenetic diversity (Supplementary Figure S2). Particularly, tongue/pharyngeal and esophageal cancer patients demonstrated high bacterial diversity. In addition, several species-level OTUs characteristic of each DTC were identified using the LEfSe method. It was interesting that some of the OTUs were characteristic among several DTC in common, even though distances from the oral cavity to each DTC varied.",

P. gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen included in these 11 species, plays a key role in the development of periodontitis by invasion of epithelial cells or by interfering with the host immunity (Hajishengallis and Lamont, 2014). In this study, the relative abundance of P. gingivalis was significantly higher in saliva of all groups of DTC patients than that of control subjects, even though there was no difference in PPD between any groups of DTC patients and control subjects, which has been frequently associated with the presence of P. gingivalis. The reason for the association between higher abundance of P. gingivalis in saliva and DTC is unknown. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that P. gingivalis affects DTC incidence through an unknown pathway. In addition, F. nucleatum, a periodontal pathogen, was also identified as a differentially abundant OTU in cancer patients and was more abundant in tongue/pharyngeal or esophageal cancer patients. The association between periodontal pathogens in the saliva and DTC should be explored to elucidate the etiology of DTC.",

Neisseria species are capable of producing a high amount of acetaldehyde in a medium containing ethanol in vitro (Muto et al., 2000; Moritani et al., 2015). In addition, the acetaldehyde level in saliva was reported to be associated with the increased risk for developing upper DTC (Salaspuro, 2003). Therefore, Neisseria species might be associated with DTC due to the production of acetaldehyde in the oral cavity after alcohol consumption. However, our previous study suggested that their phenotypes in vitro do not necessarily reflect their behavior in vivo because of interactions in the bacterial community (Yokoyama et al., 2018). To elucidate the acetaldehyde-mediated carcinogenesis, further comprehensive studies of these Neisseria species in vitro and in vivo are required.",

While gingival inflammation (based on BOP) was significantly severe in tongue/pharyngeal, esophageal, or colorectal cancer patients, there was no statistical difference in PPD. This result suggests that the difference in the salivary microbiota between DTC patients and control subjects does not merely reflect subgingival bacteria shed from deep periodontal pockets with periodontitis. There may be a direct relationship between the salivary microbiota and DTC, and an indirect relationship via gingivitis. The elucidation of these etiologies would provide us with valuable information to understand the association between the oral microbiota and DTC. However, the sample size in this study was not large enough to confirm whether the differentially abundant OTUs are related to DTC independent of the gingival condition. Additionally, the small sample size did not allow us to evaluate the relationship between the oral microbiota and DTC accounting for the detailed cancer sites (e.g., gingiva, buccal mucosa, and tongue in the oral cavity or rectum and colon in the intestine) or cancer types (e.g., adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma). Further investigation with a larger sample size is needed to elucidate the relationship between the oral microbiota and DTC in detail.",

It is particularly interesting that 5 of these 11 OTUs were detected by LEfSe analysis in colorectal cancer patients, even though colorectal cancers are physically most distant from the oral cavity, and its association with the salivary microbiota was likely to be masked by the other cancers. There might be a stronger association between the salivary microbiota and colorectal cancer than exists with the other cancers. More detailed analyses with larger sample sizes will be required to identify the respective associations of the salivary microbiota with each DTC.",
