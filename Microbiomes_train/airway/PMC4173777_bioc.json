In order to better understand this disease and its etiology, we collected case and control samples and performed pathological and diagnostic analyses. Electron micrographs revealed filamentous virus-like particles in lung epithelial cells of sick animals. Diagnostic testing for known pathogens did not identify an etiologic agent, so unbiased metagenomic sequencing was performed. Abundant nidovirus-like sequences were identified in cases and were used to assemble the genome of a previously unknown virus in the order Nidovirales. The nidoviruses, which were not previously known to infect nonavian reptiles, are a diverse order that includes important human and veterinary pathogens. The presence of the viral RNA was confirmed in all diseased animals (n = 8) but was not detected in healthy pythons or other snakes (n = 57). Viral RNA levels were generally highest in the lung and other respiratory tract tissues. The 33.5-kb viral genome is the largest RNA genome yet described and shares canonical characteristics with other nidovirus genomes, although several features distinguish this from related viruses. This virus, which we named ball python nidovirus (BPNV), will likely establish a new genus in Torovirinae subfamily. The identification of a novel nidovirus in reptiles contributes to our understanding of the biology and evolution of related viruses, and its association with lung disease in pythons is a promising step toward elucidating an etiology for this long-standing veterinary disease.",

Since the 1990s, veterinarians have been aware of an infectious respiratory disease of unknown cause in ball pythons that can be fatal. We used unbiased shotgun sequencing to discover a novel virus in the order Nidovirales that was present in cases but not controls. While nidoviruses are known to infect a variety of animals, this is the first report of a nidovirus recovered from any reptile. This report will enable diagnostics that will assist in determining the role of this virus in the causation of disease, which would allow control of the disease in zoos and private collections. Given its evolutionary divergence from known nidoviruses and its unique host, the study of reptile nidoviruses may further our understanding of related diseases and the viruses that cause them in humans and other animals.",

These viruses cause a variety of diseases that range from mild enteric infection to severe respiratory disease or hemorrhagic fever (7, 8). Examples of disease-causing nidoviruses include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a number of other coronaviruses that cause typically mild respiratory disease in humans, and agriculturally important animal pathogens, such as equine arteritis virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and yellow head virus. Nidoviruses are characterized by their overall genome architecture, distinct pattern of gene expression, and presence of a conserved set of functional domains in their nonstructural polyproteins. The nidoviruses cluster into five major groups, which have been taxonomically categorized into four families: Arteriviridae, Roniviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Coronaviridae. Viruses in the Coronaviridae family (subfamilies Torovirinae and Coronavirinae) have the largest known RNA genomes, an attribute thought possible because of a virally encoded proofreading exonuclease (ExoN) that increases replication fidelity (9,\u201312). Although nidoviruses are known to infect mammals, birds, fish, and crustaceans, no nonavian reptile nidovirus has been previously described.",

Sanger sequencing of the entire genome and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) were used to validate the assembly and to confirm that it contained the proper end sequences (Fig.\u00a04B) (23,\u201325).

This overlapping region contains a putative \u201cslippery\u201d sequence (AAAAAAC) that may be the site of frameshifting (Fig.\u00a04A; see also Fig.\u00a0S2 in the supplemental material) (35, 36).

Captive snake breeding operations typically operate at high stocking densities, and breeders commonly attend trade shows, where animals from different sources are juxtaposed. In addition, animals from geographically and ecologically diverse areas are commonly imported and mixed with minimal quarantine. These practices increase pathogen exposure and lower barriers to transmission. The outcome is evident in the case of farmed turtles, which typically have very high Salmonella carriage rates, in contrast to the low prevalence in wild turtle populations (66,\u201368). It is also possible that these practices select for increased virulence, as has been the case for feline calicivirus (FCV), which has independently evolved multiple times from a pathogen that causes a relatively benign upper respiratory disease to one that causes hemorrhagic disease with high mortality (69). This increase in FCV virulence has been documented only in high-density environments, such as shelters. Surveillance of wild ball pythons in Africa will shed light on whether a similar phenomenon has occurred here. Further investigation of the pathogens of reptiles and improved biosecurity practices and disease surveillance of the herpetoculture industry are indicated.",

The precise host range of this virus remains undefined. It is not clear that ball pythons are the primary natural host for this virus, nor whether it can replicate or cause disease in other snakes, other reptiles, or other animals. The routes of transmission for this virus remain unknown. Additionally, the prevalence of this disease is yet to be determined, although it is apparently widespread, since cases were collected from geographically disparate locations in the United States from 2006 to 2013. Additional studies will help to answer these central questions and uncover additional details about the biology of this putative pathogen. The current study is another example where the application of genomic techniques to the study of infectious disease in reptiles and other less well studied organisms has identified new and unexpected relatives of human pathogens (59, 70).",

RNA was extracted from lung of BP1 and tested by using previously described consensus PCR methods for the genus Ferlavirus in the Paramyxoviridae, the Rhabdoviridae, and the genus Orthoreovirus in the Reoviridae (71,\u201373). Additionally, RNA was extracted from portions of lungs of BP6 and -7 and tested for gene sequences for members of the family Rhabdoviridae and Filoviridae. For molecular diagnostic detection of filoviruses (Marburg viruses and Ebola viruses), RNA was sent to the Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two independent panfilovirus RT-PCR assays were utilized as previously described (74, 75) using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, RNA was reverse transcribed for 30\u00a0min at either 45\u00b0C or 50\u00b0C, respectively, and then denatured for 2\u00a0min at 94 to 95\u00b0C. For RNAs amplified according to the protocol described elsewhere (74), reaction mixtures were thermocycled 40 times at 94\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s, followed by successive incubations at 45\u00b0C and 68\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s each. For RNAs amplified according to the previously described protocol (75), reaction mixtures were treated identically except that the annealing and extension temperatures were 53\u00b0C and 72\u00b0C degrees, respectively. Positive- and negative-control reactions were carried out in parallel to validate the performance of the testing.",

Then, 1\u00a0U RNase H (NEB) diluted in 5\u00a0\u00b5l 1\u00d7 RT buffer with 100\u00a0pmol MDS-286 was added to reaction mixtures, which were incubated for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C and then 94\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min.

Low-quality sequences and low-complexity sequences (defined as having a ratio of the length of the Lempel-Ziv-Welch compressed sequence to the uncompressed length of less than 0.46) were removed from further analysis. The first 5 bases of each sequence were trimmed, as was the last base. The CD-HIT sequence clustering tool was then used to collapse reads with >98% global pairwise identity (77). Host-derived sequences were then filtered, first by using the BLASTn alignment tool (version 2.2.25+ [30]) to query a database of snake ribosomal and mitochondrial sequences and then by using the Bowtie2 alignment tool (version 2.0.0-beta7 [26]) to query databases composed of draft assemblies of the Burmese python and boa constrictor genomes (20, 21). Sequences aligning with an expect value of less than 10\u221212 (BLASTn) or with \u2013local mode alignment scores greater than 86 (Bowtie) were filtered. Similarly, sequences that aligned to the Illumina adapter sequences (see Table\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material) or to PhiX-174 control sequence were removed. This filtering removed on average 98% of sequences (see Table\u00a0S2). The remaining sequences were searched against custom databases of viral protein sequences using the BLASTx alignment tool. Sequences aligning to any viral protein sequence with an expect value of less than 0.25 were further examined. False positives were reduced by using BLAST to align putative viral sequences to the NCBI nonredundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases. Only sequences whose best hit and whose pair\u2019s best hit were still to viral sequences were retained. The PRICE de novo targeted genome assembler was used to generate initial contiguous virus sequences (22). The reference assembly (NCBI accession no. KJ541759) was assembled using reads from a single snake (no. 2); other animals lacked sufficient coverage to assemble the complete genome. To validate this assembly and generate coverage and pairwise identity data, reads were aligned to Sanger validated assemblies using the BLASTn algorithm.
