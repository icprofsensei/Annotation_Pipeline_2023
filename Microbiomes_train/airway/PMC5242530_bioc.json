While deciphering this diverse microbial community using such approaches is more accurate than traditional culture-based methods, experimental bias introduced during critical steps such as DNA extraction may compromise the results obtained. Here, we systematically evaluate four commonly used microbial DNA extraction methods (MoBio PowerSoil\u00ae DNA Isolation Kit, QIAamp\u00ae DNA Mini Kit, Zymo Bacterial/Fungal DNA Mini PrepTM, phenol:chloroform-based DNA isolation) based on the following criteria: DNA quality and yield, and microbial community structure based on Illumina amplicon sequencing of the V3\u2013V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 region of fungi. Our results indicate that DNA quality and yield varied significantly with DNA extraction method. Representation of bacterial genera in plaque and saliva samples did not significantly differ across DNA extraction methods and DNA extraction method showed no effect on the recovery of fungal genera from plaque. By contrast, fungal diversity from saliva was affected by DNA extraction method, suggesting that not all protocols are suitable to study the salivary mycobiome.",

Within the oral cavity, several distinct niches occur, including those found in plaque and saliva [2, 3], where dysbiosis and the presence of specific microbes can be associated with disease [4\u20136]. Choice of DNA extraction protocol has the potential to influence our perception of microbiome structure. DNA extraction is achievable via different cell lysis procedures, including chemical, enzymatic, mechanical and heat. Recent studies demonstrate that the cell lysis method used during DNA extraction from oral samples can impact the recovery of specific bacterial phyla [7]. Mechanical lysis increases the number of different bacterial phyla recovered from saliva [7], while the addition of lysozyme to mechanical lysis improves overall bacterial DNA yield from saliva [8]. Similarly, in plaque a mechanical lysis step and the addition of lysozyme maximises recovery at the species level [9]. As all methods have inherent biases, an approach that provides a true representation of the oral microbiome is vital if we are to more fully understand its clinical manifestations.",

Identical host (human) and fungal sequences at 18S rRNA gene primer binding sites render this gene an unsuitable target for many human samples, as sequences obtained may be predominantly human- rather than fungal-derived. Partly for this reason, the intergenic internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has become an attractive alternative to 18S rRNA gene sequencing for fungal community analyses, due to its greater sequence variability which differentiates it from the host DNA and also allows for greater taxonomic resolution [10]. However, the advantages of ITS sequencing have not yet led to a greatly improved understanding of the oral mycobiome. To date, only a handful of studies have attempted to describe this community, with even less emphasis on how DNA extraction may affect its representation [11\u201313].",

Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined based on 97% sequence similarity, and taxonomy was assigned to individual OTUs through the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier using the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) [23]. Aligned FASTA sequences were used to build a phylogenetic tree using the make_phylogeny.py command in QIIME 1.9 for subsequent phylogenetic-based beta diversity measures. Dissimilarity matrices (weighted UniFrac, unweighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis) were generated in QIIME 1.9 and visualised through multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots built in PRIMER v6 [24]. All three beta diversity measurements produced similar results, and we chose to use the unweighted UniFrac metric to compare beta diversity due to its previous success in distinguishing human microbial communities with a small sample size [25].",

The Q method yielded the highest concentration of gDNA per 100 \u03bcL from both plaque and saliva, while P yielded the lowest in both. Based on normalised Qubit concentrations (mean \u00b1 SEM), a significant difference in DNA yield from both plaque and saliva was detected when Q (4.87 \u00b1 0.79 ng/\u03bcL) was compared separately to each of the three remaining DNA extraction methods (Fig 1). An enzymatic approach was previously demonstrated to enhance extraction of gDNA from saliva, when compared with mechanical lysis [8]; this is consistent with the highest gDNA yield obtained using the Q method in our study, but does not hold true for the P approach. Therefore, these quantitative results may factor into method selection when gDNA is required for multiple downstream applications. Coefficients of variation (CV) calculated for each method within sample type indicated that all methods were reproducible for DNA yield from both plaque (M = 40%, Q = 28%, Z = 10%, P = 59%) and saliva (M = 18%, Q = 28%, Z = 15%, P = 19%).",

The plaque mycobiome was almost entirely dominated by Candida species, with > 99% of sequences for all methods assigned to this genus (Fig 3B). The closest match (100% sequence identity) through NCBI BLAST indicated that C. albicans was the dominant species in this genus, across all four methods [29]. Other species also identified within this genus included C. dubliniensis and C. tropicalis, although these were less abundant. Given the current lack of available data on the plaque mycobiome, there are no other ITS1 sequencing-based studies against which we can validate our results. Our understanding of the oral mycobiome is thus hindered by the inherent obstacles faced when studying fungal communities. Several factors contribute to a general lack of human oral mycobiome studies, including: the need for well-curated databases comparable to those used for bacterial 16S rRNA gene-based studies, the varying use of primers targeting different regions of the ITS operon between studies, and the unreliable alignment of these targeted ITS sequences. However, an 18S rRNA gene-based study identified C. albicans as the dominant species in the subgingival plaque of HIV+ patients with low viral loads and high CD4 levels, which may support the current findings [30].",

The relative abundance of Penicillium was 6\u201319%, while 14\u201320% of sequences could not be identified to genus level. Saccharomyces and Malassezia were only found in P replicates at <10% and < 1%, respectively (Fig 3D). Additionally, this method was not only the sole DNA extraction method to yield adequate sequencing reads for fungal diversity analyses, it was the only method from which Malassezia was isolated (present in all saliva replicates). As suggested by Dupuy and colleagues, cell lysis methodology is likely to have a significant effect on identifying Malassezia as a fungal community member in saliva [13]. The unique presence of Malassezia in the P extractions suggests that this approach was the only one of the four studied to reliably detect this genus in saliva. Data obtained using the P method confirmed most genera of the fungal community common to the only two previous studies of the human salivary mycobiome [11, 13]: Candida, Emericella, Lewia, Malassezia and Saccharomyces were found in at least two of the three replicates, while Cryptococcus was identified from a single replicate (Fig 3D). In contrast to the previous studies, Cladosporium/Davidiella, Fusarium/Gibberella, Aureobasidium and Epicoccum were absent in all replicates, although Epicoccum was identified in low numbers from two of the three P plaque replicates.",

The diversity of bacterial communities in plaque and saliva was largely unaffected by DNA extraction method, with no significant differences in the relative abundance of taxon-assigned OTUs across all four DNA extraction methods. Diversity assessment of the pooled plaque mycobiome also failed to identify discrepancies between DNA extraction methods, however as this community was > 99% Candida species, the diversity of our homogenate may have been inadequate for a rigorous comparison of methods.",
