However, most previous studies were based on 16S ribosomal RNA and shotgun metagenome sequencing; the viability and functional activity of the microbiome, as well as its interaction with host immune systems, have not been well studied. To characterize the active lung microbiome and its associations with host immune response and clinical features, we applied metatranscriptome sequencing to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 25 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and from nine control cases without known pulmonary disease. Community structure analyses revealed three distinct microbial compositions, which were significantly correlated with bacterial biomass, human Th17 immune response, and COPD exacerbation frequency. Specifically, samples with transcriptionally active Streptococcus, Rothia, or Pseudomonas had bacterial loads 16 times higher than samples enriched for Escherichia and Ralstonia. These high-bacterial-load samples also tended to undergo a stronger Th17 immune response. Furthermore, an increased proportion of lymphocytes was found in samples with active Pseudomonas. In addition, COPD patients with active Streptococcus or Rothia infections tended to have lower rates of exacerbations than patients with active Pseudomonas and patients with lower bacterial biomass. Our results support the idea of a stratified structure of the active lung microbiome and a significant host-microbe interaction. We speculate that diverse lung microbiomes exist in the population and that their presence and activities could either influence or reflect different aspects of lung health.",

Although lower respiratory tract disease is a leading cause of sickness and mortality, how the lung microbiome interacts with human health remains largely unknown. Here we assessed the association between the lung microbiome and host gene expression, cytokine concentration, and over 20 clinical features. Intriguingly, we found a stratified structure of the active lung microbiome which was significantly associated with bacterial biomass, lymphocyte proportion, human Th17 immune response, and COPD exacerbation frequency. These observations suggest that the microbiome plays a significant role in lung homeostasis. Not only microbial composition but also active functional elements and host immunity characteristics differed among different individuals. Such diversity may partially account for the variation in susceptibility to particular diseases.",

Dickson and colleagues have described an adapted island model for the lung microbiome (2), in which lung microbes are largely derived from the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity (UO) through microaspiration and mucosal dispersion. Simultaneously, microbes in the lung are eliminated by mucociliary clearance, cough, and host immune defenses, while reproduction and growth of the microbes are determined by regional conditions in the lung. Alterations of the lung microbiome have been observed in many respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and cystic fibrosis, but associations with clinical features and interactions with host genes are largely unknown (3,\u20135).",

However, information provided by this method is limited due to its narrow detection spectrum (bacteria), low resolution (genus), and lack of direct insights into the viability and functional activity of the microbiome. An alternative approach is shotgun metagenome sequencing, which has been used to reveal the composition of the lung microbiome with a higher resolution and wider detection spectrum (8, 9); however, recent studies proposed that expression of microbial genes could significantly change without large alterations in overall community structure (10, 11), which emphasize the importance of investigating the functional activity of the microbiome. Metatranscriptome sequencing can provide not only active microbiome profiles at high resolution but also the details of functional elements (10, 12). Moreover, it enables analysis of interactions between the microbiome and the host, as both microbial and human transcripts can be analyzed (13). Such studies on the lung microbiome are very limited thus far, and there is an urgent need to explore the active host-microbe interaction in the lung.",

After stringent quality control was performed, 76.7% (\u00b111.5%) of the reads were mapped to the human genome. Among the reads mapping to archaea, bacteria, fungi, and viruses (ABFV), 92% could be assigned to a specific genus, and 60% could be assigned to a specific species or subspecies. Rarefaction analysis showed that the current sequencing depth (30 million reads per sample) enabled us to study most genera/species with read abundance (proportion of reads among all ABFV reads, which reflects the transcriptional activity of the genera/species) greater than 0.1% but not those with lower read abundance. Thus, our study focused only on microbes with read abundance of at least 1% in at least one sample.",

Several microbes showed marginal read abundance differences between the two groups. At the genus level, Gemella was observed in only 10 COPD samples and at very low read abundance (median = 0.03%; P\u2009<\u20090.05, false-discovery rate [q]\u2009>\u20090.1). At the species level, four low-read-abundance species (Prevotella enoeca, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Enterococcus cecorum) were enriched in COPD samples (P\u2009<\u20090.05, q\u2009>\u20090.1), and the first three species are known to inhabit the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract. Notably, the sample size in the study was relatively small, which provided us very limited power to detect differences; thus, we aimed to identify the features that are most closely associated with the active lung microbiome.",

                    "text": "16S rRNA sequencing data were successfully obtained for twenty samples (V3-V4 region, with at least 10,000 reads); 73 genera were identified, 28 of which were also discovered in the metatranscriptome data (Fig.\u00a02A). Those 28 genera accounted for 83% of the 16S rRNA reads and 89% of the ABFV metatranscriptome reads, suggesting that the high-abundance genera could be faithfully identified by both methods. However, the abundances determined were not always comparable between the two methods (Fig.\u00a02B and \u200bandC);C); for example, Acinetobacter had a higher abundance in the 16S rRNA data, while Ralstonia and Pseudomonas were more highly enriched in the metatranscriptome data. The overall correlation coefficient for the read abundance of each genus estimated on the basis of these two methods was 0.326 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), with the highest correlation coefficient being 0.99 in patient COPD38 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a02D). Discrepancies between the two methods might reflect the different states of the microbes, which could be either active/viable (overrepresented in metatranscriptome data) or resting/suppressed (underrepresented in the metatranscriptome data). However, an alternative explanation could be that samples with low correlation coefficients had lower bacterial biomass and, hence, that their lung microbiomes were more likely to have been contaminated by reagents and/or the bronchoscope. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that correlation coefficients were positively correlated with bacterial biomass quantified by a 16S rRNA assay (P\u2009=\u20090.02, rho\u2009=\u20090.560).",

At the phylum level, samples were clustered into two subgroups, which were dominated by either Proteobacteria or Actinobacteria and Firmicutes (Fig.\u00a0S2A and C). We found that the read abundances of the dominant (core) microbes (the definition and algorithm are described in Text S1) in the two subgroups were negatively correlated (P\u2009<\u20090.01), whereas the read abundances of microbes within each subgroup were positively correlated (P\u2009<\u20090.01). At the genus level, samples could be further classified into three subgroups (Fig.\u00a03). Twenty samples were assigned to subgroup I, which was enriched for Streptococcus and Rothia; 10 samples were assigned to subgroup II, which was enriched for Ralstonia and Escherichia; and only 4 samples were assigned to subgroup III, whose microbiome was dominated by Pseudomonas. Core microbes of subgroup I were negatively correlated with those in subgroup II and subgroup III (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Clustering at the species level was identical to that seen at the genus level (Fig.\u00a0S2B and D).",

First, all samples in subgroup III were COPD patients, suggesting that this might be a COPD-specific group, though this hypothesis needs to be confirmed with a larger sample size. Second, all samples in subgroup II were negative in the bacteria smear test, which differs significantly from the results from the samples in subgroups I and III (P\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a04A). We hypothesized that this difference could be an indication of lower bacterial biomass for subgroup II, an interpretation that was supported by the observation that samples in subgroup II had the lowest ratio of bacterial reads to human reads (P\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a04B). As the proportion of reads could have been biased by the amplification process during library preparation, the actual amount of bacterial DNA was further quantified by a 16S rRNA assay. The median amounts of bacteria DNA in the subgroup I and III samples were 28-fold and 9-fold higher, respectively, than the bacterial DNA amounts in subgroup II samples (77.2\u2009pg/ml and 25.6\u2009pg/ml versus 2.7\u2009pg/ml) (P\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a04C). Of note, Salter and colleagues proposed that contamination from laboratory reagents critically impacted results obtained from low-microbial-biomass samples, and both Escherichia and Ralstonia were on their list of contaminant genera (23). To examine the possibility of contamination, we collected two saline samples (washing through different bronchoscopes before real samples were collected) and prepared the sequencing library following the protocol that had been used with the negative controls. We found that the major compositions were similar, and both Escherichia and Ralstonia were identified in two negative controls (with read abundances of 35% and 0.1%, respectively) (Fig.\u00a0S4). Thus, the possibility of contamination is high for this subgroup, and the high read abundance of Escherichia and Ralstonia may reflect only the background noise introduced from reagents and/or the bronchoscope. In addition, the lymphocyte proportion for the subgroup III samples was significantly higher than that for other subgroups (P\u2009<\u20090.05), while the macrophage proportion was lower in this subgroup (P\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a04D and \u200bandE).E). We further found that the lymphocyte proportion was positively correlated with the relative read abundance of Bordetella (mostly Bordetella pertussis) (rho\u2009=\u20090.501, P\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a04F). No correlation was found between the subgroups and the severity of COPD, smoking, or use of inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, or other factors (Table\u00a01).",

                    "text": "Although COPD is a chronic disease, some patients suffer from exacerbations. Recurrent exacerbation in COPD patients could lead to a faster decline in lung function and could increase their mortality risks. We have obtained the number of exacerbations for 21 COPD patients in the past 4\u2009years (2014 to 2018) (after the bronchoscopy) (Fig.\u00a05). In total, 29 exacerbation events were recorded; 14 of them occurred in 3 patients belonging to subgroup III, 10 of them occurred in 3 patients belonging to subgroup II, and 5 of them occurred in 3 patients belonging to subgroup I. The exacerbation frequency was significantly higher in patients belonging to subgroups II and III than in those belonging to subgroup I (2 and 3.5 versus 0.4, P\u2009=\u20091.3e\u22125). This observation suggests that colonization of the lung by bacteria of some specific genera (e.g., Streptococcus, Rothia) might be protective against exacerbation whereas colonization by other bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas) could be harmful. Interestingly, multiple studies have proposed that Pseudomonas could be a risk factor for exacerbation in COPD patients (24,\u201326). Associations between individual microbes and clinical features are described in Text S1.",

Interestingly, one gene-enriched pathway (\u201cdifferential regulation of cytokine production in macrophages and T helper cells by interleukin-17A [IL-17A] and IL-17F\u201d) seems to be involved in the immune response to lung microbes, as CD4+ T helper (Th) cells can regulate the adaptive immune response against pathogens and their differentiation has been proposed to be associated with the lung microbiome (28,\u201330). To further investigate the differentiation of Th cells, we compared the expression levels of 36\u2009key genes in this pathway among the three subgroups (Fig.\u00a0S5A). Overall, samples in subgroup I tended to have a higher expression level of all of these genes than samples in subgroup II (16 of them with P\u2009<\u20090.05). In particular, the expression levels of the most critical molecules for Th17 cell differentiation (including IL-6, transforming growth factor \u03b2 [TGF\u03b2], STAT3, RORC, and IL-17) were all significantly increased in subgroup I samples, and these expression levels were highly synchronized (Fig.\u00a07). The cytokine assay results further confirmed the increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1\u03b1) in subgroup I samples (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a0S5B) compared to those of subgroup II.

Interestingly, we found that microbes enriched in COPD samples were mostly upper respiratory tract and oral (UO) microbes. They were found exclusively in 15 COPD samples (but were not correlated with severity of COPD), 12 of which had at least two UO microbes codetected (P\u2009<\u20090.05). UO microbes can enter the lung through microaspiration but normally are quickly removed by the mucociliary clearance system in the lung. Such clearance is impaired in COPD patients (20, 31), and therefore enrichment of UO microbes is likely to be a consequence of COPD. This phenomenon is not specific to COPD but is also observed in other diseases, e.g., mechanically ventilated and pneumonia patients (31, 32).",

However, their abundances were higher in the 16S rRNA data (5.1% and 4.3%) and also much higher in the upper respiratory tract (throat swabs were available for seven samples) (see Fig.\u00a0S6 in the supplemental material). We speculate that these two microbial genera in the lung were acquired by microaspiration from the upper respiratory tract and that their growth was likely to be suppressed by the regional conditions in the lung, although more upper respiratory tract samples were needed to address this issue.",

Recently, Shenoy and colleagues also identified two pneumotypes (microbial community states) in HIV and pneumonia patients (30) but with different core microbes. Pneumotypes in both studies were identified on the basis of 16S rRNA data. In our study, three subgroups were identified from metatranscriptome data that may be more functionally relevant as they were inferred from the actively transcribed microbiome.",

These features seem relevant, as bacterial growth requires an abundant nutrient supply and activation of microbial genes that absorb nutrients and synthesize proteins. Actively growing bacteria might activate the host defense system, including recruitment and differentiation of Th17 cells that mediate host defenses against microbes (37). Coincidentally, Vandeputte and colleagues have recently reported a similar association between microbial load and enterotype in gut (38). We speculate that the correlation could reflect the growth rate variation among different microbes under certain regional conditions. Moreover, COPD patients in this subgroup tended to experience less-frequent exacerbations, suggesting that bacterial colonization could be a crucial stimulus to airway inflammation and could thereby be a risk factor and represent a potential predictor of exacerbations in COPD patients.",

This could indicate a more severe inflammation in this subgroup as lymphocytes are normally recruited into the alveolar space during inflammation (41); this may also associated with the fact that COPD patients in this subgroup experienced the most frequent exacerbations. Interestingly, an increased proportion of lymphocytes was found to be associated with the abundance of Veillonella (33). However, this correlation was not observed in our data (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Rather, the proportion of lymphocytes was found to be associated with the activity of Bordetella pertussis (Fig.\u00a04F); infection with Bordetella pertussis is not rare in either the healthy population or COPD patients (42, 43), which could be related to the release of pertussis toxin (PT). PT could inhibit the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages and could impede the movement of lymphocytes into lymph nodes (44). However, there are still samples that have a high proportion of lymphocytes but that have no Bordetella pertussis, suggesting that other mechanisms might be involved.",

Although a host rRNA depletion protocol was applied, 80% of the reads were derived from humans. On the one hand, this enabled us to investigate interactions between the microbiome and the host. On the other hand, less-active microbes could not be detected; however, rarefaction and variance analysis suggested that the data enabled us to identify the most active microbes and capture most of the variance among samples and thus should not have influenced the main conclusion of our study. Another limitation of our study was the relatively small sample size due to the difficulty encountered in collecting lower respiratory tract samples (as the procedure is invasive), which limited the statistical power of the study to detect differences between subgroups; thus, we focused only on the features that most closely associate with lung microbiome (bacterial biomass, Th17 immune response, COPD exacerbation frequency, etc.). Meanwhile, this potentially restricted the study to identification of only a subset of possible microbiome types. Actual lung microbiomes might be more diverse, and their association with clinical features could be more complicated. Nonetheless, data corresponding to the stratified structure of the transcriptionally active lung microbiome and its association with various features are all statistically significant and support the idea of an active host-microbe interaction. Together with previous studies on 16S rRNA and metagenome data, it is tempting to speculate that the lung microbiome variation is stratified in different dimensions in both healthy cases and some disease states. This stratification might represent differences in homeostasis states between the host and the microbiome. Critical follow-up studies should address to what extent the structures exist in different populations, how they are established and persist, and how they interact with the host immunity.",
