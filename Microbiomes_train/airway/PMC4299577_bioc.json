The more densely populated and less diverse bacterial communities of the\nlower airways in IPF may provide persistent stimuli for repetitive alveolar injury. The\ntemporal and spatial heterogeneity observed in usual interstitial pneumonia (the\nhistological lesion of IPF) speaks to the likely importance of repetitive injury as a\nmajor factor in the pathogenesis of the disease (35). The bacterial communities of the lower airways are a plausible candidate\nfor this trigger, and regional differences in the bacterial microbiome (36) may help explain the distribution of the\nfibrotic lesions in IPF.",

Trials of antibiotic therapy may help elucidate this.\nThere has recently been a large placebo-controlled multicenter study evaluating the use\nof Septrin in the broader category of fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. This\ntreatment was not well tolerated, and there was ultimately no detectable difference in\nthe primary endpoint. Despite this, in subjects who tolerated Septrin therapy there was\na reduction in infections and subsequent mortality. The authors hypothesize that this\nobservation may be a result of Septrin\u2019s antimicrobial effects, but it is\ndifficult to draw conclusions because of its concurrent antiinflammatory actions.\nHowever, combined with our data here and the high mortality associated with bacterial\nrespiratory tract infections in IPF, this observation does suggests a more targeted and\nwell-tolerated antibiotic should be trialed in an IPF cohort.",

Direct sequencing of lung tissue may\nprovide further information on the pulmonary microbiome (40), but lung biopsies are undertaken infrequently in IPF, and\ngathering true healthy control samples would be extremely difficult. We used the\noropharyngeal route to pass a bronchoscope into the lungs, and some secretions from the\nupper airways will have been carried on the tip of the bronchoscope. Any carryover,\nhowever, will have been heavily diluted by the 240 ml of BAL fluid. The high percentage\nof BAL return and an absence of ciliated epithelial cells in BAL fluid (indicative of\nlarge airway contamination) provided confidence that our BAL return was primarily\nderived from the distal airspace. We note that strong similarities have been seen\nbetween microbiota identified from BAL fluid and from surgically removed lung tissue in\nwhich upper airway contamination was not an issue (36). Most importantly, we used the same protocols and procedures for cases\nand control subjects, so any contamination will not have systematically influenced our\nresults. Although there is currently no universally adopted approach to minimize\npotential upper airways carryover, the use of protected BAL fluid, pro-BAL catheters, or\nprotected catheter brushes could help avoid contamination.",
