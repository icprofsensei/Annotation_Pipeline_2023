When salivary planktonic bacteria form an oral biofilm, a variety of polysaccharides and glycoproteins are the primary carbon sources; however, simple sugar availabilities are limited due to low diffusion from saliva to biofilm. We hypothesized that bacterial glycoside hydrolase (GH) activities would be higher in a biofilm than in saliva in order to maintain metabolism in a low-sugar, high-glycoprotein environment. Salivary bacteria from 13 healthy individuals were used to grow in vitro biofilm using two separate media, one with sucrose and the other limiting carbon sources to a complex carbohydrate. All six GHs measured were higher in vitro when grown in the medium with complex carbohydrate as the sole carbon source. We then collected saliva and overnight dental plaque samples from the same individuals and measured ex vivo activities for the same six enzymes to determine how oral microbial utilization of glycoconjugates shifts between the planktonic phase in saliva and the biofilm phase in overnight dental plaque. Overall higher GH activities were observed in plaque samples, in agreement with in vitro observation. A similar pattern was observed in GH activity profiles between in vitro and ex vivo data. 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that plaque samples had a higher abundance of microorganisms with larger number of GH gene sequences. These results suggest differences in sugar catabolism between the oral bacteria located in the biofilm and those in saliva.",

For instance, both salivary flow and the level of exogenous dietary carbon sources increase during ingestion of food, whereas both are at a minimum during sleep. Therefore, the oral microbiota may be influenced by alterations in the host environment, especially by changes in nutrient supply, local pH, and redox potential (1). One notable example is that the microbial community becomes more acidogenic in the presence of sugar (2). Endogenous salivary glycoconjugates become the most significant carbon source for oral microorganisms when an exogenous dietary carbon source is scarce. Under those circumstances, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) play an important role in the adaptation of microorganisms (3,\u20136). These CAZymes include glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases (GHs). The type and availability of carbon sources also influence the development of biofilm at stages throughout the biofilm formation as microorganisms utilize the available carbon sources as nutrients, as building blocks for extracellular polysaccharide production, and as the point of attachment (7). We speculated that the breakdown of complex, endogenous carbohydrates by GH enzymes is one mechanism whereby oral microbes adapt to different carbon sources between the salivary planktonic phase, where exogenous simple sugars are generally more available, and the oral biofilm phase, where, in the absence of exogenous simple sugars, several alternative, more complex endogenous salivary glycoconjugates are the principal carbon source (8,\u201311).",

Subjects refrained from eating, drinking, and oral hygiene for at least 2 h prior to the collection. Samples were collected on ice and immediately treated with phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF; final concentration, 1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) to a final optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.600. The pellet suspension was divided and inoculated for biofilm growth into two different media in parallel. Hydroxyapatite disks (Clarkson Chromatography Products, South Williamsport, PA) were coated for 1 h at room temperature in 24-well plates (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with pooled supernatant to form salivary pellicles. Pellet suspensions from each individual were then inoculated separately onto disks and grown for 72 h at 37\u00b0C in either peptone-yeast base medium containing 5% sucrose (sucrose medium) or 1.25% hog gastric mucin in phosphate-buffered saline (mucin medium) (12). The sucrose medium has been shown to be capable of growing a more diversified community with a microbial profile closer to that of the salivary microbiota when inoculated with pooled human saliva. On the other hand, mucin medium would represent the environment where the carbon source is limited to complex glycoconjugates. The media were refreshed every 24 h. The spent medium was centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, after which the supernatant obtained was filter sterilized for assay of GH activity. After 72 h growth, the biofilm was collected and weighed. It was then centrifuged to remove residual medium and resuspended in 50 mM N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES) buffer, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 5.0 mg pellet ml\u22121.",

Each well contained one of the following 4MU-linked glycosides as the substrate: 4MU-\u03b1-d-NAc-neuraminic acid, 4MU-\u03b1-l-fucoside, 4MU-\u03b2-d-glucoside, 4MU-\u03b2-d-galactoside, 4MU-NAc-\u03b2-d-glucosaminide, or 4MU-NAc-\u03b2-d-galactosaminide (Sigma-Aldrich). These substrates were selected based on GH previously detected in oral specimens (13). Plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before the reaction was quenched with 130 \u03bcl of 500 mM Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer (pH 10.3). Fluorescence was measured using a Victor X3 multilabel reader (excitation/emission wavelengths = 355/460 nm) (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Two negative controls were used, namely, 20 \u03bcl citric acid Na2HPO4 buffer (4MU substrate blank) and 50 \u03bcl TES buffer (reactant blank). The positive control contained 20 \u03bcl of authentic \u03b2-glucosidase solution from almonds (Sigma-Aldrich). Known concentrations of 4MU solutions were used to plot a standard curve. The detection limit was 10 nM (signal-to-noise ratio > 3), and the range of linearity was 62.5 nM to 4 \u03bcM. All assays were run in triplicate, and data were expressed in terms of unit activity per mg of protein after adjustment of the dilution factors (1 unit was defined as the release of 1 \u03bcmol 4MU per min).",

The activities of four out of six enzymes peaked at 48 h, in agreement with a previous study where GH of S. gordonii culture were downregulated during exponential growth phase compared to the stationary phase (4). This would suggest that at least some species of oral bacteria are able to shift from a preferred metabolite (glucose) to a more complex carbohydrate (mucin) when conditions require it.",

These organisms, along with P. intermedia and T. denticola, have genes for \u03b2-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase (GH20) and \u03b1-fucosidase (GH29). On the other hand, the most abundant GHs in S. salivarius, which accounted for the majority of salivary species, are \u03b1-amylase, lysozyme, and sucrase (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Our results cannot determine what percentage of the cell-bound GH activities in saliva was derived from bacteria; however, the enzymes in host cells are expressed at low levels and are associated primarily with intracellular metabolism, and hence they are not excreted to a significant extent.",

Although the secreted form of sialidase has been reported, this is the first report on secreted fucosidase to the best of our knowledge. The presence of secreted forms of GH, especially fucosidase and sialidase, can be explained by the modification of terminal glycoside moiety to provide a better scaffold for bacterial adhesion (21, 22). The complete lack of secreted glucosidase and galactosidase activities in saliva suggests that alternative hexose sugar production in response to external glycosides is not significantly induced. Our in vitro experiment showed the onset of glucosidase activity in mucin medium occurred at a later time point than that of the other 5 GH activities. The presence of secreted hexosidases in biofilm is initially counterintuitive, because the sugars produced extracellularly are considered the preferred carbon source for microorganisms and are available for other species in the biofilm. However, since the trigger for production of GH is the energy requirements of the bacteria producing the enzyme, a more global benefit to the biofilm may be an example of kin discrimination (23). Because there is limited diffusion in biofilm, the beneficiaries of such a secreted enzyme could be limited to those in close proximity to the producer, which are more likely to be genetically related to each other (24). It is noteworthy that the secreted form of glucosidase was detected in biofilm grown in nutrient-rich sucrose medium at an earlier time point than that grown in mucin medium in our in vitro experiment. Future studies focusing on how secreted GHs are induced and distributed in biofilm may provide a clue to how oral ecology maintains homeostasis despite constant perturbations in healthy individuals.",
