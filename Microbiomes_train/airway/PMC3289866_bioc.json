Recurrent bacterial infections play a key role in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis, but conventional microbiologic methods may fail to identify pathogens in many cases. We characterized and compared the pulmonary bacterial communities of cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis patients using a culture-independent molecular approach. Methods. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene libraries were constructed from lung tissue of 10 non-CF bronchiectasis and 21 CF patients, followed by DNA sequencing of isolates from each library. Community characteristics were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Results. A wide range of bacterial diversity was detected in both groups, with between 1 and 21 bacterial taxa found in each patient. Pseudomonas was the most common genus in both groups, comprising 49% of sequences detected and dominating numerically in 13 patients. Although Pseudomonas appeared to be dominant more often in CF patients than in non-CF patients, analysis of entire bacterial communities did not identify significant differences between these two groups. Conclusions. Our data indicate significant diversity in the pulmonary bacterial community of both CF and non-CF bronchiectasis patients and suggest that this community is similar in surgically resected lungs of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis patients.",

Such studies have typically found the most common pathogens to be nontypable Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by a handful of others including Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and coliforms. Nontuberculous mycobacteria have also been reported with variable frequency. Such studies suggest that, despite seemingly similar pathophysiologic mechanisms, there may be differences in the bacterial species infecting CF and non-CF bronchiectasis patients. For example, while H. influenzae is the most common pathogen in adult non-CF bronchiectasis (approximately 40% of cases), it is far less prevalent in adult CF patients [1, 12]. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa is far more commonly isolated among adult CF patients than from bronchiectasis patients (approximately 80% versus 18%, resp.) [1, 12]. Further, the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of organisms associated with significantly impaired outcome in CF patients, infects bronchiectasis patients quite infrequently in comparison to CF patients [13]. These observations suggest that despite similar changes in the disease morphology within the airways, other factors and mechanisms may be at play in determining what organisms are able to infect each group of patients.",

Such studies, therefore, may underestimate the extent of diversity and variation within the pulmonary bacterial flora associated with bronchiectasis. Application of the methods and strategies of an emerging field of study known as metagenomics may help address these issues. Metagenomics is the study of communities of organisms using genetic material taken directly from their natural environment [14]. Metagenomics' power comes from its ability to assess community structure and dynamics without needing first to isolate and propagate organisms in the laboratory. Free of the constraints and limitations imposed by culture-based methods, it provides a semiquantitative assessment of community diversity. Communities can be studied without any prior knowledge of their composition and without the need for specific selective conditions, by isolating and characterizing DNA directly from the metagenome\u2014that is, the combined genomes of all species present in the specimen of interest\u2014bypassing the need for laboratory isolation and cultivation. The potential power of metagenomics to investigate questions related to health and disease has been increasingly recognized in recent years, as evidenced, for example, by the recent launches of the International Human Microbiome Consortium (http://www.human-microbiome.org/), the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), and other similar initiatives around the world [15, 16].",

All whole bacterial community comparisons included all sequences regardless of the level to which their taxonomy was assigned; however, for the identification and analysis of numerically dominant taxa, we chose only those OTUs classified to the genus level since this has the most functional information. OTU taxonomy classifications were used to construct the OTU table used in rarefaction analysis, heatmap construction, and distance calculations. Rarefaction analysis was performed in Qiime [29], using 100 replicate samplings of the sequences for subsequent estimation of alpha diversity.

Rarefaction analysis works by repeated sampling of the data; with each of these samples, the OTU diversity is calculated and plotted to determine whether the observed diversity increases with more sampling. If the sampling saturates the diversity present, then the curve will plateau, whereas if there is additional diversity yet to be discovered, the curve will continue to rise. Considering the relatively low number of sequences we sampled for each patient, most of the rarefaction curves indicate sufficient sampling of the diversity present (Figure 1). Although there are a few patient curves that are undersampled (i.e., that continue to increase), these are not restricted to bronchiectasis or CF patients alone, indicating that any potential differences in bronchiectasis versus CF community structure are unlikely to be due to insufficient sampling.",

Management of bacterial infections historically has been based primarily on culture-based isolation of a limited number of species considered pathogenic, but there is growing appreciation of the polymicrobial nature of pulmonary infections particularly in the setting of chronic illnesses such as CF, and increasing evidence indicates that interactions between species may alter virulence properties or antibiotic susceptibility of individual species [33]. Better understanding of such interactions and their potential clinical impacts requires, as a first step, more complete characterization of the composition of the microbial community of the lungs. We describe here the application of culture-independent metagenomic-based strategies to the study of the bacterial communities of the lung. While a number of studies have applied similar strategies to the study of respiratory microbiota in CF patients [17\u201327], this study is, to our knowledge, the first reporting culture-independent sequence-based profiling of bacterial species directly from lung tissue of patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. Our data demonstrate significant diversity in the pulmonary bacterial communities of both CF and bronchiectasis patients but did not detect significant differences in overall community composition between these two groups of patients.",

Pseudomonas was numerically predominant in 2 of 10 patients with bronchiectasis, which appears to be in keeping with previously reported rates of isolation of P. aeruginosa from bronchiectasis patients in the neighborhood of 18% [4]. Interestingly, however, while Pseudomonas was numerically predominant in 2 bronchiectasis patients, it was identified as a minor constituent of the bacterial community in the remaining 8 bronchiectasis patients. On the other hand, whereas H. influenzae is typically cultured from approximately 40% of bronchiectasis patients, it was detected in only 1 of 10 bronchiectasis patients in this study. The reasons for these discrepancies between our culture-independent data and previous culture-based studies may be several-fold. Given that the present study examined tissue samples from resected lung specimens including many from patients undergoing lung transplantation, the bacterial community profiles generated here most likely represent those present in end-stage lung disease, and, together with the relatively small number of specimens profiled here, therefore may not be completely representative of the microflora in earlier stages of disease process. Further, this study examined lung tissue samples, whereas previous studies of bacterial species in bronchiectasis were based largely on cultures of sputum samples. Because H. influenzae frequently colonizes the upper respiratory tract, it may be the case that previous sputum-based studies have overestimated the prevalence of H. influenzae in the lung itself. Finally, the high frequency of Pseudomonas detection in our bronchiectasis data set compared to culture-based studies could possibly be due to inhibition of growth of Pseudomonas in culture by interspecies interactions with other, more prevalent species present within sputum samples. Such inhibition could possibly account for at least part of the large proportion of sputum samples from bronchiectasis patients in which no pathogens are detected by conventional culture methods [2]. Similar factors could also account for our detection of Burkholderia in 4 of 10 bronchiectasis patients, whereas a previous culture-based study failed to isolate any Burkholderia from sputum samples of patients with bronchiectasis [13].",

Longitudinal studies profiling respiratory samples from bronchiectasis patients in comparison with CF patients over time are needed to shed light on this question.",
