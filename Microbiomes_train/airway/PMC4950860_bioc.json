Multiple recent studies have demonstrated associations between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and IBD, but the microbiota of the oral mucosa in CD is less well characterized. Oral manifestations are observed in 5-80% of pediatric CD patients.1-3 Pediatric patients with oral CD frequently develop manifestations prior to onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, allowing earlier diagnosis.2 All areas of the oral cavity can be involved in CD, with the most commonly affected being the buccal, gingival, and labial mucosa. Manifestations include prototypical gingival lesions, aphthous lesions, edema of the mucosa, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Gingival CD, a common oral finding, is described as cobblestone-like gingival alterations and significant thickening of the tissue. These are similar to the intestinal findings of active CD, often associated with isolated edema of the mucosa and aphthous lesions. As with intestinal CD, oral lesions frequently respond to therapy with antibiotics such as metronidazole.3 Thus, we sought to determine if alterations of the subgingival microbiota are associated with Crohn's disease and antibiotic therapy.",

The antibiotics used were Ciprofloxicin, Flagyl, and Vancomycin, which have broad specificities that include the above lineages. The taxonomic alterations associated with antibiotic use here resemble some of those previously described in the oral microbiota following therapy for periodontitis.7, 8 The antibiotics-associated differences in genus abundance were also observed in the discovery cohort.

To evaluate the performance of the classifier at all threshold values, we constructed a receiver operating characteristic curve (Figure 5B). The area under the curve was 0.8, meaning that 80% of the time a randomly selected CD sample will have a higher probability for CD assignment than a randomly selected healthy sample.",

Figure 5C lists the 20 most important OTUs as determined by a mean decrease in accuracy for the classifier (out-of-bag estimate). Two Capncytophaga OTUs were ranked highest in importance for the classifier, the first of which was found to be increased more than tenfold in the CD group. Other OTUs had a modest difference between groups but were used collectively by the classifier to improve accuracy. Thus, the random forest signature provides a molecular marker for discriminating CD and healthy controls.",

The diversity of TM7 organisms in colonic biopsies, many showing >99% 16S similarity to oral clones, was increased in a previous study of adult subjects with Crohn's disease.36 In the same study, the diversity of TM7 bacteria was not increased in subjects with ulcerative colitis, indicating an involvement with CD specifically.36 In the oral cavity, a number of studies have found associations between TM7 bacteria and periodontitis.31, 37, 38 Because the organisms have never been grown in culture, mechanisms for involvement in inflammatory disease remain unclear. However, assembly of a TM7 genome from metagenomic data revealed some potential virulence factors in one study.38",

The measurement was repeated at two time points in each of two independent study cohorts. Previous studies have documented similar microbial changes following antibiotic therapy in periodontitis.7 Species from all four genera, Alloprevotella, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella, were previously reported to be less prevalent in subjects responding to antibiotic therapy for periodontitis.7 Here we report parallel changes in the patients with IBD exposed to antibiotics. The same study reported increased prevalence of the CD-associated genera identified here, Capnocytophaga and Rothia. Although these groups were not increased in association with antibiotic use in our data, the published data suggest the possibility that antibiotic exposure promoted colonization by these CD-associated organisms.",

These findings and those of others39-42 provide a tractable model for studies of microbiota interactions at the subgingival mucosal surface, where sampling is simpler than for intestinal sites. This accessibility was leveraged here to allow acquisition of separate discovery and validation cohorts, providing much more secure conclusions than is possible in studies of single cohorts in isolation. The lineages consistently enriched in abundance provide specific candidates for new rounds of studies of mechanisms of disease and antibiotic therapies. The random forest analysis provides a diagnostic signature, allowing potential discrimination of CD and healthy controls based on convenient oral sampling. In future work, it will be of interest to determine whether such signatures can be sharpened and used to partition patients into groups that are relatively more responsive to specific IBD therapies.",
