Although these approaches are superior to traditional culture-based methods, they introduce bias at the experimental and bioinformatics levels. We assessed the diversity of the human salivary microbiome by pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA V1\u20133 amplicons using metagenomic DNA extracted by two different protocols: a simple proteinase K digestion without a subsequent DNA clean-up step, and a bead-beating mechanical lysis protocol followed by column DNA purification. A high degree of congruence was found between the two extraction methods, most notably in regard to the microbial community composition. The results showed that for a given bioinformatics pipeline, all the taxa with an average proportion >0.12% in samples processed using one extraction method were also detected in samples extracted using the other method. The same taxa tended to be abundant and frequent for both extraction methods. The relative abundance of sequence reads assigned to the phyla Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, TM7, Synergistetes, and Tenericutes was significantly higher in the mechanically-treated samples than in the enzymatically-treated samples, whereas the phylum Firmicutes showed the opposite pattern. No significant differences in diversity indices were found between the extraction methods, although the mechanical lysis method revealed higher operational taxonomic unit richness. Differences between the extraction procedures outweighed the variations due to the bioinformatics analysis pipelines used.",

Studies of salivary bacterial communities initially used culture-based techniques [5], [6]. However, the presence of numerous unculturable bacteria in the mouth, currently estimated to represent about one third of the 600 inventoried species in the curated Human Oral Microbiome Database [7], has necessitated the development of culture-independent approaches. These techniques include DNA-DNA hybridization [8] and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 16S rDNA amplicon libraries [1], [9]\u2013[12] or metagenome fragments [13]. The HTS-based methods, now widely used to study bacterial communities, allow the analysis of a small or large number of samples with the desired depth of coverage. Although significantly better than culture-based approaches, the culture-independent methods may introduce bias related to the DNA extraction procedure and the downstream molecular and informatics analyses.",

The composite PCR primers were designed as described previously [11] except that they contained Titanium adaptor sequences (plain lowercase). For each of the six DNA extractions (three enzymatic and three mechanical), two separate PCRs were carried out using reverse primers with a different barcode. All PCRs were performed in duplicate using the following parameters: 30 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 56\u00b0C for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. The V1\u20133 amplicons corresponded to bases 28\u2013514 (excluding primer sequences) in the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene. Amplicon sizes were checked on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Two replicate PCRs were then pooled and purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). DNA quantity was assessed using a NanoDrop ND-8000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). Three hundred nanograms of each of the purified samples were then pooled and sequenced from the reverse primer on a Genome Sequencer FLX system with Titanium chemistry (Roche) at LGC Genomics (Berlin, Germany).",

Sequence reads were processed using the Mothur (v 1.28) software package [18]. The reads were removed (Mothur\u2019s command trim.seqs) if they met any of the following criteria: (i) contained ambiguous bases; (ii) contained more than one mismatch in the reverse primer (excluding the barcode sequence for which no mismatches were allowed); (iii) contained homopolymer runs longer than 9 bases; (iv) had a minimum quality score of <35 over a 50-base window; (v) had a sequence length <350 or >600 bases after primer sequence trimming. Sequences were aligned (command align.seq) against the Greengenes [19] reference core alignment set (available in Mothur as core_set_aligned.imputed.fasta) and truncated to include bases corresponding to E. coli 16S rRNA gene positions 101\u2013514. Sequences that did not cover this region were removed. The commands pre.cluster (with option -diff\u200a=\u200a4) and chimera.uchime (default parameters) were used for denoising [20] and removal of potentially chimeric sequences [21], respectively. Samples were normalized to an equal sampling depth corresponding to the size of the smallest sample (command sub.sample). Taxonomic assignment of individual sequences was based on the Na\u00efve Bayesian method [22] and the reference Greengenes taxonomy database (Mothur\u2019s files gg_99.pds.ng.fasta and gg_99.pds.tax), with a confidence score threshold of 80% (command classify.seqs). Sequences were assigned to representative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the furthest neighbor method and a 3% dissimilarity cut-off (command dist.seqs and cluster). The consensus taxonomy for the majority of sequences within an OTU was determined using the command classify.otu. A multiple alignment of representative OTUs was imported into FastTree [23] to construct a tree that was then used as the input file for the Fast UniFrac web interface [24].",

The most frequent taxa tended to be the most abundant, and the same taxa tended to be abundant and frequent for both extraction methods. These trends, at the OTU level, are exemplified for Pipelines 1 and 6 in Figure 2.

We used this non-phylogenetic approach to analyze smaller size libraries simulated by sampling a given number of OTUs from each sample.
