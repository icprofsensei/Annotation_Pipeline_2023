Poorer cognitive performance and tooth loss have been linked epidemiologically in both retrospective and prospective studies [2-7], and tooth loss has been associated with an increased risk of both dementia and cognitive decline [8]. Indeed, increasing tooth loss over time is associated with increased likelihood of low cognitive scores [2]. Beyond epidemiological associations, independent lines of experimental evidence support the hypothesis that bacteria associated with diseases of the oral cavity contribute to neurodegeneration. Oral bacteria and bacteria closely related to those found in the oral cavity have been found at a higher frequency post mortem in the brains of patients with AD than in those of patients who did not have AD [9,10]. In addition, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III) provided evidence that gingival bleeding and loss of periodontal attachment were associated with lower cognitive function [11]. Furthermore, subjects with high levels of antibody against the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis had significantly greater impaired verbal memory and subtraction test performance, and this finding remained robust when adjusting for potential sociodemographic and vascular confounders [12]. Levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and serum tumor necrosis factor levels have been found to discriminate between normal subjects and AD patients [7], and recently Sparks Stein et al. [13] found that elevated antibody levels to periodontal disease bacteria were observed in subjects years before cognitive impairment, suggesting that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of AD onset or progression.",

Despite the evidence linking oral health and cognitive function, there is a paucity of empirical data that assess the oral microbiome in patients with cognitive degeneration [16]. Microbiome analysis could be used to determine whether the bacterial compositions of the oral microbiome or \u2018bacterial signatures\u2019 could serve as a predictive biomarker for increased risk of cognitive impairment. It is also possible that preventive treatment could target the makeup of the oral microbiome and the efficacy of such treatment could be monitored with this approach.",

The present study was undertaken to develop a sampling and analysis pipeline using next generation DNA sequencing technology that could be used to characterize microbial populations in subgingival plaque samples. Using an Illumina HiSeq1000 DNA sequencer and a sample preparation and analysis pipeline that enabled multiple samples to be sequenced within the same sequencing lane, we were able to generate and analyze economically more than one million bacterial DNA sequences from each of 15 subgingival plaque samples. The participants were enrolled in a study that assessed oral health and cognitive function among adults at least 70\u2009years old from West Virginia, some of whom were from medically underserved communities [20]. These sequences were analyzed using bioinformatics tools available in the publicly accessable software package Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) [21], and sequence comparisons were made among participants who were clinically assessed as normal or exhibited alterations in cognitive function. The results provide a road map for future efforts to use high throughput DNA sequencing to characterize the oral microbiome in the context of systemic disease, and provide preliminary evidence that differences exist in the bacterial composition of subgingival plaque in patients with alterations in cognitive function. In contrast to other approaches to microbiome analysis, high throughput sequencing holds out the promise of also being useful for metagenomic analysis of the oral microbiome to identify potential virulence factors that contribute to systemic disease.",

The criteria for study participants were age 70\u2009years or older, resident of West Virginia, community-living, and at least four natural teeth. Oral evaluations were performed by calibrated researchers using guidelines from the NHANES 1999 to 2000 [22]. A psychometrician administered to the participants a battery of neuropsychological measures that assessed verbal and visual memory, language, executive function, orientation, praxis, and reading ability. Depression was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale [23]. A proxy informant, usually a spouse or adult child, provided information about the participant\u2019s cognitive function, functional limitations, medical history, and medications. All collected data were reviewed by two study psychologists and diagnoses were assigned within three cognitive categories: normal cognitive function, cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND), and dementia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria were used for the diagnosis of dementia [24]. CIND was defined as mild cognitive or functional impairment reported by the participant or informant that did not meet the criteria for dementia, or performance on neuropsychological measures that was both below expectations based on reading ability and educational and occupational history, and at least 1.5 standard deviations below published norms on any test within a cognitive domain (for example, memory, orientation, language, executive function, praxis). Diagnoses were anchored by these criteria, but the final diagnoses were based on clinical judgment. Similar assessment and diagnostic procedures have been used and validated in multiple large epidemiological studies on cognitive impairment in later life [25,26].",

The amplicon ranges from 296 to 327 base pairs, of which 160 base pairs is the primer. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified PCR primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA). Purified DNA was amplified using an AccuPrime PCR Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) on an MJ Research PTC-200 Thermal Cycler using the following conditions: 95\u00b0C for 6\u2009minutes denature; 95\u00b0C for 2\u2009minutes, 50\u00b0C for 2\u2009minutes, 72\u00b0C for 2\u2009minutes 30\u2009cycles; 72\u00b0C for 4\u2009minutes extend.

PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and reaction products were pooled prior to purification. Because there was a low concentration of DNA in some of the samples, it was necessary to perform 30\u2009cycles of amplification to obtain sufficient material to view on a gel.

In an effort to reduce artifacts generated by sequencing errors, a strict quality filtering protocol was employed that reduced the number of analyzed sequences to approximately 35% of the total number of sequences generated. Nevertheless, an average of more than two million high quality reads was obtained from each sample. Quality filtering of DNA sequences was performed using the following steps: 1) Sequences were first filtered by the Illumina software to eliminate the poorest reads (Q score\u2009\u2265\u200930) and imperfect primer matches. 2) The forward and reverse sequences were matched to construct a sequence that spanned the entire region between the primers with a program written in-house. The original Illumina sequences were all 125 bases in length, which is where the run ended. The pairing strategy overlaid the two 3\u2019 ends starting with an overlap of 58 bases. The overlap window was extended one base at a time to 89 bases until a perfect match was obtained in the overlap region. Any pair of sequences that did not match at 100% identity in any of the size windows was discarded. This step eliminated 56% of the sequences, which overwhelmingly had the lowest quality scores. In general, the sequence quality was better in the middle than at the end, so this preferentially eliminated sequences with sequencing artifacts. 3) Paired sequences with a Phred quality score of less than five were discarded. This removed a few remaining low quality sequences, especially any that had low quality in the regions between the primers and the overlap. 4) The sequences were clustered by matching against the Greengenes database, which is a curated collection of known bacterial 16S sequences. Sequences that did not match any of the known bacterial sequences with 97% identity were discarded. This removed chimeras and most major PCR artifacts and represented approximately 5% of the total remaining sequences. Matching at 97% identity meant that any single base PCR artifacts would be combined with the corresponding authentic sequence (since the region is about 100 bases long, up to three single base changes will be ignored). 5) The resulting table of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was filtered to remove any sequences that appeared less than 150 times.",

Approximately 44 million reads could be aligned to produce a continuous sequence with at least a 58 base overlap with 100% identity and of these, more than 34 million DNA sequences passed all quality filtering steps. These sequences were clustered into OTUs matching the Greengenes database at 97% homology. An OTU clustered at 97% homology was considered a unique phylotype that approximates a \u2018species\u2019, but the 97% identity rule typically applies across the entire 16S rDNA sequence. If the V3 region is more or less variable this rule may not apply accurately to a shorter read length. An average of about 2.4 million sequences was analyzed per DNA sample. Approximately 34% of the initial output of DNA sequences could thus be assigned as high quality OTUs for analysis using this sequencing and quality filtering pipeline. OTUs containing fewer than 150 sequences were discarded, resulting in identification of a total of 492 OTUs in this study [See Additional file 1].",

Alpha diversity was measured as the number of phylotypes observed versus number of sequences analyzed. Once each sequence was assigned to an OTU, QIIME was used to assess the alpha diversity of each subject and generate diversification plots (Figure\u20091). The number of OTUs identified in subgingival plaque samples ranged from 182 (CIND2) to 385 (Dementia 4). Population diversity essentially plateaued after approximately 350,000 reads were analyzed, and this result was consistent across participants, irrespective of the final diversity. Using the QIIME script otu_category_significance.py to run ANOVA, the amount of diversity among participants was not linked to the method of DNA isolation, mental status, age, race, or parameters of oral health listed in Table\u20091 (data not shown). Although the population diversity varied among participants, multiple samples from individual participants yielded similar curves when analyzed separately. This characteristic is illustrated by the small error bars in Figure\u20091, where results from separate samples taken from different probing depths from some individuals were combined and averaged.",

Because of the relatively short region sequenced, assignments at the species level were not robust. Results are shown for analysis of samples at the phylum and family levels for each participant and for multiple probing depth sites where available. In general, most of the identified bacteria were distributed among the phyla Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, TM7, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria with less than 1% contribution of bacteria from any other phyla (Figure\u20092). There appeared to be a higher proportion of Fusobacteria-specific sequences in the samples from participants who did not have dementia compared to those who did. Additionally, at the phylum level the proportion of sequences identified as members of the Bacteroidetes phylum seemed to be slightly elevated in the samples from subjects with dementia. These potential relationships were explored in more detail at lower taxonomic levels. Sixty-eight different families were identified during taxonomic assignment (Figure\u20092) and the large inter-person variation in bacterial populations became evident. Nevertheless, the most striking observation was that in a comparison of samples in the non-dementia versus the dementia groups, the non-dementia samples had a higher proportion of sequences identified as from the family Fusobacteriaceae (primarily genera Fusobacterium and Leptotrichia) and a lower proportion of sequences from Prevotellaceae (almost entirely Prevotella).",

In contrast, only 17 phylotypes of Fusobacteriaceae were found, even though about twice as many sequences were assigned to this group. There were only five phylotypes of Fusobacterium, although this was the most common genus in the entire data set.",

                    "text": "Subroutines in QIIME were used to compute the UniFrac weighted beta diversity distance matrix among samples. Beta diversity is the measure of differences between samples in the abundance of phylotypes. Weighted UniFrac takes into account the phylogenetic distances between the OTUs, so that it captures differences not only at the level of individual phylotypes but also differences at higher taxonomic levels. The first two principal coordinates are plotted in Figure\u20094. The normal and CIND subjects tend to cluster in the top left of the graph and the subjects with dementia tend to be in the upper and lower right half of the graph. There is no obvious separation of normal from CIND. The first principal coordinate separates all but one of the normal/CIND subjects from the participants with dementia and the second principal coordinate provides some additional separation. The observed clustering in the non-dementia samples was due to differences in Fusobacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae. When the analysis was conducted with only Fusobacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae, the first coordinate completely separated the participants with dementia from the others. When all Fusobacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae were removed and the analyses repeated, there was no clustering of the non-dementia samples (Figure\u20094). Dementia versus non-dementia was the only variable that produced clustering on the principal coordinates plot. No clustering was evident for gingivitis score, age, sex, or number of teeth (data not shown). A variety of tests were used to determine whether these observed differences were statistically significant. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the levels of Fusobacterium and Prevotella were significantly different (P <0.0018 and P <0.0049, respectively) between non-dementia and dementia. However, random forest analysis, a somewhat more robust test of statistical significance indicated that the observed differences did not reach statistical significance.",

Because of the relatively short read lengths, care must be used in choosing an appropriate region of the 16S RNA gene for analysis using the Illumina platform. The V3 region was selected because the primers used are the same as those used for older methods of bacterial community analysis, and this region had been used previously in Illumina-based analysis of microbial communities from environmental samples [27]. The region amplified in this study is longer (170 to 190 bases) than the V6 region (105 to 120 bases) [30] or the V5 region (approximately 82 bases) [18] sequenced in other studies. Using the PCR primers described in Bartram et al. [27] it was possible to run up to 12 samples per sequencing lane in this study, thereby substantially reducing the cost of the analysis. However, a challenge to using this system for microbiome analysis is the relatively short read lengths that are typically generated in a run (approximately 125\u2009bp) and the lower quality of many of these reads. These disadvantages are obviated by using a paired-end sequencing approach, and successful microbiome analyses of various environmental niches [27] including the oral cavity [18,31] have been documented. Furthermore, recent additions to the QIIME program have streamlined analysis of Illumina-generated data. We used the Greengenes database to identify the taxa corresponding to our sequences. About 5% of our sequences were not found in Greengenes; we believe that most of these are artifacts, but it is possible that a small number of rare OTUs could have been excluded, which limits the utility of this approach for identifying very rare phylotypes with a high level of confidence. Nevertheless, we successfully obtained millions of sequences from each sample, yielding profound details of the structure of the microbiome in subgingival plaque.",

First, a very high level of Fusobacteria was found, particularly in the samples from normal and CIND participants. Fusobacteria are well-studied anaerobes that have been found with great frequency in the oral cavity using culture-independent analyses [32-35], and members of the genus Fusobacterium were previously found to be among the most commonly identified species in the oral cavities of elderly patients [34,35], particularly in association with root caries [35]. A second novel observation was that the levels of Fusobacteriaceae were lower, and that levels of Prevotellaceae were higher in samples from subjects with dementia compared to subjects without dementia. We had hundreds of taxa in our results, so by chance some of them would likely appear to be correlated with dementia. However, Prevotellaceae and Fusobacteriaceae are the two most abundant families of bacteria, and antibody levels to individual species in those families have been shown to increase to higher levels in people who develop dementia than in those who do not [13].",

As expected, the participants with dementia in this study had on average, slightly more gingivitis, fewer teeth, more caries, and much higher plaque indices. However, while this is true on average, it was not always the case on an individual basis. Participant Normal 2 had poor oral health while participants Dementia 1 and Dementia 5 had relatively good oral health, albeit with fewer teeth. Participant Dementia 2 had the highest number of teeth of all those in the study. If dementia causes poor oral health, which in turn causes the changes in the microbiome, then the correlations between the directly related parameters (cognition and oral health, or oral health and the microbiome) should be higher than the correlation between the indirectly related parameters (cognition and the microbiome). Since we found the opposite, the data do not support the hypothesis that the observed differences are merely secondary effects of poor oral hygiene in subjects with dementia.",

However, the difference was not large and the statistical significance of that finding was dependent on the statistical test used to analyze the data. The number of Prevotellaceae phylotypes was high in both groups of samples, supporting many previous studies that showed diversity in Prevotellaceae phylotypes/species in the oral cavity [36]. In addition, there was a slight but statistically significant increase in the number of distinct OTUs in the dementia samples compared to the non-dementia samples, raising the question of whether there are phylotypes in the Prevotellaceae that contribute to dementia. At the species and strain levels there are examples of specific genes that could potentially contribute to virulence within the Prevotellaceae family including genes that encode fimbrial adhesins, phospholipases, host-resistance factors, adenine-specific DNA-methyltransferase and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase [36,37]. Species-specific insertion sequences have also been identified [37], but whether these or other genes are disproportionately expressed in dementia patients and play a role in disease awaits metagenomic analyses. There were no other predominant phylotypes found in higher levels in participants with dementia compared to non-dementia, arguing against the idea that the presence of certain bacteria promotes dementia. However, the fact that higher levels of Fusobacteriaceae were found in all samples from participants without dementia suggests an alternate explanation, that perhaps certain oral bacteria provide protection against dementia, possibly by filling environmental niches that could be populated by more inflammatory microorganisms, by actively suppressing local or systemic inflammatory responses, or by producing biomolecules that are neuroprotective.",

There is a strong genetic link to some forms of dementia, including the presence of the APOE-e4 variant of the Apolipoprotein E gene [38]. It is possible that the presence or absence of specific taxa could be due to genetic factors in the subject such as host immune responses, expression of adhesion molecules on host tissues that affect bacterial adherence, or other undefined factors. The relationship between human genotype and the oral microbiome needs to be studied carefully.",

These investigators also found that subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), unlike AD subjects, had no differences in P. intermedia and F. nucleatum compared to normal subjects, but had reduced levels of antibodies to several other oral bacteria. Similarly, we found that our normal and CIND subjects did not separate based on their microbiome beta diversity and, in particular, that their Prevotellaceae and Fusobacteriaceae were similar. We hypothesize that our results can be reconciled with those of Sparks Stein et al. by predicting that subjects who will develop dementia have a leakier sub-gingival compartment resulting in increased interaction between the microbiome and the immune system, leading to higher antibody levels to the most prevalent bacteria: Fusobacterium and Prevotella. Compared to Prevotella, Fusobacteria are much less genetically diverse at the 16S gene, so they might be more sensitive to elevated serum antibody levels because of less diversity of surface proteins that could serve as targets for antibodies. Thus, later in life one might predict that higher levels of antibody might reduce levels of Fusobacteria yet fail to be as effective against genetically diverse Prevotella. Alternatively, it is possible that the difference in findings for Fusobacteriaceae might be because Sparks Stein et al. were using antibodies that would differentiate strains on the basis of surface proteins while we used 16S ribosomal sequences.",
