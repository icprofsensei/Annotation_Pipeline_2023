Investigators explained the aim and protocol of this study to patients who met the inclusion criteria. Informed written consent and medical history were obtained at the visit. Patients with bronchiectasis were recruited during a stable phase of their disease, defined as no exacerbation or antibiotic treatment in the previous 4 weeks. Patients with acutely exacerbated bronchiectasis, defined according to the criteria reported by Fuchs et al [12], were recruited as the comparator group. For all patients, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected before initiation of antibiotics. Subjects were enrolled if they were adults (>19 years of age). No patients had a history of asthma or atopy, recent respiratory tract infection (within 4 weeks), or conditions with the potential to affect the safe performance of bronchoscopy. Patients with bronchiectasis had no evidence of (non-bronchiectasis) acute or chronic respiratory disease and were not receiving systemic corticosteroids. All subjects were macrolide na\u00efve and none received nebulized antibiotics. Exclusion criteria included the following: (patients with) bronchiectasis as a result of focal endobronchial obstruction; currently active tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacterium infection; recent deterioration in other respiratory disease(s); prescribed either oral or intravenous antibiotics therapy in the preceding 4 weeks; active malignancy; and acute cardiac disease.",

Assessing and identifying bacterial species, microbial diversity, and performing grouping according to shared sequence characteristics is possible due to the high degree of conservation capacity of the 16S rRNA gene across bacterial domains. Taxonomical assignment is possible due to the presence of nine hypervariable regions (V1\u2013V9) that contain sufficient sequence diversity to classify microbes. Furthermore, because conserved regions surround these variable regions, PCR amplification using universal primers is possible. To increase the resolving power of 16S rRNA profiling, primers in the Ion 16STM Metagenomics Kit were used to amplify variable regions 2, 4, and 8 in a single tube, resulting in amplicon fragments of approximately 250 base pairs (bp), 288 bp, and 295 bp, in length, respectively. In the second single tube, a multiplex PCR reaction targeted variable regions 3, 6 to 7, and 9, with resulting amplicon fragments of approximately 215 bp, 260 bp, and 209 bp, in length, respectively [13\u201316]. The primer set (V2-4-8, V3-5-6) composition followed Ion 16S\u2122 Metagenomics Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The primer pools were designed to target >80% of sequences found in the Greengenes database (>400,000 organisms curated) with 100% match for amplifying at least one variable region. After 16S rRNA PCR amplification, we loaded the PCR products on 1.5% agarose gel to confirm microbial DNA. Simultaneously, we loaded negative and positive controls to verify they did not contain non-microbial DNA.

Alpha diversity is defined as the diversity within a community and is measured by richness (S*), which estimates the number of species present; the Shannon diversity index (H) = \u2212\u2211si=1piln(pi), where pi is proportion (n/N) of individuals of one particular species found (n), s is number of species; and the Simpson index (D) = 1\u2211si=1pi2, where pi is proportion (n/N) of individuals of one particular species found (n). The higher the score, the more diversity in the community. The Shannon diversity index and the Simpson index were used for assessing species diversity. The Shannon diversity index is an information statistic index and the Simpson index is a dominance index. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify differences between the two groups in richness (S*), Simpson index (D), and Shannon diversity index (H). R package software version 3.2.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for alpha diversity analysis. Beta diversity is defined as the distance between communities, with distance estimated using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) [17,18]. PCoA analysis assigns each sample to a position in a three-dimensional plot to reduce the multiple dimensions of OTU files using linear conversion formulas. Each PCoA plot was visualized in the three-dimensional structure, and the distances between the plots were summed. The total distances were compared within and between individuals with stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis. Beta-diversity was visualized using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis.",

Table 1 summarizes the demographic information of the patient pool. All 17 enrolled patients underwent BAL via bronchoscopy, and a BAL sample was obtained from each patient. Sputum samples were collected from all patients. In the DNA sequencing process, one BAL sample was excluded because the DNA was not sufficiently extracted; two BAL samples were excluded because the total number of reads was too low. Finally, 14 BAL samples were included in the analysis: 8 samples were obtained from patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis and 6 were collected from patients with acutely exacerbated bronchiectasis. The mean age of these 14 patients was 60 years (range 42\u201378 years) and 9 (64%) were female. Age and sex were not significantly different between the stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis groups.",

There were several differences in the type of organisms identified using conventional microbiological and molecular tests. BAL quantitative culture revealed only dominant organisms, while molecular methods using 16S rRNA sequencing provided previously unknown information. We described the three most abundant bacteria in each of the samples. In the BAL quantitative and sputum cultures, P aeruginosa (5 patients) and H influenzae (4 patients) were the major organisms. The others were Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 patients) and S aureus (1 patient). The causative organism in 2 patient samples could not be identified. BAL cultures identified causative organisms in 11 patients; however, sputum cultures identified organisms in only 3. 16S rRNA sequencing identified several potentially causative organisms in all patients. There were discrepancies between microbiological and molecular tests in 3 samples (ST7, EX3 and EX6). 16S rRNA sequencing identified potentially causative organisms in undetermined samples tested using microbiological tests of BAL and sputum (ST2 and ST6). When H influenzae was identified as a causative organism, Haemophilus aegyptius was present in all cases (n = 7). An anaerobic bacterial culture process was not used for microbiological testing; thus, anaerobes could not be isolated. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed several clinically important anaerobic bacterial species including Prevotella (3 patients), Veillonella (1 patient), Porphyromonas (1 patient), and Tannerella (1 patient).",

Two samples were excluded because the total number of reads was too small to analyze. Table 4 lists the relative abundance of taxa at the genus level from the sequence pool of stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis. In the stable bronchiectasis group, Haemophilus (42.4%), Pseudomonas (22.2%), Moraxella (17.1%), Prevotella (4.3%), Staphylococcus (3.9%), and Streptococcus (1.4%) were relatively abundant. In the exacerbation group, Haemophilus (43.1%), Pseudomonas (24.0%), Klebsiella (12.5%), Prevotella (4.6%), Roseomonas (2.4%), and Aeromonas (1.8%) were abundant. Both groups showed similar compositions. Furthermore, of the 167 OTUs, nine accounted for >90% of the total sequences generated, indicating that the majority of the observed community richness resulted from low abundance taxa.",

Three-dimensional PCoA plots were visualized, in which the 3 axes and each contribution ratio (principal coordinate, PC 1\u20133, %) were depicted. There were no definite differences between the 8 stable bronchiectasis communities and 6 exacerbated bronchiectasis communities (Fig 4). A two-dimensional PCoA plot is shown using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in Fig 5. Points 1 to 8 refer to stable bronchiectasis patients, and points 9 to 14 refer to exacerbated bronchiectasis patients. There was no clustering between the stable and exacerbated groups. Samples showing close clustering tend to gather according to the dominant bacteria, rather than clinical status.",

Previous studies have investigated stable bronchiectasis using aerobic bacterial cultures. In this study, bacterial culture identified P aeruginosa, H influenzae, K pneumoniae, and S aureus as the major organisms and species, with rates similar to those reported in previous studies [19\u201321]. In contrast, culture-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing provided a more comprehensive characterization of lung microbial community composition. Two bacterial organisms that could not be identified using BAL quantitative cultures and sputum cultures (M catarrhalis and H influenzae) were identified using DNA sequencing methods. M catarrhalis is a common major pathogen identified in non-CF bronchiectasis [4,19,20]. Using culture-independent molecular techniques, M catarrhalis was the third most abundant (11.6%) bacteria in the observed taxa from the sequence pool of 14 BAL samples, in contrast to the results from microbiological cultures. Furthermore, DNA sequencing revealed potentially pathogenic anaerobic organisms, such as Prevotella and Veillonella species, in BAL samples, which are exceedingly difficult to isolate using routine aerobic culture methods. Recent studies using molecular-based techniques have reported that anaerobic bacteria are commonly found and abundant in lower airway samples from patients with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [22,23]. Nevertheless, the role of anaerobic species in the pathophysiology of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis remains unclear. Tunney et al. [18] suggested that an increase in anaerobic load relative to aerobic load may be a contributing factor to the onset of exacerbation of bronchiectasis.",

We collected BAL samples via bronchoscopy, not sputum or induced sputum and, given that BAL via bronchoscopy is an invasive procedure compared with sputum collection, enrolling a large number of patients was impossible. Nevertheless, molecular analysis of BAL samples from bronchiectasis patients represents one strength of our study. Although BAL is an invasive procedure, it does not contain oral flora and, consequently, is a particularly accurate reflection of the lung microbiota. Based on the results of this exploratory study, we will suggest directions for future studies. Second, we could not collect BAL samples of clinically stable and exacerbated from same patients, because BAL via bronchoscopy is an invasive procedure. Third, acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis could not be clearly differentiated from stable bronchiectasis. Fuchs et al. [12] defined criteria including 12 signs or symptoms; however, patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis usually experience symptoms daily. BAL fluid analysis in our study showed discrepancies in the stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis groups. Fourth, we performed agarose gel (1.5%) electrophoresis for our presumptive negative control; however, the absence of a band does not necessarily mean the absence of an amplified product. DNA sequencing would have been a more stringent negative control. Two BAL samples were excluded from the analysis because the total number of reads was too low. However, we could identify bands representing these two samples in the gel results. Fifth, next-generation sequencing 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis using a multiplex targeted PCR method is very sensitive to lower abundant species, and data analysis is relatively easy and compact. It still, however, has the limitation of primer binding sites only for known sequences. Salipante et al. compared the performances of two common sequencing platforms, Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM, for bacterial community profiling using 16S rRNA (V1-V2) amplicon sequencing, and reported that a higher rate of sequencing errors was observed using the Ion Torrent platform; however, the absolute difference in error rates between the two platforms was not significant [32]. The Ion 16STM Metagenomics Kit used in our study simultaneously examines 7 of the 9 hypervariable regions in the 16S rRNA gene. This kit is well-validated to detect bacterial strains in the microbial mock community standard material HM-277D (BEI resources) and supporting publications [13\u201316]. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that a few bacterial variable regions could be underestimated or fail to be detected due to mismatched primer binding sites in the 16S variable regions.",

Although culture-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing provided more comprehensive characterization of lung microbial community composition, we found no significant differences between the lung microbiome of patients with clinically stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis. In our study, patient-specific microbial communities were dominated by one or several genera, regardless of clinical status, which is stable or acutely exacerbated.
