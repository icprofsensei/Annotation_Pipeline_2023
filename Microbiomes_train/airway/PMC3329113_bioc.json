Although there have been numerous studies of viral communities, few have focused on viruses within the indigenous human microbiota. We analyzed 2\u2009267\u2009695 virome reads from viral particles and compared them with 263\u2009516 bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences from the saliva of five healthy human subjects over a 2- to 3-month period, in order to improve our understanding of the role viruses have in the complex oral ecosystem. Our data reveal viral communities in human saliva dominated by bacteriophages whose constituents are temporally distinct. The preponderance of shared homologs between the salivary viral communities in two unrelated subjects in the same household suggests that environmental factors are determinants of community membership. When comparing salivary viromes to those from human stool and the respiratory tract, each group was distinct, further indicating that habitat is of substantial importance in shaping human viromes. Compared with coexisting bacteria, there was concordance among certain predicted host\u2013virus pairings such as Veillonella and Streptococcus, whereas there was discordance among others such as Actinomyces. We identified 122\u2009728 virulence factor homologs, suggesting that salivary viruses may serve as reservoirs for pathogenic gene function in the oral environment. That the vast majority of human oral viruses are bacteriophages whose putative gene function signifies some have a prominent role in lysogeny, suggests these viruses may have an important role in helping shape the microbial diversity in the human oral cavity.",

We believe that there may be vast, uncharacterized communities of bacteriophages present in each of the ecological niches in humans. Because of their alternate lifestyles, involving either primarily lytic behavior\u2014with the potential to eradicate certain bacteria, or primarily lysogenic behavior\u2014with the potential to convey new function to their host (Canchaya et al., 2003), bacteriophages may have a substantial capacity to alter human bacterial communities (Kunin et al., 2008; Rohwer and Thurber, 2009), and as a result, may have a role in both health and in disease, such as chronic periodontitis (Gorski and Weber-Dabrowska, 2005).",

This approach provides information about community membership and phylogenetic relationships, but fails to reveal much about the functional potential of the community. Metagenomics (shotgun or community-wide sequencing) is an increasingly practical, alternative approach for community characterization, and assessment of functional potential that is broadly applicable, including to viral communities. There have been only a few published studies of viral community composition in humans (Breitbart et al., 2008; Nakamura et al., 2009). One study of respiratory viral communities demonstrated large differences between healthy subjects and those with cystic fibrosis (Willner et al., 2009). In the human gastrointestinal tract, viral populations are highly individual-specific, and are characterized by the presence of temperate bacteriophages with substantial genetic stability over time (Reyes et al., 2010). In human oropharyngeal samples, the presence of platelet-binding factors pblA and pblB in viruses implicates them as potential contributors to bacterial community virulence (Willner et al., 2010). We analyzed the salivary viromes of five periodontally healthy human subjects over a 60- to 90-day period to gain a broader appreciation for the viral inhabitants of the human oral cavity, their potential contribution to virulence and metabolism, and their relationship with oral bacteria.",

Saliva was filtered sequentially using 0.45 and 0.2-\u03bcm filters (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) to remove cellular and other debris, stained using SYBR-gold and visualized by epifluorescence microscopy (Noble and Fuhrman, 1998). The concentration of the virus-like particles was estimated based on the average number of particles from at least four separate high-power fields. Viral concentrates also were visualized by electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai TF 30 He Polara) at a magnification ranging from 45K to 75K. To isolate human oral viruses for DNA preparation, the filtered fraction was purified on a cesium chloride gradient. Only the fraction with a density corresponding to most known bacteriophages (Murphy et al., 1995) was retained; further purified on Amicon YM-100 protein purification columns (Millipore Inc., Billerica, MA, USA); treated with DNase-I; and subjected to lysis and DNA purification using the Qiagen UltraSens virus kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The resulting DNA was amplified using Qiagen RepliG MDA (Qiagen) and fragmented bar-coded libraries were created as described (Dethlefsen and Relman, 2010), followed by sequencing using primer-A on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX instrument using Titanium chemistry (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA).

Sequences were removed from the analysis if they were <300\u2009nt, had an uncorrectable barcode, contained any ambiguous characters or contained >10 homopolymers. Sequences were assigned to their respective samples based on their 10-nt barcode sequence and similar sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using a minimum identity of 97% using CD-Hit (Li and Godzik, 2006). To limit overestimation of the microbial diversity present, pyrosequencing noise was reduced using Pyronoise (Quince et al., 2009, #602). Representative sequences from each OTU were chosen and aligned using NAST (DeSantis et al., 2006b) based on the Greengenes database (DeSantis et al., 2006a). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using FastTree based on Kimura's two-parameter distances, and taxonomy was assigned to each OTU using the RDP classifier (Wang et al., 2007; Price et al., 2009). Shared OTUs were compared between each subject at each time point to generate heatmaps using Java Treeview (Saldanha, 2004). Principal-coordinates analysis was performed based on Beta Diversity using weighted Unifrac distances. Rarefaction analysis was performed based on species richness estimates of 10\u2009000 iterations using EcoSim (Lee et al., 2005). Good's coverage was determined as the estimation of the number of singletons in the population (n), compared with the total number of sequences (N), using the equation (1\u2212(n/N)) \u00d7 100 (Good, 1953). Beta Diversity was determined using Sorensen's similarity index (Magurran, 2004).",

We focused on contigs for identification of viruses rather than virome reads because the larger fragments allow more productive searches for homologous sequences, and create a further barrier to contaminating cellular elements. Also, a majority of the contigs were constructed with far greater than 20 \u00d7 coverage, providing substantial confidence in the assembly process. There were minimal identifiable contaminating cellular elements, with the preponderance identified as clonal environmental contaminants (Supplementary Table 2). To identify the putative origin of each contig, each was subjected to blastX analysis using the NCBI NR database. The majority of the contigs had no known homologs (Breitbart et al., 2003; Bench et al., 2007); however, for each subject a substantial proportion had known viral homologs (Supplementary Figure 4). A number of the contigs had bacterial homologs; however, contigs with known viral homologs outnumbered them in each case. Relatively few contigs (ranging from 0 to 1%) had homology to viral sequences other than bacteriophages (Supplementary Figure 5), suggesting that bacteriophages constitute the majority of the human salivary double-stranded DNA viral population. Of those contigs with homology to eukaryotic viruses, most had homology to Torque Teno viruses (Hino and Miyata, 2007).",

The Virulence Factor Database was constructed with the purpose of identifying factors that contribute to disease processes, including more conventional virulence factors such as protein toxins, and less conventional virulence factors such as regulators and siderophores that are indirectly involved in pathogenesis, but are important for microorganisms to establish infection. Each subject presented a different profile of virulence factor homologs across all time points (Figure 2b); however, numerous virulence factor homologs are present in multiple contigs in each virome, suggesting that their presence may be of substantial importance to the viral community. Among the most commonly identified are pspA and pspC (involved in complement fixation and IgA degradation) (Dave et al., 2004; Ren et al., 2004), and cbpD and cbpE (involved in adhesion to the nasopharynx) (Gosink et al., 2000). Virulence factor homologs putatively involved in platelet binding, iron scavenging, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, cell wall antigenic variation and DNA methylation also were identified in viral contigs (Supplementary Figure 7 and Supplementary Table 3).

We also identified a viral contig in Subject no. 1, present on both day 1 and day 30, with a large number of homologs to the oral commensal V. dispar (Figures 3b and c). Indeed, through blastN analysis, nearly the entire contig is present in the genome of strain V. dispar ATCC 17748, with the exception of an \u2248500-bp segment (Figures 3b and c). Mapping of virome reads to the genome of V. dispar ATCC 17748 reveals that the vast majority of the reads map to the region of the putative prophage rather than being evenly distributed over the length of the genome, which further substantiates that these phage are present in the salivary environment and are not the result of bacterial contamination. Interestingly, a small proportion of the reads on day 30 map to a separate genome region with a substantial number of hypothetical and putative phage genes, suggesting that Veillonella may have multiple phage present in the salivary environment simultaneously. We also found a putative streptococcal virus with an integrase homolog and an accompanying phage repressor homolog (Supplementary Figure 8a), further indicative of lysogenic viruses in the community. Similar to our finding of the putative Veillonella prophage, we found a putative Megasphaera phage in which many of the homologs also have synteny with the sequenced bacterial strain (Supplementary Figure 8b).",

At the phylum level, Firmicutes predominated across most all subjects and time points, followed by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria (Figure 4a). We also sequenced the bacterial 16S rRNA genes from each subject (Supplementary Table 4) as a comparison data set. Whereas there was substantial conservation of viral taxonomy (Figure 4a), the bacterial phyla present were highly variable (Figure 4b) at a high taxonomic level. We also compared the populations of bacteria and viruses present at a lower taxonomic rank by testing whether the ranks of viruses and bacteria at the genus level were more concordant than would be expected by chance. We did not find significant concordant relationships using Kendall's tau distance for the majority of the time points in each subject (Table 1). After combining all time points within individual subjects to increase the power of detecting discordant relationships, we did find significant concordant relationships for all subjects (Table 1). Examination of individual genera using Pearson's \u03c72-test to measure residuals demonstrated that for most time points there was significant concordance between bacteria and virus for Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Leptotrichia, Neisseria, Granulicatella and Cardiobacterium (Figure 4c). In many subjects, Actinomyces, Fusobacterium and Campylobacter presented the most discordant relationships (Figure 4c). There were few significant bacteria/virus relationships detected at the level of phylum (Table 1), probably because of the lack of power of a rank test on samples with limited categories (n=7). The presence of discordance for certain genera and concordance for others suggests that salivary viruses might have a different impact on their respective bacterial hosts.",

Examination of bacterial diversity through analysis of shared bacterial OTUs also revealed substantial diversity within and between subjects over time (Supplementary Figure 10).

Across all individuals, approximately 43% of the viral contigs shared the same best hit with another contig, suggesting that there are highly related yet distinct viruses that populate the human oral cavity. Similar results also were demonstrated for salivary bacterial communities (Supplementary Figures 9b and 11), indicating that shared genera are largely conserved over time in each subject. When compared with viromes from human stool (Reyes et al., 2010) and the respiratory tract (Willner et al., 2009), few of the contigs shared the same best hit, whereas most of the viral contigs were unique to their particular habitat (Figure 5a). Indeed, as demonstrated through principal-coordinates analysis, viromes from stool and the respiratory tract are distinct from those of saliva (Figure 5b). Even among the salivary viral communities, many are distinct to their individual host; however, for some time points, the viral communities are only partially reflective of their host environment.",

While the putative host range of these viruses appears to be a fairly stable component of the ecosystem (Supplementary Figure 9a), the relative proportions of the salivary bacterial microbiota vary (Figure 4b). The presence of shared homologs, particularly between subjects residing in the same household (Figure 1d), suggests that environmental factors have a substantial role in determining the composition of the oral viral community; however, a more detailed analysis than the one presented here would be necessary to conclusively demonstrate such a phenomenon. While salivary viruses may have an important role in shaping the oral microbiome, it has yet to be determined whether they are representative of the viruses that likely are present in the oral bio-film.",

                    "text": "For a portion of our analysis, we place greater emphasis on viral contigs rather than reads because in our stringent construction of contigs we noticed that for many contigs the average coverage far exceeded 20 \u00d7 , and we were able to reproduce the same contigs from separate viromes in the same subject (Figures 3b and c), thereby providing us with substantial confidence in the construction process. Also, by focusing on the viral contigs, the longer stretches of sequence permitted more productive searches for homologous sequences in the NCBI NR database. Alternative methods to advancing the identification of novel bacteriophages from metagenome data include increasing the read length of sequences and cloning larger fragments prior to sequencing. One of the greatest limitations of virome analysis is the presence of contaminating cellular DNA. While our techniques produced data sets with limited cellular contamination (Supplementary Table 2) compared with other studies, the process of assembly creates a further barrier to contamination, because reads from larger bacterial and eukaryotic genomes are less likely to assemble than reads from smaller viral genomes. The vast majority of contigs with homology to eukaryotes were to redundant eukaryote DNA, with the exception of the few eukaryotic viruses found with homology to Torque Teno viruses.",

Although this finding might reflect the presence of the same viruses over time, it is more likely due to shared characteristics among different viruses, such as the numerous virulence factor homologs that are present in each subject across all time points (Figure 2b). The presence of shared profiles within subjects over time (Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure 11a), but not between subjects, suggests that there are inherent properties specific to each human environment that determine viral community composition. The effect of habitat on virome community membership is further exemplified by the distinct differences found when comparing salivary viromes with those from human stool and the respiratory tract (Figure 5b).",

There was an extraordinary relative abundance of reads that were homologous to known virulence factors found in viral contigs from each subject across all time points (Figure 2b and Supplementary Table 3). Four of the most prevalent virulence factors (pspA, pspC, cbpD and cbpE) are putatively involved in immune evasion through breakdown of complement or IgA, and adhesion to the nasopharynx (Supplementary Table 3). The presence of these factors suggests that salivary viruses have the potential to have a role in the pathogenicity of their host bacteria.",

Our analysis of viruses in human saliva has uncovered properties of viruses that differ from those previously found in analysis of human stool and respiratory viruses (Willner et al., 2009; Reyes et al., 2010). The vast majority of the human salivary viruses were identified as viruses of bacteria, with a substantial proportion of the population having integrase homologs (Figure 3a), suggesting a predominant role in lysogeny. That we found putative viruses of Veillonella (Figure 3b), Streptococcus (Supplementary Figure 8a) and Megasphaera (Supplementary Figure 8b), whose gene structure suggests they might also exist as prophages within their respective hosts, further supports the presence of lysogenic viruses in the community. Many of the viral contigs have homologs predicted to be involved in the pathogenic functions of bacteria. As such, these findings represent an intriguing feature of salivary viruses, where they may serve as reservoirs of pathogenic gene function in the human oral environment.",
