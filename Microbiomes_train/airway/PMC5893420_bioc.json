Rarefaction analyses indicated that the species richness was significantly reduced (P <0.001) in the O compared to N, B1 and B6 samples (Supplementary Figure E1). We then evaluated diversity of bacterial communities between samples, using Shannon diversity index, a measure of alpha diversity within a sample that represents both species richness and evenness (Figure 1C). Shannon diversity index of 3.5 and above indicate highly diverse bacterial communities. While all samples including airway, nasal and oral samples had high bacterial community diversity, B1 (6.6), B6 (6.8) and N (6.3) had a significantly higher Shannon diversity index when compared to O (3.6) (P<0.001); differences in diversity between airway and nasal samples were not significantly different (P=0.8).",

We compared the bacterial communities of O and B1 microbiome, using the beta diversity metric, the weighted UniFrac distance. The weighted UniFrac distances are inclusive of abundance, the presence or absence of OTUs between samples and their phylogenetic distances and were visualized using a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot. PCoA plot between the individual subject's O and B1 microbiome showed wide separation with the first two principle components explaining 75% variability (Figure 2A). Additionally, combined analysis of all subject samples also showed that the O and B1 microbiomes clustered separately with the first two principal components explaining 74% variability (Figure 2B). When comparing O and N microbiomes with B1, the Unifrac distance between the O and B1 was greater as compared to N and B1 microbiome (P<0.0006, paired t test) (Figure 2C). The phyla Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi contributed significantly to the differences found between the O and B1 microbiome (Supplementary Table S1A). Similarly, weighted Unifrac distance between O and B6 of individual subjects showed a greater separation with the first two principal components accounting for 74% variability (Figure 2D). Likewise, combined analysis of all subjects showed distinct clustering of O and B6 microbiome with the first two principal components accounting for 64% and the first three components accounting for 73% variability (Figure 2E). In addition, the Unifrac distances were also greater between O and B6 as compared to N and B6 microbiome (P<0.0001, paired t test) (Figure 2F). Significant differences in the O and B6 microbiome were contributed by phyla Tenericutes, Fusobacteria, Deferibacteres and Proteobacteria (Supplementary Table S1B).",

Studies to date have not addressed the involvement of microbial communities in influencing their function in causing allograft rejection. We first identified three distinct phenotypes of MDSCs in the BAL of transplanted subjects: Subset (A), CD14+CD11b+CD16-HLA-DR- (monocytic) subset (B) CD66+CD16+CD14-HLA-DR-CD11b+ (neutrophilic) and subset (C) CD163+HLA-DR+CD11b+CD66b-CD16- (macrophage like) MDSCs in both B1 and B6 samples (Figure 4A). Previous studies have shown that A and B are immunosuppressive 30,31, while C has pro-inflammatory functions 32. The gating strategy for characterizing these subsets is described in detail in Supplementary Figure E5. While subset A has been reported in asthmatics and cancer subjects, subset B has only been noted in cancer and not in asthma. Subset C has been reported in asthma and sepsis. In the B1 samples, both A and C were not significantly different, but proportion of B was significantly lower (P<0.05, paired t test). In B6, C was significantly higher than A and B (P<0.001). When comparing B1 and B6, while the proportion of A was significantly higher in B1 (P<0.01), the proportion of C was significantly higher in B6 (P<0.05) suggesting a more pro-inflammatory immune cell profile in the lower airways. No differences were noted in the proportion of B in both B1 and B6 (P=0.8).",

First, we correlated MDSC phenotypes with OTUs in either B1 or B6 (Supplementary Figure E6). We found that in B1, the phyla Actinobacteria had a significant positive correlation with MDSC subsets B (r= 0.56, P= 0.002) and C (r=0.45, P=0.02) (Supplementary Figures E6 & E7). In addition, the phyla Chlorobi positively correlated with subset A (r=0.40, P=0.03) and phyla Planctomycetes (r=0.44, P= 0.02) and TM7 (r=0.40, P=0.04) positively correlated with subset C (Supplementary Figures E6 & E7). In contrast, significant negative correlation with subset B was observed with the phyla Acidobacteria (r=-0.41, P=0.04), Proteobacteria (r=-0.40, P=0.04) and Thermi (r=-0.54, P=0.003), and phyla Verrucomicrobia (r=-0.40, P=0.04) had a negative correlation with subset C (Supplementary Figures E6 & E7). In comparison, in B6 only phyla TM7 had a significant positive correlation with subset B (r=0.53, P=0.003) and C (r=0.44, p=0.01) (Supplementary Figures E6 & E7). These positive and negative correlations between MDSC subsets and bacterial phyla are represented in the network diagram shown in Figure 4B.",

Phyla Firmicutes and Thermi had differential interactions with subset B in B1 and B6, with marginal significance (P=0.05) (Supplementary Figure E6, E9D and E9E). Previously, it has been shown that neutrophilic MDSCs are preferentially activated in gram-positive sepsis in humans33. We performed correlation analysis to evaluate interactions of the gram-positive bacteria (GPB) with neutrophilic MDSC (subset B) in the airways of LTRs. The interaction between proportions of subset B and airway microbiome (B1/B6) was significant (P=0.046) (Figure E9F).

We noted significant increase in gene expression of stress response sensor CHOP and XBP1, a transcription factor which functions as an additional sensor of ER stress response (Supplementary Figure E10). These increases were noted specifically in suppressive HLA-DR\u2212MDSCs, compared to the pro-inflammatory HLA-DR+ MDSCs. Additionally, Nox2 expression that generates ROS production in MDSCs was significantly elevated in HLA-DR+ MDSCs.",

At five years after transplant, almost 50% of LTRs develop BOS and median survival thereafter is 3 years 38. Previous studies have suggested a correlation between changes in the lung microbiome and occurrence of BOS 11,12,39. In this study, we characterized the relationships between the composition and diversity of airway microbiomes with the presence of immune regulatory cells (MDSCs) that may contribute to BOS.",

In this study, we found that the oral microbiome was distinct from both proximal and distal airway microbiomes in LTRs. Additionally, the nasal microbiome was also dissimilar from the oral microbiome but more closely aligned with both proximal and distal airway microbiomes. In contrast to findings in healthy, non-transplant subjects, our studies in LTRs show a marked divergence between the BAL and oral microbiota. Other studies in lung transplant and cystic fibrosis have demonstrated the greater dissimilarity between oral and lung microbiome 41-43. In addition, HIV individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) harbor similar oral and airway microbiota compared to those not on ART 44,45. It is known that various treatments affecting mucosal immunity play a role in defining the microbiome 46. It is possible that immunosuppressive agents in LTRs or immune deficiency in HIV subjects not on ART may contribute to these differences. We performed all bronchoscopies via the oral route and thus the potential for bronchoscopic contamination of microbiota from the nasal tract was eliminated. The microbiome differences identified in our study was validated using multiple replicates.",

We used sequential BAL sampling and found distinct microbiome and MDSC signatures in the proximal and distal airways of LTRs of individual subjects. Importantly, the distal airways had a higher proportion of pro-inflammatory MDSCs (C subset), whereas the proximal airways harbored more immuno-suppressive MDSCs (subsets A and B). Nakajima et al. have hypothesized that certain microbial populations in the lungs may trigger inflammatory pathways, resulting in allograft rejection 10. Although our study was not powered to detect statistical significance between microbial signatures in BOS and non-BOS subjects, the BOS cohort had increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes in their distal airways as compared to non-BOS subjects (Figure 3C). While the phyla Firmicutes dominated the microbiome signature in the distal airways of non-BOS subjects, this shifted to a Proteobacteria dominant signature in the BOS cohort. It is possible that the higher abundance of the distinct bacterial populations that we identified in the distal airways may contribute to the activation of MDSCs in the distal airways, thus leading to increased airway inflammation and risk of allograft rejection.",

                    "text": "We also found significant correlations between bacterial OTUs and subsets of MDSCs (Figure 4B). Phyla Actinomycetes, Planctomycetes and TM7 positively correlated with the pro-inflammatory subset C. Interestingly, phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and TM7 were differentially correlated with neutrophilic MDSCs (subset B) in the proximal and distal airways. Positive or negative correlation of these bacteria to the subset B in proximal and distal airways was determined by the relative abundance of the bacteria in that compartment. A higher relative abundance led to a negative correlation, and lower abundance of bacteria led to a positive correlation with neutrophilic MDSCs. It remains to be determined whether the correlations of MDSCs with these bacteria may reflect direct involvement in the activation of the pro-inflammatory MDSCs or the primary activation of immunosuppressive neutrophilic MDSCs by these bacteria contributing to a secondary proinflammatory state of activation of non-neutrophilic MDSCs. Hence, it is plausible that presence of specific bacterial communities may be stimulatory or inhibitory in the activation of MDSCs; the imbalance in the ratio of immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory MDSCs may trigger inflammatory pathways leading to allograft rejection. Significant correlation between gram-positive bacteria and neutrophilic MDSCs were also found. This is similar to previous studies that reported preferential activation of neutrophilic MDSCs in sepsis by Staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive bacteria 33,47. Neutrophilic MDSCs are immunosuppressive in function and their activation by gram-positive bacteria in LTR may reduce host immunity and trigger further bacterial growth in the airways. Bacterial phyla are known to utilize unique metabolic pathways to maintain homeostasis (Supplementary Table S9). It is possible that these unique metabolic pathways determine the immune response generated by different bacterial phyla leading to the differential function of MDSCs. Additionally, our preliminary studies have indicated that ER stress response sensors are differentially expressed in MDSC subsets in LTRs, with higher expression in immunosuppressive HLA-DR\u2212MDSCs. This increased ER stress response can lead to apoptosis of the immunosuppressive MDSCs and may account for the imbalance in the proportions of the pro-inflammatory HLA-DR+MDSCs. Bacterial and viral infections have also been shown to modulate stress responses 34,35. Future studies are warranted to investigate if differential correlations of identified bacterial phyla and MDSC subsets may account for stress responses leading to regulation of differential functions by MDSC subsets in LTRs.",

                    "text": "One of the challenges in the field of lung microbiome is presence of relatively lower biomass in BAL samples. Interpretation of results obtained from a single low biomass sample without appropriate controls can be misleading 40,48-50. To circumvent this potential problem, we collected control samples from the bronchoscope prior to each procedure. These were found to be dissimilar to the airway microbiome (Figure E4A and E4B). Additionally, we processed quadruplicates of each biological sample to evaluate variability in relative abundance (Supplementary Figure E11). While we observed that the beta diversity between B1 and B6 samples were greater than that within B1 and B6, respectively, the large within-sample variability for B1 and B6 suggest that technical replicates are critical. Our study has several limitations. The sample size and cross sectional nature of the study limits our ability to establish a causal relationship between microbiome-immune cell interaction and BOS. However, this was a pilot study to evaluate the microbiome-immune cell interactions in LTRs. The use of quadruplet samples for microbiome analysis and inclusion of appropriate controls enhances the validity of our observations. Further studies are currently underway to validate our observations in a longitudinal cohort. Even though we found an association between the airway microbiome and MDSCs in LTRs, it is possible that several other variables such as previous acute rejection episodes, infections, immunosuppressive drugs, and antimicrobial therapies, may influence the microbiome and immune cell profiles in these subjects. Additionally, there may be an inverse effect and/or a bidirectional interplay between microbiome and the immune cells. Although, the gene expression data did show increased NOX2 expression in the HLADR+ MDSCs suggesting increased potential for reactive oxygen species formation, it does not demonstrate actual MDSC effector response. Future studies evaluating the response of MDSCs on T cell effector response will have to be conducted to confirm our observations.",
