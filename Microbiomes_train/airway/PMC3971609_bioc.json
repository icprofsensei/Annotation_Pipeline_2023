To test this, we sampled bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from the lower airways of 29 asymptomatic subjects (nine never-smokers, 14 former-smokers, and six current-smokers). We quantified, amplified, and sequenced 16S rRNA genes from BAL samples by qPCR and 454 sequencing.

In contrast, despite emerging data on airway microbiota, little is known about the role of the lung microbiome in modulating pulmonary mucosal immune response. Along the human airways, structures above the vocal cords are exposed to high bacterial burden producing contamination of lower airway samples with oropharyngeal secretions [3,4]. Classical culture techniques fail to fully describe microbial communities of the lower airways due to difficulties in growing fastidious bacteria, thus identification using marker gene sequencing is a more promising approach [5-11]. Such studies identified bacterial rRNA genes of oral cavity anaerobes such as Prevotella and Veillonella in the lower airways of normal individuals [6,8,12-16].",

The risk for microaspiration is increased in smoking-related lung disease due to reduced coordination of breathing with swallowing and gastro-esophageal reflux [18,19].

Prior studies suggest that in moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the lung microbiome is enriched with bacteria or bacterial products common to the oral cavity [7,9,20,21]. However, these studies have focused on advanced COPD patients, in whom frequent antibiotic and corticosteroid use may affect the bacterial communities of the lower airways.

However, it is unclear whether the beneficial effect is due to the antibiotic or to the anti-inflammatory properties of these drugs. An in-depth understanding of the lung microbiome and its association with mucosal inflammatory response is needed to understand potential mechanisms of lung mucosal immune regulation. Here, we hypothesized that the enrichment of the lung microbiome of asymptomatic subjects with supraglottic-characteristic taxa is associated with lung inflammation.

Since we previously observed low bacterial loads in nasal brushing [27], we used an optimized nasal bronchoscopy in an attempt to minimize the potential for contamination of the bronchoscope channel with upper airway microbiota. Given the concern for potential carry-over of upper airway microbiome to the lower airways, we avoid suctioning until the scope was in position for sampling. If during bronchoscopy, visualization was obscured, we instilled saline through the bronchoscope channel to clear the optics. In a subgroup of 15 participants, we used two bronchoscopes to evaluate potential carry-over. In this subgroup, we obtained a background sample from sterile saline and sterile normal saline passed through the bronchoscope channel. We then passed the first bronchoscope until vocal cords were visualized to obtain a supraglottic sample. The second bronchoscope was passed to obtain BAL in two different segments. The initial BAL was from a segment of the left lung (lingula) and the second BAL was from a segment of the right lung (right middle lobe, Additional file 1: Figure S1). We used three aliquots of 50 mL of saline for each BAL. On average, 50% of the instilled volume was recovered. The BAL samples were immediately placed on ice and processed within 30 min of acquisition. Total cell count and BAL cell differentials (500 cells counted) were performed to assess counts of macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. BAL fluid aliquots were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C for DNA isolation.",

UniFrac distances were calculated between supraglottic and both first and second BAL (Figure\u00a02). There were no significantly different UniFrac distances to supraglottic microbiome between first and second BAL, providing evidence that systematic carry-over did not occur. Analysis using unweighted UniFrac analysis yielded similar results. Figure \u200bFigure33 shows data from the 15 patients with complete supraglottic, first BAL, and second BAL data. The relative abundance of highly represented taxa in the supraglottic (Prevotella and Veillonella) and saline background (Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium) are shown in the bar graph with 16S rRNA copies/mL and Unifrac distance shown below each sample. There was no consistent \u2018dilution\u2019 of bacterial load and/or relative abundances of supraglottic taxa in subsequent BAL samples. As an example, in case S10, the first BAL had lower relative abundance of Prevotella and Veillonella and lower total bacterial load by qPCR (6,902 copies/mL) than the supraglottic sample (bacterial load = 34,250,000 copies/mL). Compared to first BAL, the second BAL had increased relative abundance of Prevotella and Veillonella (total bacterial load 103,300 copies/mL). Since the bronchoscope channel was not in contact with the upper airway between the first and second BAL, the increased relative abundance of Prevotella/Veillonella and total bacterial load between the first and second BAL in this example could not have been due to carry-over of supraglottic secretions contaminating the bronchoscope. From these observations, we conclude that enrichment of lower airway microbiome with supraglottic-characteristic taxa (SCT) most likely results from microaspiration, rather than from bronchoscopic carry-over.",

We used unsupervised hierarchical clustering to assess the structure of the microbiome in the background, supraglottic, and BAL samples. Background sterile saline contained high relative abundances of Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Stenotrophomonas, and Pseudomonas (Figure\u00a04, panel A). Supraglottic samples contained high relative abundances of Prevotella, Veillonella, Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas. PCoA of weighted UniFrac distances confirms that the supraglottic and background samples are distinct (panel B). Similar results were found when unweighted UniFrac was used (data not shown).",

Compared with pneumotypeUN, pneumotypeSCT was associated with higher numbers of lymphocytes (11,130 (4,640-16,069)vs. 23,315 (10,256-47,706) cells/mL for pneumotypeUN and pneumotypeSCT respectively, P= 0.007) and neutrophils in BAL (3,333 (1,411-4,327)vs. 4,537 (3,211-8,259) cells/mL, P= 0.034, Figure\u00a06A and B). We also evaluated eNO obtained prior to the bronchoscopy as an independent measure of lung inflammation (Figure\u00a06C). Compared with pneumotypeUN, pneumotypeSCT was associated with higher levels of eNO (14.5 (9.0-23.3)vs. 27.5 (15.8-41.5) ppb, P= 0.022). Since smoking is known to decrease eNO we investigated whether the association between pneumotypeSCT and increased eNO was independent of smoking. First, eNO levels in never-smokers and smokers were similar (17.8 (10.9-36.0)vs. 20.0 (13.0-32.6), P= 0.71). Further, using a linear regression model that considered eNO as dependent variable and smoking and pneumotype as dichotomized predictors, we found that pneumotypeSCT was independently associated with eNO (B = 12.3 ppb, P= 0.028) while smoking was not significantly associated with levels of eNO (B = 0.5 ppb, P= 0.9). We then evaluated whether relative abundances of specific supraglottic-characteristic taxa were associated with lung inflammation. As shown in Figure\u00a06D, E, and F, the relative abundance of Veillonella was positively correlated with both BAL inflammatory cells and eNO. Similarly, relative abundance of Prevotella correlated with BAL inflammatory cells and eNO (data not shown). These data indicate that a pneumotype defined by supraglottic-characteristic taxa is associated with inflammatory cells in the lung and with a non-invasive marker of airway inflammation.",

Prior studies suggest that the lower airway microbiome have similar microbial composition to the upper airway, raising concerns for carry-over of oropharyngeal secretions to the lower airways [5,6,9,10]. The route used for bronchoscopic approach might have significant impact since the microbiome of the oral and nasal cavity are different [40,41]. We used the nasal route because of evidence that nasal brushes have low 16S rRNA gene concentrations [27]. Our nasal bronchoscopic technique may have reduced contamination with oral secretions, enabling the uncovering of pneumotypeUN with low abundance of supraglottic-characteristic OTUs.",

First, had there been carry-over, the microbiome of first BAL would more closely resemble the supraglottic microbiome than the second BAL. In fact, UniFrac distances between supraglottic samples and the first BAL and second BAL were not different. Second, it is likely that the increased lymphocytes and neutrophils in the alveolar space of pneumotypeSCT subjects were almost certainly present prior to bronchoscopy since cell recruitment into the alveolar space probably requires more time than the duration of the bronchoscopy procedure.

PneumotypeUN had low 16S rRNA concentration, little evidence of supraglottic-characteristic OTUs and a taxonomic composition similar to the normal saline used in the research bronchoscopy. These results differ from recently published series in which oral microbiota was present in most of the BAL samples [6,11]. Technical differences between the studies may account for this discrepancy, since we aimed to minimize any potential carry-over with our bronchoscopic technique. The presence of microbial DNA in sterile saline made it difficult to ascertain which bacterial OTUs, if any, were present in the lung of pneumotypeUN subjects prior to the bronchoscopy. To reduce background noise, we subtracted saline-characteristic OTUs from the BAL. This revealed the presence of Sphingomonas, Tropheryma, Acidovorax, and Asticcacaulis in some pneumotypeUN but not in pneumotypeSCT samples. Our finding of Tropheryma in 2/16 patients in pneumotypeUN (relative abundance of 0.02 in the never-smoker and 0.11 in the smoker) is consistent with a recent report describing Tropheryma in the lower airways of 12% to 40% of normal subjects [10]. Studies with larger cohorts using low contamination bronchoscopic techniques, deeper sequencing, and bioinformatic source tracking approaches are needed to better describe pneumotype(s) in subjects with low bacterial rRNA gene concentrations [42,43].",

This study extends prior investigations by showing that systematic carry-over does not occur and that the increased abundance of supraglottic-characteristic flora in pneumotypeSCT was associated with increased BAL neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eNO. Since pneumotypeSCT also has high relative abundance of Prevotella/Veillonella and high inflammatory cells in the lung, there may be a common link between microaspiration of Prevotella/Veillonella and inflammation. Importantly, the BAL cell differentials were normal in both never-smokers and smokers, suggesting that differences in lung inflammation between pneumotypeUN and pneumotypeSCT represent subclinical variation.",

Persistent microorganisms contribute to pulmonary inflammation in current and former smokers with advanced COPD [44]. Similar to recent studies [11], we found no significant difference in \u03b1 or \u03b2 diversity between never-smokers and smokers. It is possible that increasing the sequencing depth would reveal smoking or early COPD-specific microbes present at lower relative abundance. It also is possible that investigation of larger cohorts would reveal more substantial microbiome differences between these never-smokers and smokers. However, perturbation of the lung microbiome may occur only in more advanced disease due to progressive microaspiration and impaired bacterial clearance. Alteration of the lung microbiome also may follow treatments for COPD with antibiotics and/or inhaled steroids. The early nature of disease in our smoking cohort or the absence of recent drug treatment may account for the differences between our observations and the prior reports [7,8,21].",

Our results extend these observations by demonstrating that elevated eNO may occur in association with a specific pneumotype even in the absence of overt pneumonia. Increased eNO levels were associated with both pneumotypeSCT and enrichment with supraglottic taxa such as Veillonella suggesting that the presence of subclinical inflammatory changes may occur in response to pathogen-associated molecules. Although smoking may influence eNO levels, in our cohort, the association of increased eNO with pneumotypeSCT was independent of smoking history [48,49]. Further investigation will be needed to determine whether a change in pneumotype leads to increase levels of eNO. The enhanced subclinical inflammation observed in pneumotypeSCT may warrant investigation into whether this pneumotype is associated with early physiologic markers of airway dysfunction in smokers at risk for COPD.",

Further, the association between inflammation and supraglottic-characteristic taxa in the lower airways does not imply that Prevotella and Veillonella in the lower airways cause inflammation. Additionally, the relatively small sample size, and the depth of sequencing may have prevented us from observing subtle but potentially important differences between smokers and never-smokers. Finally, our cross-sectional design does not allow us to measure the temporal stability of the lower airway microbiome. Evaluation of the impact of pneumotype resilience on lung inflammation is important to understand the potential role of the lung microbiome in the development of lung injury.",

In this relatively healthy cohort, the association between microbiome and lung inflammation exists in asymptomatic subjects, both never-smokers and smokers. In advancing COPD, mucocilliary dysfunction worsens and the risk for microaspiration increases [50,51]. This could introduce high relative abundance of oral flora into the lower airways leading to pneumotypeSCT and its associated increased inflammation. In addition, it is plausible that the progressive immune dysfunction of COPD changes the lung microbiome [52,53]. Further understanding of the association between pneumotypes and pulmonary inflammation will be required to relate the above observations to the development of lung diseases and the potential impact of antibiotics.",
