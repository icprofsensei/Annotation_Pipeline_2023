We found a seasonally persistent association between the detected blood concentration of the insecticide azinphos-methyl and the taxonomic composition of the buccal swab oral microbiome. Blood and buccal samples were collected concurrently from individual subjects in two seasons, spring/summer 2005 and winter 2006. Mass spectrometry quantified blood concentrations of the organophosphate insecticide azinphos-methyl. Buccal oral microbiome samples were 16S rRNA gene DNA sequenced, assigned to the bacterial taxonomy, and analyzed after \u201ccentered-log-ratio\u201d transformation to handle the compositional nature of the proportional abundances of bacteria per sample. Nonparametric analysis of the transformed microbiome data for individuals with and without azinphos-methyl blood detection showed significant perturbations in seven common bacterial taxa (>0.5% of sample mean read depth), including significant reductions in members of the common oral bacterial genus Streptococcus. Diversity in centered-log-ratio composition between individuals' microbiomes was also investigated using principal-component analysis (PCA) to reveal two primary PCA clusters of microbiome types. The spring/summer \u201cexposed\u201d microbiome cluster with significantly less bacterial diversity was enriched for farmworkers and contained 27 of the 30 individuals who also had azinphos-methyl agricultural pesticide exposure detected in the blood.",

Xenobiotic-microbiome interactions have been targeted as important to drug metabolism and biotransformation (2) which also makes the microbiome an important interaction term in the study of toxicology. Understanding of the microbiome, environmental exposure, and potential impacts on human health is currently growing: It has been elucidated that the microbiome can affect cognition (3,\u20135), metabolic syndrome and obesity (6,\u20138), and social development (9, 10). Many common environmental exposures (11,\u201318) can change the microbiome composition; these can be as simple as dietary differences (13, 14) and can be induced by probiotics (16) and antibiotics (11). It has also been shown that community composition changes in the microbiome are persistent when they occur as the result of extinction events and are rescued only when both nutrients (diet as environment) and microbiome transplantation (reseeding or exposure) allow recovery (19). Additionally, changes in the microbiome can have particularly compelling effects on tertiary phenotypes, which can affect the well-being of individuals. For example a Danish cohort study of prenatal exposure to antibacterial agents found an increased risk of being obese and overweight later in life in individuals with prenatal exposure to systemic antibacterials (20). Another study, in Canada, showed that the alteration of microbial compositions affects the risk of childhood asthma (21). These reports point at the microbiome as a common determinant of other phenotypes with pleiotropic effects on human health. Understanding the environmental effects of exposure on the microbiome is thus particularly important for public health.",

Acute OP toxicity in higher organisms operates primarily via a common mechanism of covalently binding a serine residue in the active site of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE); inactivating this site results in a systemic inhibition of enzyme activity (24). AChE cleaves the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released in synapses when they fire. By inhibiting the enzyme cleavage of acetylcholine, synapses are not allowed to reset, which may result in death at high doses in adults and in neurodevelopmental abnormality in children at lower doses. Residential studies of exposure to the OP chlorpyrifos have shown reductions in working memory, reductions in intelligence, and brain anomalies in the babies of exposed mothers (25,\u201329), as well as in laboratory animal experiments (30). Studies of acute exposure to these compounds have resulted in restrictions on the use of some OPs in both occupational and residential settings. As a result, the EPA has phased out any use of azinphos-methyl as of 30 September 2013 (http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/reregistration/Azinphos-methyl/phaseout_fs.htm).",

Sequenced buccal samples from 117 adult individuals were used to determine proportional abundances of oral microbiome bacteria detected in buccal swabs. Blood concentrations of azinphos-methyl have been determined by mass spectrometry in this family-based community pesticide exposure study (31). Samples were collected in spring/summer 2005 to measure pesticide exposure during the spring-to-summer fruit-thinning season, when the workers had a high likelihood of OP exposure. The winter 2006 samples assessed exposure during the off-season, when the likelihood of exposure was low. Seventy individuals had buccal samples 16S rRNA sequenced from both longitudinal collection seasons. Bacterial detection was performed by DNA sequencing of the V5 and V6 regions of the 16S rRNA gene from 206 adult buccal swab samples. Counts of reads mapping to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (32) with >97% sequence identity were converted to sample proportional abundances. The microbiota OTUs were assigned bacterial taxonomies by the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier (33). Proportional taxonomic data fall into the category of compositional data analysis with simplex geometry, where the correlation structure of reductions in abundance of one bacterial taxon is autocorrelated with compensatory proportional increase in another taxon due to the remaining read counts being occupied by other compositional members (34). The \u201ccentered log ratio\u201d of each sample's taxonomic proportional abundances applied here has been proposed as an appropriate transformation to correct for this compositional nature of the data (34,\u201336). To avoid the complications due to limits of detection of rare member of the microbiota when read depths vary between samples, we have chosen to analyze associations in only common taxonomic genus members of the community composition (>0.5% mean proportion of sample read depth) as defined by the spring/summer 2005 samples. We adopted a slightly less stringent definition for common (>0.1% sample mean OTU proportion) when conducting exploratory principal-component analysis (PCA) at the OTU taxonomy resolution, in contrast to the genus-level taxonomy used in hypothesis testing of exposed groups. To model read depths and the probability that we would detect a taxonomic proportion, we used the negative binomial probability, Pr[missed taxon] = e\u2212pn, where p is the proportion of reads identified to that taxon and n is the total number of reads for that sample (37, 38). This allowed us to establish criteria from the samples' taxon mean proportions (e.g., genera > 0.005, OTUs > 0.001) for which taxa to investigate at the read depth of sequencing sampled. Using only deeply sequenced samples (minimum threshold, 2,500 reads; median, 38,454; mean, 55,321), we fix a high probability at the median read depth, Pr[missed 0.001] < 1.99 \u00d7 10\u221217, that we will observe the identified common taxon in the Dirichlet process if the taxon exists in the sample above the proportion threshold. This common taxon analysis with deeply sequenced samples mitigates the false zero inflation of nondetects, which can occur when analyzing various depths of reads sampled and rarely detected taxa. We have also adopted this common genus detection limit threshold to limit the number of hypotheses tested to only common microbiota; to further reduce the possibility of bias, nonparametric Wilcoxon's rank sum tests were used to test for differences in microbial abundances. Using this approach, we identified robust false-discovery-adjusted associations between the identified microbiota abundance and azinphos-methyl exposure in this Hispanic Yakima Valley (Washington State) community agricultural cohort. We additionally extended this result to an exploratory PCA of the centered-log-ratio common OTU sample proportions present in buccal microbiomes of pesticide-exposed individuals and other members of the Yakima Valley Hispanic community.",

Reads were quality control discarded if the primers were not detected during trimming, if the read had more than three expected errors, or if chimeras were detected (32). The remaining mean read length was 247 bp (221 to 279 bp), putting the effective error rate at less than 0.012 error per base after quality control. The median sequencing depth of the 196 adult samples with more than 2,500 reads passing quality control was 38,454 total reads (mean, 55,321), making these samples deeply sequenced. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering by USEARCH (32) with 97% read DNA sequence identity resulted in 2,520 OTUs with measured differences between taxonomy members in excess of 7.41 nucleotide bases [(1 \u2212 0.97) \u00d7 247 bp], with fewer than three of these being sequencing errors. These OTUs were classified to 286 bacterial reference taxonomies with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier java program (33). The RDP classifier reports to the lowest taxonomic level it can, down to the genus level. Among the common taxa we analyzed, suborders Micrococcineae and Actinomycineae and the family Coriobacterineae are identified as the lowest taxonomy level classified for these phylogenies. We refer to these taxa collectively as \u201cgenera\u201d with the genera in this text. Sample bacterial DNA sequences were mapped onto the 2,520 de novo OTU reference taxonomies with USEARCH (32). Reads that did not match an OTU were assigned to the category OTU_NA and treated like the other OTUs. File S1 provides a summary of read sequence counts for each sample's OTUs as classified.",

Twenty-nine spring/summer individuals and 26 winter individuals for whom sequencing was performed had concurrent winter or previous spring/summer blood azinphos-methyl detection by mass spectrometry as evidence of pesticide exposure. Each buccal sample's genus proportion was transformed by the centered log ratio, and the common genera (n = 22 genera, by spring/summer sample mean genus proportion of >0.005) were tested by the Wilcoxon rank sum test (34, 35) between the sample groups in which azinphos-methyl was detected and not detected.

Two of these (Streptococcus and Halomonas) maintained suggestive negative association significance (P values of \u223c0.01, FDR of \u223c0.14) in the following winter (Table 1, underlined). We observed winter values with the same direction but lower magnitude than the spring/summer collection values for Wilcoxon's location difference between groups showing reduced abundance in those with detected azinphos-methyl. This is not surprising, as of the 26 individuals in the winter azinphos-methyl detection group, only one (the nonfarmworker) had concurrent winter exposure measured in blood. This suggests a relaxation but persistence of the exposure effect into the winter. Mannheimia, Herminiimonas, Actinobacillus, Neisseria, and Prevotella appear also to be suggestively perturbed in the spring/summer azinphos-methyl group. Actinobacillus and Prevotella were suggestively (0.1 < FDR < 0.2) perturbed taxa that were decreased in the azinphos-methyl detection group, whereas the other three were increased in relative abundance. In Fig. 1 (spring/summer 2005) and Fig. 2 (winter 2006), each tested common taxon's mean proportional abundance in buccal samples by blood azinphos-methyl detection group is presented.",

This can be seen in the whisker bars for many genera which extend to the 10\u22126 extreme value. The lowest common population genus proportions measured that were nonzero in individual samples were \u223c10\u22125, two orders of magnitude below the mean proportion threshold and one order of magnitude above the zero order of the log scale. Two model assumptions were used in the application of the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum to hypothesis testing of the taxonomic proportion centered log ratios by azinphos-methyl detection groups: (i) we deeply sequenced samples with many reads, and (ii) only common population sample mean taxonomic proportion members were tested. These assumptions will mitigate the zero-inflation statistical effects that can occur in count-based proportional data at various depths sampled. As an example, Streptococcus was absent in three individuals (H161A, H153A, and H125A) with azinphos-methyl detected in the spring/summer collection with sequenced samples at the depths (2,695, 3,884, and 5,788 reads; Pr[missed at 0.005], 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22126, 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22129, and 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221213, respectively), whereas Streptococcus was detected in all individuals from the group with azinphos-methyl not detected. Two samples (H160A and H149A) from the winter collection with azinphos-methyl detected also had no Streptococcus detected in their buccal microbiota data. The depth of sequencing for these samples (84,158 and 30,611 reads, respectively) gave very low probabilities (\u223c10\u2212183 and 10\u221267, respectively) at the mean proportion threshold (0.005) that we missed Streptococcus in these individuals, suggesting that the true proportion is indeed very low in many of these exposed individuals. This analysis suggests that taxon proportions that are very low in some individuals and proportionally different between the exposure groups are likely due to a true difference in the composition of the microbiota community structure. Streptococcus is a taxonomically large common oral microbiota member. Some members of Streptococcus have been shown to be beneficial to oral health (i.e., S. salivarius, S. oligofermentans and S. mitis) while others have been implicated in oral disease (i.e., S. mutans, S. pneumoniae, S. sanguinis, S. sobrinus, S. gordonii, S. agalactiae, S. tigurinus, and S. anginosus) (41,\u201353). This split in the beneficence profile of Streptococcus causes a diversity of disease and positive health potentials for the observed effect when the compositionally abundant member Streptococcus is perturbed. Similarly, Haemophilus (54,\u201362) and other genera identified here common to the oral context (63) can have a diversity of disease and health profiles within any taxonomic level and can be contextually associated with different coinfections, plasmids, species, and strains (64). This makes drawing specific conclusions about the perturbed community member contributions to health difficult without specific information on health outcome in this agricultural context and additional investigations.",

                    "text": "We observed two clusters evident in both seasons. The less aggregated left cluster is visibly enriched for those individuals with detected azinphos-methyl in the blood (Fig. 3, top panels) and farmworker status (middle panels). A similar clustering pattern is also seen in the following winter 2006 buccal microbiomes (right panels), suggesting a persistence of the microbiome state induced by previous exposure. Azinphos-methyl was detected in only one nonfarmworker in the winter. If azinphos-methyl was detected in either season, the color in the plots for both seasons reflects this detection to track migration of pesticide-exposed subjects' microbiome types while those same individuals are azinphos-methyl nondetects in the winter. t tests of the PC1 scores for spring/summer and winter showed that the microbiome composition PC1 score was significant for azinphos-methyl detection in the left direction of PC1. The spring/summer mean azinphos-methyl group PC1 score was \u22122.8, versus 1.1 in the nondetect samples. In the winter projection, the azinphos-methyl group PC1 mean score was \u22121.6, while the nondetected samples had a PC1 mean score of 0.73. The spring/summer P value of 4 \u00d7 10\u22127 and winter P value of 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 show a persistent significant association between the buccal microbiome composition PC1 score and azinphos-methyl detection. The data points for the samples with lower blood concentration (<1 ng azinphos-methyl/g blood, the median) are colored orange to show that there is no simple evidence of a dose response within the exposed individuals. t test P values of >0.49 result from the comparison of PC1 values for high (red) and low (orange) azinphos-methyl concentrations in spring/summer and winter. The middle two panels of Fig. 3 show the farmworker-versus-nonfarmworker distribution in the OTU microbiota PCA. In the spring/summer, the t test of the PC1 scores for farmworker occupational status also showed that farmworkers had significantly lower mean microbiome PC1 scores (\u22121.01) than nonfarmworkers (1.16) (Welch's t test, P value of \u223c0.01). This farmworker occupational PC1 microbiome exposure was not persistent in the winter (P value of \u223c0.45). The bottom two panels present the mClust cluster call assignments using the spring/summer 2005 PC1 as input to Gaussian model-based cluster assignments (65). To train the model, the spring/summer 2005 PC1 data were used to determine a decision value of 0.72 based on the midpoint between the maximum PC1 value in the spring/summer left cluster and the minimum PC1 value in the right cluster. This midpoint (0.72) between clusters was then used to classify the winter 2006 buccal samples in the respective clusters based on the projection PC1 of winter OTUs through the spring/summer PC1 loadings. This allowed us to compare PC1 cluster memberships between seasons in the space defined by the spring/summer data. The left spring/summer and winter clusters are assumed as \u201cexposed\u201d based on the coclustering of samples in which azinphos-methyl was detected in blood. Categorical analysis of occupation status and cluster membership showed that the spring/summer 2005 buccal microbiomes' left exposed PC1 cluster contains 57 individuals (38 farmworkers and 19 nonfarmworkers) and the right, more tightly grouped cluster contained 44 individuals (16 farmworkers and 28 nonfarmworkers). The difference of cluster membership was significant by Fisher's exact test for occupational farmworkers status (P value of \u223c0.003; odds ratio, \u223c3.5, 95% CI, 1.4 to 8.7). When the 29 farmworkers and one nonfarmworker with both buccal microbiome data and detected azinphos-methyl concentrations in blood were compared with spring/summer buccal microbiome cluster membership, the left cluster, enriched with farmworkers, contained nearly all (27/30) of the individuals with spring/summer microbiome data with azinphos-methyl detected (including the one nonfarmworker with detection in the winter) and 30 individuals in whom none was detected. The right cluster contained almost exclusively individuals with nondetects of azinphos-methyl (41/44), except for three farmworkers with azinphos-methyl detected in blood. Those with detected levels of azinphos-methyl were significantly enriched in one of the two clusters from the spring/summer 2005 buccal collection (P value of \u223c6.5 \u00d7 10\u22126; odds ratio, \u223c12.0; 95% CI, 3.2 to 67). We refer to the left cluster enriched with farmworkers and containing the majority of individuals with azinphos-methyl detection as the \u201cexposed\u201d cluster and to the right cluster enriched with nonfarmworkers as the \u201cunexposed\u201d cluster. In winter 2006, 48 individuals (28 farmworkers and 20 nonfarmworkers) cluster in the left exposed PC cluster and 34 individuals (14 farmworkers and 20 nonfarmworkers) in the right unexposed cluster (Fisher's exact test P value of \u223c0.18; odds ratio, \u223c1.98; 95% CI, 0.74 to 5.4). Comparison of azinphos-methyl blood detection in any season to the winter 2006 microbiome PC clusters showed that azinphos-methyl detection in blood was still significantly enriched in the exposed cluster (Fisher's exact test P value of \u223c0.008; odds ratio, \u223c4.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 17.2), with 21 individuals having azinphos-methyl detected and 27 with none detected, compared to the unexposed cluster containing five individuals with azinphos-methyl detected and 29 with none detected.",

This would be expected, as azinphos-methyl is metabolized and excreted with a half-life clearance of \u223c30 h (66), making the temporal window in which one must capture an exposure important. We analyzed the persistence of cluster membership using the 70 individuals with both spring/summer 2005 and winter 2006 microbiome sequence data. The majority (94%, 66/70) of individuals sampled remained in their original cluster the following winter. The one nonfarmworker with azinphos-methyl detected in the winter of 2006 remained as an exposed cluster member in both seasons. This overall pattern suggests a persistence to the exposed microbiome state as detected by model-based PC1 clustering state. The two individuals who migrated from the exposed to the unexposed microbiome cluster were a farmworker and a nonfarmworker. The farmworker who changed from the exposed to the unexposed cluster had azinphos-methyl detected in blood in the spring/summer of 2005 but none detected in the winter. Among just the exposed spring/summer cluster individuals, the composition effect of the spring/summer azinphos-methyl-exposed cluster as measured by PC cluster membership at the later winter collection date had 95% (39/41) remaining in the exposed cluster for both seasons. This cluster membership concordance in combination with the extremely low bacterial taxon abundances measured for some exposed individuals suggests that these microbiomes have undergone extinctions of the affected microbiota with minor regrowth. The consequence of bacterial extinction with little regrowth has been shown in mice when gut recolonization is not facilitated by microbiome seeding (19). Two nonfarmworkers with no azinphos-methyl detected switched from unexposed to exposed microbiome PC clusters, suggesting exposure events since the last spring/summer's pesticide applications which we did not ascertain. We speculate that more of the individuals from the unexposed cluster would have been found to migrate to the exposed cluster if sample collections had continued to include a following spring/summer 2006 agricultural cycle, when pesticide spraying begins again. The nonfarmworkers' microbiomes that cluster with individuals with detected azinphos-methyl blood concentrations suggest that other, unobserved exposures have occurred throughout the spring/summer and fall and into winter, as observed in the one nonfarmworker with detected azinphos-methyl in the winter 2006 collection. We suspect that stochastic differences in exposure in the home and community environment, as well as differential geographic location, azinphos-methyl dose, and clearance duration, may explain the heterogeneous clustering of nonfarmworkers with farmworkers in the respective clusters. File S1 contains all reported sample microbiome PC coordinates, cluster membership calls, occupation categories, and azinphos-methyl concentrations.",

Vector group 2 includes taxa that are increased in individuals for whom we did not detect azinphos-methyl in the blood. The high-loading-rank OTUs in the spring/summer 2005 data are representatives of several genera also detected in the nonparametric analysis of the common genus composition in the azinphos-methyl blood detection group. These include the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Haemophilus and the suborder Micrococcineae. The Streptococcus OTUs are still present, but at lower abundance, in the exposed cluster and appear more in the top portion of the plot for vector group 1 (spring/summer). Streptococcus is the most increased in samples in the direction of vector group 2 (spring/summer) to the unexposed cluster. Neisseria is a common driver in the left exposed cluster direction of PC1. While not associated by the nonparametric analyses, it is possible that Neisseria is less susceptible to the exposure and, as the most common microbiota detected, is among the majority of the reads left when other taxa are not present in the compositional relative abundance. This leaves Neisseria as even more common in the exposed individuals. Neisseria is a large genus with many diverse members, many of which do not normally cause disease (67). The PC cluster discerning taxa is split as to which Fusobacterium OTUs are indicator taxa for the respective exposure clusters, reflective of the Wilcoxon test, where it is not significant (Table 1; Fig. 1 and \u200band2).2). OTUs in loading vector groups 1 and 3 are pointed in opposite directions of PC2 and not at the central mass in the left direction of PC1. This heterogeneity in PC2 OTU genera may be explained in part by complex relationships in the composition. The perturbed taxa may have lower abundance but are still present in some exposed individual subjects, as seen for Streptococcus in the nonparametric test. This PC2 heterogeneity may be interpreted as a less tractable community ecology and homeostatic dysbiotic state that would occur when a normal apex community member such as Streptococcus is depleted. This community perturbation would have effects on many members of the community that are reliant on amino acids from syntrophic metabolic niches (68) generated by Streptococcus. The winter exposed cluster projected from these spring/summer OTU loadings (Fig. 3) also shows this less aggregated \u201cdysbiotic\u201d pattern, where individuals are more heterogeneous in PC2 if they have a low score in PC1.",

This agricultural signal was measured in members of the Yakima Valley Hispanic community in Washington State by blood concentrations of the organophosphate insecticide azinphos-methyl and self-reported status as apple and pear orchard farmworkers. These exposed individuals have reduced abundances of several common oral indicator genera in this molecular epidemiology analysis of the buccal microbiota profile of agricultural pome fruit orchard workers and community members. The spring/summer 2005 sample collection timing targeted occupational farmworker and community exposures at times when seasonal agricultural applications of azinphos-methyl insecticide were known to occur. The microbiome PC cluster group membership of nonfarmworkers and farmworkers exposed to azinphos-methyl suggests that many individuals in the community may have unobserved exposures to pesticides which we did not capture in blood. We observed one such exposure in a nonfarmworker with blood azinphos-methyl detection from the winter 2006 collection season, when exposure is not likely based on the seasonal nature of pesticide applications. This underlines the need for data sets with fine temporal resolutions to discover modes of exposure for community pesticide exposures. Previously published household dust data from this same cohort suggest that azinphos-methyl exposures may occur via take-home pathways in cars and houses, where dry, stale air and low UV light conditions can allow environmental persistence (70).",

The earliest report (2013) that OPs such as azinphos-methyl may cause changes in the composition of a host microbiome were conducted with chlorpyrifos in an intestinal in vitro simulation reactor model and in vivo in the rat (77). Azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos, and other OPs are closely related compounds with the same covalent mechanism of primary toxicity, cholinesterase inactivation. The same authors showed that chronic chlorpyrifos exposure changes the gut permeability and permits translocation of bacteria across the rat intestine (78), and they quickly followed this in vivo rat model study with a perinatal exposure study in which they also showed that dysbiotic microbiota and exposure affected the intestinal development of the rat pups (79). Two other very recent articles show that other OPs cause changes in the gut microbiome. One of the OPs, trichlorfon, induced intestinal dysbiosis and reductions in many taxa at low doses in the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) (80). In another study, low-level dosing of mice with the organophosphate diazinon induced gut microbiota and metabolomic changes in both sexes (81). These orthogonal studies provide evidence to support our finding that human exposure to OPs is associated with the composition of the human buccal microbiome. These studies also found significant reductions in the abundances of Lactobacillus, the name-defining genus member of the order Lactobacillales, of which Streptococcus is also a common phylogeny member. We also found another common genus member of the order Lactobacillales, Granulicatella, to be significantly decreased in abundance (Table 1, spring/summer) (\u22120.89; 95% CI difference, \u22121.64 to 0; P value of \u223c0.026; FDR, \u223c0.08) and an indicator OTU in cluster analysis (Fig. 4). This suggests that the order Lactobacillales may in general be susceptible to organophosphate pesticide exposure. The in vivo rat studies reported recently (77,\u201379) also showed increased intestinal permeability, reductions in tight-junction gene expression, and increased translocation of bacteria to distal organs in chlorpyrifos-dosed animals. The in vitro digester microbiome gut model did not contain a membrane equivalent of the intestine or an immune system and showed differences in the bacterial composition of human feces used to inoculate the culture system upon organophosphate exposure to chlorpyrifos (77). These orthogonal findings suggest that at least two independent mechanisms of microbiome perturbation exist, host membrane permeability and direct microbial action. While our findings are limited to the oral-buccal body site, these other authors have found that similar OP-induced perturbations can affect the gut microbiome and gut-derived neurotransmitters that are systemically circulated. Gut metabolomic analysis of mice dosed with the OP diazinon indicates that there are changes in gut-derived neurotransmitters and amino acid metabolism products. These organophosphate microbiome-mediated neurotransmitters can affect both host behavioral phenotypes and the niches of other gut bacteria present (81). Future functional validations of antibiotic and other etiological properties by in vitro and in vivo methods could distinguish between the membrane permeability, immune and inflammatory responses, and potential for direct antimicrobial properties, as these other studies suggest. The systemic bacterial ecology and interaction with the human immune system and tight-junction tissue sites may contribute to the holistic compositional effect in the buccal context. In any of these cases, agricultural pesticide exposure is associated here with significant community composition changes in these Hispanic individuals' buccal microbiomes. The community ecology of organisms significantly dependent on Streptococcus will likely be affected, as it is the second most common oral member detected with significant reductions in abundance.",

The farmworkers were actively working in the recently azinphos-methyl-sprayed orchards, thinning the fruit and pruning, in the April to July 2005 spring/summer sample collection time, as shown by direct blood detection as the measure of exposure. The health impacts of these agricultural exposure-associated bacterial community structures and composition in the oral context and at other body sites (i.e., the gut, nasal passages, etc.) have not been investigated in this cohort to date. Hispanics have a disproportionate disease burden for many common diseases related to vasculature (i.e., diabetes and cardiovascular disease) (82,\u201390) that have also been shown to have microbiome-related disease variables in many other experimental contexts (91,\u2013104). Dental health, bacterial infection, and peripheral vascular disease have many independent associations (105), and some of the etiology could be affected by systemic loosening of tight junctions as induced by organophosphates (78). In many other contexts, environmental pollutants have been shown to affect the microbiome (106), and here we show in humans the association between the composition of the microbiome and agricultural pesticide exposure.",

When conducing total diversity measures that depend on the numbers of singletons, doubletons, and so on in the tail of the distribution, no proportional frequency cutoffs were employed. Whenever analyses required statistical comparisons between orthogonal detection groups (i.e., azinphos-methyl blood detection), OTUs were pooled by genera identified with the RDP classifier; genera identified at >0.5% mean proportional abundance in the spring/summer 2005 sample were used in subsequent analyses. PCA was performed using the R base function prcomp() with centered-log-ratio-transformed proportions via the R package \u201ccompositions\u201d (111). OTUs detected at >0.1% mean proportion of the spring/summer 2005 sample reads were included in the PCA. This PCA allowed an exploratory examination of the beta diversity differences between individuals within the cohort. Cluster analysis of the spring/summer PC1 scores was performed with the mclust() R package (65). PC loadings from the spring/summer data were used to project the winter OTU centered-log-ratio-transformed proportions into the spring/summer data space generating projected PC1 and PC2 scores and to assign cluster based on the spring/summer fit for the winter data. The base R implementations of statistical tests (Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon's rank sum test, and Welch's t test) were used where noted to identify enrichment of categorical variables.",
