The microbiota has a fundamental role in metabolism and in the development of the immune system.3, 4 The important contribution of a well-balanced intestinal microbiota in host defense against infections, e.g., by colonization resistance, is underscored by the high effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation as treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections and potentially other diseases, such as ulcerative colitis.5, 6",

Before, 1 day after antibiotics, and 6 weeks later, blood and feces were sampled (Figure 1a). Ethical approval was received from the Medical Ethics Committee, Academic Medical Center. All subjects gave written informed consent (Netherlands Trial Registry NTR3629). Prior to participation, healthy subjects underwent a medical screening, including medical history, physical examination, and hematological and biochemical screening. Participants did not smoke or use any medication. Subjects were excluded if they had used any kind of antibiotics within 1 year, if they had an abnormal bowel frequency (<3 bowel movements per week or >3 per day), or travel planned during the study period. Subjects did not use any nutritional supplements or probiotics and did not follow a vegetarian diet nor were they given dietary instructions.

In line, stimulation with Gram-negative K. pneumoniae and B. pseudomallei, but not Gram-positive S. pneumoniae or TLR2/5 agonists, resulted in a trend toward diminished IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 release (see Supplementary Figure S2 online). Isolated PBMCs stimulated with LPS showed a similar reduced capacity to release the early proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 2d\u2013f). These defects were restored 6 weeks after antibiotics.",

To our knowledge, this intervention study is the first to investigate the interplay between intestinal microbiota and the systemic innate immune system in healthy humans. Up to now, most human studies in the research field of microbiota and innate immune system are associative. The likelihood of microbiota disturbance has, for example, been positively correlated with the risk of subsequent severe sepsis in a cohort of 10,996 patients.20 Studies in critically ill patients are limited to descriptive cohort studies, mostly associating higher bacterial diversity with better outcome.21, 22, 23, 24",

Our results support some, but not all, of the postulated hypotheses. First, murine studies have suggested that granulopoiesis is an important aspect of microbiota-related protection from infection.8, 9, 12 We did not find any differences in neutrophil numbers in peripheral blood after antibiotic treatment, compared with before. Second, a difference in phagocytic or killing functions of neutrophils has been reported in antibiotic-treated mice.7 We tested the phagocytic capacities of neutrophils in whole blood but again did not find any differences. Finally, cytokine production has been reported to be affected by the microbial status of mice.8, 10 Our results corroborate these studies, as production of TNF-\u03b1 by mononuclear cells upon LPS stimulation was significantly lower after the antibiotic course. To a lesser extent, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production by whole blood upon Gram-negative stimulation was affected as well.",

Some of the reported experiments were performed in neonatal mice; the bone marrow of healthy adults may be much less sensitive to microbial signals than that of children. Also, redundancy in the innate immune system may compensate for any small deficit caused by microbiota disruption. Finally, humans are much more diverse than mice in their genetic makeup, environment, and microbiota, which could make it more difficult to detect any small changes in immune effector functions. Still, this study was designed to be as controlled as possible.",

First, it is not possible to associate the observed effects with specific antibiotics or bacterial taxa owing to the broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen, which was chosen to achieve the largest possible effect on the intestinal microbiota. Second, a 24-h antibiotic washout period was included to avoid direct effects of antibiotics present in blood on the performed tests. We cannot exclude that partial recovery of the microbiota and immune system has taken place during this interval. Furthermore, similar to most human microbiota studies, we have focused on bacteria only as they comprise the vast majority of the intestinal microbiota. Fungi, viruses, and archaea may, however, have a significant role when bacteria are eradicated by antibiotics. Finally, interindividual differences in microbiota composition may be an important factor, although numbers of genes for bacterial metabolic pathways are very similar among healthy people, even if those genes are coming from different kinds of bacteria.25 Still, it is important to keep in mind that these results may not translate to people with a different diet, sex, age, or genetic background\u2014or to patients, where comorbidities and medications come into play.",
