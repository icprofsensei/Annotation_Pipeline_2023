The MED algorithm is similar to the previously described oligotyping algorithm32 and differentiates taxa on the basis of single-nucleotide differences in the positions of highest entropy. The parameters used were minimum substantive abundance of a MED node (-M) = 7 and maximum variation allowed in each node (-V) = 4 nt. The total number of Streptococcus sequences analyzed was 564,342. Of these, 62,706 were removed as outliers due to the minimum substantive abundance parameter (-M, set to 60), and 8262 were removed as outliers due to the maximum variation at each node parameter (-V, set to 5). Thus, after the refinement, 493,374 were analyzed and classified into 370 MED nodes (oligotypes). Sequences representative of each oligotype were identified at species level by comparison with the Human Oral Microbiome database through the BLAST web tool, accessible at http://www.homd.org.",

Streptococcus salivarius proportions were significantly higher in the OFG only and CD only groups compared with HC (Fig. 4). The S. mitis group also showed significant differences among groups (Fig. 5), with healthy HC and OFG only having significantly higher relative abundances than CD only. In addition, the relative abundances of individual oligotypes whose mean relative abundance was over 0.5% were compared across the groups. Three S. salivarius oligotypes were found to show significant differences between groups (Fig. 6). Oligotype 2869 showed the largest differences with the OFG only, CD only, and OFG+CD groups all having significantly higher relative abundance than the HC group.",

This finding is in contrast to the results of numerous studies looking at the effect of CD on the composition of the intestinal microbiome.33 The fecal and mucosal microbiome is substantially altered in patients with CD. Richness is reduced,34, 35 and the phylum Firmicutes is relatively depleted, particularly anaerobes from the order Clostridiales, but there are raised proportions of Proteobacteria, mainly Enterobacteriaceae. The shift toward a less anaerobic bacterial community is thought to be the result of increased levels of reactive oxygen species produced as a part of the inflammatory response.34 Specific genus-level microbial signatures of CD have been reported to be reduced levels of Faecalibacterium, an unknown Peptostreptococcaceae, Anaerostipes, Methanobrevibacter, an unknown Christensenellaceae and Collinsella, and increased proportions of Fusobacterium and Escherichia.36",

The high number of comparisons performed in microbiome studies when OTU relative abundances are compared between patient groups can lead to spurious associations being revealed by chance, even when significance thresholds, as here, are corrected for multiple comparisons. Such associations should therefore be interpreted with caution. Of the 11 OTUs over-represented in particular subject groups, 7 were in the control group. This suggests that the major shift in OFG and CD was the relative loss of normal microbiota taxa. Another important consideration in interpreting OTU association analyses is whether the size of the effect is biologically significant. Many of the OTUs found to be differentially abundant were present at extremely low levels, and therefore, only those present at a relative abundance of greater than 1 % were considered further. Levels of H. parainfluenzae were reduced in all patient groups compared with controls. Haemophilus parainfluenzae is a commonly occurring member of the normal microbiota, and the significance of this finding is unclear. In contrast, proportions of oligotypes belonging to the S. salivarius group were found to be significantly raised in the OFG only and CD only groups. Streptococcus salivarius and related species are regarded as health-associated and are found primarily on the dorsum of the tongue and the pharyngeal mucosa.39, 40 Indeed, strains of S. salivarius are used as probiotics with beneficial properties against oral conditions such as halitosis and pharyngitis41 and have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in vitro via downregulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway.42 It is not clear why the proportions of these species should be raised in OFG and CD, but the diseases may change the oral mucosa in ways which promote the adherence and retention of these species. It is particularly interesting that 1 oligotype, 2869, was specifically elevated in subjects with OFG or CD. It is known that strains of a species can differ markedly in their biological and pathogenic properties, and it seems that members of this oligotype, found in multiple subjects, has a particular and numerically strong relationship with OFG. These findings are of particular interest as bacterial antigens, including streptococci, are a known common target for Immunoglobulin E (IgE). And previous studies have identified infiltrates of dendritic B cells in the oral epithelium OFG patients which express surface IgE.12 Future work should be focused on confirming the association of specific S. salivarius strains with OFG by metagenomic analyses that enable strain differentiation,43 together with the isolation of representatives of this oligotype and investigation of its properties of relevance to OFG.",

Further studies that can correlate these findings with host genetics, immune status, and metabolomics, and other risk factors could help to develop prediction tools to identify those OFG patients that are at greatest risk of developing intestinal CD, thereby opening up the possibility for early intervention. In addition, a better understanding of the interactions between microbial shifts, inflammation, and disease pathology would have the potential to lead to further targets for drug development and disease management strategies for this complex phenotype.",
