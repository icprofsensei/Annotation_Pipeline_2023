Here, we used 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and metagenomic sequencing to examine oral microbial compositions and their functional variations in children with halitosis. We found that the tongue coating of subjects with halitosis had greater bacterial richness than those of healthy subjects. The relative abundance and prevalence of Leptotrichia wadei and Peptostreptococcus stomatis were higher in tongue coating samples from children with halitosis than those from children without halitosis; Prevotella shahii had higher relative abundance and prevalence in saliva samples from children with halitosis. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of the co-occurrence networks of saliva and tongue coating communities under healthy and halitosis conditions, and investigated patterns of significant differences between these communities. Moreover, we observed that bacterial genes associated with responses to infectious diseases and terpenoid and polyketide metabolism were enriched in subjects with halitosis, but not in healthy subjects. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S)-related metabolic pathways suggested that there was higher microbial production and less usage of H2S in subjects with halitosis. Thus, the mechanism of halitosis was implied for the first time via metagenomic sequencing.",

This condition causes substantial personal discomfort and social limitations1. Studies indicate that 15\u201335% of adults2,3,4 and 14.5\u201340.9% of children5,6,7 worldwide suffer from halitosis. Owing to its high prevalence and negative social impact, halitosis has been ranked as the third most common reason for dental visits, after dental caries and periodontal disease8. Halitosis is a multifactorial condition; the factors involved vary according to the source of the malodour. Approximately 90% of halitosis cases are associated with intraoral conditions9, such as tongue coating, gingival and periodontal diseases, deep carious lesions, peri-implant diseases, exposed necrotic pulps or retention of food debris10,11. Extraoral halitosis is usually associated with respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal disorders or metabolic disorders8.",

VSCs in the oral cavity primarily comprise hydrogen sulphide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and dimethyl sulphide [(CH3)2S]12. Historically, microbiological studies of halitosis used culture-based methods to detect pathogens. Several anaerobic bacteria and spirochetes, including Bacteroides spp., Centipeda periodontii, Eubacterium spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Selenomonas artemidis, Treponema denticola, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella loescheii and Solobacterium moorei, have been identified as active producers of VSCs9,13,14,15,16. However, these and similar studies have excluded numerous as-yet-uncultured taxa owing to cultivation limitations. Now, because of the increased capabilities of next-generation sequencing (NGS)17 technology, studies of microbes in halitosis have shifted towards evaluating microbial communities that include uncultured taxa. For instance, Yang et al. used 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to identify links between the oral microbiome and halitosis18, thereby providing comprehensive insight into the micro-ecological changes associated with halitosis. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies of halitosis using NGS methods have focused mainly on adults. Surprisingly, little is known regarding the microbial communities that are associated with halitosis in children who have no other confounders; specifically, little is known about the gene compositions, functional significance and genetic variabilities of these microbial communities.",

We sampled from the dorsum of the tongue because it is known to retain large quantities of microorganisms, exfoliated cells and as a result of its large and papillary surface area, it is well regarded as a major source of VSCs. Saliva, as a representative of the overall oral microbial population, is also associated with halitosis; in consideration of its host-friendly sampling accessibility, it was also collected in this study. Because children rarely have periodontal disease or systemic diseases, they are good candidates for studying halitosis. This study aimed to increase our understanding of the impact of oral microbes on halitosis in children.",

The demographics and characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table S1. Tongue coating and saliva samples were collected from these 20 subjects and analysed using 454 pyrosequencing. One subject was excluded from the study (both tongue coating and saliva samples) owing to poor sequencing reads from his tongue coating sample. Thus, 38 samples remained. After processing with Mothur, we obtained a total of 394,697 final sequence reads with an average of 10,387 \u00b1 1,907 reads per sample (Table S2). The 38 samples included a total of 1,436 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity cut-off, with 66\u2013266 OTUs per sample.

Interestingly, two healthy samples (Fig. S5, blue squares marked with 4 and 5) fell within the halitosis cluster, indicating that these individuals may be at risk of halitosis.",

Nodes with more than 30 linkages (edges) were selected as hub nodes (Fig. 3). These correlations are divided into inter-group correlations (namely, correlations of OTUs between tongue coating and saliva), and intra-group correlations (namely, correlations of OTUs within tongue coating samples and of OTUs within saliva samples). Twenty-five saliva nodes together with only 2 tongue coating nodes were found in the healthy inter-group module; all of the correlations were positive (Fig. 3A). The two tongue coating nodes were both from the Capnocytophaga genus. Using the same method, twenty-three tongue coating nodes and 4 saliva nodes were found with 39 positive and 21 negative correlations in the halitosis inter-group module (Fig. 3B). Most of the halitosis hub tongue coating nodes were from the genera Actinomyces, Capnocytophaga, Leptotrichia, Fusobacterium and Prevotella, which have been previously associated with halitosis14,15,18,21,22,23. The characteristics of the hub nodes are shown in Table S4. The same patterns could be found in intra-group modules as well (Fig. 3C,D). These results suggested distinct patterns in the correlations of saliva and tongue coating communities under healthy and halitosis conditions.",

We defined genes with relative abundance differences of >2-fold as differentially abundant genes. Previous studies have indicated that bacteria produce H2S in two ways: reduction of sulphate and desulphydration of cysteine and methionine25. Sulphate reduction is mediated by the enzymes encoded by the cysNC, cysN, cysD, cysC, cysH, cysJ, cysI, aprA and sir genes. Of these, cysC was more abundant in the halitosis tongue coating samples, whereas sir was less abundant in the halitosis saliva samples; no variations in the other genes were detected (Fig. 6, Table S8). The desulphydration process includes (1) reverse transsulphuration pathway activation via cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (encoded by cbs), cystathionine \u03b3-lyase and homocysteine desulphydrase (encoded by mccB), which converts homocysteine (an essential intermediate in methionine oxidation and cysteine synthesis) into cystathionine, cysteine, pyruvate, ammonia, and H2S; and (2) cysteine transamination by aminotransferases (encoded by aspB, aspC, and yhdR) to yield 3-mercaptopyruvate, which is further metabolized by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase (encoded by sseA) and thiosulphate sulphurtransferase (encoded by sseA and glpE) to release sulphur26,27. Our study showed that cbs, aspB, yhdR, sseA and glpE were more abundant in the halitosis groups. Additionally, cysM, which encodes cysteine synthase B and catalyses the H2S-to-cysteine conversion in prokaryotes, was less abundant in the halitosis samples (Fig. 6, Table S8). This might result in higher H2S levels in the oral cavity compared with healthy subjects. To further clarify the bacterial contribution to the functional variations, we searched NCBI Bacterial Gene Database by using gene names (e.g., cysC) and their descriptions (e.g., adenylylsulfate kinase), and then computed the intersection part with the Kraken taxonomic profile. The candidate species are shown in the Table S9.",

The oral cavity is one of the most important and complicated habitats in our body and supports diverse microbial communities which could be related to oral health or diseases. Previous evidences have shown that microbiome differences are often seen at the disease sites, for example, supragingival plaque for caries20 and subgingival plaque for periodontitis29. In studies on halitosis, tongue coating has been widely used, while saliva is also used when researchers focus on epidemiological characteristics in their studies20,30. In this research, our data on richness showed that differences were visible in tongue coating but not saliva (Fig. 1), which is consistent with the above view. Indeed, the presence of deep fissures in the tongue provides an environment with low oxygen levels, i.e., a relatively anaerobic niche, making halitosis-associated pathogens more likely to colonise.",

For example, S. moorei is a Gram-positive bacterium that can convert cysteine into hydrogen sulphide32; it has been previously recognized as a pathogenic bacterium15,16,31. S. moorei (OTU30) was significantly more abundant in the halitosis samples compared to healthy samples (Fig. 2A,C), indicating an association with halitosis. Takeshita et al. found increased abundances of Leptotrichia in persons with oral malodour33, and Yang et al. reported that L. wadei was positively correlated with H2S concentrations18. Notably, we detected L. wadei (OTU398) in all of the halitosis tongue-coating samples but in only 10% of the healthy samples (Fig. 2B). This bacterium also showed a higher relative abundance in halitosis tongue coating samples (Fig. 2A). Thus, we inferred that L. wadei may be involved in halitosis. Persson et al. reported that periodontitis pathogens, such as Po. gingivalis, Pr. intermedia, T. forsythensis, F. nucleatum and Tr. denticola, have the capacity to produce VSCs in vitro14. These pathogens have also been recognized to have a positive correlation with oral malodour in vivo22,34,35. However, we found no differences in the abundances of any of these periodontitis pathogens between the healthy and halitosis groups. There are many possible reasons for this inconsistency. First, our study focused on preschool-aged children, whereas most other studies have focused on adults. Children rarely have periodontal diseases or systemic diseases and are all nonsmokers, thereby providing favourable conditions for a better understanding of halitosis-associated microbiota. Ling et al. reported that the diversity of the salivary microbiota in children was greater than in adults, indicating that oral cavity bacterial flora are dynamic and change during life20,36. Moreover, the prevalence of halitosis differs among races owing to diet, environment and host genetics16. Second, most previous studies have utilized culture-dependent methods or focused on only a small panel of anaerobic bacteria. However, approximately 600 bacterial species are present in the oral cavity, 35% of which cannot be cultivated at present37. In contrast to these conventional methods, we used 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, a culture-independent method that can provide a broad view of the oral microbiota. Finally, in contrast to most previous studies, we used a gas chromatograph to test for halitosis. Although this method is time-consuming and complicated, it can distinguish among the 3 common sulphur compounds associated with halitosis and thus is suitable for a research environment38.",

We identified healthy and halitosis-associated modules of hub OTUs (Fig. 3). Twenty-five saliva nodes in inter-group correlations (twenty-six saliva nodes in intra-group correlations) and only 2 tongue coating nodes were identified as hub taxa in the healthy module, suggesting that saliva plays a more important role than tongue coating in maintaining microbial balance under healthy conditions (Fig. 3A,C). By contrast, this balance was disrupted in the halitosis module. Negative correlations were detected, which indicates that opposing relationships or colonization resistance may exist between species (Fig. 3B,D)40. The number of tongue coating hub nodes turned out to far exceed the number of saliva nodes. These changes between healthy and halitosis modules suggest that community interactions display different patterns in healthy and halitosis subjects. Furthermore, the predominant hub OTUs switched from saliva to tongue coating, indicating a role reversal.",

                    "text": "Despite inter-individual variability, we detected several OTUs that were present in most of the tongue coating samples (Fig. 7). We defined these OTUs as the \u201ccore microbiome\u201d of tongue coatings, thus representing the normal flora of this oral site (Fig. 7, green-coloured shape). Most of the species within the core microbiome of the tongue coating biofilm were Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. These species are the most adaptable to the tongue coating environment. Similar definitions of core microbiomes in the healthy (TH) and halitosis (TD) tongue coatings were also determined (Fig. 7, blue and orange shapes). Within the TD core microbiome, L. wadei (OTU398), P. stomatis (OTU135) and P. shahii (OTU283) were candidate halitosis pathogens, as discussed above (Fig. 2A,B). Taxonomic analysis was also performed with the metagenomic sequencing data using a relatively new method called \u201cKraken\u201d, which is an ultrafast and highly accurate program for assigning taxonomic labels41. The metagenomic taxa were then compared with the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD)37,42 at the genus and species levels, as HOMD is considered a powerful oral microbiome reference and contains more than 600 prokaryote species. We identified 605 genera and 1,274 species, including more than 196 genera and 708 species in HOMD. The number of species we identified is consistent with Jenkinson\u2019s view that the estimated species number might turn out to be higher (~1200) than that in the database43. Therefore, metagenomic sequencing helps identify a microbiota that is broader than the current database.",

Therefore, we mainly focused on H2S in the present study. We attempted to identify candidate halitosis pathogens using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing; however, the most differentially abundant OTUs lacked evidence of H2S production in vitro (Fig. 2). We thus inferred that the pathogenesis of halitosis might be due to cooperative poly-microbial interactions rather than the effect of a single pathogen. Belda-Ferre et al. first used metagenomic approach in oral samples45, which could provide a convenient method for comprehensively studying poly-microbial interactions with functional information. By analysing the H2S metabolic process in the metagenomic data, we revealed functional differences between the halitosis and healthy microbiomes. As expected, there were significant increases in the abundances of the cbs, aspB, yhdR, sseA and glpE genes, which are involved in the reverse transsulphuration pathway and in the cysteine transamination pathway, which converts amino acids into H2S26,27. This result is consistent with previous studies showing that microbial degradation of methionine and cysteine in the oral cavity is the main cause of halitosis8,46. Moreover, the reduced abundance of cysM in our study might represent reduced conversion of H2S during cysteine metabolism in prokaryotes, resulting in lower usage of H2S. The higher production and lower use could contribute to excessive H2S concentrations and, hence, halitosis. In our study, few differences were found in most of the VSC pathway genes. Some of these genes might be present at equal frequencies but differentially expressed; metatranscriptomics are required to identify such differences.",

DEGexp was used here because it could correct inexact relative abundance ratios caused by samples with very low abundance. Genes with relative abundance differences of >5-fold and with P-values\u2009<\u20090.001 in the DEGexp results were functionally annotated using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) bioinformatics database (8th KEGG release, December 2014)57 and the eggNOG 4.0 database58. Functional categories and genes in KEGG/eggNOG were counted. Differential genes were subjected to KEGG Ontology (KO) enrichment analysis, and enriched P-values were calculated according to the hypergeometric test (P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant). Furthermore, genes that mapped to the sulphur metabolic pathway and to the cysteine and methionine metabolic pathway were analysed. Hydrogen sulphide-related genes were used to construct an H2S metabolic map. We defined genes with relative abundance ratios of >2 as differentially abundant genes in the H2S metabolic analysis. To determine taxonomic origins of these genes, we searched the NCBI Bacterial Gene Database by using gene names and gene descriptions, followed by computing the intersection with the Kraken taxonomic profile.",
