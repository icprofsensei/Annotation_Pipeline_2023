Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) account for approximately 85% of the viruses causing severe bronchiolitis [2]. Although different viruses cause bronchiolitis, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that clinicians not test children with bronchiolitis for viruses, since treatment does not vary by viral etiology [3]. Furthermore, owing to the lack of clinical trials demonstrating a consistently beneficial responses to pharmacotherapy, the 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline discusses bronchiolitis as a single, relatively homogenous entity [4, 5].",

Furthermore, compared with children with RSV bronchiolitis, children with RV bronchiolitis have a shorter hospital length of stay [2], are significantly more likely to be treated with systemic corticosteroids [7], and have an increased risk of childhood asthma [7, 8]. Although indicative of heterogeneity, these associations between viral etiology and outcomes do not provide insight into the underlying pathobiology of bronchiolitis, which involves complex interplay between the virus, microbiome, and host. Thus, we hypothesized that RSV and RV infections would be associated with underlying metabolic differences, as manifested by differences in the airway microbiome and metabolome. To test this hypothesis, we used metabolomic and metagenomic approaches to investigate nasopharyngeal aspirates from infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. This integrated multi-omic approach examined molecular differences between RSV and RV pathobiology while accounting for both microbial and host factors.",

Bronchiolitis was defined on the basis of the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, as follows: acute respiratory illness with some combination of rhinitis, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, crackles, and retractions [3]. To make the timing of sample collection more synchronous, we excluded infants with previous enrollment, those who were transferred to a participating hospital >24 hours after the original hospitalization, and those for whom consent to participate was provided >24 hours after hospitalization. We also excluded those with known heart-lung disease, immunodeficiency, immunosuppression, or gestational age of <32 weeks. All patients were treated at the discretion of the treating physician.

Significant metabolites were determined using the 2-tailed Welch t test, with the false-discovery rate (FDR) algorithm used to adjust for multiple comparisons [17]. Linear regression models adjusted for 7 potential confounding variables (ie, age, sex, preterm birth, use of antibiotics, use of systemic corticosteroid therapy before hospitalization, positive pressure ventilation [PPV], and hospital site) and were corrected with the FDR algorithm. MixOmics [18] was implemented in R, version 3.3 [19], based on sparse partial least squares regression analysis, and was performed in canonical mode with LASSO penalization.

Since the use of PPV was significantly greater in infants with RSV-only infection and may influence the metabolites (Table 1), we removed the infants who underwent PPV from the analysis and still found significant differences in the metabolomic profiles between infants with RSV-only infection and those with RV-only infection (P < .001). Metabolites associated with RSV-only infection were from a range of superpathways, including carbohydrate metabolism (N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylgalactosamine), lipid metabolism (mevalonolactone), amino acid metabolism (5-oxoproline), and energy metabolism (2-methylcitrate-homocitrate; Figure 1B). By contrast, metabolites associated with RV-only infection consisted primarily of N-acetyl metabolites from the amino acid superpathway, specifically, N-acetylthreonine, N-acetylleucine, N-acetylisokeucine, N-acetylphenyalanine, N-acetylvaline, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetyltyrosine, and N-acetyllysine (Figure 1B).",

In other words, not only were the metabolites different on the basis of infecting virus, but also the amount of virus correlated with increased metabolite intensity. Of the samples with detectable virus, the median viral load Ct was 23.0 (interquartile range, 21.5\u201326.4) for RSV and 26.4 (interquartile range, 24.6\u201328.1) for RV.",

Among infants with RSV-only infection, S. pneumoniae relative abundance was associated with driving the functional shift in all 9 pathways. By contrast, Moraxella catarrhalis was associated with driving 4 of 9 pathways and reducing the remaining 5 pathways. Among infants with RV-only infection, H. influenzae was associated with driving all 9 pathways, and Prevotella melaninogenica was associated with reducing all 9 pathways. Findings of the more granular module-level analysis were comparable to those of the broader pathway-level analysis, except that energy metabolism modules were reduced by S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis in RSV-only bronchiolitis and by H. influenzae in RV-only bronchiolitis (Supplementary Figure 1).

As the adonis function is based on sequential sum of squared deviations from a centroid, the order of the factors (ie, whether the virus was entered first or second in the model) was tested using both permutations. The virus (RSV only or RV only) was statistically significant when entered as the first factor (P = .04) but not when entered as the second factor (P = .14). Similarly, the bacterial species (dominance by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or a mixed community) was statistically significant when entered as the first factor (P = .049) but not when entered as the second factor (P = .10). These results suggest that both the viral etiology and the bacterial species are associated with the metabolomic profiles and that both are relevant in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.",

None of the 31 metabolites that significantly differed between infants with RSV-only infection and those with RV-only infection were bacterially derived (Table 2).

Infants with RSV-only bronchiolitis had significantly increased metabolites from a range of pathways, whereas infants with RV-only bronchiolitis had increased N-acetyl amino acids. Moreover, a higher viral genomic load positively correlated with a higher intensity of the metabolites associated with RSV and RV infections. RSV and RV co-occurred with bacterial species (eg, RSV with S. pneumoniae and RV with H. influenzae), and the associated metagenomes significantly differed between RSV-only and RV-only infections. Thus, these data are the first to demonstrate that RSV and RV are associated with different metabolic pathways and that the associated bacterial functional capacity is derived primarily from S. pneumoniae in RSV bronchiolitis and from H. influenzae in RV bronchiolitis.",

The present results provide the first multi-omic comparison demonstrating pathobiological differences between RSV and RV bronchiolitis. Higher genomic load of RSV and RV was positively correlated with a higher intensity of the metabolites that distinguished RSV infection from RV infection. This finding is intriguing because of the association between higher RSV genomic load and increased severity of illness [26], but the same association has not been found in RV infection [27]. While the relevance of genomic viral load requires additional validation owing to the epidemiological and now pathobiological differences between RSV and RV, future clinical trials for infants with bronchiolitis should consider stratifying infants on the basis of viral etiology.",

H. influenzae, which co-occurred with RV, was also associated with these metabolites. N\u03b1-acetylation is the process of irreversibly transferring an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the \u03b1-amino group of an amino acid [28]. It is among the most abundant cotranslational and posttranslational protein modifications in eukaryotes but is less common in bacteria [29]. The functional implication of acetylation in RV bronchiolitis remains unclear. Notably, in asthma, there is an increase in histone acetyltransferase activity that is treatable with corticosteroids [30]. The association, although speculative, between RV wheezing illnesses during early childhood and an increased risk of asthma among school-aged children [31\u201333] may be explained in part by the altered host amino acid metabolism in RV bronchiolitis seen in the present results.",

The KEGG orthologs from H. influenzae were associated with the generation of essential amino acids, but neither S. pneumoniae nor other microbes correlated with the generation of amino acids. Indeed, S. pneumoniae cannot synthesize amino acids [35], producing peptidases and proteases and using cell wall transporters to uptake amino acids [36]. Therefore, in addition to dietary intake, H. influenzae provides access to essential amino acids, which may have contributed to the observed increase in RV-associated N-acetyl metabolites. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were responsible for the same bacterial metabolic pathway functions in RSV and RV infections, respectively. Additionally, we found cases of S. pneumoniae driving and S. mitis reducing the same modules, suggesting important effects of different species within the same genera [20]. Taken together, these results suggest that the viruses and bacteria both have important influences on the metabolomic profiles, as supported by the adonis results. Thus, future bronchiolitis studies may need to account for both viral and bacterial communities, and clinicians may need to begin thinking of \u201cviral\u201d bronchiolitis as being due to a complex interplay among the infecting virus, microbiome, and host response.",

                    "text": "The current study has several potential limitations. First, bronchiolitis is mostly a disease of the lower airways, and while nasopharyngeal samples may not provide a reliable representation of the lung microbiome [42], they are more easily obtained than lower airway samples [43]. Additionally, nasopharyngeal samples have further technical and ethical justification [43]. Second, the cross-sectional study design prevented temporal monitoring of viral and bacterial abundance and function; thus, subsequent studies would benefit from longitudinal sampling, including, ideally, the collection of samples prior to hospitalization and samples from noninfectious control infants. Third, antibiotic data were limited to use prior to enrollment, but neither the exact antibiotic used nor the duration of administration was analyzed. However, there were no significant differences in antibiotic use prior to enrollment between infants with RSV-only infection and those with RV-only infection, as shown in Table 1 (P = .75). Fourth, significant financial expense of the techniques used limited the number of samples that could be analyzed. Thus, the present results require validation not only in the full MARC-35 cohort, but also in an independent cohort. Indeed, such temporal and validation analyses would be necessary for biomarker identification. Finally, from an analytic standpoint, not all significant metabolites are present in the KEGG metabolic network model, meaning that MIMOSA would be unable to analyze them. Thus, it is possible that some metabolites considered to be host derived are products of novel microbial metabolism. Notwithstanding these limitations, the current study provides novel evidence to support the emerging hypothesis that RSV and RV induce bronchiolitis through distinct metabolic pathways.",

Although replication of our findings is needed, these data demonstrate the underlying heterogeneity of bronchiolitis by showing that RSV and RV are associated with different metabolic pathways and that both the virus and the co-occurring bacterial species play a role in the host metabolism. Bronchiolitis is also currently considered a viral condition, but these data provide further evidence that bronchiolitis involves a complex interplay among virus, microbiome, and host. Indeed, these results not only challenge long-standing ideas about bronchiolitis, but also, given the lack of effective pharmacotherapies for this very common condition [3\u20135], have important implications for the future development of novel treatments.",
