However, the rate of progression varies among individuals and is difficult to predict [1]. The evolving knowledge about the pathogenesis of this disease suggests that environmental factors cause repetitive injury to the alveolar epithelium followed by an abnormal repair process and scarring. The presence of comorbid conditions, such as emphysema and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, may impact the lower airway microbiome and negatively affect prognosis in IPF [2\u20136]. With the increasing investigation of the lower airway microbiome using culture-independent techniques, observational studies have shown that in IPF there is increased bacterial burden and taxonomic differences [7, 8].

Lung transplantation prolongs survival in patients with IPF but this option is limited primarily by the supply of donor organs. Post-transplant survival is poor in IPF when compared with other chronic lung diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis). Pirfenidone (an anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory medication) and nintedanib (an oxindole derivative that inhibits signalling from platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor) have been shown to slow the decline in forced vital capacity [1]. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 is an endogenously produced T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine with anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic functions [9]. Although exogenous IFN-\u03b3 was shown to be effective in vitro and in animal models of IPF [10\u201312], two randomised placebo controlled trials using subcutaneous IFN-\u03b3 [9, 13] failed to demonstrate its therapeutic benefit in IPF patients. Inhaled IFN-\u03b3 may be more effective than parenteral IFN-\u03b3 [14]. We have conducted a phase II trial in subjects with IPF, and demonstrated that inhaled IFN-\u03b3 can be safely delivered to lung parenchyma and that pulmonary function remained stable throughout the trial [15]. Using bronchoscopic samples obtained longitudinally in this pilot study, we explored possible mechanisms by which the lower airway microbiota interacts with the host. We evaluated associations between the lung microbiome and the local/systemic host immune phenotype during a clinical trial with aerosolised IFN-\u03b3 in IPF patients.",

Paired statistics (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used for pre\u2013post comparison of continuous covariates. For tests of association with continuous variables, we used nonparametric Spearman correlation tests. These tests were performed in R utilising the Hmisc package (https://cran.r-project.org).

Taxonomic features with an LDA score >2.0 were represented as a cladogram, as produced by LEfSe with default parameters. To adjust for statistically spurious associations, from compositional artefacts, multicollinearity and repeated measures design, we used the compPLS framework, outlined in Ramanan\net al.

Technical negative controls yielded fewer reads (2959 (1628\u20134291); p<0.001)). The three most abundant operational taxonomic units detected in sequences of technical negative controls were: Chitinophagaceae_550392, Betaproteobacteria_247441 and Nocardioidaceae_1088254 (relative abundance 12.3% (6.1\u201318.5%), 12.3% (5.1\u201318.4%) and 11.9% (5.9\u201317.9%), respectively). None of these three taxa were found at >0.01% in any given BAL sample. Figure 1 shows cluster analysis based on the most abundant taxa (>5% in any given sample) for all BAL samples. Consistent with prior observations, samples clustered in two groups: one enriched with genera commonly found in the upper airways, such as Prevotella, Streptococcus, Veillonella and Fusobacterium, and a second enriched with genera commonly described as background taxa (Pseudomonas, Acidocella and Flavobacterium) [21, 22]. To examine the effects of IFN treatment on the lung microbiome we evaluated changes in \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity. Figure 2a and b shows no significant difference in \u03b1 or \u03b2 diversity between BAL samples at baseline and post IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Evaluation of UniFrac distances within each subject (before versus after IFN-\u03b3 treatment) and between different subjects shows a nonsignificant trend to a greater degree of similarity within subjects (figure 2c). However, a wide range of distances was noted within different subjects. This suggests that while in some subjects their lower airway microbiome remained resilient, in other subjects the microbiome underwent multiple changes in taxonomic composition. We then used LEfSe to evaluate taxonomic changes post IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Figure 2d shows a cladogram demonstrating very few significant taxonomic changes. Specifically, when compared with baseline, one genus annotated to the order Actinomycetales was enriched post IFN-\u03b3 treatment, while only two genera annotated to the family Lachnospiraceae and order MIZ46 were decreased post IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Notably, these changes occurred in genera with low relative abundance (<1%).",

Supplementary table S1 shows biomarker levels in BALF, BAL cell ex vivo biomarker production, and levels in plasma at baseline and post IFN-\u03b3 treatment.

Ex vivo BAL cell production of eotaxin, FGF-2, IFN-\u03b12 and VEGF decreased, while there was a nonsignificant trend for a decreased production of IL-8, TNF-\u03b2 and PGDF-AA.

We found fewer significant taxa\u2013biomarker correlations among plasma biomarkers compared with BALF or BAL cell supernatant biomarkers. This suggests that the mucosal inflammatory phenotype is more tightly correlated with lower airway taxa than the systemic inflammatory phenotype. Most of the significant positive correlations occurred between biomarkers and taxa commonly considered upper airway commensals, such as Prevotella, Veillonella, Rothia and Streptococcus. Post IFN-\u03b3 treatment, a different set of taxa were significantly correlated with levels of biomarkers (supplementary figure S2).

Figure 3 shows that upper airway taxa were positively correlated with different biomarkers from each of these immunological profiles both at the local level (BALF and BAL cell supernatant) and the systemic level (plasma). For example, in BAL, Porphyromonas, an oral commensal, was positively correlated with levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, two cytokines important for Th17 differentiation, and TNF-\u03b2, a cytokine characteristic of Th1 pathways. Dialister, another oral commensal, was positively correlated with levels of IL-4, IL-9 and IL-10, typical Th2 cytokines, as well as with IL-2 and TNF-\u03b2, cytokines involved in Th1-mediated inflammation. Other cytokines with important roles previously described in IPF, such as MCP-1, IL-17, PDGF-AB-AA, were also correlated with taxa in BAL. For example, PDGF activates fibroblasts while IL-17 interacts with TGF-\u03b2 in pulmonary fibrosis [23]. Supplementary table S2 shows a summary of taxa associated with these predefined immunological profiles (Th1, Th2, Th17 and IPF). The most abundant taxa identified were oral commensals, such as Prevotella, Parvimonas, Rothia and Porphyromonas. Taken together, the data support the interaction of oral commensals present in the lower airway with the host immune response.",

The balance between the expression of Th1 and Th2 cytokines is an important determinant of disease progression in the inflammatory phase of pulmonary fibrosis [24]. Th1 biomarkers, such as IFN-\u03b3, have been shown to ameliorate the degree of fibrosis in a bleomycin murine model, promoting its consideration as potential treatment in this disease [25]. However, Th2 biomarkers, such as, IL-5, have also been shown to potentiate fibrosis [26]. In our study, the IL-5 levels decreased in BAL cell supernatants as did some pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic biomarkers, such as IL-13, IL-17 and PDGF-AA. Interestingly, PDGF is a required element in fibroblast cellular division [23]. Activation of IL-6 is associated with fibroblast proliferation. In our study, BAL and supernatant levels of IL-6 were decreased after treatment with aerosolised IFN-\u03b3. Inhibition of IL-6 has been associated with decreased pulmonary fibrosis in mouse models [27]. In contrast, no significant decreases in the levels of IL-13, IL-17, PDGF-AA and IL-6 were noted in systemic circulation from our subjects. These data suggest that inhaled IFN-\u03b3 can alter multiple immunological and tissue repair pathways in the lower airway mucosa.",

                    "text": "With recent advances in culture-independent techniques, there has been an increased awareness of the role of the lower airway microbiota in the host's immune response in multiple disease states [28]. In IPF, it is postulated that chronic microbial colonisation in the lower respiratory tract may contribute to the alveolar epithelial injury potentiating disease progression [29]. Microbes have been suspected of playing a role in the repetitive alveolar epithelial injury and aberrant wound healing that leads to the fibrotic process characteristic of IPF. Thus, recent studies have begun to look at the potential role of bacterial pathogens in the development of fibrotic lung disease. Prior comparisons of BAL samples from subjects with IPF compared with subjects with normal lungs and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) showed that in IPF there is an increase in bacterial burden in the lower airways [7]. Furthermore, there is a direct correlation between this lower airway bacterial burden and the decline in lung function. In a large multicentre trial, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus were associated with progression of disease in IPF [8]. In a double-blind randomised placebo controlled trial, cotrimoxazole was given to patients with IPF twice daily for a period of 12\u2005months, leading to improvement in quality of life scoring and decreased mortality [29]. In our study, the diversity of the lower airway microbiota of patients with IPF did not significantly change during treatment with aerosolised IFN-\u03b3. However, taxonomic composition of the lower airway microbiota was significantly associated with multiple immunological pathways that may play a role in the lung parenchymal injury/repair process in IPF. In healthy smokers, we have shown that a lower airway microbiome enriched with taxa commonly found in the upper airways is associated with a distinct immune profile characterised by a Th17 phenotype and a blunted Toll-like receptor 4 response [16]. We have also noted that this distinct lung microbiome (pneumotypeSPT for \u201csupraglottic predominant taxa\u201d) is associated with a distinct genomic potential and metabolomic profile. In line with our prior investigations, we show that in IPF, taxa commonly characterised as oral commensals are present in the lower airways and are associated with pre-specified immunological profiles (Th1, Th2, Th17 and IPF). Furthermore, a recent investigation showed that a disrupted lower airway microbiota was associated with host transcriptome differences and this association remained significant during longitudinal follow-up [30]. Although the causative nature of this association is beyond the scope of our study, data suggest that the lung microbiota may represent an important environmental factor in the pathogenesis of this disease by either promoting lung injury or altering the repair process of the injured lung tissue. The exact mechanism for this association still needs to be elucidated with a focus on microbial metabolites and host\u2013microbe interactions. In subjects with early COPD, we have shown that microbial metabolism is a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic target [31], raising the possibility that it may also be a potential therapeutic target to prevent further lung tissue damage in IPF.",

Conversely, in a similar clinical setting, HRCT has been found to have a 90% positive predictive value for the histopathological diagnosis of UIP [32]. Although we followed patients for a minimum of 80\u2005weeks, the sample size is small with only 10 patients enrolled. However, this was a pilot study primarily designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of treatment with inhaled IFN-\u03b3 that required two bronchoscopies. There are few longitudinal studies that have evaluated the lower airway microbiota and none that we are aware of in IPF. Future studies will require a larger cohort and the use of noninvasive methods to evaluate the lower airway microbiota and biomarkers. Additionally, since we lack a placebo control group, the observed changes in microbiome and biomarkers need to be interpreted with caution. Sampling with bronchoscopy was restricted to only one site and spatial variation (especially since IPF preferentially affects the lower lung parenchyma) could not be investigated [33]. We could not assess the upper airway microbiota as we did not concomitantly collect oral samples. Thus, we cannot control for cross-contamination with oral secretions. Although contamination with oropharyngeal microbiota can occur during bronchoscopy, recent data suggest that sampling artefacts of the lower airway microbial surveys are relatively minor [21, 33\u201335]. In this investigation, we utilised acellular BAL to characterise the lower airway microbiota. Therefore, it is possible that cell-associated microbes are underrepresented [36], further affecting the degree of background enrichment due to decreased of lower airway bacterial load. Moreover, although we included technical controls in sequencing runs, BAL samples were obtained prior to adapting our protocol for sampling bronchoscopic environmental controls, which may also be important for microbiome studies with low biomass samples [22, 37].",
