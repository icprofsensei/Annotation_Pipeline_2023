Several sample types have been used to investigate the lung microbiota, each presenting specific challenges for preparation and analysis of microbial communities. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) enables the identification of microbiota specific to the lower lung but commonly has low bacterial density, increasing the risk of false-positive signal from contaminating DNA. The objectives of this study were to investigate the extent of contamination across a range of sample densities representative of BALF and identify features of contaminants that facilitate their removal from sequence data and aid in the interpretation of BALF sample 16S sequencing data.",

Sequencing accuracy, precision, and the relative abundance of mock community members decreased with sample input density, with a significant drop-off below 8E+\u200905 16S copies/ml. Contaminant OTUs were commonly inversely correlated with sample input density or not reproduced between technical replicates. Removal of taxa with these features or physical concentration of samples prior to sequencing improved both sequencing accuracy and precision for samples between 8E+\u200904 and 8E+\u200906 16S copies/ml. For the lowest densities, below 8E+\u200903 16S copies/ml BALF, accuracy and precision could not be significantly improved using these approaches.

Complex microbial communities with specific exposure/disease associations have been identified in the lungs, even in individuals where the lung was previously considered to be sterile [6\u201310]. Importantly, much of what we understand of the microbiota in lung diseases is derived from populations with relatively high bacterial burden, such as those with infections or suppurative lung diseases including cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. The total biomass observed in samples from individuals with suppurative lung diseases is generally high, with low bacterial diversity and domination by a single taxon in a significant proportion of individuals [11, 12]. Less extensively studied samples collected from individuals with non-suppurative lung diseases can have much lower bacterial biomass but higher relative diversity [13].",

The likelihood that an OTU represented a true positive varied by OTU and by input density. Burkholderia, Fusobacterium, and Streptococcus anginosus were consistently true positives across the full density range. True-positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally distinguishable from the distinct contaminant Pseudomonas with our sequencing methods, and, if identified at the species level, was likely to be a true positive at a relative abundance of >\u20090.001.

Interestingly, Ureaplasma was detected at high relative abundance in a single sample but lacked either feature of contaminants. All OTUs with positive or negative correlation with sample density are shown in Fig.\u00a010b. Negatively correlated OTUs largely represent common contaminants in low biomass samples, whereas positively correlated taxa represent known colonizers of the human airway.\n",

The analysis of the microbiome present in low-density samples is particularly challenging due to the ubiquitous presence of contaminants [18, 19, 24]. Using three different mock communities over a density range representative of BALF across numerous health/disease states, we ascertained the features of contaminating OTUs across a representative range of input sample densities, determined density-specific accuracy and precision, and determined the effect of simple pre-sequencing and contaminant removal strategies on sequencing accuracy and precision.

At a density below ~\u20098E+\u200906 16S copies/ml in unfiltered samples, the observed signal was derived from both bacterial taxa from the mock communities and contaminants. We identified features that distinguished contaminants from true positive taxa, including that they were negatively correlated with input density and that they showed low inter-replicate reproducibility. These features facilitated identification of a large proportion of contaminating OTUs and reads but could not be used to distinguish between taxa that are both common contaminants and airway pathogens/colonizers, indicating that current, commonly used amplicon sequencing methods will be limited for the quantitation of these taxa, especially in low-relative abundance or in low-density samples. In spite of these limitations, however, identification and removal of reads from these OTUs based on these features can improve accuracy without a significant impact on precision for samples with an input density above ~\u20098E+\u200904 16S copies/ml. It is important to note that with relative abundance compositional data, samples that are dissimilar based on density and relative abundance of contaminants may appear compositionally similar if reads from contaminants are removed. While this form of filtering may improve accuracy and precision, it potentially obscures differences between samples that may be informative, particularly those due to differences in the abundance of \u2018true positive\u2019 taxa that are lower in relative abundance in only one group of interest. This is an inherent limitation of relative abundance data but is an important consideration in the interpretation of samples of variable density and may need to be addressed with complementary methods (such as absolute quantitation of taxa or quantitative normalization).",

All amplification reactions were done in triplicate, checked on a 1% agarose TBE gel, and then pooled to reduce amplification bias. Pooled triplicates were quantified using Quant-it PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and combined by even concentrations. The final library was purified using Ampure XP beads (Agencourt), selecting for the bacterial V4 amplified band. The purified library was quantified using Qubit dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and loaded on to the Illumina MiSeq for sequencing, according to manufacturer instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed using the V2 (150\u2009bp \u00d7\u20092) chemistry. Sequencing depths are reported in Additional\u00a0file\u00a03.",

Sequences were assembled and quality trimmed using \u2013fastq_mergepairs and \u2013fastq_filter, with a \u2013fastq_maxee set at 1.0 and 0.5, respectively. Assembled sequences less than 233\u2009bp were removed. Following the UNOISE pipeline, unique sequences were identified from the merged pairs and sorted. Sequences were denoised and chimaeras were removed using the unoise3 command in USEARCH. Assembled sequences were then mapped back to the chimaera-free denoised sequences at 97% identity OTUs using the \u2013usearch_global command. Taxonomy assignment was executed using SINTAX [31], available through USEARCH, and the SINTAX-compatible Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database version 16, with the default minimum confidence cut-off of 0.8 [32]. OTU sequences were aligned using PyNast accessed through QIIME [33]. Sequences that did not align were removed from the dataset and a phylogenetic tree of the filtered aligned sequence data was made using FastTree [34].",

To apply Filter F1, we converted raw absolute abundance tables to relative abundances. We subsequently measured the Spearman correlation between relative abundances and sample input density and tested for significance for both the mock sample set and the BALF set, independently. OTUs presenting significant negative correlation were labelled as contaminants. For filter F2, we assessed whether each bacterial taxon was present in both technical replicates and subsequently removed those which were found to be singletons. For filter F3, we first applied F1, followed by F2.",
