In our work, we enrolled 32 patients with primary TB characterised by unilateral TB lesion formation diagnosed by chest radiographic exam. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was taken from both lungs. Twenty-four healthy people were chosen as controls. Pyrosequencing was performed on the V3 hypervariable region of 16S rDNA in all bacterial samples and used as a culture-independent method to describe the phylogenetic composition of the microbiota. Through pyrosequencing, 271,764 amplicons were detected in samples and analysed using tools in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) and bioinformatics. These analyses revealed significant differences in the microbiota in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) of TB patients compared with healthy controls; in contrast, the microbiota of intra/extra-TB lesions were similar. These results showed that the dominant bacterial genus in the LRT of TB patients was Cupriavidus and not Streptococcus, which resulted in a significant change in the microbiota in TB patients. The abundance of Mycobacteria and Porphyromonas significantly increased inside TB lesions when compared with non-lesion-containing contralateral lungs. From these data, it can be concluded that Cupriavidus plays an important role in TB\u2019s secondary infection and that in addition to Mycobacteria, Porphyromonas may also be a co-factor in lesion formation. The mechanisms underlying this connection warrant further research.",

Clinically, typical TB presents as granuloma-like lesions in the lung and chronic consumptive symptoms [2,3]. In the field of TB research, the pathogen Mycobacteria tuberculosis is the focal point, and issues related to its virulence, pathogenicity and drug resistance have been extensively researched [4,5]. With the development of systematic biology, the concept and mechanisms underlying persistent infections has changed and which suggests that infectious diseases reflect an equilibrium between the host and the pathogen that is established and maintained by a broad network of interactions that occur across scales, ranging from molecular and cellular to whole organism and population levels [6,7]. Chronic TB is a unique infection in the human body that is different from other types of diffuse pulmonary infections, and the formation of granulomas isolates the pathogens involved from other lung tissue. However, when judged through the lens of new infection concepts, changes in the microbiota in the lungs likely play an important role in the pathological process [8].",

For example, many published articles have examined the bacterial flora in the vagina, intestine and lung, attempting to determine the relationship between changes in local microbiota and such diseases as obesity, inflammation or diabetes [10,11]. In our previous researches, we also described the difference among the microbiota from healthy individuals, patients with hospital acquired pneumonia and patients with community acquired pneumonia [12,13]. From the viewpoint of the current studies, the stability or instability of the microbiota in vivo deeply influences the maintenance of health and the onset or progression of disease [7]. We hypothesise that the understanding of the link between the microbiota and persistent infection in the lungs of TB patients is currently in the very early stages and is an important topic for further research; therefore, the composition of the microbiota in intra- or extra-TB lesion areas needs to be analysed.",

On the base of patients\u2019 full understanding and when the signatures were obtained, the bronchoscopy was allowed to be undergone and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained. If the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was suit for our research work, the corresponding patient would be further informed that his/her sample would be further used in research work after the relative clinical works were done. In this step, after obtaining the verbal consent from the patient, our research would be undertaken. Our lab work was started after the samples being discarded. This study didn't involve patient private information and any adjustment or difference in clinical treatment. Therefore, all the samples were not intended to be collected specially for the research but a step after the routine clinical exam.

On the other hand, it would help to form the localized TB lesion in lung. All above were according to the treating guideline towards the primary TB and endobronchial tuberculosis [18]. After these treatments, chest radiographic exams were retaken to determine pulmonary lesion status and position. Then, bronchoalveolar lavage guided by bronchofibroscopy was undertaken. For each patient, two lavage samples were collected: one from the normal side (defined as Group A) and one from the opposite, lesion-forming lung area (defined as Group B). On the assumption that the side with TB lesion had a higher abundance of pathogens than the opposite side, we undertook lavage in the lesion-free side prior to the lesion-bearing side. When the lavage in the lesion-free side was done, the bronchoscopy was sterilized and then the operation would be continued. Although, the multi-contamination could not be fully avoided because of the limit of the instrument and operating skills, for example, the trachea acted as the common pathway when push-in and pull-out the bronchoscopy, we believe that these measures would minimize the bias by present methodology. After the operation, the anti-TB medicine treatment would be continued after the operation until the end of required medicine course of treatment by guideline.",

The percentages of genera from both sides were compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for TB patients.

For this reason, we inevitably encountered the issue of whether the low number of reads was representative for profiling the microbiota. A rarefaction curve and Shannon-Weaver index were generated to evaluate the ability of the detected amplicons to reflect bacterial diversity in samples.

Fig 2A shows that the green dots (Group H) and the blue/red dots (Groups A and B) were clearly located in different quadrants, indicating that the microbiota changed dramatically in TB patients. The distribution tendencies of these dots are also quite different. The green dots tended to cluster in a relatively small area; in contrast, dots representing Groups A and B had a relatively scattered clustering and were difficult to clearly separate, despite representing different microbiota origins. As Fig 2B shows, the microbiota from Group H concentrated under the same sub-branch and had a long phylogenic distance from Groups A and B.",

We interpreted the lack of homology as follows: from classical knowledge of TB pathology, Mycobacteria invasion is an important factor in injuring the mucosal barrier in the LRT, facilitating the colonisation of bacteria from the URT or foreign environments [24]. Our colleagues Cui et al. have found that many rare, unique bacteria exist in the microbiota of sputum from TB patients compared with that of healthy individuals, indicating its important role in creating the diversity in TB microbiota [25].",

Streptococcus was the dominant genus in the bacterial community of healthy people; however, in the TB patients, the dominant genus was Cupriavidus. The percentage of Streptococcus decreased significantly in TB patients. According to previous knowledge, Cupriavidus seldom results in primary pulmonary infections in populations with normal immune function; however, it can cause secondary infections in patients with immune-compromising conditions, such as post-transplantation status, aplastic anaemia or cystic fibrosis [26,27,28]. As a chronic consuming disease, TB not only reduces systemic immunity but also damages the local physical barrier of the LRT; all of these factors contribute to colonisation by Cupriavidus. The bacterial flora from the LRT in TB patients was characterised by a high abundance of Cupriavidus compared with the characteristic Streptococcus found in healthy controls; this is the main reason why significant changes appeared in the microbiota of patients\u2019 LRT. Cupriavidus was not found in healthy samples; as a result, we hypothesise that this genus is an important foreign infectious agent in TB patients.",

Comparisons of the microbiota from both lungs of each patient could clarify the change in the percentage of each genus in both sides. Table 3 shows the statistic calculations by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the abundance of each detected bacterial genera between Groups A and B. Other than Mycobacteria (P = 0.02) and Porphyromonas (P = 0.025), no genera showed statistically significant differences in abundance between the two sides (P>0.05). Table 5 compares the rate of Mycobacteria positive tests on both sides; there were no significant differences. These two tables suggest that despite wide distribution of Mycobacteria and Porphyromonas in both sides, the abundance in lesion-forming areas was much higher than in non-lesion forming areas. Thus, we hypothesise that these two genera were important lesion-forming factors. Mycobacteria are unquestionably the primary pathogens in TB and a main factor that stimulates macrophages to form lesions; however, we also consider Porphyromonas an important co-factor in lesion formation because of its high intra-lesion abundance. More research is needed to discover the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of Porphyromonas.",
