The accurate and rapid identification of the microbial pathogens in patients with pulmonary infections might lead to targeted antimicrobial therapy with potentially fewer adverse effects and lower costs. Major advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow culture-independent identification of pathogens. The present study used NGS of essentially full-length PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA from the bronchial aspirates of intubated patients with suspected pneumonia. The results from 61 patients demonstrated that sufficient DNA was obtained from 72% of samples, 44% of which (27 samples) yielded PCR amplimers suitable for NGS. Out of the 27 sequenced samples, only 20 had bacterial culture growth, while the microbiological and NGS identification of bacteria coincided in 17 (85%) of these samples. Despite the lack of bacterial growth in 7 samples that yielded amplimers and were sequenced, the NGS identified a number of bacterial species in these samples. Overall, a significant diversity of bacterial species was identified from the same genus as the predominant cultured pathogens. The numbers of NGS-identifiable bacterial genera were consistently higher than identified by standard microbiological methods. As technical advances reduce the processing and sequencing times, NGS-based methods will ultimately be able to provide clinicians with rapid, precise, culture-independent identification of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity profiles.",

Patients with VAP have estimated crude mortality rates of 20 to 70% and attributable mortality rates of 10 to 40% (2,\u20134). Because appropriate antimicrobial therapy has been shown to reduce crude mortality rates in patients if administered within the first 48 h of VAP diagnosis (5), patients suspected of VAP are generally started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to ensure that the most common pathogens are targeted. However, establishing the precise microbiologic cause of VAP allows clinicians to replace this preemptive broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with targeted antibiotics against an identified pathogen or group of bacteria, thereby reducing the risk of antibiotic-associated side effects, decreasing the potential for antibiotic resistance, and reducing the overall health care costs (6).",

Lower tract aspirate cultures are recommended in patients suspected of having hospital-acquired pneumonia or VAP (7) and have been shown to help guide appropriate antimicrobial therapy (8, 9). Culture-based microbiological diagnosis remains complicated because the presence of just a few colonizing bacteria in the respiratory tract can result in significant microbial growth on agar cultures and thus can be erroneously interpreted as being indicative of infection. The diagnostic process is further complicated by false-negative results from pathogens that cannot be cultured using standard laboratory procedures, possibly due to prior antibiotic administration or lack of anaerobic transport conditions (10). Combined, these false positives and false negatives significantly reduce the clinical value of deep tracheal aspirate cultures (11,\u201313). Microbiologic yields of 33 to 60% have been reported when only conventional diagnostic methods were used (14,\u201316). Furthermore, whereas a primary pathogen might be identified using standard culture techniques, the bacterial community of other abundant, but not necessarily pathogenic bacteria, may be an important factor modifying the virulence of the predominant pathogen through mechanisms such as quorum sensing. Therefore, analysis of the pulmonary bacterial community, also called the lung microbiome (17), may be an important factor in understanding the pathogenesis of bacteria in VAP and in managing the infection.",

Advances in DNA sequencing now allow increasingly rapid and massive parallel sequencing of thousands to millions of DNA strands simultaneously, thereby allowing a snapshot of all bacteria present in a given sample. Thus, we sought to determine whether the microbiome of human endobronchial aspirates might be effectively characterized by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Prior approaches to bacterial identification by DNA sequencing have included fluorescent Sanger sequencing of hundreds of small variable regions of 16S ribosomal amplimer clones (19, 20), length heterogeneity (LH) PCR for 16S ribosomal variable regions (21), restriction fragment polymorphisms in 16S (19, 21), arrays with bacterium-specific probes, such as PhyloChip (22, 23), and early applications of NGS (24, 25). These methods have been applied to various clinical situations, such as the microbiome of suboptimally controlled asthma (22), cystic fibrosis (19, 21), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (24, 26, 27), bronchiectasis (28), pleurisy (20), forensic assessment of drowning (25), and intubated patients (23). These studies have revealed unexpectedly large numbers of bacterial genera in patients with clinical illnesses and in healthy individuals (29, 30). In the present study, single-molecule NGS of thousands of full-length 16S small subunit ribosomal DNA amplimers was used to characterize the repertoire of pulmonary bacteria in intubated patients being clinically assessed for possible VAP.",

The aspirate was submitted to the GWU Hospital microbiology laboratory for routine Gram staining and microbial culture. In short, the most purulent or blood-tinged portions were used for a Gram stain and bacterial cultures on sheep blood, chocolate, and MacConkey agars. The cultures on sheep blood and chocolate agars were incubated in 5% CO2 at 35\u00b0C for at least 48 h, while the cultures on MacConkey agar were incubated in a non-CO2 atmosphere at 35\u00b0C for at least 24 h. Significant growth was defined as moderate to heavy growth of an isolate in the second, third, or fourth quadrants of each plate. Organisms were identified and susceptibility was determined using Vitek 2 identification (ID) and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) cards (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) following the standard operating procedures utilized by the GWU Hospital microbiology laboratory. The residual aspirate samples were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until processing for DNA extraction. After thawing, the samples were transferred into a 50-ml conical tube and processed by minor modifications to the method optimized for Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolation from human aspirate (31). To help dissolve the mucus, N-acetylcysteine (NAC-50; Remel Microbiology Products, USA) mucolytic agent (5 mg/ml, pH 6.8) was added 1:1 and vortexed. To pellet the bacteria, the samples were spun at 2,500 \u00d7 g for 30 min in a swinging bucket centrifuge, and the pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of 70% isopropanol and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until DNA isolation.",

Standard bacterial samples (Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis, ATCC 51299; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ATCC 27853; Escherichia coli, ATCC 25922; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, ATCC 6303, and E. coli dH5\u03b1 NEB C2987) were used to optimize DNA isolation from both Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G\u2212) samples. Bacteria were grown in LB broth for 16 h, and 1 ml was used for DNA isolation by different methods. The following kits were used for optimization of the DNA extraction protocol: TRIzol (Invitrogen), QuickExtract (Epicentre), DNAZol (MP Biologicals), the Wizard SV genomic DNA purification system (Promega), and the GenElute bacterial DNA kit (Sigma). After the yield of gDNA was analyzed, a combination of G+/G\u2212 lysis buffer based on the Sigma GenElute kit was used for patients' gDNA isolation (bacterial G+ lysis solution supplemented with lysozyme [2.2 \u00d7 106 units/ml], lysostaphin [200 units/ml], and mutanolysin [5,000 units/ml] combined in equal volumes with lysis solution T for G\u2212 bacteria). Aspirate samples (1 ml) were spun for 5 min at 1,500 \u00d7 g, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of the modified lysis solution described above. The concentration of gDNA was measured using both a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000; Thermo Scientific, USA) and a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Typical gDNA yields were 500 ng to 20 \u03bcg per 1 ml of aspirate.",

The optimal loading of 500 ng of gDNA was used for the majority of samples, although many samples amplified well with 100 to 250 ng. PCRs were conducted with 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 40\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 90 s. There was a final 7-min extension step at 72\u00b0C, after which the samples were held at 4\u00b0C until processed. The presence of amplimers at the expected 1,466-bp size was confirmed by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr) and by an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer using a 7,500-bp DNA chip (Agilent Technologies). The gel-resolved amplimers were not used for NGS due to an adverse effect of EtBr and UV light on the DNA integrity. Rather, the PCR products were purified with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman-Coulter). Purified PCR products were quantified with an optical density at 260 or 280 nm (OD260/280) (NanoDrop) and fluorescence staining (Qubit). All PCR amplification reactions that did not produce detectable amplimers of the expected sizes were repeated with different amounts of gDNA, and if these failed, the samples were excluded from NGS. In cases of insufficient starting quantities for library preparation, amplimers were pooled from multiple reactions.",

However, depending on the loading efficiency and other factors, on average, 11,790 mapped consensus reads were obtained (standard error of the mean [SEM], 1,868; range, 9 to 36,684). Those reads, however, were quite long, with an average length of 3,810 bp, >2 full-length single-pass subreads of the 1,466-bp insert. The accuracy of the sequencing of the individual subreads, as measured against the reference E. coli is only 83.1%, but this increases markedly when the subreads are combined to produce a consensus sequence, which is 99.8% accurate compared to the E. coli reference. The accuracy issues are complicated by the fact that a typical bacterium contains multiple copies of 16S ribosomal DNA, with E. coli K-12, for instance, apparently having 7 copies with very high similarity. The spike-in reference sequence was used as another test of accuracy; the apparent accuracy of the sequencing, on a single pass, is likewise 81.98%, which was comparable to that observed in the 27 patient samples (84.17% mapped subread accuracy). The consensus accuracy, which combines multiple passes of the same insert, was >99.5% with a minimum coverage (QV) of >100 (for a sample-by-sample coverage report, see Table SA1 in the supplemental material).",

To identify an optimal analytical workflow, two different taxonomy assignment pipelines were employed: PathoScope and SMRT Portal. For both PathoScope and SMRT Portal, the 16S reference file was derived from LTP version 111, to which the human 18S sequences were added to account for the 300-bp PCR product. The total number of quality mapped subreads was 1,127,682 for all 27 sequenced samples (mean, 43,372; standard deviation, 52,590; minimum, 4,611; maximum, 219,863). Thus, the combination of read depth coverage of >1,000 per identified pathogen and accuracy of consensus reads >99.5%, generated substantial overall confidence in the results. The number of bacterial species identified was highly correlated between the aligners (r = 0.68, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2), but PathoScope consistently produced a tighter diagnosis (3.55 versus 11.03 species/sample, P < 0.001). To account for chimeric sequences, all ATCC standards and patients' sample sequences were run through the Database Enabled Code for Ideal Probe Hybridization Employing R (DECIPHER) web application (University of Wisconsin-Madison) (43), and the results demonstrated a very low presence of chimeric sequences in patients' samples (see Table SA1 in the supplemental material).",

Within the 16S open reading frame (ORF), there are several relatively invariant \u201cconstant\u201d regions, which are useful as primer sites, and then there are 9 variable regions (V1 to V9, shown schematically in Fig. 3), which can be used for the assignment of the sequence to a particular bacterial taxon, genus, species, and often, subspecies, with the V1 to V3 and V7 to V9 having the greatest utility in classification (44). By sequencing essentially the entire 16S ORF, there was no need to choose just one variable region. To determine whether the long reads, as used here, had any beneficial effect on microbiome characterization, we conducted in silico experiments in which the long-read sequences were used to create simulated short reads spanning the 16S gene. The results indicate that the shorter reads increased the apparent microbiome complexity of the sample, as determined by the identified number of genera per sample (SEM): short reads of 5.6 (\u00b1 0.74) versus long reads of 3.7 (\u00b1 0.44) (Fig. 3), probably due to shorter fragments detecting spurious homologies with conserved regions of 16S. Thus, the long reads produced a narrower diagnosis of the lung bacterial diversity, which is an expected benefit of combining the diagnostic strengths of different 16S regions (44).",

Conversely, the error rate might not contribute to a significant misclassification rate because (i) the errors should be random, (ii) consensus reads minimize subread errors, (iii) only errors in variable regions should result in misclassification, and (iv) errors in a single variable region might be insufficient to misclassify the entire read. These assumptions have to be tempered with the knowledge that existing aligner/classifiers are optimized for short reads and have not been optimized for long-read technologies. Comparisons of the Roche 454 and Illumina technologies confirmed that the read lengths and error rates exerted significant influence on the bacterial classifications in intestinal microbiota (45).",

Using all quality reads, we found that PathoScope correctly identified 5 of 6 known bacteria with high confidence, with minor ambiguities in discriminating E. coli from Shigella and P. aeruginosa from P. otitidis, which have nearly identical 16S sequences. With the example of S. aureus, the consensus reads were further aligned and classified in SMRT Portal. Then the assemblies were used to plot the number of sequences per assembly, and the percentage of low-quality (LQ) sequences (Q of <20). The results clearly show that the major classifications of S. aureus and the closely related Staphylococcus simiae (Fig. 4), which as the top 3 assemblies account for about 70% of reads, had essentially no consensus reads of low quality. However, as the number of reads per assembly drops and the classifications diverge from the correct classification, the number of LQ reads increases rapidly, demonstrating that LQ reads are associated with misdiagnosis.",

A working hypothesis was that patients exhibiting lower CPIS were more likely to have mild commensal infections, which might have greater bacterial diversity than serious pathogenic infections with a single organism. In the 27 patient samples on which NGS was completed, the number of NGS-identifiable bacterial genera tended to be higher in patients with low CPIS, but the correlation was weak overall (r = \u22120.23, P > 0.1; see Fig. SA1 in the supplemental material). Thus, while the gDNA yield, PCR positivity, and bacterial diversity via NGS did not clearly distinguish between low-risk and high-risk infections, as assessed by the CPIS, NGS was quite valuable in determining the precise identities of the bacteria (Fig. 6).",

Among the strengths of this approach is the significant improvement in the accuracy of the diagnosis that is offered by long-read sequencing-based approaches. As long-read technologies improve with respect to the number of reads they produce, it will be increasingly feasible to conduct PCR-directed, multitargeted sequencing of pathogens for identification and antibiotic resistance and eventually long-read full microbial genomes. A second major advantage of the NGS approach is that it does not require culture of the microbes, which should shorten diagnostic times and increase the range of diagnosable microbes. Overall, a strength of this study design is that it employed real-world clinical samples collected under the true conditions in which an accurate diagnosis is necessary. Finally, the accuracy of the DNA diagnosis, coupled with sophisticated analytical tools, will allow for more accurate and comprehensive monitoring of pathogen outbreaks, which will improve therapeutic efforts and improve the tracking of pathogens in health care facilities and the community.",

The results represent a pilot study with a modest number of observations, which might limit the comparison of our findings against established clinical parameters, such as the CPIS. It is also plausible that a certain subset of patients with apparent infections would not be diagnosed by this method. Several factors can be identified. First, it is quite possible that in some patients with a true infection, the pulmonary aspirate would not collect relevant pathogens. This might be especially true in infections caused by pathogens that are highly encapsulated, are strongly adherent, or form robust biofilms. Second, the isolation of bacteria from the aspirate might be improved by some type of affinity separation, rather than relying on centrifugation alone. A further challenge is that the highly variable nature of the clinical samples makes it difficult to standardize the analysis. Some samples are essentially \u201cclots,\u201d probably neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS), which isolate and attack bacteria with neutrophil-derived peptides, such as defensins (47). While an essential part of innate immunity, NETs make reliable and quantitative recovery of pathogens more difficult. It is likely that any clinical implementation will benefit from more rapid, sensitive, and automated preparatory steps. Certainly a relevant factor in apparent \u201cDNA-negative\u201d samples is that many patients are started on antibiotics as soon as there is a suspicion of pneumonia.",

                    "text": "A second set of concerns pertains to the PCR amplification step. First, it is desirable to sequence all DNA in the aspirate, so that any pathogen type, whether viral, bacterial, or fungal is identified, but the presence of human genomic DNA might consume the majority of reads and sufficient microbial reads for accurate diagnosis might not be produced. This problem can be overcome by generating a larger number of reads and then excluding the human reads from analysis using bioinformatics tools. A second potential concern in any type of PCR-based diagnosis is amplification bias (45). The universal primers have minor mismatches against specific bacteria that might reduce their annealing efficiency (33), although under these PCR conditions, there was successful amplification of a broad range of bacterial pathogens. While degenerate primers, which are pools of primers with different specificities, can be employed, one still confronts the problem of whether the abundance of the primers matches the relative abundance of the target bacterial sequences. The ideal solution is an amplification-independent methodology, but this requires improvements mentioned above to enrich for the bacteria, so that the human sequences do not overwhelm the bacterial reads. Alternatively, our preliminary studies with \u201cshotgun\u201d sequencing of pulmonary aspirates, suggests that if the initial read number is large, then the human reads can be filtered to produce a diagnosis of the microbes, including fungal and viral sequences (S.

                    "text": "Overall, the success or failure of this general strategy will likely depend upon three major factors: (i) the reliable isolation of pathogens from complex biological samples, (ii) the generation of large numbers of long reads, and (iii) the speed with which the sequencing and computational analysis can be completed. While sequencing technologies are increasing in speed, down to hours per run, most of the time-intensive steps are involved in bacterial separation, DNA isolation, PCR amplification, and preparatory steps prior to sequencing. Despite the apparent speed of the actual sequencing, only about 1 h per sample, the sample preparatory work presently consumes days of DNA purification, amplification, blunting, ligation, and library preparation prior to sequencing. We estimate that with current methods, including the computational time and interpretation, a minimum of 48 h per sample would be required to produce a laboratory diagnosis. Technical improvements with real-time sequencing of unmodified DNA via nanopores, for instance, might significantly shorten diagnostic times and increase the effective read lengths for fast, accurate diagnosis of pathogens.",
