We hypothesised that CF gastric and lung microbiomes are related. Gastric and sputum cultures were obtained from fifteen CF patients receiving percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding. Non-CF gastric juice data was obtained through endoscopy from 14 patients without lung disease. Bacterial and fungal isolates were identified by culture. Molecular bacterial profiling used next generation sequencing (NGS) of the 16S rRNA gene. Cultures grew bacteria and/or fungi in all CF gastric juice and sputa and in 9/14 non-CF gastric juices. Pseudomonas aeruginosa(Pa) was present in CF sputum in 11 patients, 4 had identical Pa strains in the stomach. NGS data from non-CF gastric juice samples were significantly more diverse compared to CF samples. NGS showed CF gastric juice had markedly lower abundance of normal gut bacteria; Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium, but increased Pseudomonas compared with non-CF. Multivariate partial least squares discriminant analysis demonstrated similar bacterial profiles of CF sputum and gastric juice samples, which were distinct from non-CF gastric juice. We provide novel evidence suggesting the existence of an aerodigestive microbiome in CF, which may have clinical relevance.",

Most of the morbidity and premature mortality associated with CF can be attributed to chronic lung diseases caused by microbial infections and subsequent inflammation3, most frequently by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa)4. Treatment from dedicated CF centres has been associated with increased survival and treatment of lung disease is an understandable priority. The overall benefits associated with dedicated CF centres however emphasise a multi-disciplinary approach, and gastrointestinal problems are recognised as prominent. In particular Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux (GOR) is increased with a prevalence of more than 50%5. Several mechanisms have been proposed including reduced lower oesophageal sphincter pressure (LOS), increased transient LOS relaxation, and delayed gastric emptying. Increased GOR might also be due to an increased abdomino-thoracic pressure gradient during cough and physiotherapy6.",

Further analysis of the matched gastric juice and sputum samples from the same patient showed these samples generally grouped together (see Figure E1 in the data supplement). The loading plot from the PLS-DA of the overall bacterial community revealed that Prevotella, Rothia, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Herminiimonas and Pseudomonas were closely associated with CF samples while Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus were more associated with non-CF gastric juices (see Figure E2 in the data supplement).",

If lung and stomach were colonised by Pa from unrelated, stochastic sources, the organisms would be highly unlikely to be identical at the molecular level. In CF patients with intermittent colonization or recently acquired chronic Pa infection, there are high levels of genotype diversity23, suggesting that CF patients acquire unique Pa strains independently, from different environmental sources24. For intermittently colonized patients, following initial eradication by inhaled antibiotic treatment, recolonization by Pa can occur. This can be with a different genotype, suggesting new environmental sources, but in approximately 25% of patients the same genotype is identified, suggesting either undetectable persistent colonisation or local unknown environmental sources of recolonization23. Careful longitudinal eradication studies in CF have observed patients being re-colonized with the original Pa strains after several years of no demonstrable Pa in sputa25. The findings reported in this study might be consistent with the notion that gastric contents may represent a niche, relatively protected from inhaled antibiotics used in best practice eradication protocols26.",

This study noted the potential for bacterial pneumonia as a result of failed clearance of aspirated bacteria. A further valuable quantitative study by Gleeson and colleagues employed infusion of 2\u2009mL/h radioactive Tc-99m tracer into the nasopharynx to estimate the quantity of occult aspiration of nasopharyngeal secretions in normal humans. Aspiration was common, occurring in 50% of healthy young men during sleep, and was variable within subjects studied on more than one occasion. The levels of aspiration measured were 0.01 to 0.2\u2009mL; levels noted as being consistent with a potentially significant bacterial inoculum29.",

This recolonization is believed to originate from the upper airway and the sinuses34. It is also possible that the lungs of CF patients might be vulnerable to infection from aspiration of Pa colonising the gastrointestinal tract post transplantation however35, and that bi-directional transmission of pathogenic organisms, including Pa, occurs between the stomach and the oropharynx12. In lung transplantation, GOR has been substantially implicated as a potential non-alloimmune cause of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS), and anti-reflux fundoplication surgery has been assessed36, and associated with improved allograft function37.",

Decreasing airway bacterial diversity in patients with CF is well described39 . This is potentially consistent with our study showing that the CF gastric microbiota showed lower diversity compared to non-CF in the molecular based approach. This loss of diversity was a common feature between sputum and CF gastric juice samples compared to non-CF gastric juices. Molecular identification and multivariate discriminant analysis showed that the CF gastric juice samples and sputum samples were clustered and distinct from the non-CF gastric juices. Moreover, sputum and CF gastric juice samples from the same patient also had comparable profiles. Overall this further suggests that a link may be present between microbes colonising the sputum and gastric juice in some CF patients and that this is worthy of further investigation. Such studies should investigate whether the same profile of micro-organisms in the sputum and the gastric juice we observed might be explained by a common origin in the sinus and/or oro-pharynx.",

We restricted our gastric juice sampling to PEG fed patients and sampled over 80% of all the PEG patients potentially available to us, but this limited our study and our reported data to a specific patient cohort. There was no exclusion based on severity of the disease or antibiotic exposure. It is relevant to consider that apart from PEG fed patients with CF we have previously isolated Pa from samples of gastric juice from non- PEG fed CF patients, where gastric juice was sampled by endoscopy35. Our previous study found strains of Pa identical at the molecular level in broncho alveolar lavage (BAL), endoscopically sampled gastric juice and sputa. This suggests that the findings of our present study, that the stomach constitutes a viable bacterial reservoir relevant to the overall pathophysiology of CF, is not restricted solely to PEG fed patients35.",

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is another reason to start drugs for GA inhibition in patients with CF, and in North America it has been observed that the majority of patients with CF are on gastric acid suppressive treatments42. According to the clinical practice in our centre of study and that of others, all our CF patients were therefore on acid suppression therapy. Antibiotic therapy is also a current mainstay of therapy in CF. We feel that further studies regarding the effect of antibiotics and anti-acid therapy on the aerodigestive microbiome in CF, though challenging, could be important. We hope that such work may be aided and informed by our present study data.",

This study demonstrates that the stomach may represent an under recognised foci of bacterial infection, and potential reservoir of Pa in CF. Gastric microbiology could be contributed to by cough, expectoration and swallowing of organisms from the lung. Patients with CF are also known to reflux and aspirate however, indicating that in principle gastric microorganisms could contribute to the lung compartment. We conclude that the \u2018aerodigestive microbiome\u2019 may have potential relevance in the pathophysiology of CF and may have therapeutic implications, since Pa eradication does not consider a gastric niche of organisms.",
