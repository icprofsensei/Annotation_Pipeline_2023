Influenza A is a common viral infection that challenges that health, and a well-recognized sequela is bacterial pneumonia. Given this connection, we sought to characterize the upper respiratory tract microbiota of individuals suffering from the pandemic H1N1 influenza A outbreak of 2009 and determine if microbiome profiles could be correlated with patient characteristics. We determined the microbial profiles of 65 samples from H1N1 patients by cpn60 universal target amplification and sequencing. Profiles were examined at the phylum and nearest neighbor \u201cspecies\u201d levels using the characteristics of patient gender, age, originating health authority, sample type and designation (STAT/non-STAT). At the phylum level, Actinobacteria-, Firmicutes- and Proteobacteria-dominated microbiomes were observed, with none of the patient characteristics showing significant profile composition differences. At the nearest neighbor \u201cspecies\u201d level, the upper respiratory tract microbiomes were composed of 13-20 \u201cspecies\u201d and showed a trend towards increasing diversity with patient age. Interestingly, at an individual level, most patients had one to three organisms dominant in their microbiota. A limited number of discrete microbiome profiles were observed, shared among influenza patients regardless of patient status variables. To assess the validity of analyses derived from sequence read abundance, several bacterial species were quantified by quantitative PCR and compared to the abundance of cpn60 sequence read counts obtained in the study. A strong positive correlation between read abundance and absolute bacterial quantification was observed. This study represents the first examination of the upper respiratory tract microbiome using a target other than the 16S rRNA gene and to our knowledge, the first thorough examination of this microbiome during a viral infection.",

                    "text": "In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza A strain (A(H1N1) pdm09) reached global pandemic status. It is estimated that tens of millions to 200 million people were infected with A(H1N1) pdm09 worldwide, with 2-5% of confirmed cases in Canada and the USA requiring hospitalization [1,2]. Although many hospitalizations and deaths could be attributed to recognized risk factors (cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, auto-immune disorders, obesity, diabetes, cancer or pregnancy), close to one third of hospitalized patients who died had no known underlying medical conditions that would have predisposed them to severe infection [1]. The last major pandemic of an H1N1 influenza A strain was the Spanish flu of 1918-19. Recent investigations into that outbreak have determined that for many patients, if not most, secondary infection with bacterial pneumonia was the major cause of morbidity and mortality [3]. Along a similar vein, current research has shown that Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection is correlated with severity of A(H1N1) pdm09 influenza illness [4]. These findings highlight the importance of bacteria in the respiratory tract during a viral infection. However, research into the associations of bacteria with A(H1N1) pdm09 infections has to date focused only on known pathogens.",

The current consensus is that a healthy nose/nasopharynx has a bacterial community dominated by Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, with an increasing presence of Proteobacteria farther from the nose in the nasopharynx [5\u20138]. An inverse correlation between the prevalence of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes has been noted, with individuals having microbiomes dominated by either one phylum or the other, suggesting a possible antagonistic relationship between the groups [7]. At the genus level, similar to skin microbiomes, \nCorynebacterium\n spp., \nPropionibacterium\n spp. and \nStaphylococcus\n spp. are prominent members of the upper respiratory tract microbiome [6,7,9]. However, despite our growing understanding, we do not yet know if any particular upper respiratory tract microbiota compositions are associated with particular patient characteristics during a respiratory tract infection.",

Although the focus of that work was to examine the viral component of the microbiome, a small fraction of bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were also detected. Interestingly, the most detected bacterial families observed in individual patients were Enterobacteriaceae (Proteobacteria, 7 patients), Moraxellaceae (Proteobacteria, 4 patients), Streptococcaceae (Firmicutes, 2 patients), Carnobacteriaceae (Firmicutes, 2 patients), Pasteurellaceae (Proteobacteria, 1 patient), and Oxalobacteraceae (Proteobacteria, 1 patient) [10]. This composition is notably different from previous studies (more Proteobacteria-dominated profiles, no Actinobacteria-dominated profiles) and raises the question of whether this represents a methodological difference or an actual difference in the upper respiratory microbiota during A(H1N1) pdm09 infection compared to healthy individuals.",

We obtained samples from A(H1N1) pdm09 patients in British Columbia, Canada during the 2009 pandemic and determined their microbiome compositions by metagenomic profiling with the cpn60 universal target and qPCR. We found the microbiomes clustered based on composition into a few recurring profiles that were independent of patient gender, age, originating health authority, sample type collected or its STAT/non-STAT designation. In addition, we found the number of metagenomic sequence reads obtained correlated strongly with absolute qPCR quantification for seven species that were present at a range of prevalences in the data. This confirmed that metagenomic sequence frequencies obtained from the cpn60 gene accurately reflected the composition of the samples.",

Amplicons were pooled into four libraries and each was sequenced on a half plate region of a Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium pyrosequencer to generate a total of 1,940,006 filter passed sequence reads. Since previous studies of upper respiratory samples report human genomic DNA as an overwhelming proportion of nucleic acid isolated from this environment [10,25], all filter passed sequences were screened against a version of the human genome that had all cpn60 genes and pseudo-genes removed. This screening process filtered out 1,661,090 sequences (85.6% of the data). The remaining sequences were MID-separated and loaded into gsAssembler for de novo assembly. OTU sequences were then filtered to remove chimeras and non-cpn60 sequences (those with <55% identity to any reference database sequence). OTU abundance was calculated by mapping all reads on to the OTU using Bow tie 2 within the mPUMA pipeline. The final dataset contained 270,284 sequences in 490 OTU (Table S2). When each OTU was compared to the reference database (cpnDB_nr), the median percent identify of OTU to reference sequences was 96.4%, with 369/490 (75%) of the OTU having identities of >90% to a reference sequence (Table S3). To further aggregate the data, OTU with the same nearest neighbor (termed nearest neighbor \"species\") were combined. An average of 4,158 sequence reads per sample (median 1054) was obtained.

A distance matrix was created for each rarefaction and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was computed on each rarefied matrix using two different distance measures: Bray-Curtis and Canberra. Each sample was then plotted as a point where the area of each point reflected the interquartile range of the jackknifed PCoA estimates (Figure S1). The relatively compact size of the points for each sample indicated that the distance matrices were fairly consistent over 1000 iterations at the sampling depth of 100 reads, suggesting the sampling depth was adequate for sample comparison.

The diversity indices were then compared by patient gender, age, health authority, sample type and STAT/non-STAT designation by ANOVA (Table S4). Microbiomes contained an average of 9-14 nearest neighbor \u201cspecies\u201d when examined at the 100 read subsampling depth, and were predicted by the Chao1 estimate to contain 13-20 \u201cspecies\u201d if sampled to completion. There was no significant difference in the number of species observed or predicted between any patient characteristic groups. Diversity measurements of richness and evenness determined by Shannon\u2019s and Simpson\u2019s indices also showed no statistically significant difference by patient characteristics. However, there was a trend for both measures to increase as patient age increased (Shannon\u2019s, p = 0.08; Simpson\u2019s, p = 0.11; Table S4), with an observable distinction between patients under and over 20 years of age.",

This set was comprised of the three most abundant species in the dataset (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and \n\nCorynebacterium\n\npseudodiphtheriticum\n), two species representing 1-2% of the dataset (\n\nEnterococcus\n\nhirae\n and Propionibacterium acnes) and two species present at less than 1% of the dataset (Streptococcus mitis and Corynebacterium accolens) (Table 2). All seven of these species were also detected in at least 31/65 samples. In addition to the individual species, estimates of total bacterial and human DNA were also obtained for comparison. qPCR was used to quantify the amount of each target of interest in the clinical sample nucleic acid extracts. A well-established Taqman assay targeting the lytA gene was used for quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae [22]. For the remaining species, specific assays were developed for this study using SYBR Green chemistry and targeting the species type strain cpn60 sequence (whenever available). Assays were also designed to estimate the amount of total bacterial DNA (via quantification of the 16S rRNA gene content with primers designed previously [23]) and human DNA present (via quantification of human mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1)).",

An average of approximately 1.0\u00d7108 copies of cox1 were detected per sample, which translates into 5.0\u00d7104 to 2.0\u00d7106 epithelial cells per sample (Figure 3). The average 16S rRNA copy number per sample was 2.5\u00d7105 (Figure 3), which translates to approximately 7.5\u00d7105 bacteria per sample based on a median 16S rRNA copy number of three per bacterial genome [14].

To determine this, the first step was to determine the microbiomes of patients confirmed A(H1N1) pdm09 positive. To facilitate the exploitation of any informative differences in future diagnostics, we chose samples for this study from specimens submitted to the BC PHMRL for routine influenza diagnostic testing. This meant that the samples were from a range of health authorities across the province, collected from a spectrum of patients in terms of gender, age, preexisting conditions, and that sample type varied from nasal swabs to nasopharyngeal swabs to nasopharyngeal washes and one tracheal aspirate. An important part of our study was to determine whether this heterogeneous sample pool (which would be typically received by a diagnostic laboratory) would yield useful information about the upper respiratory tract microbiome.",

Our ability to assess patient illness severity in this study was limited. During the pandemic, the BC PHMRL established a system to prioritize testing for patients with more severe illness where samples submitted for influenza testing from patients hospitalized for respiratory illness, severe respiratory infection or having lower respiratory tract symptoms were to be marked with a \u201cSTAT\u201d designation. The \u201cnon-STAT\u201d samples in our study were collected in a community setting from patients well enough to see a physician at a private office or clinic, and submitted for influenza testing as routine samples. However, as the pandemic progressed, almost all samples from patients attended to at the hospitals were designated \u201cSTAT\u201d, regardless of disease severity. As such, we were unable to separate mildly and severely ill patients confidently, and could only use this characteristic as an indicator for the clinical setting in which the sample was collected.",

There were no significant differences by ANOVA comparing upper respiratory tract microbiome diversity statistics such as observed species, Chao1 estimates or Shannon\u2019s and Simpson\u2019s diversity index when compared using these variables (Table S4). As well, at a phylogenetic level, Unifrac failed to cluster microbiome compositions by these metadata parameters (Figure S2). The only trend noted was a moderate difference in microbiome richness and diversity between younger (<20 years) and older (>20 years) patients (Table S4). In fact, the finding that both men and women from birth to over 65 years of age share a remarkably similar collection of upper respiratory tract bacteria and fungi is impressive and notably different from what has been observed for the microbiota of other body sites [29].",

Frank et al. used the V1-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to profile the bacterial communities in the left and right nares of five healthy and 44 hospitalized individuals. Generating an average of 268 sequence reads per sample, they determined the major phyla present in the noses of healthy individuals to be Actinobacteria (68%), Firmicutes (27%), Proteobacteria (4%) and Bacteriodetes (1.4%), while hospitalized individuals had Firmicutes dominant (71%) profiles, with proportionately fewer Actinobacteria (20%) [6]. Lemon et al. profiled the nasal communities from seven healthy individuals by amplifying the full-length 16S rRNA gene from samples and identified community members by PhyloChip analysis. They observed an inverse correlation between the proportions of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria detected in an individual\u2019s nostril microbiome. When Staphylococcaceae (Firmicutes) proportions were high, Corynebacteraceae and/or Propionibacteriaceae (Actinobacteria) proportions were low and vice versa [7]. Our dataset of 65 patients, with an average of 4158 sequences per sample, contained many samples dominated by Actinobacteria or Firmicutes, but also contained several profiles dominated by Proteobacteria (Figure 1). Although Proteobacteria were clearly seen in the previous studies, our Proteobacteria proportions were notably higher. At lower taxonomic levels (family, genus, species), many major organisms detected from our A(H1N1) pdm09 study subjects (\nCorynebacterium\n\n, \n\nPropionibacterium\n\n, \n\nStaphylococcus\n and \nStreptococcus\n) are comparable to previous surveys [5\u20138]. In addition, our dataset also contained several Proteobacteria genera, such as \nVariovorax\n and \nMoraxella\n, not as commonly reported in this environment by 16S rRNA gene-based studies.",

Bacterial data in this study was limited to rRNA gene sequence obtained from Illumina sequencing of total cDNA libraries. Interestingly, their finding of Proteobacteria-dominated microbiomes was mirrored in our results. The two bacterial families that dominated the microbiomes of over half of their patients, Enterobactericeae (7/17 patients) and Moraxellaceae (4/17 patients), were seen as the dominant families for Clusters 11 and 7 in our data, respectively (Figure 2). Collectively, these finding lend weight to a hypothesis that influenza A infection may be associated with a more Proteobacteria-dominated upper respiratory tract microbiome. However, additional studies addressing this hypothesis are needed before any definitive statements can be made.",

While all previous studies used the 16S rRNA gene as a target, cpn60 has the advantage of being present in both bacteria and eukaryotes, making simultaneous detection possible. In these samples, Fungi did not represent a large proportion of the sequence reads obtained (0.1%), however three fungal species were identified, including \n\nMalassezia\n\nglobosa\n (skin organism known to cause dandruff [30]), \n\nPenicillium\n\ndigitatum\n (the cause of green mold on citrus fruit [31]) and Phanerochaete chrysosporium (environmental organism that decomposes wood [32]) (Table S3). Whether these fungi were just transients in the upper respiratory tract or whether they play a role in the microbiome is currently unknown.",

Evidence has been accumulating in the literature highlighting PCR, sequencing and data processing limitations that generate misleading and artifactual estimates of taxon abundance based solely on sequencing read abundance counts from metagenomic profiles [26,33,34]. The cpn60 UT region has been shown to alleviate some of these biases with strategic primer design [11,35], however, this is the first study to employ cpn60 for upper respiratory tract analysis, and so a technical examination of its performance was desired. We were surprised that 85% of our sequence data ended up matching the human genome, suggesting a significant amount of non-target amplification. The cpn60 PCR protocol used in this study has been previously applied to clinical samples from feces and vaginal swabs with no problems in specificity [36,37]. This led us to evaluate the relative proportions of human to bacterial DNA in these upper respiratory tract samples (Figure 3). Given that the human DNA component of these samples was an order of magnitude higher than the bacterial component, we suspect that the lower range of the temperature gradient component of the cpn60 universal PCR (originally designed for maximum amplification of diverse bacteria [11]) allowed for the non-specific amplification. Studies are underway to evaluate this parameter and address this issue for future studies involving samples dominated by host genomic DNA.",

To that end, we chose seven organisms that represented the most abundant species in the dataset (13-19% of the sequence data), species representing 1-2% of the data and species representing less than 1% of the data (Table 2). These species were specifically targeted and quantified by qPCR. Reassuringly, the sequence abundance data generated with cpn60 profiling correlated strongly with absolute species quantification by targeted qPCR (Table 2). Methodologically, this was very important and gives confidence in the analyses based on the read abundance values. Many metagenomic profiling studies draw conclusions from sequence abundance data but findings are never validated with another method.",

At the phylum level, A(H1N1) pdm09 patients had microbiomes composed of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria while at the species level, microbiome compositions fell into one of 11 clusters dominated by one or two organisms.
