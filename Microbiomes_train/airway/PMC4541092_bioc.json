Etiology is unknown, but several factors have been implicated, all of which influence the composition of microbiota residing on oral mucosae, which in turn modulates immunity and thereby affects disease progression. Although no individual pathogens have been conclusively shown to be causative agents of RAS, imbalanced composition of the oral microbiota may play a key role. In this study, we sought to determine composition profiles of bacterial microbiota in the oral mucosa associated with RAS. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized the most abundant bacterial populations residing on healthy and ulcerated mucosae in patients with RAS (recruited using highly stringent criteria) and no associated medical conditions; we also compared these to the bacterial microbiota of healthy controls (HCs). Phylum-level diversity comparisons revealed decreased Firmicutes and increased Proteobacteria in ulcerated sites, as compared with healthy sites in RAS patients, and no differences between RAS patients with healthy sites and HCs. Genus-level analysis demonstrated higher abundance of total Bacteroidales in RAS patients with healthy sites over HCs. Porphyromonadaceae comprising species associated with periodontal disease and Veillonellaceae predominated in ulcerated sites over HCs, while no quantitative differences of these families were observed between healthy sites in RAS patients and HCs. Streptococcaceae comprising species associated with oral health predominated in HCs over ulcerated sites but not in HCs over healthy sites in RAS patients. This study demonstrates that mucosal microbiome changes in patients with idiopathic RAS\u2014namely, increased Bacteroidales species in mucosae of RAS patients not affected by active ulceration. While these changes suggest a microbial role in initiation of RAS, this study does not provide data on causality. Within this limitation, the study contributes to the understanding of the potential role of mucosal microbiome changes in oral mucosal disease.",

RAS is characterized by multiple recurrent round or ovoid inflammatory ulcerations with circumscribed margins, erythematous haloes, and yellow or gray floors (Jurge et al. 2006). RAS causes considerable pain, can interfere with oral functions (eating, speech, toothbrushing), and can thereby have a negative impact on quality of life (Al-Omiri et al. 2014). Current treatment is based on topical corticosteroids and systemic immunosuppressants depending on severity but is still palliative, as it only reduces the severity of the ulceration and does not stop recurrence (Altenburg et al. 2007; Sheikh et al. 2013). Understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of RAS, currently unknown, will aid the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.",

While not directly involved in the etiology of RAS, all these factors influence the composition of the community of microorganisms that colonize the oral mucosa (oral microbiota), which can in turn modulate inflammatory responses and thus affect progression of RAS. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that perturbations of mucosal microbiota\u2014at the intestinal mucosa in particular\u2014can modulate innate and adaptive immune responses, with inflammation arising upon reduction of the number of symbiont microorganisms and/or increase in the number of pathobiont microorganisms (commensal bacteria with pathogenic potential). This status is referred to as microbial dysbiosis (Petersen and Round 2014). Several immune mechanisms of disease suppression by symbiont bacteria have been hypothesized, including induction of IL-10, suppression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8, and modulation of Toll-like receptors (Round and Mazmanian 2009). These mechanisms have all been implicated in remission of RAS (Taylor et al. 1992; Miyamoto et al. 2008; Gallo et al. 2012).",

Oral streptococci have also been implicated (Hasan et al. 1995). So far, however, no bacterial species have been conclusively shown to be the causative agents of RAS. Nonetheless, the oral microbiota of patients with RAS was found to differ from that of healthy controls (HCs; Marchini et al. 2007). Indeed, pathogen-associated molecular patterns shared by different microbial species have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of RAS (Hietanen et al. 2012). As suggested for periodontal disease (Kumar et al. 2005), targets of early stages of inflammation in RAS may be pathobionts that are overrepresented during global perturbation of the normal oral microbiota. The role of Porphyromonas gingivalis in periodontal disease has recently been emphasized by demonstration of its ability to promote dysbiosis of oral microbiota (Maekawa et al. 2014).",

A group of HCs matched by sex and age (\u00b1 5 y) was also recruited. Patient assessment included a full history and neck and oral mucosae examination. As part of a comprehensive oral health assessment, we also carried out tooth charting, periodontal health assessment, measurement of plaque index, and whole salivary flow rate and candida culture. To exclude the presence of underlying medical conditions, serology investigations were carried out (full blood count, liver function test, renal profile, red cell folate, ferritin, and vitamin B12). Exclusion criteria included the following: hematologic and biochemical tests outside the normal range, whole salivary flow rate <1 mL/min, candida count >1,000 colony-forming unit/mL, smoking, use of antibiotics in the preceding 3 mo, having commenced any therapy for RAS in the preceding 6 mo, presence of any known medical conditions, presence of other oral mucosal diseases (including trauma-related injury), periodontal disease, high-sugar diet, D3MFT >2, plaque index >30%. To reduce influences by dietary and oral hygiene habits, participants were asked to avoid antibacterial mouthwashes, dental floss, and consumption of sugary food and drinks for 72 h prior to the visit. Patients were asked to avoid the foods and drinks defined as potentially cariogenic by the Department of Health and the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry (2009). Recruits were also asked to brush their teeth twice a day using only toothpaste provided by the clinic. Toothbrushes were not provided by the clinic, but we ensured that all patients used manual toothbrushes. Optimal toothbrushing technique was discussed with all patients as part of routine clinical practice. The full recruitment method is illustrated in the Appendix Figure.",

DGGE analysis was used to provide a visual representation of bacterial diversity and was not intended to provide quantitative data. DGGE analysis showed diversity across all samples with individuals each harboring a unique collection of bacteria, depicted by differing DGGE profiles (Fig. 1). In RAS cases where ulcers sampled were >2 mm in diameter, intrapatient differences between the bacterial profiles generated from healthy and ulcerated mucosal sites were dramatic and not confined to differences in band intensity, suggesting that different bacterial communities were present in healthy sites when compared with ulcerated sites in the same individual (Fig. 1, lanes 8 and 9 vs. lanes 10 and 11).",

Numerous reviews have appraised the robustness of studies attributing an infectious basis (viral and bacterial) to the etiology of RAS and agreed that the evidence is contradictory (Jurge et al. 2006). This study suggests that imbalances of the oral mucosal microbiome, rather than individual infectious pathogens as suggested previously (Mansour-Ghanaei et al. 2005), may be implicated in the etiopathogenesis of RAS. Recent evidence suggests that mucosal microbiome changes may play a role in the etiology of chronic mucosal inflammatory conditions historically associated with individual infectious pathogens (Petersen and Round 2014).",

Porphyromonadaceae comprising species specifically associated with periodontal disease (Mysak et al. 2014) and Veillonellaceae for which diverse roles in oral health and disease are reported predominated only in ulcerated sites over HC. No quantitative differences of these 2 families were observed between healthy sites in RAS patients and HCs. Total Clostridia, to which the family of Veillonellaceae belongs, showed the reverse trend, with statistically significant higher abundance in HC over ulcerated sites. Equally, Streptococcaceae comprising commensal species associated with oral health (Liu et al. 2012) were more abundant in HCs over ulcerated sites but not in HCs over healthy sites in RAS patients. Consistently, the overall Bacilli population, which includes Streptococcaceae, showed higher abundance in HCs over ulcerated sites. The biological relevance of statistically significant changes associated to Caulobacter and Akkermansia was difficult to interpret, particularly in view of the low numerical abundance.",

Importantly, the observed increase of Bacteroidales was independent of the presence of medical conditions, other oral diseases, smoking, and reduced salivary flow rate. Potential influences by dietary and oral hygiene habits were also minimized. Oral hygiene instructions included suspension of flossing for 3 participants (1 HC and 2 RAS) who used floss as part of their routine oral hygiene. We acknowledge that suspension of flossing may influence the composition of oral mucosal microbiota in healthy individuals.",

Yet, recent studies have shown the ability of P. gingivalis to inhibit phagocytosis of otherwise susceptible bacteria and hence promote dysbiosis itself (Maekawa et al. 2014). The coinciding decrease of Streptococcaceae species was equally observed in active ulcers only. Streptococci-based products to repopulate the oral environment with \u201cbeneficial species\u201d have been marketed for control of halitosis. The potential of these products for controlling oral inflammatory conditions has been suggested, although randomized clinical trials to test their efficacy have not been carried out (Pradeep et al. 2014). The work presented here shows no evidence of increased abundance of Streptococcaceae species in healthy subjects over healthy mucosae in RAS patients and therefore does not support the use of streptococci-based products to prevent recurrence of RAS. This, however, does not exclude a role for these products in aiding restoration of oral health following acute exacerbations.",

A comparison of the mucosal microbiome in patients with idiopathic RAS and those with recurrent oral ulceration associated with similar immune pathogenesis but different etiology (e.g., underlying systemic conditions such as iron deficiency; Challacombe et al. 1983) may provide data on causality. Future studies should also investigate the role of the oral mycobiome (Ghannoum et al. 2010) in etiopathogenesis of RAS. Metagenomic studies of the oral microbiome in RAS patients, as recently reported for healthy individuals (Jorth et al. 2014), will define conserved changes in metabolic and virulence gene expression of bacterial communities associated with RAS.",
