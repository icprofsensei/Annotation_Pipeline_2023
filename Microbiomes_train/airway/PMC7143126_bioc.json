The home assessment of indoor microbiome (HAIM) study seeks to assess the abundance of indoor microbiota (IM) in the homes of under-five children (U-5Cs) with and without LRTI. HAIM is a hospital- and community-based study involving 200 cases and 200 controls recruited from three children\u2019s hospitals in Ibadan, Nigeria. Cases will be hospital-based patients with LRTI confirmed by a pediatrician, while controls will be community-based participants, matched to cases on the basis of sex, geographical location, and age (\u00b13 months) without LRTI. The abundance of IM in houses of cases and controls will be investigated using active and passive air sampling techniques and analyzed by qualitative detection of bacterial 16SrRNA gene (V3\u2013V4), fungal ITS1 region, and viral RNA sequencing. HAIM is expected to elucidate the relationship between exposure to IM and incidence of LRTI among U-5Cs and ultimately provide evidence base for strategic interventions to curtail the burgeoning burden of LRTI on the subcontinent.",

The microorganisms within and around the human body is a portion of the microbial diversity we encounter and interact with over time, most of which takes place in the indoor environment where humans, especially children under the age of five (U-5Cs), spend more than 90% of their time [1]. Understanding the process that drives microbial communities is an important endeavor. Evidence is accumulating that both the human and environmental microbiome contribute to human health [2,3,4]. The scientific community has begun to appreciate the importance of characterizing such interactions, with increasing numbers of studies seeking to determine the biodiversity, ecology, and public health implications of the microbial congregation present in the built environment.

Each year, LRTIs cause 15% of all deaths among U-5Cs globally, and about 50% of these deaths occur in SSA [8]. Nearly 265,000 in-hospital deaths of U-5Cs took place due to LRTI globally in 2010, 99% of which were reported in developing countries [9]. Among the microbial agents associated with LRTIs, viruses play an essential role, because primary infection with viral pathogens can pre-dispose children to secondary bacterial infection [10]. Furthermore, co-infection with multiple respiratory viruses is common [11,12]. Correct and timely (viral) diagnosis can minimize the overuse of antibiotics [13]. The assessment of specific fungal [14,15] and bacterial [16] communities in homes has been demonstrated in several studies, but only a few studies have considered the home indoor microbiome (IM) [17,18,19]. In addition, there is a paucity of expertise, experience and infrastructure for suitable cutting-edge IM research in SSA. ",

This cycle will continue across the dry and raining seasons until a total of 200 cases and controls each are recruited. At the recruitment sites, all children arriving at the hospital will be screened, but only those younger than five will be recruited. A child will be recruited into the study only after the caregiver has consented and the purpose of the study has been explained in English or Yoruba using a consent form. Those who meet the eligibility criteria and provide us with informed consent will be included in the study. All U-5Cs confirmed by a pediatrician with LRTI and admitted to the children\u2019s ward or emergency room, will be logged and invited to participate in the study through their caregivers. At the presenting hospitals, diagnosis of LRTI is mostly based on chest radiography. The presence of one or more of the chest radiographic features of patchy, segmental, or lobar consolidation; +/- a positive air bronchogram; and +/- pleural effusion is used to confirm the diagnosis. Controls will be primarily recruited from the same community where the cases reside. For every case of LRTI recruited from the hospitals and followed home for indoor assessment, a control will be identified, tested, and confirmed to not have LRTI and/or any of the respiratory signs and symptoms. Each control will be matched for sex, age (\u00b13 months), and geographical location. There will be at least one control for every case recruited. Two approaches will be used in identification and recruitment of community controls. The first method will be to ask the caregiver of the recruited case to identify a neighbor whose child is of the same age group and sex as the case and then approach that caregiver with an intent to recruit her/him. After explaining the study and obtaining consent, the caregivers of such controls will be interviewed using the same instruments as cases. Second, screening of potential controls will also be performed by a pediatrician for history of fever, cough, fast breathing, and lower chest wall indrawing. Where no reported diagnosis of LRTI is identified, the caregiver will be interviewed using the same child health questionnaire used in cases. ",

The electrostatic dust collector (EDC) is an easy-to-use passive sampling device consisting of a polypropylene folder holding electrostatic cloths. Electret fibers have been shown to enhance allergen particle retention, giving the electrostatic abilities of EDCs an advantage [26]. EDCs have previously been used for sampling both low endotoxin home environments including apartments and farm homes and high endotoxin occupational environments including a companion animal hospital and a social room at a composting plant [26,27]. Each EDC sampler will contain two cloths that are rendered pyrogen-free before use by heating overnight at 200 \u00b0C and assembled following a standard protocol [28,29]. The EDCs will be placed in plastic lock sealing bags (Ziploc\u00ae, S.C. Johnson & Son, Racine, WI, USA) and transported to the field for sampling. Sampling will be done by opening the EDC preferably in the child\u2019s sleeping room if different from the child\u2019s playing area to expose the cloths to the air and allowing the collection of settling dust for 14 days at not less than 1.50 m above the floor. At the end of the sampling period, the field workers will carefully close the EDCs and return the used EDCs to the laboratory in a new plastic lock sealing bags (Ziploc\u00ae) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C prior to qPCR analysis. Unexposed EDCs will be included and subjected to the same condition and processing which will serve as laboratory controls during deoxyribonucleic acid/ribonucleic acid (DNA/RNA) extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Similarly, 5% of the sampled houses of cases and controls will be resampled before the end of each season to ensure stability and consistency of the measurements.",

First, the HAIM study will be the first to fully explore the diversity and composition of microbiome in homes within SSA and its association with LRTI among U-5Cs. Second, several studies from SSA have made use of active airborne sampling [47,48,49] and passive airborne sampling using petri dishes [50,51,52], but the HAIM study is the first to apply electrostatic dust collectors (EDCs) in SSA. The EDC has been employed by several studies [29,53,54] in the developed world and has been proven to be useful for assessing exposure to airborne dust and microbial constituents in home or work environments. Several studies assessing different indoor sampling approaches demonstrated that dust that settles on a standard sampler surface located above floor level is a closer representative of the actual airborne exposure [55,56] than house dust. Passive collection on EDCs has three specific advantages compared to active airborne sampling. First, particle collection onto the standardized sampler surface occurs over a discrete and known time period. Second, placing passive samplers on a sufficiently elevated surface likely captures airborne dust. Third, the EDC gives users the opportunity to capture the entire microbial composition within a particular environment, unlike the active sampling, which depends on culture media that may not support the growth of certain microorganisms. Due to these features, passive collectors of settled dust have been used in health-based studies and otherwise to assess the microbes that occupants encounter in the built environment [28,57,58,59,60]. To further buttress the effectiveness of the EDC, Normand et al., [61] in their study comparing air impaction method and the EDC, showed that a single EDC measurement is comparable to the sum of several air-impaction measurements. Therefore, EDCs provide a more precise estimation of the fungal or microbial exposition of individuals in public buildings compared with a single air impaction [61].",

                    "text": "Third, HAIM will be the first to investigate airborne viruses in homes within SSA knowing the role of viruses in the incidence of LRTI among U-5Cs. To the best of our knowledge, indoor airborne viruses have been investigated only in the United State using SKC AirCheck pumps loaded with filter holders and a Sioutas Personal Cascade Impactor Sampler (PCIS) [62,63,64]. This environment differs substantially in climatic, meteorological and housing conditions from Ibadan where the HAIM study is based [65]. A major effort of the HAIM study is the collection of airborne viral samples from 200 homes of U-5Cs as compared to the study carried out by Prussin et al., [62] in a daycare center. In addition, the studies carried out in the United State made use of the active sampling method to sample airborne viral particles in less than 120 min, while the HAIM study intends to employ a passive sampling method using EDCs over a period of 14 days, giving ample opportunity for the collection of a good representation of specific viruses within the child\u2019s environment. The community engagement within the HAIM study is a unique avenue to address perception and willingness of caregivers of U-5Cs to participate in home inspection and monitoring for indoor air pollutants most especially IM. The community engagement activity of the HAIM study will create awareness on the impact of exposure to IM on the respiratory health of U-5C and provide a platform to educate parents especially mothers of U-5Cs within Ibadan on the importance of home assessment for indoor airborne microbiota.

However, the community survey strategy is designed to eliminate this bias. Second, recruiting matched controls from the same catchment area as the cases could introduce some selection bias due to the likelihood of the ideal controls not consenting to participate in the study. The study will make an effort to mitigate such an occurrence by making sure that the caregivers of the controls are well informed of the benefits of participating in the study. Third, responses from parents/caregivers of a child with severe conditions may be influenced by the state of the child, thereby introducing some response bias. The study will ensure that such situations are alleviated by making sure the administration of the tools is carried out in a conducive and comfortable atmosphere.",
