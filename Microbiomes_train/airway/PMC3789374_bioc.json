However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity and biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis showed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities found a total of 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) with only 78 of these present in all subjects. We demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. With respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by the abundance of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa. In summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. Despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.",

Indeed, disturbance of these communities and changes in their composition have been associated with the development of a variety of diseases (Eckburg & Relman, 2007; Chang et al., 2008; Turnbaugh & Gordon, 2009; Ravel et al., 2011). Most common oral diseases are also a consequence of changes in the structure of resident microbial communities, driven by an interplay between the microorganisms and the behavioral habits and immune system of the host (Marsh, 2003). Hence, an understanding of the composition and ecological events that drive changes in the structure, from health to disease, of oral microbial communities is an important step in the development of preventive strategies to promote oral health.",

Obtaining sequences from amplicon libraries generated by universal amplification of portions of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is now a cost-effective technique with thousands to hundreds of thousands of sequence reads generated in a single run. This approach allows an overview of the communities as a whole, overcoming the limited views that previously employed techniques offered. These advances are already generating open-ended studies of the variability in the oral microflora as it relates to oral diseases (Li et al., 2010; Belda-Ferre et al., 2011; Pushalkar et al., 2011). However, before large-scale studies are conducted, it is necessary to evaluate the oral microbiome composition during health because large inter-individual variability may limit the discovery of disease-associated biomarkers. Indeed, high throughput sequencing has already been used to characterize the bacterial microbiome of healthy subjects at different intra-oral niches (Zaura et al., 2009). This study sequenced V5\u2013V6 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene from intra-oral sites of three systemically and orally healthy individuals and found that subjects shared a great proportion of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), thereby supporting the concept of a core oral microbiome present during health. In contrast, other studies have reported that although a core microbiome exists, there is also great inter-subject variability in the microbial communities of humans (Eckburg et al., 2005; Diaz et al., 2006; Bik et al., 2010; Lazarevic et al., 2010). Despite the presence of common taxa at higher taxonomic ranks, it has been suggested that differences in the presence and abundance of lower rank taxa generate a unique microbiome signature for individuals (Diaz et al., 2006; Lazarevic et al., 2010). One important aspect in the detection of inter-individual variability is the coverage of species richness obtained after sampling. The lack of observation of a phylotype in a sample is not indicative of its absence if the richness in the sample is not fully covered. In this respect, the determination of the number of sequence reads needed to observe most phylotypes present in a sample becomes crucial for the proper design of studies aimed at defining the core microbiome and large clinical studies that investigate shifts in the microbial composition between health and disease or intend to discover disease-associated biomarkers.",

Resident microbial communities of humans assemble at body sites with dissimilar environmental conditions such as surface characteristics, humidity, oxygen tension, temperature and presence of body fluids. These communities differ in their membership and structure according to the body site sampled, an indication that specific environments select for certain types of microorganisms (Costello et al., 2009). This pattern may also be evident within a specific niche, with fine scale differences in community structure occurring over short distances. Indeed, the intra-niche biogeography of oral communities has been studied using both culturing and molecular approaches (Liljemark & Gibbons, 1971, 1972; Mager et al., 2003; Aas et al., 2005; Zaura et al., 2009). These investigations have revealed that the bacterial microflora differs markedly among intraoral surfaces.

For example, it is known that targeting different regions of the 16S rRNA gene results in microbial communities with different structures (Sundquist et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2011). Among the hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, those between the first 500 base pairs (bp) have been used for most molecular surveys of oral flora because they allow good taxonomic discrimination at the genus and even species level (Diaz et al., 2006; Sundquist et al., 2007). We and others have also demonstrated that DNA lysis procedures influence the composition of microbial communities assayed via molecular methods (Diaz et al., 2006; Morgan et al., 2010). Although such limitations may be insurmountable, their effects need to be assessed on a \u2018mock\u2019 community of oral organisms, an artificial community constructed in vitro with some of the same members encountered in vivo. This type of experiment constitutes an important first step in understanding the inherent biases in the technique chosen for a given study.",

However, estimations of richness using high throughput sequencing are usually overinflated because of the inherent error in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and sequencing, as well as by limitations in data analysis methodology (Reeder & Knight, 2009; Schloss et al., 2011). Ecological estimators commonly used in macroecology are applied to pyrosequencing datasets to predict the number of unseen phylotypes in a sample and to estimate the coverage obtained. However, the accuracy of these estimators is limited by the error-prone datasets provided as input. A mock community can help to ascertain error because the number of expected species is known a priori. With respect to the use of estimators to predict undetected species, it is also important to evaluate the behavior of the estimator at different sequencing depths to determine the minimum sequencing effort needed to reliably predict the total phylotypes present and the richness coverage obtained.",

We began by evaluating the bias of our DNA isolation, PCR amplification and sequencing protocols using a mock community of oral microorganisms. We also evaluated the error in OTU assignment using a recently developed data analysis pipeline (Schloss et al., 2011) and investigated the impact of removing singleton OTUs on decreasing this error. With this knowledge, we then characterized, using a deep-sequencing approach, the salivary and buccal mucosa communities of three healthy individuals and investigated the diversity at these sites. We then determined the sampling effort needed to cover most, or all, of the community richness and that to obtain an accurate estimate of the total richness in salivary and mucosal samples. Next, we sequenced the microbiome of two additional individuals and compared the \u03b2-diversity of salivary and buccal mucosa microbial communities at different sequencing efforts, followed by an OTU/phylotype-level analysis to explain the observed biodiversity patterns. The questions we wanted to answer were the following. What is the diversity present in oral bacterial communities of saliva and buccal mucosa? What is the sequencing effort necessary to cover most of the richness in oral microbial communities allowing membership-based community comparisons? Does 454 pyrosequencing reveal differences in biogeography similar to those reported in the literature using culture-based or other molecular approaches? What is the inter-individual variability in the oral microbial communities of healthy individuals and is this variability greater than the expected intra-individual biogeographical differences? And finally, how are these variability measures affected by sampling effort? By answering these questions, we demonstrate that community analysis by 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicon libraries is a technique that offers great advantages but also has its limitations. These studies represent a first step in the understanding of how to best capture comprehensive information on oral microbial communities using this powerful approach.",

PK 1910 were grown at 37\u00b0C in appropriate media and environmental conditions until cultures reached late logarithmic phase. Streptococci, A. oris and L. casei were grown in brain\u2013heart infusion (BHI) medium (Oxoid Ltd, Cambridge, UK) under aerobic static conditions. Anaerobes were grown under an atmosphere of 90% N2, 5% H2 and 5% CO2. F. nucleatum was grown in BHI supplemented with 0.5 g l\u22121 cysteine; P. gingivalis was grown in BHI supplemented with 0.5 g l\u22121 cysteine, 5 mg l\u22121 haemin and 1 mg l\u22121 vitamin K; and Veillonella sp. was grown in BHI supplemented with the same concentrations of cysteine and haemin and 0.6% (volume/volume) of lactic acid. Three types of mock communities were assembled containing these seven representative oral species. Mock 1 consisted of a mixture of genomic DNA from the seven organisms to obtain equal numbers of 16S rRNA gene copies per species. To accomplish this, we first identified the genome size (n) in bp for each organism and then calculated the mass of DNA (m) per genome using the formula m = (n) (1.096 \u00d7 10\u221221 g bp\u22121). We then normalized genome mass by the copy number of the 16S rRNA gene (ranging from three to five copies, depending on the organism) and calculated the grams of DNA containing the copy number of interest (1 \u00d7 105 16S rRNA molecules). Mock 2 was assembled by mixing the same number of cells from each species. Mock 3 was assembled to mimic unevenly distributed natural oral communities by mixing cells from the seven species in the following proportions: 30% cells of S. oralis; 15% cells each of F. nucleatum, Veillonella sp. and A. oris; and 8.3% cells each of S. mutans, L. casei and P. gingivalis. Cell numbers were determined by using a Petroff\u2013Hausser counting chamber. Information on the number of 16S rRNA copies of the seven species was obtained from the Ribosomal RNA Operon Copy Number Database (RRNDB) (Klappenbach et al., 2001) and used to normalize DNA amounts added to mock 1 and to determine the expected number of sequence reads per taxon in mocks 2 and 3. Mock communities were assembled in duplicate and sequenced by combining triplicate amplicon libraries generated from each sample (see below).",

First, primers and barcodes were trimmed followed by removal of sequences shorter than 200 bp, or with homopolymers greater than eight nucleotides or with ambiguous base calls. Sequences were then filtered according to quality scores using the sliding window approach, which trims sequences when the average quality score over a 50-bp sliding window drops below 35. Unique sequences were aligned using the SILVA database as a reference (Schloss, 2010) and trimmed so that sequences only included a comparable anchor region. Sequences were further denoized by a modification of the single linkage algorithm (Huse et al., 2010; Schloss et al., 2011) to find sequences with up to 2 bp difference from a more abundant sequence and then merge their counts. This step reduces variability but also diminishes errors caused by pyrosequencing. Chimeric sequences were then removed by applying the UChime algorithm (Edgar et al., 2011), as implemented in mothur.",

Sequences were then clustered into OTUs using the average neighbor algorithm (Schloss & Westcott, 2011) and a 3% dissimilarity cutoff. Sequences were individually classified using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier (Wang et al., 2007), which uses a Bayesian approach and also runs a bootstrapping algorithm. The threshold for bootstrapping assignment to a specific taxonomy was set at 80%. Template taxonomies used were the large RDP reference dataset and the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD), a curated dataset for oral taxa (Dewhirst et al., 2010). The OTUs were assigned a taxonomic classification based on the consensus taxonomic assignment for the majority of sequences within that OTU. If a consensus taxonomic assignment was not possible at the species level, then the nearest taxonomical level where a consensus was obtained was reported. Classified sequences were also used to group sequences into phylotypes (from genus to phylum level) based on taxonomic identity. In some cases OTUs with only one sequence across all datasets (singletons) were eliminated.",

We observed that these estimators were not sensitive to sequencing effort and thus comparison of samples with different sampling depths was possible. Rarefaction curves were constructed using output from mothur. Coverage of richness at a given sampling effort was determined via the Good\u2013Turing estimator (Good, 1953). Total richness was also estimated via catchall (Bunge, 2011), as implemented in mothur. The number of sequence reads needed to observe all the OTUs estimated by catchall to exist in a given sample was calculated by assuming a logarithmic dependency of the number of OTUs y on the number of sequence reads x(y = a ln (x) + b). Parameters a and b of this model were estimated by least squares best fit of observed data points.

As a consequence, application of a strict pipeline for dataset curation is a crucial component of data analysis. In this study, we evaluated the error in amplicon pyrosequencing methods using laboratory-created mock communities of oral microorganisms with defined compositions as a training set. Table 1 lists the libraries from mock communities sequenced in this study. Although sequence curation eliminated \u223c35% of low-quality/chimeric sequences, some of these curated datasets still generated more OTUs than the seven expected OTUs contained in mock communities (from 0 to +12 extra OTUs). We have frequently observed that singleton OTUs, defined as OTUs containing only one sequence across datasets, can be manually identified as chimeric sequences. To correct for this, we have added a step to our analysis pipeline to eliminate singleton OTUs. As Table 1 shows, this step decreases the erroneous OTUs appearing in sequenced libraries.",

We used three types of mock communities containing equal numbers of 16S rRNA molecules (mock 1), equal numbers of cells (mock 2) or unequal numbers of cells (mock 3) for seven different oral microorganisms (Table 1). Mock 1 is comprised of genomic DNA and is expected to yield an equal number of reads for each species if PCR and sequencing bias are not present. Mocks 2 and 3 could be affected by both PCR/sequencing bias and by differences in cell lysis procedures. As shown in Fig. 1, mock 1 yielded a greater than expected number of reads for F. nucleatum and lower than expected read numbers for A. oris and L. casei. Starting with known numbers of cells, as in mocks 2 and 3, showed both F. nucleatum and S. oralis as over-represented, a finding that suggests that S. oralis was more easily lysed than other organisms. In addition to being under-represented in mock 1, A. oris and L. casei were also under-represented in mocks 2 and 3, as predicted from PCR bias. Both S. mutans and P. gingivalis appeared in lower abundance than expected only in mocks 2 and 3, a finding that suggests that these organisms are less efficiently lysed. These results demonstrated that although 454-pyrosequencing of amplicon libraries is a powerful technique simultaneously detecting all members in a microbial community, species abundance is subject to empirical bias introduced through methods for DNA isolation and amplification.",

This knowledge is not only required to understand differences among sites, subjects and disease states, but has important experimental implications because most studies using 454 amplicon sequencing are conducted via a multiplexing approach, where multiple samples are sequenced in parallel at a decreased sequencing depth. Hence, it is necessary to be aware of the number of undetected species when interpreting results, especially if communities are compared based solely on membership. From ecological patterns followed by most microbial communities, it is expected that rare species will remain unseen even at a great sequencing depth, because species abundance distribution curves usually show a long tail with most species being rare (Marrugan & McGill, 2011). In ecological terms, the number of species in a given community is known as richness. To investigate richness at two oral sites, we conducted a moderately deep-sequencing survey (at least 30,000 sequences per sample) of the microbial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of three subjects. We then tested the performance of two estimators of richness and coverage as a function of increasing sequencing efforts. The number of observed OTUs and measures of diversity at maximum sequencing effort are shown in Table 2, and the rarefaction curves for these samples are depicted in Fig. 2.",

According to the Good\u2013Turing estimator, richness in all samples was covered to a minimum of 99% (Table 2). Using this estimator, we calculated the minimal number of sequence reads needed to achieve an acceptable level of coverage of 98% (Table 3). Assuming that the number of OTUs at the maximum sequencing effort closely approximates total richness (sampling universe), we then determined the percentage of OTUs (based on total number of OTUs observed), that were actually detected at the sequencing effort predicted to yield 98% coverage. As Table 3 illustrates, if sampling was to terminate at a level of 98% Good\u2013Turing coverage, a great proportion of richness would not be captured as the result of insufficient sampling. These results demonstrate that despite its broad application, Good\u2013Turing alone is not a sufficient measure of richness coverage in microbial community sampling. Moreover, because Good\u2013Turing is based on the number of singletons, its use as an estimator of coverage appears particularly inadequate for less evenly distributed communities, such as those from buccal mucosa (Table 3).",

Hence, we examined the dissimilarity patterns arising from under-sampled versus exhaustively sampled communities. For this analysis we sequenced the communities of two more subjects using a multiplexing approach. The general characteristics and \u03b1-diversity estimates of the salivary and mucosa communities from these two subjects are presented in Tables 2 and \u200band4.4. In agreement with results for deep-sequenced communities, mucosal communities were less diverse, both in terms of richness and evenness, than salivary communities. Dissimilarity analysis of deep-sequenced communities (Fig. 4A), based on the Jaccard index (takes into account membership only), showed no clustering of samples based on site or subject. In contrast, comparison of community structure in deep-sequenced communities by the \u03b8YC measure of dissimilarity (takes into account relative abundance of taxa) clustered communities by site of origin, rather than by subject (P < 0.001).",

Although the Firmicutes as a whole appeared more abundant in mucosa, the cladogram for this phylum, shown in Fig. 10B, demonstrates that this difference was largely caused by Streptococcus and Gemella, and other Firmicutes genera do not display predilection for mucosal surfaces.",

Although the objective of this study was not to compare PCR primer pairs or DNA isolation protocols, we provide evidence from mock communities of oral microorganisms that DNA isolation, PCR and sequencing bias introduce variability into the results that has to be considered when interpreting data. These results also highlight the importance of using standardized operating protocols by different laboratories to make results comparable across the oral research community. The primers used in this study have been assessed by other investigators for their ability to amplify a vast number of bacterial taxa (Sundquist et al., 2007). Using a mock community with the same number of 16S rRNA copies (mock 1), we confirm that this primer pair detected all species in the community but their relative abundances differed from those expected. After checking the primer pair for mismatches to the 16S rRNA gene from sequences in the RDP, we could not attribute the results obtained to primer mismatches. In fact, the reverse primer had one mismatch to F. nucleatum, an organism over-represented in mock communities, but no sequence mismatches were present with L. casei, an under-represented organism. Hence, other parameters such as different primer binding energies or interferences from DNA flanking the template region may better explain the observed quantitative results (Hansen et al., 1998; Polz & Cavanaugh, 1998).",

Despite this, sequence analysis of mock 2 (equal number of cells) did not yield an evenly distributed community, nor a community that resembled the abundances in mock 1. Mocks 2 and 3 showed biases in the same species, which suggests that the actual relative abundance of species in the community does not unduly influence the bias introduced. The species with greater over-representation in mocks 2 and 3 as a consequence of DNA-isolation bias was S. oralis. This finding agrees with previously published results demonstrating over-representation of streptococci after 16S rRNA amplification, cloning and Sanger sequencing (Kroes et al., 1999) and disagrees with our previous findings that streptococci were accurately represented after Sanger methods (Diaz et al., 2006). These discrepancies could be explained by intra-genus variability in lysis efficiency, as exemplified by S. mutans under-representation in mocks 2 and 3. Although such findings of inherent biases may discourage the use of an open-ended molecular method, they do not diminish the great advantages of using powerful high-throughput approaches, which can reveal the breadth and depth of bacterial diversity in a given sample. They do, however, highlight the importance of investigator awareness of limitations, and adoption of standardized protocols when possible to minimize errors.",

By removing singleton OTUs we are able to decrease the number of erroneous OTUs to almost zero. Most singleton OTUs appeared to be chimeric sequences, in agreement with recent results (Schloss et al., 2011). This improvement is of great advantage when using deep-sequenced data to determine richness because the inclusion of amplification and sequencing artifacts could cause rarefaction curves to appear as never leveling. Although application of this correction to real samples could eliminate true taxa, this is preferable to the inclusion of erroneous OTUs, which artifactually increase dissimilarity among datasets. Elimination of singleton OTUs may not be necessary once chimera detection methods improve. It is also noteworthy that mock communities were not deep-sequenced and the number of erroneous OTUs could increase with sequencing effort, as recently reported (Schloss et al., 2011). As a consequence, our deep-sequenced samples could contain more erroneous OTUs than those reported for mock communities. However, this increase is expected to occur in a linear fashion and it may not greatly affect the richness results. It could partly account, however, for the lack of a complete asymptote in rarefaction curves, although it is also expected that not all richness was sampled.",

Deep-sequencing of three subjects allowed us to capture a number of OTUs close to those in the sampling universe. Results demonstrated that basing coverage on Good\u2013Turing's estimator greatly underestimates the number of sequences needed to achieve acceptable coverage of richness. catchall provided results that better approximated reality and was more accurate when used in uneven communities than Good\u2013Turing. We also show that catchall rapidly stabilizes and so, after obtaining \u223c3000\u20135000 sequences, it can be used as a reliable estimator of total richness in a sample, even though detection of nearly all OTUs would require 100 times more sequences. Hence, although Good\u2013Turing is widely used by microbial ecologists, these results confirm that this non-parametric estimator is downwardly biased and of lower accuracy. Reduction of sequencing error and the identification of an estimator that reliably predicts total richness allowed us then to answer the question of how many OTUs existed in the microbial communities sampled. This analysis resulted in a range of observed OTUs at each site of 63\u2013318, and total estimated OTUs at each site from 111 to 377. These results are in striking agreement with findings of Zaura et al. (2009), who reported a range of 123\u2013326 OTUs (also defined at 3% dissimilarity) in each oral site they sampled. Richness detected in other oral sites may be higher and may also increase as communities associated with individuals suffering from oral disease are analysed by future studies, because an increased diversity is believed to be associated with the development of conditions such as periodontal disease (Paster et al., 2001; Diaz, 2012).",

Our analysis demonstrates that a large number of sequences is required to completely cover the richness in salivary or mucosal samples. If communities are compared based on prevalence data, it may be necessary to sample to a greater depth to conclude that a specific phylotype is absent. A similar limitation applies to studies that aim at defining the core oral microbiome, those phylotypes highly prevalent in all human hosts, which will most likely be impacted by under-sampling. We demonstrate, however, that comparing communities based on structure is more feasible than comparisons based on membership. Moreover, depending on the effect size measured, it may not be necessary to achieve great richness coverage. As few as 40 sequences were able to discriminate between saliva and buccal mucosa communities because of considerable differences in structures. Clearly, researchers will benefit from preliminary studies like the one herein to define sequencing depth and associated costs before embarking on large-scale sequencing enterprises.",

For instance, our results agree with those of Aas et al. (2005), in that S. mitis, S. mitis bv. 2 and G. haemolysans were the predominant species of the buccal epithelium. It is interesting to highlight the intra-genus variability in the affinity of microorganisms for buccal mucosal surfaces because several cultured and uncultured streptococci other than S. mitis, as well as Gemella sanguinis, are over-represented in saliva (see Supplementary material, Table S2). These differences in fine-scale biogeography support the concept of an interplay between environmental selection and microbial traits as a driving force of community assemblage. The attachment of S. mitis to oral epithelial surfaces is mediated by adhesins that bind to sialic acid receptors (Gibbons, 1989; Childs & Gibbons, 1990). The mechanism used by G. haemolysans has not been studied. The abundance of these microorganisms at mucosal surfaces during health suggests a role as prime commensals of the oral cavity of humans. Discerning the mechanisms by which they interact with, and are tolerated by the host as well as their interactions with mucosal pathogens will be important to understand how the dynamics of the host\u2013oral flora cross-talk may promote health or disease.",

(2003) used the checkerboard DNA\u2013DNA hybridization technique to evaluate the presence and abundance of 40 bacterial species in healthy individuals. Our results and the latter study agree in finding Veillonella parvula, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium periodonticum and S. mitis as predominant microorganisms in the saliva of healthy individuals. Our study broadens this knowledge base by demonstrating that 11 of the 25 most abundant organisms in saliva across individuals were uncultured \u2018species-level\u2019 phylotypes, belonging to the genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter and Rothia. Of particular interest is the great abundance of Porphyromonas and Prevotella sp., organisms typically thought to favor the subgingival environment because of their oxygen requirements. In a previous study we identified these two genera as present in initial communities formed for 4 or 8 h on the enamel surfaces of healthy individuals (Diaz et al., 2006), a finding in agreement with their pronounced abundance in saliva and their low affinity for soft tissues. Characterization of the properties of these uncultured Prevotella and Porphyromonas species and comparison with cultured species such as Porphyromonas gingivalis or Prevotella nigrescens that are considered pathogenic microorganisms of the subgingival environment (Socransky et al., 1998), remains a question for future investigations. The high abundance of the genus Neisseria in saliva and its low abundance at mucosal surfaces are also interesting findings. Species of Neisseria, in particular Neisseria mucosa, have not been previously demonstrated to differ among oral sites (Mager et al., 2003). Here we show species-level phylotypes identified as Neisseria sicca and Neisseria flavescens present in great abundance in saliva and with low affinity for buccal mucosal surfaces. One speculation is that the great abundance of obligate anaerobes in saliva may depend on the presence of these aerobic, oxygen-metabolizing organisms, as has been suggested by in vitro modeling of oral bacterial consortia (Bradshaw et al., 1996).",

However, investigators using this strategy should be aware of limitations and minimize technical error by accounting for it in the design of experimental studies and data analysis. Use of similar operating procedures among oral researchers is highly encouraged. It is also advisable to use a mock community of oral organisms to refine protocols before under-taking large-scale studies. Researchers should also determine the best sequencing effort needed based on their specific study question. Studies directed at determining the existence of a core microbiome in the oral cavity should first assess coverage with a reliable estimator such as catchall before concluding on differences or commonalities. Studies interested in determining drivers of community structure should first determine optimal sequencing depth, depending on the effect size of the expected change. By using these methods we present evidence that fine-scale biogeography variation within the oral cavity is larger than inter-subject variability in the structure of either salivary or mucosal communities. This finding enables the use of 16S rRNA community profiling to understand microbial shifts associated with the development of mucosal disease.",
