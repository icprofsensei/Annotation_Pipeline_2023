Here we characterized the taxonomic and derived functional profiles of gastric microbiota in two different sets of gastric cancer patients, and compared them with microbial profiles in other body sites. Paired non-malignant and tumor tissues were sampled from 160 gastric cancer patients with 80 from China and 80 from Mexico. The 16S rRNA gene V3\u2013V4 region was sequenced using MiSeq platform for taxonomic profiles. PICRUSt was used to predict functional profiles. Human Microbiome Project was used for comparison. We showed that Hp is the most abundant member of gastric microbiota in both Chinese and Mexican samples (51 and 24%, respectively), followed by oral-associated bacteria. Taxonomic (phylum-level) profiles of stomach microbiota resembled oral microbiota, especially when the Helicobacter reads were removed. The functional profiles of stomach microbiota, however, were distinct from those found in other body sites and had higher inter-subject dissimilarity. Gastric microbiota composition did not differ by Hp colonization status or stomach anatomic sites, but did differ between paired non-malignant and tumor tissues in either Chinese or Mexican samples. Our study showed that Hp is the dominant member of the non-malignant gastric tissue microbiota in many gastric cancer patients. Our results provide insights on the gastric microbiota composition and function in gastric cancer patients, which may have important clinical implications.",

GC incidence varies widely with high rates in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central and South America, and low rates in North America and Africa (Carneiro, 2014). GC may arise in cardia or in non-cardia (the fundus, body, or pylorus section). Chronic colonization of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is known to increase the risk of non-cardia cancer (Cavaleiro-Pinto et al., 2011). The association between Hp colonization and gastric cardia cancer varies by populations. The studies in Western countries tend to show a neutral or even negative association while in Eastern populations namely China, Japan, and Korea, there is strong evidence of a higher risk of cardia cancer among subjects with Hp colonization (Cavaleiro-Pinto et al., 2011).",

Atrophic gastritis, the loss of specialized glandular tissue with impaired acid secretion and differentiation of gastric progenitor cells, results in hypochlorhydria in the stomach. It is generally believed that Hp prefers a healthy gastric mucosa and that as the steps to GC progress, Hp is also gradually fading, until it disappears. Therefore, the stomachs of patients with GC should facilitate the colonization of the gastric mucosa by bacteria other than Hp (Sheh and Fox, 2013). Studies of gastric microbiota are sparse. Previous studies were often small, not in GC patients or used biopsy samples collected during endoscopy, which may have led to contamination from the oral cavity (see Supplementary Table 1 for summary of previous studies). Therefore, gastric microbiota in GC patients remains largely unknown.",

The taxonomic and functional profiles for these samples are shown in Supplementary Figure 3. The average profiles for both non-malignant and tumor sample groups are shown in Figure \u200bFigure2.2. Similar to the profiles in non-malignant tissues, the tumor gastric microbiota for both sample sets was also mainly composed of Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes in Chinese tumor samples or Firmicutes in Mexican tumor samples (Supplementary Figure 3A vs. Figure \u200bFigure2A).2A). The genus with the most abundance in both tumor sample sets was Helicobacter (Supplementary Figure 3B vs. Figure \u200bFigure2B)2B) with average relative abundance of 21% in Chinese samples and 18% in Mexican samples. Compared to non-malignant tissues, tumor tissue had less Proteobacteria, and higher Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Spirochaetes in Chinese samples. There was no significant change in Mexican samples in phylum-level taxa (Supplementary Table 5). At the genus level, tumor tissue had lower Helicobacter abundance relative to non-malignant tissue in both Chinese and Mexican samples. Chinese samples showed substantial differences in alpha diversity as well as several other genus taxa. Mexican samples showed differences in Clostridia relative abundance, but did not display differences in alpha diversity measures (Supplementary Table 5). Hp relative abundance was also lower in tumor tissues compared to matched non-malignant tissues in both sample sets (Supplementary Table 5). However, the majority of tumor tissues (94% Chinese and 56% Mexican) were colonized by Hp, and many tumor samples (20% Chinese and 17% Mexican) were dominated by Hp (Hp relative abundance >50%; Table \u200bTable11).",

The principal coordinates plots based on taxonomic profiles (phylum-level) demonstrated the primary clustering of samples by body sites (Figures 4A,B). The stomach samples, Chinse or Mexico, largely overlapping with oral sample cluster, which was clearer when Helicobacter reads were removed (Figures 4A,B). Compared to the principal coordinates plots based on taxonomic profiles, the plots based on functional profiles (KEGG modules) showed a much clearer pattern of clustering by body sites (Figure \u200b(Figure4A4A vs. Figure \u200bFigure4C,4C, Figure \u200bFigure4B4B vs. Figure \u200bFigure4D).4D). The stomach samples, with or without Helicobacter reads removed, either Mexico or Chinese samples, did not cluster with the other body sites, but they also did not cluster with each other as closely as the samples in the other body sites. It suggested higher inter-subject dissimilarity in stomach samples than in the other body sites in functional profiles. The inter-subject dissimilarity by body sites based on Bray-Curtis distance of phylum/KEGG module profiles were then evaluated (Supplementary Figure 5). Mexican stomach samples had the highest inter-subject dissimilarity in phylum profiles. The Chinese samples, however, had inter-subject dissimilarity higher than the other body sites only when Helicobacter reads were removed (Supplementary Figure 5A). This might be due to the fact that almost all Chinese samples (94%) had Helicobacter. The inter-subject dissimilarity in functional profiles was much higher in the stomachs of both sample sets than in other body sites (Supplementary Figure 5B).",

The principal coordinates plots of Bray\u2013Curtis distance matrix based on phylum-level taxonomic profiles suggested that stomach samples largely overlapped with oral samples. The principal coordinates plots based on functional profiles, however, suggested that stomach microbiota was distinct from the microbiota of other body sites, and had higher inter-subject dissimilarity. We found no differences in microbiota composition by anatomic site or Hp status, although we had only limited sample size to detect differences. We did find that the relative abundance of Hp was higher in non-malignant than in tumor tissues for both Chinese and Mexican samples.",

Therefore, GC patients have been hypothesized to have diminished or no colonization of Hp in the stomach (Sheh and Fox, 2013). Previous studies of gastric microbiota in GC patients were limited, small, and found inconsistent results (summarized in Supplementary Table 1). Studies from Sweden (Eun et al., 2014) and Mexico (Aviles-Jimenez et al., 2014) did not identify Hp as the dominant species in any of the samples evaluated, while four other studies in Korea, Taiwan and USA showed results consistent with our finding with Hp as the dominant species in GC samples (Dicksved et al., 2009; Eun et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Tseng et al., 2016). This difference between studies might be due to Hp prevalence heterogeneity across study samples. A recent study of 212 chronic gastritis and 103 GC patients in China that used quantitative PCR showed that the bacteria load in the gastric mucosa was increased in cancer patients compared to gastritis patients, and the bacterial load was positively correlated with Hp quantity (R = 0.38, P < 0.001), suggesting Hp colonization in GC patients (Wang et al., 2016). In the current study, we found that many Chinese and Mexican GC patients had stomachs dominated by Hp. This finding may be relevant to the decision-making of GC treatment. Endoscopic resection has been considered the first line of treatment for early GC in Korea and Japan because it is minimally invasive and effective (Chung et al., 2009; Isomoto et al., 2009). Several studies have shown a benefit for Hp eradication in reducing metachronous tumors after resection for early gastric cancer (Fukase et al., 2008; Bang et al., 2015). Our data suggest that the majority of patients diagnosed with GC in these populations have current Hp colonization and this may explain why eradication therapy at time of diagnosis may be beneficial.",

This finding of less variation in function than in taxa is consistent with functional redundancy across taxa and suggests that taxonomically distinct microbes may have similar functions. Therefore, analysis of functional modules appears to provide insights that analysis of phyla alone may not be able to identify. For example, we showed that stomach microbiota was distinct from microbiotas in other body sites in functional profiles, but not in taxonomical profiles. In addition, inter-subject dissimilarity in functional profiles is much higher in stomach than in other body sites. However, it is important to note that the functional profiles were based on prediction only. Therefore, it is possible that prediction-based biases toward well-documented microbial genomes resulted from exclusion of unknown or poorly documented taxa. Further studies are needed to validate these findings.",

However, the difference in the gastric microbiota by host Hp colonization status is not fully understood. Consistent with our findings, a study in the United States showed that the relative abundance of non-Hp bacteria in Hp+ subjects was not altered compared to Hp\u2212 subjects when Hp sequences were eliminated from the analysis (Bik et al., 2006). A study in China however suggested that the major influence of Hp on microbiota is the increased bacterial load in the stomach, not the relative abundance of non-Hp bacteria groups (Wang et al., 2015). In contrast, a small study of 10 Amerindians and 2 non-Amerindians using the PhyloChip reported marked differences in relative abundance of non-Hp bacteria by Hp status (Maldonado-Contreras et al., 2011). Our study examined cancer patients, and thus Hp\u2212 GC patients may have a prior history of Hp colonization. Larger studies in subjects without GC using advanced sequencing technology are needed.",

This observation might suggest the change of local environment in tumor (e.g., reduction of acid secretion) compared to non-malignant tissues, which leads to Hp diminution and corresponding microbial functional changes in tumor. Whether these changes contribute to gastric carcinogenesis or tumor progression require further investigation. Our recent study of the Chinese sample set suggested that the changes in the gastric microbiota including Hp relative abundance in non-malignant tissue were associated with cancer risk factors and clinical outcomes including family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer and tumor grades (Yu et al., 2017). Similar associations were, however, not found in the tumor tissues or in the Mexican sample set (data not shown).",

Although, it is the largest study of the gastric non-malignant tissue microbiota from GC patients to date, it includes samples from two different populations with different rates and types of GC. The non-malignant tissue samples were obtained distant but unmeasured from the tumor lesion under sterile conditions and were frozen immediately. Also, unlike most studies of gastric microbiota, we analyzed not only the taxonomic profiles and Hp relative abundance, but also virtual reconstructed functional profiles. We compared our gastric tissue data to the HMP data, which included different populations, DNA extraction techniques, and sequencing platforms. We tried to minimize the effects of these differences by restricting our comparisons to the highest and least variable taxonomic level (phylum-level) and functional entity (KEGG module). In addition, a meta-analysis of microbiota studies suggested that differences in microbial populations across body sites are larger than those driven by the experimental protocols, age, geography, and other population characteristics (Lozupone et al., 2013). Another limitation was the use of a DNA extraction method without a bead-beating step. However, we showed that although we may have missed certain bacteria with potentially hard-to-break cell membranes, these bacteria were rare and should not have adversely affected our conclusions. Finally, our study was restricted to cancer patients and we did not have gastric samples from subjects without GC for comparison. Therefore, we cannot evaluate whether results found in GC patients generalize to subjects without GC.",
