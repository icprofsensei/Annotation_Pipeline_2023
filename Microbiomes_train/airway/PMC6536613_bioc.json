The aims of this study were to identify unique microbial signatures of the lung microbiome and analyze microbial gene function in IPF patients. DNA isolated from BALF samples was obtained for high-throughput gene sequencing. Microbial metagenomic data were used for principal component analysis (PCA) and analyzed at different taxonomic levels. Shotgun metagenomic data were annotated using the KEGG database and were analyzed for functional and metabolic pathways. In this study, 17 IPF patients and 38 healthy subjects (smokers and non-smokers) were recruited. For the PCA, the first and the second principal component explained 16.3 and 13.4% of the overall variability, respectively. The \u03b2 diversity of microbiome was reduced in the IPF group. Signature of IPF's microbes was enriched of Streptococcus, Pseudobutyrivibrio, and Anaerorhabdus. The translocation of lung microbiome was shown that 32.84% of them were from oral. After analysis of gene function, ABC transporter systems, biofilm formation, and two-component regulatory system were enriched in IPF patients' microbiome. Here we shown the microbiology characteristics in IPF patients. The microbiome may participate in altering internal conditions and involving in generating antibiotic resistance in IPF patients.",

We performed paired-end sequencing on 2 \u00d7 100 base pairs (bp) or single-end sequencing on 100 bp. The base-calling pipeline was used to process raw fluorescent images and to call sequences. Reads that mapped to the human genome (hg19) were removed from each sample with BWA MEM using the default parameter (Li and Durbin, 2009). For quality control, we employed Trimmomatic (version 0.36) with the following criteria: (a) scan the read with a 4-base-wide sliding window, cutting when the average quality per base drops below 15; (b) drop reads below 50 bases in length; and (c) remove leading/tailing low quality (Q < 13). This produced an average of 8.5 gigabases (Gb) of high-quality sequences for each sample, resulting in a total of 470 Gb of sequence data (Supplementary Table 1). The reads were assembled into contigs for all samples using the assembly software IDBA (version 1.1.1) (Peng et al., 2012). IDBA was applied for Illumina short read assembly with the parameters \u201c\u2013pre_correction \u2013mink 30 \u2013maxk 120 \u2013step 10.\u201d Then, we removed ambiguous bases from the assembled scaffolds and discarded scaffolds with lengths less than 500 bp. Finally, 73% of the total reads were used to generate 88,761 contigs without ambiguous bases (minimum length of 500 bp). These contigs had a total length of 210,670,314 bp, an average N50 length of 4,151 bp and ranged from 503 to 620,529 bp.",

Intrinsic differences in lung microbiota composition are shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 2. Species with a median relative abundance larger than 0.01% of the total abundance in either the control group or the IPF group were included for comparison. Furthermore, we imported taxonomic data into QIIME for comparison. At the phylum level, Firmicutes (ANOVA, P-value = 0.02) and Fusobacterium (ANOVA, P-value = 0.04) dominated the BALF microbial communities in both groups (Figure 2).

BALF biodiversity was significantly reduced (P-value = 0.01) in the IPF group compared with that in the smoking/non-smoking groups according to the ADONIS results. A similar grouping pattern was identified based on the Bray-Curtis matrix using hclust2 (Figure 3). We identified the following two groups that were differentiated based on combinations of sex, age, and condition: Group 1, opportunistic pathogenic bacteria primarily derived from the skin and mouth, according to study of Blauwkamp (Blauwkamp et al., 2019); and Group 2, bacteria derived from the gut. These two groups were similar to those identified by ANOSIM. Mantel tests of the vegan package revealed the significant correlation of community structure with a P-value = 0.001 (Mantel Statistic R: 0.3057).",

A total of 2,707 KOs were identified either in healthy controls or IPF samples. We further mapped these KOs to KEGG modules and pathways and calculated the adjusted P-value for the hypergeometric distribution. In particular, ABC transporter systems, the two-component regulatory system, biofilm formation, methane metabolism, aromatic compound degradation, amino acid biosynthesis (including alanine, tyrosine, valine and leucine), vitamin biosynthesis, biotin metabolism, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were enriched in the IPF group (Supplementary Figure 2). Among these pathways, the ABC transporter system, which imports amino acids, represented the majority of the enriched genes in the IPF group (Supplementary Figure 3). Multidrug efflux genes, which contribute to drug resistance, were enriched in the IPF group. According to ARDB databases, antibiotic resistant genes (ARG) was checked and 48 different types of ARGs was identified, which showed in Supplementary Table 5. The relative abundance of identified ARGs in IPF group and healthy control groups (smoking and non-smoking) was shown in Figure 5. Compared with microbial genes from healthy control subjects, genes from IPF group were enriched of ARGS (5/10), including tet40, acrR, evgA, tolC, mdtO, with significantly abundance changes. These ARGs identified in IPF group are related to multidrug efflux, suggesting that the multidrug efflux pumps maybe the primary mechanism for bacteria to extrude antibiotics and other materials (Figure 5A). At the same time, virulence genes were also detected in this research showed in Supplementary Table 6 and the relative abundance of each group was showed in Figure 6.",

Because the human lung was believed to be sterile, it was not included in the original Human Microbiome Project. However, a growing number of studies have revealed the presence of microbial communities in the lungs. Next generation sequencing technology has dramatically improved lung microbiome identification in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic airway diseases, but humanized genomic DNA contamination remains a major technical challenge (Corless et al., 2000; Zoetendal et al., 2006; Salonen et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2010). As shown in our previous study, the use of pure microbial DNA avoids humanized genomic pollution and facilitates investigation of the lung microbiota (Wen et al., 2016).",

The most common pathogenic bacteria in the IPF group were Acinetobacter and Neisseria (at the genus level), and the most common pathogenic viruses were microvirus, simplex virus and varicella virus. The same results had been reported with an increased bacterial load and decreased microbial diversity in BAL samples from IPF patients (Morris et al., 2014). At the same time, there are clear differences in the IPF BAL microbiome (increase in Neisseria, Streptococcus and some other species) compared to healthy subjects, which was also proven in our study. The bacterial load affects survival in these patients whereas retrospective analysis of the lung microbiome in BAL samples from the COMET-cohort suggested that presence of specific Streptococcus operational taxonomic units (OTU) or Staphylococcus OTU was associated with worse outcomes of IPF. These studies were showed the differential microbiome and specific microbial genes changes in BALF isolated from IPF patients, which suggested microbiota-targeted biomarkers may be potential tools for disease diagnosis and predicting prognosis. Biodiversity analysis revealed greater microbiome diversity associated with better lung function in the control group; conversely, the IPF group demonstrated decreased microbial diversity in terms of bacterial gene richness. Analysis of BALF microbiome revealed the appearance of common oral and gut inhabitants in BALF. Notably, shifts in the bacterial make-up of the BALF were associated with the human gut and oral microbiotas. In the IPF group, the majority of inhabitants were derived from the oral microbiome, suggesting they shifted from the mouth and throat. Comparison of BALF microbial genes to oral and gut microbiomes demonstrated that majority genes were from oral source, which hint the potential mechanism of oral aspiration as a risk factor in pathogenesis of IPF.",

To identify the functions of the BALF genome, gene length and copy number were normalized, and the relative frequencies of different functions were deduced based on the number of genes recruited to different EggNOG clusters. ABC transporter systems, the two-component regulatory system, biofilm formation, amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis, and central carbon metabolism were enriched in the IPF group. Not surprisingly, projection of the range clusters in KEGG metabolic pathways provided highly explicit directions associated with antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is a natural response of bacteria to antibiotic exposure (Sherrard et al., 2014). Antimicrobial resistance may be intrinsic to a bacterium, arise from spontaneous genetic mutations, or be associated with horizontal gene transfer (Sherrard et al., 2014). The enrichment of ABC transporters and biofilm formation signals indicates the presence of major antimicrobial resistance pathways in the IPF lung.",

In some antibiotic-producing or drug-resistant bacteria, particularly Gram-negative bacteria, ABC systems are responsible for the active efflux of drugs and other harmful compounds across the cell envelope (Seeger and Van Veen, 2009). Relative abundance of multidrug efflux genes were increased in IPF group compared with healthy controls which listed in this research. Furthermore, the virulence factors also evaluated in this research and showed significant differences between IPF group and control group. Biofilm formation is a feature of chronic airway infection. Bacteria growing in biofilms are embedded in a matrix of exopolymeric substances and are much more resistant to antibiotics than organisms growing planktonically (Stewart and Costerton, 2001; Wu et al., 2015). Together, these findings emphasize antimicrobial resistance as a primary function of the BALF ecosystem.",

The interesting modules and pathways found in this project suggest the BALF microbiome in IPF patients is related to antibiotic resistance. Therefore, more therapeutic options for IPF may become available through the adaptation of lung environments or the identification of beneficial probiotic microorganisms. Further studies in this area will lead to a deeper understanding of bacterial life in the BALF.",
