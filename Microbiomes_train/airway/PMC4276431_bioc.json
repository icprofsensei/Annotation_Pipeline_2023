Outcomes of lung transplantation are known to be influenced by several recognized respiratory viruses, but global understanding of the virome of the transplanted lung is incomplete. To define the DNA virome within the respiratory tract following lung transplantation we carried out metagenomic analysis of allograft bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and compared to healthy and HIV+ subjects. Viral concentrates were purified from BAL and analyzed by shotgun DNA sequencing. All of the BAL samples contained reads mapping to anelloviruses, with high proportions in lung transplant samples. Anellovirus populations in transplant recipients were complex, with multiple concurrent variants. Q-PCR quantification revealed that anellovirus sequences were 56-fold more abundant in BAL from lung transplant recipients compared with healthy controls or HIV+ subjects (p<0.0001). Anellovirus sequences were also more abundant in upper respiratory tract specimens from lung transplant recipients than controls (p=0.006). Comparison to metagenomic data on bacterial populations showed that high anellovirus loads correlated with dysbiotic bacterial communities in allograft BAL (p=0.00816). Thus the respiratory tracts of lung transplant recipients contain high levels and complex populations of anelloviruses, warranting studies of anellovirus lung infection and transplant outcome.",

Their small genomes (2.3\u20133.8 kb) consist of three to four open reading frames and a highly conserved untranslated region (UTR) (12). These viruses are ubiquitous in the human population and have not yet been causally linked with any human disease (12, 13).

In the upper respiratory tract, elevated levels of TTV have been found in nasal secretions from children with respiratory diseases, and correlated with disease severity (15, 16). In HIV-infected patients, plasma concentrations of anelloviruses increased during progression to AIDS (18) and decreased following therapy (19). TTV viremia was reported to increase following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and then return to baseline levels following immune reconstitution (10). Recently, TTV levels in blood were shown to increase in association with immunosuppression following lung and heart transplantation (11). The association between TTV levels and immune status has led some authors to propose that anelloviruses genome copy numbers may serve as an empirical measure of successful immune suppression (10, 11, 19).",

Based on these metagenomic data, we then quantified anellovirus levels within the lungs and upper respiratory tracts of lung transplant recipients, HIV+ subjects, and healthy individuals using Q-PCR, demonstrating high levels of anellovirus DNA in BAL and OW of lung transplant recipients. Our findings demonstrate metagenomic detection and genetic characterization of the allograft virome, which is then followed by broader quantitative analysis.

Based on the closest match to reference viruses, a wide variety of anelloviruses were present within the lungs of lung transplant subjects, while substantially fewer anellovirus reads were detected in lungs of HIV+ individuals (Figure 2A). Furthermore, diverse anelloviruses were present in single individuals, especially in the lung transplant recipients, as evidenced by reads aligning to many different TTVs, TTMVs, TTMVDs, and SAVs within single samples (Table 1).",

To determine whether use of the 0.22 micron filter step during virus purification may have resulted in depletion of some of the larger viruses, we compared filtration and centrifugation (Table S6). This showed that filtration resulted in reduced recovery of herpesviruses, but was more efficient at capturing small viruses such as human papillomaviruses and anelloviruses.",

To validate correct contig assembly, we designed specific primer sets for three of the contigs, then PCR amplified 500\u2013700 base pair regions, sequenced using the Sanger method, and assembled using the conventional overlap method. Assembled contigs were then aligned to the NCBI nt database (Figure 2B). Selected regions within the anellovirus contigs were 87\u201393% identical to the reference sequences, though highly divergent regions were also detected. Anellovirus open reading frames (ORF) 1 and 2 were identified in the three anellovirus contigs. ORF1 was previously shown to encode the capsid gene and contains a hypervariable region, which may evolve rapidly to evade the host immune response (12). The ORF2 encoded protein was reported to suppress the NF-\u039aB pathway, thereby potentially regulating the host innate and adaptive immune response (12, 31).",

Previously, DNA was purified from whole BAL, PCR ampified using primers that recognize conserved regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, and products analyzed by deep sequencing (20). That analysis showed that lung transplant bacterial communities differed in composition from healthy subjects, and transplant recipients were commonly colonized by oral bacteria, known pathogenic bacteria, and sometimes by unexpected bacterial lineages. Absolute levels of bacteria were also higher than in healthy controls (40\u2013100-fold). Here we compared the anellovirus titers with bacterial community composition among transplant recipients, and found a significant correlation (Figure 7; weighted UniFrac, p=0.032). However, no specific bacterial lineages were significantly linked to anellovirus levels among transplant subjects. We then asked if the relationship between anellovirus and 16S bacterial composition might be linked to the degree to which the bacterial communities diverged from healthy controls. This analysis revealed a significant correlation between transplant BAL anellovirus levels and a metric measuring the divergence between the corresponding bacterial community and those of healthy subjects (Figure S1; p=0.008). Thus, high anellovirus levels in transplant recipients are also associated with aberrant bacterial microbiota.",

Our most notable finding was that the anelloviruses, including TTVs, TTMVDs, TTMVs, and SAVs, were greatly increased in abundance in the lungs and the upper respiratory tract of lung transplant recipients compared with healthy and HIV+ subjects. As this work was being completed, Quake and colleagues reported that anellovirus sequences were increased in abundance in blood in organ transplant recipients (11).

A notable feature of transplant recipients was the great diversity of anelloviruses represented within single individuals. Quantifying the exact number of different forms is challenging and dependent on the metric chosen. Taking each independent contig into account, there were up to 247 contigs identified as anelloviruses within one sample (Tx-24). However, this may be an overestimate because some contigs are only partial genomes (sizes ranged from 250\u20133600 base pairs), though this is hard to assess definitively because replication-competent subviral molecules have been reported (32). Analysis based on viral ORF1 regions showed that up to 17 different anelloviruses were present within a single transplant recipient (Tx-24), indicating remarkable diversity. Some of the anelloviruses identified in these subjects were distant in sequence from database genomes. Such high divergence was confirmed in the three genomes reconstructed by Sanger sequencing, and so is not a result of error in Illumina sequence determination or assembly. The origin of this extreme diversity is unclear, but may be due in part to the known high mutation rates of single-stranded DNA viruses (33) combined with high virus levels likely reflecting high rates of virus replication in lung.",

This is likely in large part related to the near-universal use of herpesviruses prophylaxis in transplant subjects, and relatively modest level of immune dysfunction based on CD4+ T cell counts in our HIV+ subjects. In addition, samples for metagenomic analysis were subject to multiple displacement amplification, which favors small circular genomes such as anelloviruses. An additional technical factor may be that the filtration step used could have depleted large viruses or viral particles bound to other macromolecules, although reconstruction experiments suggest that the losses were modest. In addition, a large proportion of sequences did not match any database genomes, which is concordant with findings in other metagenomic virome studies (6, 9, 29). While many of these are likely novel bacterophages, it is possible that novel mammalian viruses may exist within those sequences as well. One limitation of our sample set is the relatively short elapsed time since transplant (median of 5 months), and it will be useful to investigate whether additional viral lineages emerge over longer times.",
