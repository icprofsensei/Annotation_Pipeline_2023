This study investigates salivary microbes and inflammatory cytokines as biomarkers for HNSCC, with consideration of oral health. Saliva was collected from 30 participants, including 14 HNSCC patients and 16 participants representing both dentally compromised and healthy individuals. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed based on 16S rRNA gene and ITS1 amplicon sequencing, respectively, and concentrations of inflammatory cytokines were quantified using a cytometric bead array, with flow cytometry. Diversity\u2010based analyses revealed that the bacterial communities of HNSCC patients were significantly different to those of the healthy control group but not the dentally compromised patients. Fungal communities were dominated by Candida, irrespective of cohort, with Candida albicans comprising \u226596% of fungal sequences in most HNSCC patients. Significantly higher concentrations of interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20108 were detected in HNSCC and dentally compromised patients, when independently compared with healthy controls. IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20108 concentrations were significantly positively correlated with the abundance of C.\u00a0albicans. Our findings suggest that salivary microbial and inflammatory biomarkers of HNSCC are influenced by oral health.",

Emerging hypotheses suggest that oral microbial imbalances and variations to microbial community structure may modulate viral infections by regulating host susceptibility to oncogenic viruses (Vyshenska, Lam, Shulzhenko, & Morgun, 2017).",

Recent studies suggest that increases in the relative abundances of several bacterial genera (including Dialister, Selenomonas, Streptococcus, and Treponema) occur in the saliva of oral cancer patients, when compared with healthy controls (Guerrero\u2010Preston et al., 2016; Pushalkar et al., 2011; Wolf, Moissl\u2010Eichinger, Perras, Koskinen, & Peter, 2017). Although Streptococcus anginosus has been implicated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC; Morita et al., 2003; Tateda et al., 2000), a majority of the focus has been on Porphyromonas gingivalis, which displays oncogenic properties directly linked to oral carcinogenesis (Ha et al., 2015). Detection of P.\u00a0gingivalis and other oral pathobionts in healthy subjects makes it difficult to attribute carcinogenic potential to specific bacteria (Katz, Onate, Pauley, Bhattacharyya, & Cha, 2011). Candida albicans is implicated in carcinogenesis because of its capacity to produce carcinogenic levels of acetaldehyde and induce host immune responses (Ramirez\u2010Garcia et al., 2016). Candidiasis may play a role in the malignant transformation of oral lesions (Bakri, Hussaini, Holmes, Cannon, & Rich, 2010). Furthermore, C.\u00a0albicans is overrepresented (average relative abundance of 61.2%) in the mycobiome of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) biopsies (Perera et al., 2017).",

The V3\u2013V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified using primers 341F and 806R (Klindworth et al., 2013), both with Illumina compatible overhang adapter sequences. Each PCR reaction contained HotStar PCR Buffer (1\u00d7), 2\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.5\u00a0mM of each dNTP, 0.5\u00a0U HotStar DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, NRW, Germany), 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm of each primer, 1\u00a0\u03bcl of gDNA template and PCR\u2010grade water to a final volume of 25\u00a0\u03bcl. Positive and negative PCR controls were included (Escherichia coli and water, respectively). PCR was performed using the following conditions: Initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, followed by 32\u00a0cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s), annealing (55\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s), and extension (70\u00b0C for 40\u00a0s), with a final extension step at 70\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min. For the fungal PCR reactions, Illumina\u2010compatible primers ITS1F (Gardes & Bruns, 1993) and ITS2 (White, Bruns, Lee, & Taylor, 1990) were substituted in to amplify the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of fungal DNA. C.\u00a0albicans was used as a positive control and water as a negative control. Fungal PCR conditions deviated from those described for bacteria as follows: annealing temperature was reduced to 50\u00b0C and thermocycling increased to 38\u00a0cycles to account for expected lower fungal biomass (Vesty et al., 2017). Duplicate PCR reactions were prepared for sequencing as previously described (Vesty et al., 2017). Samples were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, through New Zealand Genomics Ltd.

Multivariate dispersions were compared based on the distance of each sample to the median of their disease group.

The remaining samples from all disease groups were largely dominated by Candida (Figure\u00a01b). NCBI BLAST checks of OTUs belonging to the Candida genus revealed C.\u00a0albicans (100% sequence identity) comprised on average about 80% of obtained sequence reads across all disease groups. However, fungal communities in HNSCC patients were almost entirely since of C.\u00a0albicans (individual relative abundances of 96\u2013100%). There was one exception where the mycobiome comprised 99.6% Candida tropicalis (NCBI BLAST 100% sequence identity), however, no obvious characteristic differentiated this HNSCC patient from the rest.",

Generally, it is considered that oral microbes contribute to carcinogenesis, potentially accounting for differences observed in the oral microbial communities of head and neck cancer patients. However, it could also be considered that oral microbial communities might be modified as a consequence of the cancer. Saliva\u2010based microbiome studies have not yielded a consensus but do suggest that overall bacterial community composition, rather than the presence of a single pathogen, may be important in head and neck cancer. However, such conclusions can be confounded by the choice of control group and may simply reflect oral health\u2010related differences rather than differences related to cancer per se. To clarify this issue, a comparison with a group of dentally compromised patients in addition to healthy controls was included in this study.",

The significantly more diverse mycobiome in dentally compromised patients highlights the overrepresentation of C.\u00a0albicans in HNSCC patients. C.\u00a0albicans has been recognized as an etiological factor in oral carcinogenesis due to its ability to induce host inflammatory responses (Ramirez\u2010Garcia et al., 2016). This observation was supported by our finding that the relative abundance of C.\u00a0albicans was positively correlated with the concentrations of IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20108 in saliva. However, the correlations between C.\u00a0albicans and IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20108 were not particularly strong, potentially reflecting the presence of this OTU in most subjects.",

In vitro, IL\u20106\u2010induced inflammation promotes tumorigenesis in oral cancer cells via aberrant DNA methylation (Gasche, Hoffmann, Boland, & Goel, 2011). IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20108 inflammatory profiles of HNSCC patients suggest the presence of comparable levels of inflammation to dentally compromised patients, with concentrations significantly higher in both of these patient groups when compared independently with healthy controls. Smoking has been linked to lower concentrations of IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, and IL\u20108 in saliva (Rathnayake et al., 2013), and although the healthy control group in this study was composed only of nonsmokers, this group still had the lowest average salivary concentrations of these cytokines. The presence of smokers/ex\u2010smokers in the HNSCC and dentally compromised groups (and absence in the healthy controls) may reflect the epidemiology of head and neck cancer and periodontal disease, and that tobacco use is a strong risk factor for both (Petersen & Ogawa, 2012; Sturgis, Wei, & Spitz, 2004). Periodontal disease is linked with higher salivary concentrations of IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20108 (reviewed by Jaedicke, Preshaw, & Taylor, 2016), yet in this study, it was unclear whether inflammatory profiles were driven by differences in the respective microbial communities, with only weak associations detected between microbial relative abundances and cytokine concentrations.",

Similarly, differentiation of HNSCC and dentally compromised patients based on inflammatory cytokines is limited, with only healthy controls significantly differentiated. However, application of IL\u20106 as a biomarker for HNSCC is potentially relevant due to its increased detection in HNSCC patients, although this finding requires confirmation with a larger cohort. The elevated relative abundance of C.\u00a0albicans as a constituent of the salivary mycobiome is confounded by its presence in both healthy controls and dentally compromised patients.
