The V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by RT-PCR. To sequence the 16S amplicons by Illumina MiSeq platform, dual index adapters were attached using the Nextera XT Index kit. The sequence library preparations were performed according to the 16S library preparation protocol by Illumina (San Diego, CA). The libraries were sequenced using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 Cycles, 250 bp paired-end). After clustering with 97% homology using UCLUST version 1.2.22q (Edgar, 2010), operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated. The representative sequences of the OTUs were collated against the full-length 16S gene database Greengenes (v13.8) to determine the identity and composition of the bacterial genera. The QIIME (v1.8.0) pipeline was used for analysis from the clustering step through alpha diversity. The linear discriminant analysis, combined with effect size measurements (LEfSe), were used to quantitate differential taxonomic and functional pathway abundance between the groups (R vs. NR).",

The gut microbiomes in the ICI responders were significantly enriched with Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Syntrophococcus when compared to those of non-responders. In contrast, the gut microbiomes of the ICI non-responders were significantly abundant with Bilophila, Sutterella, and Parabacteroides when compared to those of responders (Figure 2). Patients with a high abundance of Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Syntrophococcus tended to have a longer TTF when compared to those with a lower abundance. Patients with a low amount of Bilophila and Sutterella had a significantly prolonged TTF than those with a high amount. However, there was no remarkable association between the abundance of Parabacteroides and TTF with ICIs (Figure 3). The alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota was not significantly different between the responders and non-responders and did not influence the TTF (Figure S1).",

Lactobacillus has been reported to promote DC maturation and regulate host immunity in preclinical models (13). These observations suggest that the specific subpopulation enrichment of the gut microbiomes, such as Lactobacillus and Clostridium, may elicit T cell mobilization to the tumors, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effects of ICI treatment. In contrast, a subpopulation of the microbiome, such as Sutterella and Bilophila, was negatively associated with TTF with ICI treatment. These bacteria elicit inflammation within the tumor microenvironment, which may be related to the insensitivity to ICI treatment (14,15). Interestingly, Bilophila-induced inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunctions have been shown to be suppressed by the probiotic, Lactobacillus, in mice models (14). Therefore, the management with probiotics may improve the response to maintenance therapy with ICIs. Further investigations are warranted to improve the clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients with ICIs.",

Third, there may be a bias considering that we obtained data from our domestic hospital only. Forth, we evaluated the outcomes only once based on stool sampling during ICI treatment, and we have not evaluated the influence of ICI treatment on the gut microbiome. Therefore, a further prospective study is warranted to identify the role of the microbiome in evaluating the response to ICIs in NSCLC patients.",
