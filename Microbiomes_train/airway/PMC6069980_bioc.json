Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola also produce VSCs, but additionally produce butyric acid and other volatile organic compounds that cause oral malodour [3, 5\u20137]. Nevertheless, because there are over 700 known bacterial species in the human oral cavity [8, 9], and because several species produce VSCs to varying degrees, the presence of VSCs in the breath cannot be predicted by the presence of specific species. Concentrations of oral malodourous compounds produced by oral bacteria vary according to the type and abundance of species. Interactions between bacterial species may play important roles in the production of VSCs.",

Indeed, some well-known algorithms, such as SVMs, random forests, Bayesian networks, and Gaussian networks, have been applied in genomics, proteomics, systems biology, and numerous other domains [11]. We previously reported prediction of oral malodour from oral microbiota in saliva by using an SVM based on peak areas of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLPs) of the 16S rRNA gene as data for supervised machine-learning methods [10]. Using this training data, the SVM achieved a high classification accuracy of 82%, with a sensitivity of 51% and specificity of 95%. Currently, T-RFLP does not provide economic advantages over 16S RNA sequence analysis. In this study, we devised a more precise classification system using a deep-learning approach based on 16S rRNA sequences with a higher resolution than that of T-RFLP analysis, and compared it with SVM-based prediction.",

The OLT scores were estimated by two of three evaluators using a scale of 0 to 5 [12], and the mean of the scores given by the evaluators was used. The presence of OLT scores \u2265\u20092 among the three evaluators always exceeded 75% (= 0.50).

The value for total VSCs was defined as the sum of the H2S, CH3SH, and CH3SCH3 concentrations. The threshold for marked oral malodour was defined as an OLT score of \u2265\u20093 and total VSC concentration of \u2265\u20090.3 ppm.

T-RFs are generated by digestion with restriction enzyme(s); therefore, the resolution for discrimination of bacterial species is limited by the size of recognition sites within the target fragments and lacks quantitative ability. The costs for 16S rRNA sequence analyses have been reduced by pyrosequencing and other next-generation sequencing techniques. We expected that the higher resolution would improve the recognition rate by SVM and other machine learning systems. Contrary to our expectations, the SVM classifier discriminated between the presence and absence of oral malodour using the amplified 16S rRNA sequences from the saliva samples with an accuracy of 78.9%, similar to that of T-LFs (Table\u00a02).",

Of the genera present at over 5% abundance, Streptococcus, Granulicatella and Rothia were more abundant in the healthy group, whereas Veillonella, Peptostreptococcus, and Porphyromonas were more abundant in the malodourous group. These genera contain oral malodour-associated species, and Porphyromonas spp, in particular, as periodontal bacteria, are strongly suggested to be an oral malodour-producing bacteria [4, 16, 17]. In addition, LEfSe analysis revealed many bacterial species, genera, and families with significantly different relative abundances in oral malodourousand healthy breath. A total of 74 OTUs or OTU groups were noted to be significantly differentially abundant in these groups, with an LDA threshold of 4.0 (Fig.\u00a02). The Bacteroidales order, which includes the genera Prevotella and Porphyromonas, was strongly associated with oral malodour. The results of LEfSe analysis include a cladogram showing the significant differences at different hierarchical levels (Fig.\u00a02\u200b2b).b). In this study, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium was an averaged 0.12%, and Treponema was detected in almost no samples. Thus, VSC concentrations cannot be predicted based on the abundances of some known VSC-producing bacteria, and machine learning techniques are useful.",

Thus, machine learning can be expected to classify oral microorganisms as oral malodourous or non-malodourous, although our first trial with SVM did not show high classification accuracy (Table\u00a02). We next focused on deep learning, which has advanced significantly in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for several years [18]. Application of deep learning in bioinformatics has become a focal point of research [19].",

Notably, the sensitivity is 100%, or false negative rate is 0%. That is, anyone whose oral microbiota is classified as oral malodourous has a high risk of oral malodour. Classification with high sensitivity is desirable for screening or preliminary tests because of the lower number of false negatives, though 97% accuracy is not always expected for such biological data. ROC curve analysis (Fig.\u00a03) suggested that this approach is effective and reliable. Patients concerned about oral malodour could send saliva samples for analysis before medical treatment. Packaging breath is impractical, whereas preparation of a saliva sample is simple, as DNA from oral bacterial cells in the saliva can be dried and transported at room temperature by using FTA cards (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).\n\n",
