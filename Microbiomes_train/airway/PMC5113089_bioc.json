Via a double-blinded, randomised controlled trial of 91 subjects, the impact of CPC-containing oral rinses on supragingival plaque was investigated in experimental gingivitis, where the subjects, after a 21-day period of dental prophylaxis to achieve healthy gingivae, received either CPC rinses or water for 21 days. Within-subject temporal dynamics of plaque microbiota and symptoms of gingivitis were profiled via 16S ribosomal DNA gene pyrosequencing and assessment with the Mazza gingival index. Cetylpyridinium chloride conferred gingival benefits, as progression of gingival inflammation resulting from a lack of dental hygiene was significantly slower in the mouth rinse group than in the water group due to inhibition of 17 gingivitis-enriched bacterial genera. Tracking of plaque \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity revealed that CPC treatment prevents acquisition of new taxa that would otherwise accumulate but maintains the original biodiversity of healthy plaques. Furthermore, CPC rinses reduced the size, local connectivity and microbiota-wide connectivity of the bacterial correlation network, particularly for nodes representing gingivitis-enriched taxa. The findings of this study provide mechanistic insights into the impact of oral rinses on the progression and maturation of dental plaque in the natural human population.",

It achieves this goal by physically interrupting plaque development and keeping plaque in an immature state. The efficacy of this endeavour, however, is often compromised by the presence of hard-to-reach areas, as well as inadequate skill, poor motivation and a lack of compliance.5 Consequently, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinses as a supplement to mechanical oral hygiene regimens is considered a valuable means of enhancing plaque control.6, 7, 8, 9 In particular, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), which carries a long history of safe and effective oral use, has frequently been employed as an antimicrobial ingredient to improve clinical efficacy.10, 11",

The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice were followed. Subjects were recruited from the Beijing area. The 91 total subjects first participated in an oral hygiene phase (Baseline). In this phase, each subject first received dental prophylaxis (supra- and subgingival prophylaxis) and tooth polishing and was then instructed to brush his/her teeth under supervision using a type of anti-cavity toothpaste (Crest Cavity Protection; Procter & Gamble, Guangzhou, China) for 3\u2009min twice a day. This brushing regimen was followed for the next 21 days, resulting in the \u201cBaseline\u201d state of the gingivae. Then, the 91 subjects were randomly assigned into one of two groups: the CPC-treatment group (41 subjects) and the control group (50 subjects). Experimental gingivitis was induced by constraining subject oral hygiene practices, including brushing, flossing and dental prophylaxis, for the next 21 days. No toothpaste was used by any of the subjects during the study. To understand the impact of CPC oral rinses on gingivitis development and oral microbiomes, in the CPC-treatment group, subjects were instructed to return to the clinical site twice daily, at which time they would rinse with 20\u2009mL of mouth rinse (Crest Pro-health Mouth Rinse; Procter & Gamble, Guangzhou, China) for 30\u2009s.

There was no significant difference between the CPC and control groups regarding either smoking status or gender based on a X2-analysis. The 91 human participants sampled consisted of 30 men and 61 women. The proportion of smokers was 24.4% for the CPC group and 26.0% for the control group (Supplementary Table S1).

The Shannon index and genus richness of the control group were significantly elevated from Baseline to Day 21 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P<0.01). However, no significant changes in \u03b1 diversity were observed for the CPC group during the same period (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P>0.05; Figure 2a). At Day 21, \u03b1 diversity was profoundly higher in the control group than in the CPC group (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P<0.01; Figure 2a). The increased microbial richness of the control group during gingivitis progression was driven by the higher detection rate of rare taxa (mean relative abundance <0.001) and the increased abundance of minority taxa (such as Porphyromonas, Corynebacterium, Abiotrophia and TM7) from Baseline to Day 21 (Figure 2b). However, such a trend was absent for the CPC-treatment group. These results indicate that CPC can affect the development of supragingival plaques that underlie gingivitis progression.",

Among these 25 genera, 17 gingivitis-associated genera were significantly inhibited, including Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Peptococcus, Selenomonas, Solobacterium, SR1, Tannerella, TM7 genus, Uncultured_Lachnospiraceae Atopobium, Gemella, Megasphaera, Mogibacterium, Moraxella, Oribacterium and Shuttleworthia (Figures 4a and 4b).

First of all, the size of the CPC group network was smaller than that of the control group, with the former composed of much fewer nodes (29) than the latter (43). Twenty seven nodes were shared between the two networks. Sixteen nodes were specific to the control group network, with nine of them being gingivitis-enriched taxa, such as Leptotrichia and SR1. However, only two nodes, including Actinomyces (gingivitis-depleted taxa) and Campylobacter (gingivitis-enriched taxa), were specific to the CPC group network. Thus, there were ninefold more gingivitis-enriched taxa among control-specific nodes than among CPC-specific nodes, suggesting that CPC may have disrupted certain interactions among gingivitis-enriched taxa during plaque development.",

For example, Prevotella, which is a gingivitis-enriched genus, was found to be connected to 20 other gingivitis-associated bacteria (16 gingivitis-enriched, 3 gingivitis-depleted and 1 neutral) in the control group network; however, it was linked to 10 other gingivitis-associated bacteria (10 gingivitis-enriched and no gingivitis-depleted) in the CPC group network. As Prevotella spp. have been shown, in past studies, to be implicated in endodontic,28 gingival29 and periodontal infections,30 such a difference in the connectivity of Prevotella spp. between the groups with and without CPC treatment further supports that CPC treatment reduces the connectivity of certain gingivitis-enriched taxa during plaque development.",

This effect eventually prevents or slows down the progression of gingivitis. It is believed that health-associated plaque is generally immature,35 whereas gingivitis is associated with a more developed and complex microbial community.13, 17 A significant increase in the \u03b1-diversity of plaque microbiota was found for subjects in the control group from Baseline to Day 21, which is consistent with previous observations in other gingivitis cohorts.30, 36, 37 In contrast, during the same period, plaque \u03b1-diversity in the CPC-treated group remained stable, indicating that when starting with healthy gingivae CPC treatment prevents acquisition of new taxa that would otherwise accumulate but maintains the original biodiversity of healthy plaques that is associated with healthy gingivae.",

                    "text": "Second, CPC oral rinses specifically inhibit increases in gingivitis-associated bacteria in supragingival biofilms during gingivitis development. Socransky et al.38 recognised that early plaque consists predominantly of gram positive organisms and that if left undisturbed, the plaque undergoes a process of maturation, resulting in predominantly gram-negative microbiota. In fact, 17 gingivitis-associated bacteria were significantly inhibited in the CPC-treated group compared with the placebo group. Among them, Tannerella, Peptococcus, Selenomonas and Prevotella are Gram-negative obligate anaerobic microorganisms that are embedded in matrices of polymers in thick and deep dental biofilms.31 Studies based on traditional methods, such as viable counting and confocal microscopy, also supported the anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm effectiveness of CPC on certain culturable pathogenic bacteria (such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens), anaerobic bacterial communities and even oral biofilms.7, 20, 39, 40 This suggests that CPC can diffuse into oral biofilms and exert anti-bacterial effects in vivo.41 Notably, oral bacteria that were difficult to grow in culture or were not yet cultured, such as TM7, SR1 and Uncultured_Lachnospiraceae, were also inhibited by CPC mouth rinses, suggesting the importance of culture-independent approaches in unveiling a global landscape of microbial responses in plaque. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the preventative efficacy of CPC in experimental gingivitis, as well as its impact on oral microbiome changes, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The identified microbiota changes are consistent with overall microbiota changes after long- and short-term periodontal therapy. For example, Tannerella and Porphyromonas, which had been classified as part of the red complex for periodontal disease, were found to be significantly inhibited by CPC in our study and also shown to be reduced in other periodontal therapies.38, 42, 43",

The co-adhesion of different oral bacteria is a critical step for building physical networks. Our results suggested that the size, local connectivity and microbiota-wide connectivity of bacterial correlation networks were reduced by CPC treatment, particularly for those nodes representing bacterial taxa that are positively associated with gingivitis. For example, a negative correlation between Streptococcus and Prevotella was observed in the control samples of this study at Day 21 (which was consistent with an inverse correlation between the two bacterial taxa found in periodontal pocket microbiota in periodontitis patients).44 However, such a connection was disrupted or lost in the CPC groups. It is notable, however, that various CPC-containing formulations can have distinct pellicle surface properties and thus may exert different impacts on such bacterial interactions (the Crest Pro-health Mouth Rinse used herein features high bioavailability of CPC, which yields more hydrophobic pellicles on the tooth surface and interferes with bacterial co-adhesion).45 Moreover, tracking the dynamics of such bacterial correlation networks along short- or long-term treatment with CPC oral rinses may help to reconstruct the successive patterns of each individual taxon and thus reveal the causal relationships among interacting plaque microbes in response to CPC. Comparisons of such treatment-induced response patterns of plaque microbiota among different types of oral rinses may serve as a valuable venue for the mechanism-based evaluation of oral care products and for guiding rational development of oral care regimens.",
