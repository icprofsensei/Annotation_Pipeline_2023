Most of these studies were based on DNA extracted from teeth or postcranial bones. In contrast, no pathogen DNA has been reported from the petrous bone which has become the most desired skeletal element in ancient DNA research due to its high endogenous DNA content. To compare the potential for pathogenic aDNA retrieval from teeth and petrous bones, we sampled these elements from five ancient skeletons, previously shown to be carrying Yersinia pestis. Based on shotgun sequencing data, four of these five plague victims showed clearly detectable levels of Y.\u00a0pestis \nDNA in the teeth, whereas all the petrous bones failed to produce Y.\u00a0pestis \nDNA above baseline levels. A broader comparative metagenomic analysis of teeth and petrous bones from 10 historical skeletons corroborated these results, showing a much higher microbial diversity in teeth than petrous bones, including pathogenic and oral microbial taxa. Our results imply that although petrous bones are highly valuable for ancient genomic analyses as an excellent source of endogenous DNA, the metagenomic potential of these dense skeletal elements is highly limited. This trade\u2010off must be considered when designing the sampling strategy for an aDNA project.",

For many ancient samples, the endogenous DNA content is very low (<1%), why recent aDNA efforts have aimed at maximizing the endogenous DNA content through improved sampling, DNA extraction, and library preparation protocols (Allentoft et\u00a0al., 2015; Damgaard et\u00a0al., 2015; Gamba et\u00a0al., 2014; Gansauge & Meyer, 2014; Hansen et\u00a0al., 2017; Korlevi\u0107 et\u00a0al., 2015). The \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the petrous bone as an excellent aDNA resource represents a major improvement. Being the hardest bone in the mammalian body (Frisch, S\u00f8rensen, Overgaard, Lind, & Bretlau, 1998), the petrous part of the temporal bone contains high levels of endogenous DNA (Gamba et\u00a0al., 2014), peaking in the otic capsule (Pinhasi et\u00a0al., 2015) which is the highly compact bone surrounding the inner ear. Despite its obvious advantages in preserving endogenous DNA, ancient pathogen DNA has not, to our knowledge, been reported from petrous bone. This could simply be a coincidence or due to the fact that the compact bone structure of the otic capsule has a lower level of blood supply than other parts of the skeleton (Anson, Winch, Warpeha, & Donaldson, 1966), reflecting a much lower tissue turnover rate (J\u00f8rkov, Heinemeier, & Lynnerup, 2009). The petrous bone, however, is not the only skeletal part with high endogenous DNA content. When ancient teeth are well preserved, the cementum\u2010rich outer layer of the roots can yield levels of endogenous DNA that are often comparable to those of petrous bone (Hansen et\u00a0al., 2017). Most ancient pathogens detected so far have been extracted from either postcranial bones or teeth, possibly because these have an abundant network of blood vessels/circulation and thus become directly exposed to blood\u2010borne pathogens.",

We sampled the petrous bones and teeth from five Bronze Age and Iron Age skeletons that have previously been shown to be carrying Y.\u00a0pestis based on aDNA extracted from their teeth (Rasmussen et\u00a0al., 2015). By resampling and \u201cshotgun\u201d sequencing these skeletons, we could assess the reproducibility of plague detection between teeth from the same individuals. It further allowed us to systematically test for differences in the presence of Y.\u00a0pestis DNA in tooth cementum (outer hard layer of the root), tooth dentine (inner softer root layer), and the petrous bone. As negative control samples, we used data from teeth and petrous bones from 10 historical skeletons from a locality in Denmark allowing us to establish baseline levels and to test for more general differences in microbial DNA diversity in the different substrates.",

For the purpose here, we consider this to be a reasonable baseline approximation, reflecting background levels of nonspecific mapping of reads to the Y.\u00a0pestis genome from other related taxa present in the environment. Despite sample\u2010to\u2010sample variance, Rise386, Rise397, Rise509, and Rise511 display Y.\u00a0pestis DNA levels in the teeth that are clearly above the average background level (Table\u00a01, Figure\u00a01). Among these four individuals, the highest and lowest fractions of mapped Y.\u00a0pestis reads were detected for Rise509 and Rise397, respectively. Interestingly, this relative pattern is also observed in the original study by Rasmussen et\u00a0al. (2015). This observation serves as a general confirmation of the results presented in Rasmussen et\u00a0al. (2015) and implies that the detection of this disease can be reproduced in most cases from different teeth of an infected skeleton. Both tooth dentine and cementum show evidence of Y.\u00a0pestis infection except for Rise397 (a poorly preserved tooth sample) where the level in dentine is below our detection threshold (Figure\u00a01). For the remaining three samples, dentine actually seems to \u201coutperform\u201d cementum 5\u20136 times, possibly because dentine (inner part of the root) is more directly in contact with the bloodstream in the pulp cavity. Interestingly, we could not detect Y.\u00a0pestis DNA in the tooth from the Rise00 individual, contrasting the previously published results (Rasmussen et\u00a0al., 2015). This result emphasizes that despite the general reproducibility, plague DNA levels can vary between teeth, implying that an apparent absence of plague DNA cannot be used to rule out an infection. More comparative analyses of ancient plague victims are needed to accurately assess the heterogeneity and detection sensitivity levels.",

It is clear that the dense and structure of the otic capsule that facilitates good preservation of endogenous DNA seems to prevent the detection of blood\u2010borne pathogens perhaps due to having lower blood circulation levels compared to the other parts of the human skeleton.

This is a typical feature of ancient DNA molecules and confirms that the plague reads are authentic and of ancient origin. Although the absolute deamination rates were slightly lower than observed in the original paper, the relative C\u2192T misincorporation rates (between\u2010sample differences) match the pattern observed by Rasmussen et\u00a0al. (2015). Moreover, we observed a random distribution of DNA reads mapped to the Y.\u00a0pestis genome (i.e., not clustered around conserved regions), further supporting the authenticity of the mapped DNA fragments. As a further confirmation of cross\u2010study comparability, we compared the human mtDNA haplogroups obtained from our shotgun data with the previously published data representing the same individuals (Allentoft et\u00a0al., 2015). Ten samples (representing four individuals) had enough mtDNA coverage to reliably call the human mitochondrial haplogroups, and all showed the same haplogroup as in the original study (Table\u00a01).

This conservative confidence scoring threshold, removing ambiguous and unclassified k\u2010mers (e.g., due to DNA deamination damage), probably explains why the number of identified plague reads was smaller than in the mapping analysis (Table\u00a01). However, the relative between\u2010sample distribution of identified Y.\u00a0pestis sequences was highly similar with the two methods, confirming increased levels of Y.\u00a0pestis DNA in teeth from Rise386, Rise397, Rise509, Rise511, and below the threshold for Rise00, and for all the petrous bones (Table\u00a01).",

As the vast majority of nonhuman reads were from bacteria, we focused on that domain in the downstream comparative analysis (Figure\u00a02a). Moreover, we confined our comparative analysis to the genus level which was the lowest taxonomic level used by Wood and Salzberg (2014) for testing the sensitivity and accuracy of Kraken. We note that the accuracy of the Kraken classification depends on the diversity and number of reference sequences in the Kraken database. This, coupled with the short and heavily deaminated aDNA molecules, could easily result in false\u2010positive classification for some reads. We therefore removed classified genera identified with <10 reads, because such rare taxa may represent background \u201cnoise\u201d rather than a real signal. Still, rigorous follow\u2010up analyses would be required to confirm each identified taxon as truly being represented by authentic aDNA in a sample. It is beyond the scope of the present study to provide an accurate and in\u2010depth taxonomic characterization of the microbial community in these tissues. We focus on the obvious comparative metagenomic differences and note that exact taxon matches (Table S2) should be interpreted with great caution.",

The general distribution pattern of major taxonomic bacterial groups is similar between both substrates (Figure\u00a02a) with most classified reads from genera like Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Clostridium, and Aeromonas which are all common in soil. Despite an overall qualitative similarity in the metagenomic profiles of tooth cementum and petrous bone, there are important differences. To emphasize this, we assessed the diversity of genera represented by a\u00a0>\u00a010\u2010fold difference in number of classified reads between the tooth and petrous bone datasets. These genera are essentially >10 times more likely to be identified in shotgun sequencing data from one substrate compared to the other. The result is summarized in Figure\u00a02b. We identified 60 bacterial genera with >10 times more reads in the tooth cementum data than in the petrous bone data. In contrast, only eight bacterial genera were identified with >10 times more sequences in petrous bone compared to tooth cementum. (Table S3, Figure\u00a02b). Among the 60 genera with a skewed presence in favor of tooth, many such as Clostridium and Citrobacter have both pathogenic species and ones commonly found in soil. Also, genera associated with human natural and pathogenic oral microbiome (http://www.homd.org/) such as Actinomyces, Methanobrevibacter, and Streptococcus were also much more abundant in the tooth\u2010derived dataset than in the petrous bone data. Among the eight genera being skewed in favor of petrous bone were Bacillus species, which are ubiquitous in nature, (Harwood, 2013) and Aeromonas species, which are found in freshwater and can be associated with a number of human diseases (Austin, 1996).",

For example, Clostridium tetani, a causative agent for tetanus, was identified with 2,130 sequences in the pooled tooth dataset and only 14 sequences in the pooled petrous bone data (Table S4). Most of these reads were derived from the same individual (sample M1) showing 614 times as many C.\u00a0tetani classified reads in the tooth as in the petrous bone. While some of the tetanus sequences may originate from soil, the general absence of tetanus in the rest of the samples from the same cemetery indicates that the individual was indeed infected by this blood\u2010borne pathogen.",

We mapped the trimmed DNA reads to the relevant reference genomes and this allowed us to assess the DNA damage patterns. The pathogen bacterium Clostridium tetani and the oral bacteria Actinomyces gerencseriae and Actinomyces sp oral taxon 448 were, in the Kraken analysis, respectively, represented with 614\u2010fold, 7,330\u2010fold, and 4,663\u2010fold as many DNA sequences in the pooled tooth data compared to the pooled petrous bone data. When mapping the data to the reference genomes of these species, the mapped sequences showed typical aDNA deamination damage profiles with increased C\u2192T transition rates at the first position of sequenced DNA fragments (Figure S2). However, in case of the petrous bone samples, either very few reads were mapped to the reference genomes (C.\u00a0tetani\u2014only 80 reads), preventing an assessment of damage, or the mapped sequences did not show deamination profiles (Figure S2 and Table S5). This suggests that most sequences mapping to above\u2010mentioned pathogenic and oral microbiome species are authentic and ancient when obtained from teeth, while the few reads of these species obtained from the petrous bones are likely to be false positives or modern contamination.",

In contrast, among the few bacterial species identified as more common in petrous bone, the absence (or very low level) of DNA damage indicates a higher degree of false\u2010positive matches because of poor database coverage, or a higher influence of modern bacterial DNA. The latter can be a direct effect of having very little ancient bacterial DNA in the extract, allowing low background levels of modern bacterial DNA to be built into the library. It is worth mentioning that there are of course differences in metagenomic composition between and within individuals. Apart from the obvious differences such as the burial location and soil microenvironment, another major factor could be the preservation state of the teeth and petrous bones. As one might expect, in relatively badly preserved petrous bone samples (with degraded and porous otic capsule), the diversity of bacterial taxa could be much higher.",

                    "text": "Our study has contributed with several insights of relevance to the aDNA scientific community. First of all, finding Yersinia pestis DNA in an ancient skeleton is reproducible between different teeth (in four of five cases). This is an important observation for diagnostic purposes. Second, we find no traces of Y.\u00a0pestis DNA in the petrous bone implying that the evolutionary and epidemic history of this bacterium cannot be studied genetically from this skeletal element. Consequently, if the skeletons in Rasmussen et\u00a0al. (2015) had originally been sampled from the petrous bones, like in most ancient human genomic studies published in recent times, the discovery of these prehistoric plague infections would not have been made at that time. Our results show that this difference is not limited to Y.\u00a0pestis but represents a general difference in the metagenomic profiles, where petrous bones (otic capsules) display little to none authentic ancient exogenous DNA. We emphasize that when identifying ancient pathogen DNA in a skeletal element, rigorous follow\u2010up analyses are needed to thoroughly address the authenticity and exact taxonomic origin of the reads (e.g., Rasmussen et\u00a0al., 2015). A bioinformatical screening with, for example, Kraken is only the first exploratory step to identify interesting sequences that are candidates for further scrutiny. Nonetheless, our results point to the simple conclusion that if a skeleton has been sampled from the tooth, the chance of finding an interesting microbial signal is much higher than when using the petrous bone from the same individual. This is highly relevant when establishing the sampling strategy for any project that involves aDNA. Targeting the petrous bone is an efficient means to maximize the endogenous DNA content from an ancient individual, but it clearly comes with a cost. In that context, it is important to consider that tooth cementum, if well preserved and sampled correctly (Damgaard et\u00a0al., 2015), can often yield an endogenous DNA content that is almost as high as in the petrous bone (Hansen et\u00a0al., 2017), while also providing an authentic and diverse ancient metagenomic profile.",
