Likewise, changes in the oral microbiome have been linked to periodontal diseases and dental caries (5), pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (6), and infant birth weight (7). In recent years, next-generation sequencing of the hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene has become a powerful tool for the assessment of human microbial communities, and large-scale efforts such as those carried out by the Human Microbiome Project Consortium (8) have begun to characterize the diversity of the microbiome in healthy adults. Despite the growing importance of the microbiome in epidemiologic and environmental health research, it remains poorly understood how the human microbiome is first established and subsequently maintained throughout childhood and adulthood.",

The early oral microbiome may also dictate the composition of the long-term stable adult oral microbiome (9). Therefore, understanding the process of oral microbiome establishment in infants and young children may shed light on molecular mechanisms linking early life exposures and microbiome-related health outcomes in later life. A variety of factors are already known to affect the development of the infant salivary microbiome, including mode of delivery (10) and interaction with the primary caregiver (11\u201313). Though microbial colonization of the oral cavity may begin in utero (14), it has recently been established that human milk is home to a diverse community of bacterial species (15) and may also contribute to the establishment of healthy infant oral and gut microbiomes, as indicated by observable differences between the microbiota of breast- and formula-fed infants (14\u201316). Likewise, there is evidence to suggest that early life exposures can indeed exert long-term effects on gut microbiome composition (17, 18). Despite this potential for breast milk consumption to modulate the microbiome, a limited number of published studies have examined the bacterial composition of breast milk, and few have assessed both breast milk and salivary microbial communities in mother-child pairs.",

The CHAMACOS study, which investigates the health of low-income, Mexican-American women and children in an agricultural community, affords a unique opportunity to compare the maternal milk and child salivary microbiomes across a period of several years through the use of banked specimens. The high prevalence of obesity observed in the CHAMACOS cohort represents an additional research question with relevance to studies of the microbiome. Here, we describe the breast milk and salivary microbiomes in a randomly-selected subset of CHAMACOS mothers and their children, seek preliminary evidence of similarities in the microbiome between mother-child pairs, and explore whether pre-pregnancy or childhood obesity may be related to microbial community composition.",

This ranking system demonstrated that communities that appear extremely uniform due to high abundance of Streptococcus (samples BM3, BM9, BM7) may actually contain a greater number of unique taxa than communities that appear significantly more diverse (samples BM8, BM5, S7).",

Again, breast milk samples tended to exhibit lower diversity than child saliva samples (2.2 bits in saliva vs. 1.4 bits in breast milk, P = 0.024), but ordering within mother and child groups changed substantially compared to ordering by number of OTUs detected. Both methods of estimating within-individual community diversity indicated that breast milk samples were less diverse than child saliva samples, but the entropy-based method is more likely to assign lower diversity scores to samples that are dominated by a single highly abundant taxon.",

To see whether these levels of Streptococcus were consistent with those observed in other populations, we compared average profiles in our subjects to those from eight other groups of subjects described in six published studies (Table 2, Figure 3). Average Streptococcus levels in saliva samples varied substantially between studies, from 11.9% in adult saliva samples from the Human Microbiome Project Consortium (HMPC) study (8, 20) to 62.2% in saliva samples from infants in the Cephas et al. study (11). All three studies of infant or child saliva and three out of four studies of adult saliva reported communities where Streptococcus was the most abundant taxon. Diversity of the average profiles, measured as entropy, also varied considerably between studies on the salivary microbiome. Entropy of averaged community data was lowest in infant saliva in the Cephas et al. study (2.2 bits) and comparably low in child saliva in the CHAMACOS study (2.6 bits). The remaining studies of the salivary microbiome reported considerably higher levels of entropy (3.5 bits in Ling et al. adults, 3.7 bits in Ling et al. children, 3.9 bits in Cephas et al. adults, and 4.0 bits in HMPC adults).",

Streptococcus was only a small component of breast milk (4.2%) in the Finnish Caucasian women enrolled in this study, whereas it was highly abundant in the Mexican-American women in the CHAMACOS study (73.4%). Conversely, Lactobacillus was the most abundant taxon (15.1%) reported in the Finnish study, but was nearly undetected (0.008%) in CHAMACOS breast milk. Both entropy and number of taxa were also notably higher in the Finnish study than in the CHAMACOS study (5.2 bits and 421 OTUs in Cabrera-Rubio et al. mothers vs. 1.7 bits and 241 OTUs in CHAMACOS mothers). Two other studies on the breast milk microbiome, performed by Hunt et al. (22) and Jost et al. (23), both reported that Streptococcus was the second most abundant genus (8.2% and 17.6%, respectively) after Staphylococcus (15.8% and 60.1%, respectively), but were not included in the comparison figure because full microbiome profile data were not available.",

                    "text": "The very high abundance of Streptococcus spp. in both breast milk and child saliva samples was one of the most notable features of our results. In child saliva samples, this is a relatively unsurprising finding; many other studies have reported similarly high Streptococcus abundances in the oral cavity. The Human Microbiome Project Consortium, which has generated the largest collection of healthy adult microbiome community composition data to date, reported that Prevotellaceae was, on average, the most abundant family in saliva, but also noted that Streptococcus spp. dominated most oral habitats (8). Other 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based studies of the bacterial microbiome have also reported that Streptococcus is one of the most abundant taxa in saliva in both children and adults (9, 11, 27, 28), though relative abundances still tended to be lower than those observed in CHAMACOS children. Interestingly, the salivary microbiome profiles of low-income CHAMACOS children most closely resembled those reported by Cephas et al. (11) among infants enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children program, another low-income population.",

Although Streptococcus is known to be a common member of the human milk microbiome, its relative abundance appears to differ substantially between groups, between individuals, and even between samples from the same individual (15, 21\u201323). In our study, Streptococcus was significantly more common than in other published metagenomic analyses of breast milk (21, 22), and therefore community diversity in our samples was correspondingly lower. These dissimilarities in diversity and Streptococcus abundance may be attributable to differences among study populations. For example, the population of women enrolled in the CHAMACOS study is notably distinct from the mostly educated, Finnish Caucasian participants in the Cabrera-Rubio et al. study (21, 29) in terms of geographical location, socioeconomic status, diet, and ethnicity; any of these factors may have contributed to the significant differences observed between these two studies of the human milk microbiome.",

For example, it is possible that the differences we observed between our study and other similar published analyses may be due to differences in sample collection. Additionally, use of samples from only one time point, though common in many existing studies of the microbiome, may not provide an accurate representation of the average long-term microbiome composition, which has been shown to be variable in the short-term (22). Because Streptococcus was so highly abundant in both sample types, another important question is whether species distribution within this genus is similar between mothers and children. Published studies based on both bacterial isolation and culture-independent methods indicate that numerous Streptococcus species, including S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. oris, S. parasanguis, S. lactarius, S. australis, S. gallolyticus, and S. vestibularis, can be found in breast milk (15), but even full-length 16S sequences often do not provide enough information to resolve species within the Streptococcus genus (5), representing an important disadvantage of 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based metagenomics. To gain further insight into the role these species play in saliva and breast milk, future studies of the human milk and oral microbiomes should aim to improve resolution within Streptococcus and other highly abundant genera.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the relationship between the breast milk and salivary microbiomes in mother-child pairs over a period of five years. Likely due to the relatively small sample size and limited statistical power of this pilot study combined with the length of time between sample collection, we were unable to observe any clear similarities between bacterial communities in breast milk and 5-year-old child saliva. While it is likely that environmental factors such as diet and dental hygiene play a significant role in defining the oral microbiome in 5-year-old children, existing evidence suggests that certain early life exposures may indeed affect long-term health outcomes such as obesity, most likely through modulation of the infant microbiome (17, 18, 24, 30). Since breast milk consumption is known to affect infant microbiome composition (9, 16) and breast milk is an early source of bacteria in the infant oral cavity (14), it is possible that the breast milk microbiome itself may influence the long-term composition of both the oral and gut bacterial communities in children. Further analyses that include additional CHAMACOS mother-child pairs may help to increase our understanding of this potentially important aspect of microbiome establishment during early childhood.",

Saliva samples were collected from their children five years later. All infants were breastfed for \u22656 months, and only healthy infants delivered vaginally after full-term pregnancy were considered for inclusion due to the known effects of cesarean delivery on microbiome composition (10, 21). Developmental assessments of children, including anthropometrics, were conducted at birth and at the time of each maternal interview. Signed informed consent was obtained from all mothers in the study. The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California, Berkeley, approved all study procedures. After sequencing data quality assessment and control, 9 mothers and 10 children remained in the analysis (see Quality Filtering of Reads).",

OTU assignments were made based on a minimum of 97% sequence identity, corresponding to genus-level similarity; any sequences that did not match the reference database were clustered de novo. Taxonomy was then assigned to the resulting OTUs using the UCLUST consensus taxonomy assigner (38). At this step, any reads that failed to align using PyNAST (36) were excluded and any taxa with fewer than two reads across all samples were removed from the final OTU table. 2,061,324 reads remained in the analysis (3,439\u2013248,421 per subject). One maternal breast milk sample (BM10) was dropped from the dataset due to low read count (<12,000 reads after alignment), which may have been indicative of poor PCR performance.
