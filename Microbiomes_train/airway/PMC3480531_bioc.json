Infection and primary graft dysfunction are the principal causes of death early after transplantation, whereas the major causes of later death are infection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) (1). Lung shares with all organ transplants an increased susceptibility to infection resulting from immunosuppressive therapy, but additional factors make it uniquely susceptible. These include direct communication with the external environment and microbe-rich upper respiratory tract (URT), defective lower respiratory tract (LRT) mechanical defense due to vagal denervation cough reflex defects and abnormal mucocilliary clearance at anastamotic sites, and a high propensity for microaspiration (2, 3). Microbial triggers are also linked to BOS, the clinical manifestation of chronic rejection, based on epidemiological association with specific bacteria, fungi, or viruses detected in lung (4\u20138), linkage with genetic polymorphisms in innate microbial sensors (9\u201312), and responsiveness to azithromycin (13\u201315).",

A high abundance of Staphylococcus aureus was seen in one BAL (B24; transplanted for IPF), also detected by culture. Similarly, one BAL showed dominant Achromobacter (B32; transplanted for CF), also identified by culture. In contrast, BAL from the subject with late-onset BOS (B38) was dominated by the unusual anaerobic lineage Sneathia (35), which was not identified by culture. Three BAL samples showed high levels of Streptococcus spp. (B25, B39B, B42; transplanted for COPD or \u03b1-1 antitrypsin deficiency) without any corresponding cultured organism, but Streptococcus spp. were also found at high or moderate abundance in OW from these subjects.",

Several subjects with intermediate ITS levels revealed high abundance of Candida (B41, B25, B26, B39, B39B, and B42), and one was dominated by Aspergillus (B36, also found by culture). When Candida was seen in BAL, it was also always found at high abundance in OW, whereas for subjects with a high abundance of Aspergillus in BAL, this fungus was absent or at markedly lower abundance in OW. Cryptococcus was present in six transplant patients\u2019 BAL but at relatively low abundance or in samples with low total ITS read numbers. Cryptococcus was not seen in BAL from the transplant subject who had this fungus at high abundance in OW (Tx46).",

Oropharyngeal fungal microbiota from healthy and transplant subjects showed flat rarefaction curves at high sequencing depth, indicating that further sequencing would yield few additional fungal OTUs (Figure 4B), although transplant patients had fewer fungal lineages identified than healthy subjects (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum).

The major cause of later death is BOS (1, 39), a form of chronic rejection that is not well understood but is linked to microbial triggers within the allograft (4\u201312, 40). Here we applied broad-range 16S bacterial and ITS fungal rRNA gene profiling to define microbial populations in the lungs of 21 transplant recipients. Transplant subjects showed marked differences from healthy subjects in airway microbial burden, community composition and structure, lower richness, and greater distances between lung and upper respiratory communities. We then used a novel approach to visualize taxa enriched in bronchoscopic specimens relative to oropharyngeal samples, allowing identification of specific bacteria replicating in allografts of individual subjects.",

By comparing the relative abundance of each bacterial taxon in BAL and oropharyngeal samples, we can identify enrichment in lung (E.S. Charlson, unpublished observations). Enrichment in BAL compared with the URT suggests replication within the lung and thus can distinguish such organisms from those entering BAL through bronchoscopic carryover or passive aspiration. A large proportion of transplant recipients had specific lung-enriched bacteria. Enriched taxa often confirmed organisms found by culture but also identified bacteria not amenable to culture, such as unusual anaerobes or normal oropharyngeal residents. Molecular profiling also determined proportional abundances of organisms, adding quantitative information to culture results. In some cases we showed that bacteria identified by culture were equally represented in BAL and URT, providing evidence against authentic LRT replication.",

This finding was true regardless of underlying indication for transplant, with no difference between subjects transplanted for COPD/emphysema, interstitial lung disease, or CF/suppurative lung disease. Although taxa present in BAL at abundances similar to the URT may result from bronchoscopic carryover, they may also reflect bacteria genuinely present in lung due to aspiration without replication and enrichment. The high 16S DNA levels seen even in subjects without outliers (or where outliers reflect a minority of BAL sequences) is consistent with such a source, which may result from increased propensity for aspiration or inability to clear aspirated bacteria effectively due to cough and mucocilliary clearance defects (3, 44, 45) Passively aspirated or even dead bacteria can be potent immunological activators, and aspiration has been implicated in BOS (46).",

It is hypothesized that aberrant microbial populations in the lung, among other factors, trigger inflammatory pathways, resulting in graft injury (40). Our study was not designed to address BOS specifically. However, one subject had late-onset BOS, and 16S sequencing revealed high-level lung enrichment of the anaerobic lineage Sneathia. This organism is a component of the vaginal flora and a rare cause of obstetrical infections (35, 47\u201349) but has not previously been reported in the respiratory tract and would not be identified by standard culture. Two subjects with early BOS also had taxa enriched in lung that were not detected by culture (Tx25, Tx40). Longitudinal studies using broad-range profiling are needed to determine whether overall microbial burden or specific lung microbiome features, either early after transplant or at the time of BOS, have a role in late graft failure.",

(2) Although OW is a clinically tractable way to sample the URT, there may be subtle differences in outliers identified when BAL is compared with the most accurate representation of potential carryover, direct peri-glottic specimens obtained with high stringency two-scope sampling (20; E.S. Charlson, unpublished observations). (3) Although most pathogens found by culture were detected by molecular analysis, two subjects had M. avium-intracellulare infections on culture that were not found by 16S sequencing. Although MAI is occasionally isolated as a laboratory contaminant, this result suggests that mycobacterial detection may be a limitation of 16S rDNA surveys with the primers used (50).
