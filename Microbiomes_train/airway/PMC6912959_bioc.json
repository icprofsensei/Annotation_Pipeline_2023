Microbial DNA was extracted from subgingival dental plaque (n=281) and V3\u2013V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced to measure the relative abundances of 20 a priori\u2013selected taxa with nitrate\u2010reducing capacity. Standardized scores of each taxon's relative abundance were summed, producing a nitrate\u2010reducing taxa summary score (NO\n3\nTSS) for each participant. Natural log\u2010transformed homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, plasma glucose, systolic BP, and diastolic BP were regressed on NO\n3\nTSS in multivariable linear regressions; prediabetes mellitus and hypertension prevalence were regressed on NO\n3\nTSS using modified Poisson regression models. Nitrate\u2010reducing bacterial species represented 20\u00b116% of all measured taxa.

However, it has recently been discovered that NO production can also occur via the reduction of salivary nitrates by nitrate\u2010reducing oral bacteria to form nitrites, which are then swallowed and made systemically bioavailable for further reduction into NO in the blood vessels and tissues.8 This so\u2010called enterosalivary nitrate\u2010nitrite\u2010NO pathway presents a novel and biologically plausible mechanism by which oral bacteria might influence the systemic bioavailability of NO and the development of related clinical cardiometabolic outcomes in humans.",

A systematic review of 13 trials lasting 1 to 6\u00a0weeks found an \u22484.1 and 2.0\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg reduction in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively, following daily nitrate supplementation.11 Studies in mice have shown that dietary nitrate can improve insulin signaling and reverse features of metabolic syndrome.12, 13 Reduced plasma glucose and improved insulin sensitivity following nitrate supplementation have also been observed in some human studies, although the results are less conclusive.14, 15, 16 The direct role of nitrate\u2010reducing oral bacteria in the enterosalivary pathway of NO production is supported by several small experimental studies that use antibacterial mouthwash to reduce the overall oral bacteria. Antibacterial mouthwash use significantly blunts the BP and plasma glucose reductions observed following experimental nitrate supplementation.14, 17, 18 Notably, even in the absence of exogenous nitrate supplementation, a decrease in salivary and plasma nitrite, and an \u22483\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg increase in SBP and DBP was observed after antibacterial mouthwash use.19 This finding suggests that oral microbiota play a continuous role in BP regulation through the nitrate\u2010nitrite\u2010NO pathway.",

Geometric means are presented after back\u2010transforming predicted means obtained in regression analyses described below. Multivariable models regressed continuous measures of lnHOMA\u2010IR, plasma glucose levels, SBP, and DBP (dependent variables) on the continuous summary score for nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria (NO3TSS) in separate regressions for each outcome. Results were also presented visually in categories of increasing intervals of SD. Because the outcomes of prediabetes mellitus and hypertension were common in our study population, relative risk regression models using a modified Poisson regression with robust error variance were used to calculate the prevalence ratios instead of odds ratios.34 To avoid the possibility of behavioral modification and medications (after a hypertension diagnosis) from masking the associations with bacteria, sensitivity analyses for SBP and DBP outcomes were conducted using only the 187 participants with normotension. Exploratory analyses of the relationship between the 20 individual bacteria taxa and the cardiometabolic outcomes of interest were also conducted.",

Few studies have directly measured the oral microbiota when examining the enterosalivary pathway of NO generation with health outcomes.20, 21 Of these, none have examined the outcomes of insulin resistance and plasma glucose, and our study utilizes the largest sample size to date. Our findings demonstrate that a meaningful proportion (\u224820%) of oral taxa are potentially nitrate\u2010reducing, while also showing substantial between\u2010person variation in the relative abundance of nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria. Moreover, the results suggest that higher levels of nitrate\u2010reducing organisms might confer health benefits across the population distribution of bacterial levels. Thus, if this relationship were causal, interventions to manipulate nitrate\u2010reducing bacterial levels may be a useful treatment modality to improve cardiometabolic health, even in younger, generally healthy populations. The difference of \u22483 to 6\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg in mean SBP observed between the highest and lowest SD intervals of NO3TSS in our study is comparable to the estimated effects (5.7\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg for SBP and 3.1\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg for DBP) of first\u2010line antihypertensive medications.37 Importantly, a 4.4\u2010mm\u00a0Hg reduction in SBP has been estimated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by as much as 14%.37 The smaller differences in insulin resistance and fasting plasma glucose currently observed between SD intervals of nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria have not previously been associated with an increased conversion to overt diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease incidence. But future studies with longer follow\u2010up times that allow for the development of greater impairment of glucose regulation may yield greater clinical relevance.",

It is possible that nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria may be most relevant in the early preclinical stages of disease development, before more advanced pathophysiological alterations (eg, reduced \u03b2\u2010cell function or increased arterial stiffness) occur and environmental risk factors lose importance. Furthermore, behavioral changes (eg, improved diet and activity levels) or medical therapies following the diagnosis of hypertension, prediabetes mellitus, or other comorbidities (eg, high cholesterol) could favorably influence both the nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria and cardiometabolic health, masking these associations. This notion is supported by the observation that NO3TSS was most strongly associated with SBP among individuals with normotension only. Alternatively, these observations may simply be the result of chance, and replication in future studies will be important.",

Since there are many more oral bacteria with nitrate\u2010reducing capacity, it is also likely that not all relevant nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria have been identified, as only 2 studies have sought to identify the key contributors to oral nitrate\u2010reduction.25, 26 Additionally, strain\u2010level variation within the same species, horizontal gene transfer between bacteria,40 and different rates of nitrate\u2010reduction across taxa25, 26 may all result in the misclassification of the individual's nitrate\u2010reducing capacity. Metagenomics to directly assess the genes (eg, narG, narL, napC, napB) encoding for the nitrate\u2010reductase produced by bacteria,26 or metatranscriptomics measuring gene expression, may better capture the nitrate\u2010reducing capacity. Likewise, including a measure of plasma or salivary nitrite together with the bacteria measures can further support the increase in nitrite production through these bacteria and may be useful for mediation analyses. Although the amount of salivary nitrate reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria appears to be substantial and dose\u2010depen dent,19, 21 the percentage that reaches the systemic circulation as plasma nitrite is unclear but appears to be less, and a possible saturation threshold has been suggested that needs further examination.17, 21 Nevertheless, misclassification of the nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria exposure is likely nondifferential by the outcomes, biasing the estimates towards the null.",

Our study was only able to examine subgingival bacteria when the tongue is believed to be the main site of bacterial nitrate reduction in the mouth.25 The oral cavity is thought to contain distinct niches of microbiota with varying microbial diversity and composition,41 and it is unknown whether levels of nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria in the subgingival plaque serve as a reasonable proxy for levels on the tongue. The assessment of subgingival microbiota from one periodontal site per participant, as in this study, is also highly likely to have increased measurement error of the full\u2010mouth exposure to nitrate\u2010reducing taxa, which would bias the results towards the null. Future studies that can directly assess nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria on the tongue will be important.",

As contiguous parts of the digestive tract, the gut, and oral microbiota likely influence one another.42 The gut microbiome is also capable of nitrate reduction, although its contribution to circulating nitrite is likely minor, as the main site of nitrate to nitrite reduction occurs in the mouth, and dietary nitrate is mostly absorbed from the proximal intestine into the circulation, bypassing the nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria residing more distally. However, gut bacteria (eg, Lactobacilli sp., Bifidobacterium) can directly produce NO, potentially influencing blood flow and mucus generation, and thus the uptake and bioavailability of nitrate and nitrite.10 Gastric pH is also of relevance with high levels of NO formed nonenzymatically in the acidic stomach from swallowed nitrite and acid\u2010reducing medication shown to attenuate the BP\u2010lowering effects of nitrate.43 Furthermore, the gut microbiome produces hydrogen sulfide (H2S), another physiologically important gaseous signaling molecule, involved in the formation of NO from nitrite in the intestine and systemic tissues.10 Evidence suggests that an interplay of H2S and NO has cardiovascular effects.44 Thus, the gut microbiome may modify nitrite and NO bioavailability, and more research is needed to fully understand the role of the gut microbiome in the nitrate\u2010nitrite\u2010NO enterosalivary pathway.",

Our results support the hypothesis that oral nitrate\u2010reducing bacteria play a beneficial role in BP regulation and insulin resistance. Future longitudinal studies with enhanced assessment of nitrate\u2010reducing bacterial exposure predicting progression of cardiometabolic risk biomarkers and incident clinical disease will improve temporal inference necessary to inform causality and inform the development of future intervention studies that could manipulate oral nitrate\u2010reducing capacity.",
