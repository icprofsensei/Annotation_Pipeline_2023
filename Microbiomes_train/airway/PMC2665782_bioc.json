We analyzed 14,115 partial (\u223c500 bp) 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences from saliva samples from 120 healthy individuals (10 individuals from each of 12 worldwide locations). These sequences could be assigned to 101 known bacterial genera, of which 39 were not previously reported from the human oral cavity; phylogenetic analysis suggests that an additional 64 unknown genera are present. There is high diversity in the salivary microbiome within and between individuals, but little geographic structure. Overall, \u223c13.5% of the total variance in the composition of genera is due to differences among individuals, which is remarkably similar to the fraction of the total variance in neutral genetic markers that can be attributed to differences among human populations. Investigation of some environmental variables revealed a significant association between the genetic distances among locations and the distance of each location from the equator. Further characterization of the enormous diversity revealed here in the human salivary microbiome will aid in elucidating the role it plays in human health and disease, and in the identification of potentially informative species for studies of human population history.",

These studies have revealed a wealth of not-yet-cultivated bacterial species, and several projects to study the human microbiome have been proposed and/or initiated (Turnbaugh et al. 2007; Mullard 2008). However, comparatively little attention has been paid to the human salivary microbiome, as most studies of the human oral cavity have focused on identifying bacteria that might be associated with diseases (Becker et al. 2002; Kumar et al. 2003; Diaz et al. 2006; Kilian et al. 2006; Machado de Oliveira et al. 2007; Faveri et al. 2008). More than 600 different species have been described from the human oral cavity (Fabian et al. 2008), but only limited information is available on the normal microflora of healthy individuals (Aas et al. 2005; Kang et al. 2006). A comprehensive understanding of the breadth of diversity in the human oral cavity microbiome is necessary to fully gauge the role of bacteria in diseases of the oral cavity (Aas et al. 2005; Paster et al. 2006; Fabian et al. 2008). Moreover, as the oral cavity is often the entry point of bacteria into the body, there may be important interactions between the saliva microbiome and other microbiomes in the human body, in particular, that of the intestinal tract (Schipper et al. 2007; Fabian et al. 2008).",

When humans migrate, they take their bacteria with them, and it has previously been shown that patterns of variation in the stomach bacteria Helicobacter pylori correspond closely to migrations inferred from analyses of human DNA variation (Falush et al. 2003; Linz et al. 2007). Moreover, it was shown that two human ethnic groups, which could not be distinguished on the basis of human DNA markers, could be distinguished based on their patterns of H. pylori variation (Wirth et al. 2004). This result could reflect either genetic isolation of these two communities that is too recent to be reflected in the human DNA markers, or some cultural factor that influences H. pylori variation (such as diet) that differs between these communities; in either event, the H. pylori variation does provide insights into human populations that are not revealed by analysis of human DNA markers.",

And even bacterial species that exhibit high levels of horizontal transfer may nonetheless provide evidence of recent contact between populations that would not be revealed by human DNA markers. Characterization of patterns of diversity in the human salivary microbiome thus may provide useful insights into human population structure and migration.",

A highly variable portion of the 16S rRNA gene of \u223c500 bp was amplified and cloned, and approximately 120 clones were sequenced from each individual; this number of clones is sufficient to capture most of the variation at the level of bacterial genera inferred from the partial 16S rRNA sequences (Supplemental Fig. S1). A total of 14,691 sequences were obtained, which were then analyzed for possible chimeras or other artifacts (Ashelford et al. 2006). We identified 576 potentially chimeric sequences, which represents \u223c3.9% of the sequences. This is less than the average of 9% potentially chimeric sequences reported previously for full-length 16S rRNA clone libraries (Ashelford et al. 2006), probably because our partial 16S rRNA sequences provide a smaller target for jumping PCR or other processes that produce chimeric sequences. Excluding these 576 potentially chimeric sequences leaves 14,115 sequences for further analysis (Table 1); these sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers EU984515-EU998629. The sequences were analyzed in two ways: First, a genus was assigned to each sequence by comparison to the RDPII database (Cole et al. 2007), and the composition of genera across individuals was subsequently analyzed. Second, all sequences were used to generate a phylogenetic tree, which was subsequently analyzed.",

The PCA plot of the UniFrac distances (Fig. 4B) is quite similar to the MDS plot for the distances based on genus composition (Fig. 4A), and the UniFrac distances (Supplemental Table S14) are similarly not correlated with the geographic distances among locations (Mantel test, r = \u22120.14, P = 0.79).

We also tested for associations between age and gender of the donor and the FST distances based on the composition of bacterial genera for each donor. The only significant association involved the distance of each location from the equator, which explained \u223c24% of the variation in the UniFrac distances (Fig. 5). However, this apparently significant association should be viewed with caution. Many factors vary with distance from the equator (such as UV index), so further work will be required to ascertain what aspect(s) of the distance from the equator is responsible for this association. Moreover, the association is primarily driven by the Congo, which has high distances to other locations and is also closest to the equator; investigation of additional populations that are similarly close to the equator would be necessary to verify this association.",

However, we emphasize that a main conclusion of our study (discussed below) is that the human salivary microbiome does not vary greatly between different geographic locations. Therefore, if these uncontrolled environmental and/or cultural factors are having a significant impact on our results, then controlling for them would presumably result in even less geographic differentiation in the patterns of variation.

Sequence variation within particular bacterial taxa may very well exhibit geographic structure that would provide novel insights into human population structure, relationships, and migrations, as has been previously observed for H. pylori (Falush et al. 2003; Linz et al. 2007). Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) is a particularly promising approach (Urwin and Maiden 2003; Maiden 2006) that has shown geographic structure in some bacteria that was not evident in 16S rRNA comparisons (Margos et al. 2008). Additional characterization of coding sequence variation in particular taxa by MLST or other means would be highly desirable, and may very well reveal geographic structure that is not apparent in the overall composition of the salivary microbiome. For tracing human migrations, it would be most useful to focus on bacteria that are likely to be transferred primarily vertically (i.e., within families or households). However, even bacteria that are primarily transferred horizontally may provide useful markers of population contact that is too recent to be detected by analysis of human DNA polymorphisms. Perhaps the most useful taxa to start with would be those that are both widespread (i.e., found in many different locations) and frequent (i.e., found in multiple individuals from a location); these would include Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Neisseria, Haemophilus, Rothia, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium (Fig. 2).

In addition, further characterization of some of the taxa identified in this study by MLST or other means should provide useful markers for studies of human population history and/or recent population contact.",

The gene fragment we amplified corresponds to nucleotide positions 2,769,690 to 2,770,259 in the Escherichia coli genome (Blattner et al. 1997), with an amplicon length of 570 bp. The primer sequences used in this study are: forward primer, 5\u2032-CTACGTGCCAGCAGCCGCGG-3\u2032; and reverse primer, 5\u2032-CTCACGACACGAGCTGACGA-3\u2032. PCR amplification was carried out in a 50-\u03bcL total volume, including 38 \u03bcL of ddH2O, 5 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 PCR buffer (500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 9.0, 1.0% Triton X-100), 3 \u03bcL of 25 mM MgCl2, 1 \u03bcL of 10 mM dNTPs (10 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP, dCTP), 1 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM forward primer, 1 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM reverse primer, 0.5 \u03bcL of Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems), and 20 ng of template DNA, for 35 cycles using the following conditions: denaturation step for 1 min at 95\u00b0C, annealing step for 1 min at 62\u00b0C, and extension step for 1 min at 72\u00b0C.",

The appropriate similarity score for defining bacterial genera is a matter of debate, generally ranging from 90% to 95%; we chose a value at the low end of the range, in accordance with some previous studies (Pei et al. 2004; Gao et al. 2007), in order to minimize falsely designating new taxa (at the possible expense of mis-assigning some taxa). In the event of multiple matches to sequences in the database, the genus was assigned according to the highest similarity score. Comparing the sequences in a similar fashion to GenBank resulted in a highly similar assignment of genera, except that more sequences were classified as unknown (data not shown). Supplemental Tables S1\u2013S12 give the frequency of each genus for each individual, as well as the frequency of unclassified sequences (those that matched a sequence in RDPII, but the genus of the matching sequence has not been determined) and unknown sequences (those that did not match any sequence in RDPII above the 90% threshold). The apportionment of variation based on the frequency distribution of genera within and between individuals and locations, and linearized FST distances (Slatkin 1995) were calculated with Arlequin 3.1 (Excoffier et al. 2005); for these analyses, each genus was considered equivalent to an allele at a single haploid locus. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis was carried out using STATISTICA 7.1 (StatSoft, Inc.).",

To implement this method, we first carried out a multiple alignment of all of the sequences using ClustalW2 (Larkin et al. 2007). A matrix of the sequence differences between each pair of sequences was then determined using the F84 model (Kishino and Hasegawa 1989) as implemented in the DNADIST program in PHYLIP 3.67 (Felsenstein 1989). A UPGMA tree was then constructed from the pairwise distance matrix, using the NEIGHBOR program in PHYLIP, and the UniFrac distance metric (Lozupone et al. 2006) was calculated between each pair of locations with the online resource (http://bmf2.colorado.edu/unifrac/). These distances were used as input for principal coordinates analysis; a neighbor-joining tree resulted in UniFrac distances that were nearly identical to the distances based on the UPGMA tree (Mantel test, r = 0.97, P < 0.001), and the PC plot based on the neighbor-joining distances was virtually identical to that based on UPGMA distances (data not shown). Multivariate regression analysis (Anderson 2001; McArdle and Anderson 2001) for associations between the genetic distance matrices and potential predictor variables of interest was carried out with the DISTLM program (Anderson 2004); this method treats the entire distance matrix as the response variable and uses a permutation method to test for associations with potential explanatory variables, in a regression analysis framework.",
