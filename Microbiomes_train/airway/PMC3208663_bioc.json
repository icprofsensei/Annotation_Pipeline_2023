Sampling by bronchoscopy requires passage through the upper respiratory tract (URT), which harbors large microbial populations and where contaminating organisms may be acquired. In addition, samples from lung may be of low microbial biomass, meaning that low-level admixture of sequences from dust, reagents, instruments, or other sources might also confound the data. To be definitive, molecular sampling needs to document the contribution of sequences from each of these sources.",

Some organisms found in low-biomass lung samples matched environmental or control sequences. Unique LRT sequences were rare and inconsistent among subjects and samples. We conclude that there is no distinctive bacterial community in the healthy LRT, and the low amounts of bacterial sequences detectable in the LRT arise mainly from URT microbiota, likely through microaspiration along with bronchoscopic carryover during sampling.",

If carryover contributes to 16S copies in BAL, it would be highest in BAL-A 1st Return and diminish subsequently, as suggested by culture-based studies (29). Page's L trend values calculated from 16S copy numbers of BAL samples revealed a significant trend (L = 79, P < 0.05) to fewer copies across the three samples, demonstrating a serial decrement in biomass. Thus, levels of microbial DNA in BAL are low and affected by URT carryover.

Using the UniFrac metric, we found that every subject's PSB was more closely related to their own Scope 1 Tip-swab and Scope 1 Post-wash than to those of any other subject (P < 0.05 for both weighted and unweighted UniFrac; data not shown). We also used a nonphylogenetic index of shared OTUs, the Jaccard Index (36, 37), which also revealed that each PSB was more closely related to Scope 1 samples from that subject than from any other (P < 0.0002 for both binary and abundance-weighted Jaccard; data not shown). Finally, we applied an OTU network analysis (38) to lung PSB and peri-glottic Scope 1 Tip samples, to determine whether specific lineages were more likely to be shared by these two samples from the same subject than by samples from different subjects (Figure E3). This analysis revealed that organisms were far more likely to be shared by an individual's pair of PSB and Scope 1 Tip samples than by samples from different individuals (P = 0.0014, 720 permutations).

As can be seen in the heatmap representation (Figure 3), while BAL and PSB closely match URT samples, several families appeared at relatively higher abundances in lung than in OP, OW, or Scope 1 samples. However, most of these taxa were also present at high relative abundances in control or pre-procedure channel wash samples, and their presence in lung was particularly associated with low bacterial biomass BAL. Some of these are mainly environmental (e.g., Sphingomonadaceae), whereas others are environmental but also have significant pathogenic potential (e.g., Pseudomonaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Staphylococcaceae). Some were also highly abundant in NP swabs (e.g., Propionibacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae). Thus, their appearance in BAL cannot be ascribed to lung origin, because their presence in controls and association with low-biomass lung samples suggest that they may result from environmental sources, but appear relatively more abundant in lung samples that are less confounded by URT carryover.",

Sequences reads were clustered at 97% identity and analyzed as \u201coperational taxonomic units (OTUs)\u201d (Table E2), representing our most fine-grained taxonomic classification. Out of 3,431 total OTUs, 410 were only detected in BAL or PSB specimens (Table E3). Over 87% of these OTUs were identified by only a single sequence read, and thus it is uncertain whether they are derived from rare organisms or from sequencing errors that eluded quality filters. Seven OTUs were identified as lung-specific and supported by more than 10 sequence reads. Each of these seven taxa was unique to a single individual's lung samples, and five of the seven were found in only one of the four LRT sample types from that individual, again raising questions about authenticity. However, the lung-specific lineage with the highest sequence count (32 sequences) was found in all three BAL and PSB samples from one individual (subject 3B10) but not in URT, Scope Pre-washes, or environmental controls. This OTU was identified as T. whipplei, a member of the Tropheryma genus.",

Molecular-based studies of the LRT using bronchoscopic collection of BAL or mucosal brushes have reported that airways of healthy individuals contain a characteristic distribution of organisms, often at very high levels (10, 11). However, these studies lacked separate analysis of upper airway microbiota, as well as environmental admixture controls, that we show here are needed to assign microbial populations to the lower airway.

The protected specimen brush sample of the relatively proximal endobronchial mucosa, performed after multiple BALs on the opposite side, had substantial levels of bacterial DNA, suggesting that that bacterial material originated from the LRT airway surface rather than entirely from bronchoscope carryover. However, the PSB-derived bacterial communities still retained the same relative composition as upper airway samples. Previous molecular studies show that microbial community structures are exquisitely sensitive to differences in environment niche, such that bacterial populations are clearly distinguishable when obtained from different regions of the skin or gastrointestinal tract or even gingival crevices of different teeth (13, 31, 39). Therefore, it is unlikely that LRT community profiles reflect an independent self-sustaining lung microbiome that is indistinguishable from URT communities, and most likely reflect transient URT-derived bacteria. Low levels of microaspiration normally occur in healthy people (40\u201342), consistent with this finding. It is unclear whether the bacterial DNA derived from live or dead bacteria.",

This organism was recently reported in BAL from patients with pneumonia or interstitial lung disease (43, 44), and may represent genuine detection of a bacteria resident of the LRT in this subject. Six other OTUs were present in fewer reads in LRT samples from individual subjects but absent in URT and environmental samples. However, they comprise only 6 OTUs versus 3,431 in the full set of lung samples and thus, if authentic LRT residents, they are extremely low abundance; none were found in more than one individual, and most were in only one of four LRT samples from that subject.

These studies typically excluded organisms normally present at high levels in the URT or restricted analysis to potential pulmonary pathogens, and utilized quantitative thresholds for \u201cclinically significant\u201d numbers of organisms (45\u201349). Unlike quantitative thresholds empirically determined for diagnosis of pneumonia, however, there are no validated criteria for defining colonization or identifying normal microbial populations of the lower airways. Some culture-based studies attempted to minimize URT carryover using the two-scope approach or separate analysis of BAL 1st Return (28\u201330, 50). As we have shown, culture-independent characterization of LRT microflora does not obviate the need for similar careful sampling and interpretation. Despite these caveats, molecular methods have a powerful advantage in analyzing lower respiratory tract inhabitants. Traditional culture is incomplete, highly selective, and semi-quantitative at best. In contrast, molecular analysis characterizes entire populations and, while not completely unbiased in DNA extraction or amplification efficiency, can accurately define relative abundances of all bacteria in distinct communities. Thus, molecular community characterization can compare different niches and identify organisms present in one site at a higher relative abundance than another. Similarly, our results do not imply that the presence of an organism in both the URT and LRT precludes biological significance, particularly for lung pathogens that may colonize the URT or that may be expectorated and secondarily found in the URT.",

Authentic lung bacteria can be molecularly identified given appropriate attention to minimize URT carryover and define its impact. In addition, low-biomass niches such as the lung require scrupulous attention to environmental admixture including Q-PCR determination of low- and high-biomass samples, and sequencing of otherwise unquantifiable amplification products. Using these approaches, it will be possible to define the role of LRT microbiota in lung health and disease, and to identify genuine LRT inhabitants.",
