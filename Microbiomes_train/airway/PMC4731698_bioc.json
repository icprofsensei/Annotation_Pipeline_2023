However, clarifying the relationship between the microbiome of the lung and the microbiome of other compartments, including the oropharynx, presents a challenge for lung microbiome analysis (2, 3). Because sampling of the lower airways by bronchoscopy depends on insertion of a bronchoscope through the nose or mouth, careful methodologic attention to possible contamination from the upper airway is required (4). Environmental sources that may confound the lung data must be evaluated, particularly in low bioburden samples. Although bacterial taxa in the lung closely resemble those of the upper airway from the oropharynx (5), there seem to be differences between the mouth and the lungs in both health and disease (6, 7). A growing body of literature documents changes in the microbiome that occur during pulmonary disease processes, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8\u201311), bronchiectasis (12), asthma (13\u201315), lung transplantation (16\u201319), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (20, 21), and cystic fibrosis (22, 23).",

The Shannon Diversity Index combines measurements of evenness (distribution of OTUs across a population) and richness (number of different OTUs in a population) to express diversity numerically. After randomly selecting 500 sequences per sample with 1,000 randomizations, the distances between populations were measured using \u0398YC (ThetaYC) as previously described (27). \u0398YC measures dissimilarity between the structures of communities. We tested for differences in the average distance between each group of samples by analysis of molecular variance, a statistical tool analogous to analysis of variance (28). OTUs were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test for all OTUs with average relative abundances of greater than 1% across all samples. These tools produce similar results to the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances (data not shown); we chose the \u0398YC distance metric over the UniFrac metrics because the former is based on the relative abundance of individual OTUs, whereas the latter is based on a phylogenetic tree without the use of OTU designations.",

We did not detect overall differences in numbers of OTUs or in the Shannon diversity index. Microbial populations in oral washes differed between HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected subjects, but BAL populations did not differ significantly. The most surprising finding in our study was the overall similarity of the microbiota in subjects with and without HIV infection. This result was unexpected, since HIV-infected individuals (even with relatively preserved CD4 counts) are at higher risk for lower respiratory tract bacterial infections, including bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis, indicating significantly impaired local immune function. We did identify greater differences in oral washes than in BALs. It is possible that these differences reflect the greater complexity of the oropharyngeal compartment and/or increased exposure to the environment, but we did observe significant differences in our subject groups related to HIV infection and treatment status. Alterations in the oral microbiome have important implications for disease processes (29), such as periodontal diseases (30), but may precede changes in the lung. Previous work by one of the LHMP collaborators identified increased abundances for a large number of taxa in oral samples from HIV-infected patients with pneumonia, in comparison to HIV-uninfected control subjects (31). A culture-based study identified abundant Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. in oral samples from HIV-infected subjects, but uninfected subjects were not examined in this study (32). A study of the lingual microbiome associated increased proportions of Veillonella, Prevotella, Megasphaera, and Campylobacter with HIV viremia (33).",

We previously compared HIV-uninfected smokers and nonsmokers and found that the lung microbiome in HIV-uninfected individuals was largely derived from the oral microbiome, except for some unique lung species such as Tropheryma whipplei (6). The mouth microbiome differed in smokers and nonsmokers, whereas smoking did not alter the lung microbiome significantly. The LHMP then conducted a targeted analysis of colonization of the lung by T. whipplei in the lungs of HIV-infected individuals and also demonstrated that the use of antiretroviral therapy decreased the relative abundance of this organism (7). In the current, larger cohort, we adopted a different approach by combining smokers and nonsmokers for analysis (as there were no significant differences in smoking status between subject groups), by analyzing all OTUs, and by approaching potential environmental controls conservatively using the neutral model. In comparing relative abundances of OTUs in oral washes and BALs, we found more OTUs that differed in the Negative and HAART subjects than in the Naive subjects. Interestingly, we observed differences in T. whipplei in Negative and HAART subjects but not in Naive subjects.",

First, we collected samples from individuals at eight different clinical sites, whereas most of the existing literature examines subjects enrolled from a single center. Previous, small studies have suggested geographic variation, for example in sputa obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis in the United States and the United Kingdom (36). We did not detect systematic variation among our sites. The current results support our previous multicenter investigation in which patterns of diversity were not driven by cohort location (7). Next, none of the patients received oral or inhaled corticosteroids. The role of inhaled corticosteroids in modulation of the upper and/or lower airway microbiota remains unclear (14).",

However, the statistical power to analyze these factors post hoc is problematic given the small numbers in the subgroups. We focused on bacteria and did not analyze viruses or fungi. We also did not analyze gut microbiota or the subjects\u2019 diets, but it is likely that the gut and diet have significant influence on the upper and lower airway microbiota (11). In mice, the gut microbiota is intimately associated with pulmonary phenotypes, including allergic and asthma-like conditions (37, 38). Next, the samples were obtained at a single point in time, although several of the LHMP sites are conducting serial sampling. A recent analysis of the Human Microbiome Project data demonstrated that samples from oral communities were the least stable over time, in comparison to the relative stability of gut samples (39). We chose oral washes as integrative samples of the mouth, realizing that it was impractical to control accurately for differences in oral hygiene. Thus, small differences in composition of bacterial communities in different regions of the oropharynx may impact the most appropriate comparator against which to assess BAL specimens (40). Bronchoscopy, although providing the only practical method to sample the lung in large numbers of subjects, runs an inherent risk of contamination from the oropharynx and upper airway during the procedure. The lower biomass of BAL samples from clinically well individuals necessitated the sequencing depth we reported, and future investigations using higher biomass samples should consider deeper sequencing. It also appears that the lung microbiome in individuals who are clinically well and without lung disease is largely derived from the oral microbiome, making it challenging to distinguish carry-over from true members of the community (6). Although sampling during surgery can approach a gold standard (9, 10), this methodology is less practical for studies examining large numbers of subjects or for performing serial sampling.",

Oral bacterial communities differed significantly depending on HIV status, whereas lung communities sampled by BAL were similar. We identified specific taxa in oral samples that differed among the subject groups. Within each subject group, we identified a unique signature of taxa differing between the mouth and the lung; the patterns in the Negative and HAART subjects were similar to one another but differed from the pattern in the Naive subjects. These LHMP data serve as a basis for further investigations of the role of the lung microbiome during health and disease in HIV-infected individuals (3).",
