Although bacterial infections are implicated in nearly 50% of exacerbations, only a handful of pathogens have been consistently identified in COPD airways, primarily by culture-based methods, and the bacterial microbiota in acute exacerbations remains largely uncharacterized. The aim of this study was to comprehensively profile airway bacterial communities using a culture-independent microarray, the 16S rRNA PhyloChip, of a cohort of COPD patients requiring ventilatory support and antibiotic therapy for exacerbation-related respiratory failure. PhyloChip analysis revealed the presence of over 1,200 bacterial taxa representing 140 distinct families, many previously undetected in airway diseases; bacterial community composition was strongly influenced by the duration of intubation. A core community of 75 taxa was detected in all patients, many of which are known pathogens. Bacterial community diversity in COPD airways is substantially greater than previously recognized and includes a number of potential pathogens detected in the setting of antibiotic exposure. Comprehensive assessment of the COPD airway microbiota using high-throughput, culture-independent methods may prove key to understanding the relationships between airway bacterial colonization, acute exacerbation, and clinical outcomes in this and other chronic inflammatory airway diseases.",

A significant proportion of COPD-related healthcare costs are attributable to hospitalization for respiratory exacerbations (Mannino and Braman, 2007), with severe exacerbations having been associated with high mortality rates (Connors et al., 1996; Nseir et al., 2006). Bacterial infections are implicated in approximately 50% of COPD exacerbations (Sethi and Murphy, 2008). However, in most studies to date, bacterial identification has primarily relied on culture-based methods (Papi et al., 2006; Rosell et al., 2005; Soler et al., 2007) or species-specific, targeted PCR approaches (Murphy et al., 2004). Therefore, the true depth of bacterial diversity present in COPD airways is unknown, and the potential role for mixed-species bacterial communities in the pathogenesis of chronic airway colonization and acute exacerbations have been largely overlooked.",

Growing interest in characterizing these consortia and their interactions with the host, is exemplified by the formation in 2008 of the International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC), a collaborative effort to merge data generated through the U.S. NIH Human Microbiome Project (HMP; http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp) and the E.U. Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT; www.metahit.eu) initiatives. Constant exposure of the respiratory tract with the external environment could conceivably lead to important microbe\u2013microbe and microbe\u2013host interactions, yet the human airway microbiota, particularly that present in the context of pulmonary disease, remains largely uncharacterized. Given the limitations of culture-based methods, culture-independent approaches that identify species, or groups of closely related species, based on sequence polymorphisms in conserved genes, such as the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene, enable a more comprehensive assessment of microbial members present in a mixed-species population. Such methods have increasingly been applied to identify bacterial consortia in a variety of human niches with demonstration that community composition is related to disease states such as obesity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and cystic fibrosis airway disease (Flanagan et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2007; Rogers et al., 2004; Turnbaugh et al., 2006).",

Subjects admitted to the ICU with a primary diagnosis of \u201cCOPD exacerbation\u201d were identified for inclusion in our study. Available endotracheal aspirates (ETAs) from eight patients were processed for 16S rRNA PhyloChip analysis, as detailed below. To compare results from PhyloChip analysis with conventional clinical cultures, we obtained results of quantitative clinical laboratory bacterial cultures (blood agar, chocolate agar, and EMB media) performed on minibronchoalveolar lavage (m-BAL) airway samples, collected within 1\u20135 days of the ETA specimen analyzed by PhyloChip, as previously described (Flanagan et al., 2007). We have previously found m-BALs to possess a similar bacterial community composition to that of ETAs obtained concurrently from the same patient (Flanagan et al., 2007). Clinical data (Table 1) were recorded in a secure database, including whether a diagnosis of pneumonia by conventional clinical and radiologic criteria (Zhuo et al., 2008) was made during the patient's hospitalization and the time frame between diagnosis and collection of airway samples.

The positive fraction (pf\u2009) of probe sets (minimum of 11, median of 24 probe-pairs per taxon) was calculated, and a taxon was considered \u201cpresent\u201d if the calculated pf was \u226590%. Statistical analyses were performed in the R environment (www.R-project.org), using the ecological community analysis package vegan (version 1.16-1). Log-transformed fluorescence intensities were used to calculate Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures of ecological distance. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), a nonparametric ordination method that maps community relatedness, in this case using the Bray-Curtis distance metric, was used to assess variability in bacterial community structure. The function adonis (Anderson, 2001), which conducts a matrix-based nonparametric analysis of variance, was applied to explore relationships between community composition and clinical variables, including age, gender, number of intubation days, presence of pneumonia, time frame between pneumonia diagnosis and sample collection, antibiotic and corticosteroid treatments, and survival to ICU discharge. Between-group differences in taxon abundance were assessed by two-tailed t-testing with significance adjusted for false discovery using q-values, as previously described (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003). Taxa exhibiting q values\u2009<0.05, a p-value \u22640.02 and a change of >1,000 fluorescence units (log-fold change in 16S rRNA copy number) were considered statistically and biologically significant.

Four subjects (patients 1, 4, 5, and 6) exhibited communities with significantly fewer taxa (p\u2009<\u20090.002) compared with the other four subjects. Patients in which fewer bacterial taxa were detected tended to possess more members of the Pseudomonadaceae. In contrast, members of the Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Bacillaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae were detected more commonly in those patients with richer communities (patients 2, 3, 7). Patient 8 was observed to possess a large proportion of taxa belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which have been associated with more advanced COPD lung disease (Sethi and Murphy, 2008). Interestingly, this patient had radiographic evidence of coexisting bronchiectasis, which was not present in the other patients.",

                    "text": "Given the variation in bacterial richness among samples, which suggested differences in bacterial community composition, NMDS was used to assess variation in bacterial community structure (based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures) across the sample cohort. This revealed two distinct groups of patient samples and confirmed that patient 8 represented a structurally distinct airway community (Fig. 2). Although the cohort was small, given this separation of subjects based on differing bacterial community structures, the influence of available clinical parameters on community composition was explored. Matrix-based, nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance (Anderson, 2001) revealed that across the cohort, the number of elapsed intubation days was significantly associated with bacterial community composition and structure, accounting for the greatest percentage of the observed variability (44%, p\u2009<\u20090.03; Fig. 2). Group 1 patient samples (patients 2, 3, and 7) were characterized by a shorter intubation duration prior to ETA sample collection (\u22646 days), while those in Group 2 were intubated for significantly longer periods of time (p\u2009<\u20090.0007; patients 1, 4, 5, and 6; \u226516 days) and exhibited a significantly less rich community composition compared to that of Group 1 (p\u2009<\u20090.025). Given the community variation between Group 1 and Group 2, differences in the relative abundance of all detected taxa were assessed between the groups, which identified 153 taxa with significantly different relative abundances (Table 4; see at end of article). All of these significant taxa were present in higher abundance in Group 1, the majority of which (77%) belonged to the phylum Firmicutes. These included species such as Lactobacillus kitasatonis, L. perolens, L. sakei, and Bacillus clausii, as well as known pathogenic species such as Streptococcus constellatus, which is a member of the Streptoccocus milleri group (SMG; Table 4). No other clinical variable [including diagnosis of pneumonia (n\u2009=\u20096; p\u2009<\u20090.4) or the number of days between pneumonia diagnosis and sample collection (range: 3\u201352 days; p\u2009<\u20090.6)] demonstrated a significant association with bacterial community composition in this cohort.",

In addition, taxa containing species of pathogenic potential, such as Arcobacter cryaerophilus, Brevundimonas diminuta, Leptospira interrogans, as well as P. aeruginosa, were detected in all patients (a complete list of the core taxa is provided in Table 5; see at end of article). We also analyzed the array data for organisms that have previously been associated with COPD airways (Sethi and Murphy, 2008). Haemophilus influenzae was detected by the array in two subjects (patients 2 and 8), although corresponding m-BAL cultures were negative for this organism. Moraxella catarrhalis was not detected by PhyloChip or culture in any patient sample. However, other phylogenetically related members in the Moraxellaceae family, including Moraxella oblonga, Acinetobacter haemolyticus, and Psychrobacter psychrophilus were identified by the array in 80\u2013100% of subjects (Table 3). Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in four subjects (patients 2, 3, 7 and 8) despite all m-BALs being culture-negative for this species. Finally, we also examined PhyloChip data for the presence of the atypical bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, which are associated with 3\u20135% percent of exacerbations (Sethi and Murphy, 2008). Neither was detected by the PhyloChip, although a related species, Mycoplasma pulmonis, was identified in a single individual (patient 3).",

The overall aim of this study was to begin to address the overarching question whether previously undetected bacterial species exist in the airways of COPD patients during acute exacerbations. High-resolution, culture-independent analysis using the 16S rRNA PhyloChip revealed a much greater diversity of bacteria than has previously been appreciated in the airways of COPD patients being managed for severe exacerbations, including members of the Pseudomonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Helicobacteraceae, among others. The potential for a diverse airway bacterial community to play a role in chronic airway colonization and inflammation, a feature of COPD, has not been previously considered.",

Future studies in a larger cohort of patients, including nonintubated COPD patients with a greater range of exacerbation severity, will be necessary to determine relationships between community composition, structure, and pulmonary health. Only a handful of bacterial species, such as H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, have previously been associated with COPD exacerbations. The possible role of other bacterial community members with pathogenic potential identified in this study, e.g. A. cryaerophilus, B. diminuta, and L. interrogans, may merit further investigation. Many of these species have been implicated in other pathogenic processes such as endocarditis (Han and Andrade, 2005; Marques da Silva et al., 2006; Paster et al., 2002) and bacteremia (Hsueh et al., 1997; Woo et al., 2001). L. interrogans, the causative agent of human leptospirosis (Gaudie et al., 2008), has recently been shown to induce pulmonary lesions in an experimental animal model of airway infection (Marinho et al., 2009) and pulmonary hemorrhage in severe cases (Dall'Antonia et al., 2008). Their potential for pathogenesis suggests the possibility of a role for these organisms in COPD chronic airway disease. Future studies involving functional and mechanistic analyses will be necessary to further assess this.",

Although contamination by oropharyngeal secretions is always a possibility, samples were collected through an endotracheal tube, diminishing the degree of direct contamination. Ongoing microaspiration during intubation, however, cannot be completely prevented, and it has been suggested that the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract act as a microbial reservoir for seeding the airways in vulnerable patient populations (Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 1997; Heyland and Mandell, 1992; Orozco-Levi et al., 2003). In our study the relative abundance of targeted gastrointestinal-associated species, H. cetorum and C. mucosalis (Figura et al., 1993; Garcia-Amado et al., 2007), were confirmed by independent Q-PCR in airway samples from these patients. The presence of oropharyngeal or gut-associated bacteria in the lower airways may have significant implications for a disease population with greater risks from pulmonary infections. For example, Duan et al. (2003) demonstrated in a rat model that coinfection of P. aeruginosa with oropharyngeal bacterial species (isolated from cystic fibrosis patient sputa) resulted in enhanced lung damage and upregulation of P. aeruginosa virulence gene expression. In our study, P. aeruginosa and oropharyngeal and gut-associated species were present in the airways of all patients studied, suggesting the potential for enhanced pathogenesis in this patient population.",

Therefore, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to a broader group of COPD patients, especially nonintubated individuals experiencing less severe exacerbations. Although facilitating access to lower respiratory specimens that are otherwise challenging to obtain during severe exacerbations, the intubation status of these patients is an important consideration in weighing these findings. Although protracted intubation was associated with decreased bacterial community richness, the possibility for a more diverse bacterial community to play a role at least at the onset of exacerbation-associated respiratory failure remains. Control samples from nonintubated COPD and non-COPD patients were not available for this study, nor were longitudinal samples from these patients. In a previous study, however, we have found that endotracheal samples obtained from patients briefly intubated for elective surgery produced no detectable 16S rRNA PCR product (Flanagan et al., 2007). The lack of an association between duration of active antimicrobial therapy and bacterial community structure is most likely due to both the small study numbers as well as the administration of previous antibiotic courses up to one month prior to sample collection in the study (e.g., patient 6).",

                    "text": "Results of this study highlight the advantages of complementing culture-based methods with higher resolution approaches for bacterial detection to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the airway microbiota present in COPD patients. Culture-independent methods are particularly relevant to identify viable but nonculturable species that produce and exist in biofilms (Rayner et al., 1998), which are characteristic of chronic airway infections (Costerton et al., 1999; Singh et al., 2000) and have recently been implicated in COPD (Martinez-Solano et al., 2008). Because our PhyloChip analysis was based on DNA extracted from airway samples, it does not provide information on the viability of the species detected. However, we have previously noted that within 24\u2009h of antimicrobial administration to cystic fibrosis patients, bacterial richness decreased approximately 10-fold as detected by the PhyloChip (Lynch, unpublished data). This suggests that DNA turnover is relatively rapid in the airways of chronic pulmonary disease patients, and that the taxa detected during antimicrobial administration in our COPD patients largely represent the viable portion of the community. This is supported by the finding that the PhyloChip detected all species that were isolated by concurrent clinical laboratory culture. Independent Q-PCR analysis of selected taxa also demonstrated strong concordance between calculated 16S rRNA copy number and PhyloChip-based fluorescence intensities, validating the abundance of individual species detected by the array. Although both cultures and the microarray demonstrated low detection rates for H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, two species commonly associated with COPD exacerbation (potentially due to antibiotic-mediated clearance), only the PhyloChip identified other Haemophilus species across the majority of patients in this study, as well as other members of the Moraxellaceae family. Although these molecular methods may identify potentially relevant species undetected by culture, they provide no information on the viability or activity of these species. Hence, the significance of detecting species phylogenetically related to known pathogens in COPD airways is unclear, but may merit further study.",

A core community of bacterial taxa comprised of many known pathogens, some not previously associated with COPD, was common to all patients studied. Given that the disease model of COPD is generally characterized by chronic airway colonization, recurrent infection-related exacerbations, and a persistent state of chronic airway inflammation, these results highlight the need to consider the polymicrobial community present in COPD airways and the potential functional effects of these consortia on immune response and pulmonary health. Identification of relationships that exist between bacterial communities, their collective gene expression, concomitant host response, and clinical outcomes may ultimately lead to improved understanding of the pathogenesis of COPD.",
