Whilst no patient cultured Neisseria, 5 of the patients were found to be dominated by a Neisseria OTU from the sequencing results. Seventeen (70.83%) of the 24 patients cultured Haemophilus influenzae, while only 9 (52.94%) of the same patients were found to be Haemophilus dominated by sequencing. Moraxella was cultured from 3 patients, in two of the three Moraxella was found to be the dominant organism by sequencing. Another 2 patients, however, were dominated by the Moraxella OTU despite not being positive on culture for the bacterium. Only fifteen of the 24 patients (62.5%) cultured the dominant organism that was identified by sequencing.",

Nose swabs from mothers were significantly different from their own throat swabs, showing that there are major differences between these areas of the upper respiratory tract. Previous studies have shown that unlike the nose the bacterial community from the throat is more similar to that of the lower airways [11]. It was hypothesised that the bacterial community present in the respiratory tract of mothers and children would therefore potentially share similarities, due to their close proximity and shared environments when children are under 2 years of age. In the majority of cases however, the community composition of the mothers\u2019 samples were significantly different from their children. Only a single case was observed where the maternal oropharyngeal community and their child\u2019s lower airway bacterial communities were similar, and these samples were found to be dominated by the same organism.",

Hilty et al. observed a decrease in the Proteobacteria and an increase in Bacteroidetes in controls compared to asthmatics, although only 3 of their 7 controls had no respiratory symptoms [11]. The current study demonstrates that the data generated from a blind brushing via an ET tube is comparable to that obtained by visualization using bronchoscopy, the so-called non-blind brush, allowing the inclusion of healthy children attending the hospital for reasons unrelated to respiratory symptoms.",

This study is the first step in using next generation sequencing methods to increase our understanding of the bacterial community within the lungs of children with PBB.
