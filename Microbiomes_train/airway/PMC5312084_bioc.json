We sought to establish whether bronchoscopic sampling accurately reflects the lung microbiome in health and to distinguish between two proposed routes of authentic microbial immigration, (i) dispersion along contiguous respiratory mucosa and (ii) subclinical microaspiration. During bronchoscopy of eight adult volunteers without lung disease, we performed seven protected specimen brushings (PSB) and bilateral bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) per subject. We amplified, sequenced, and analyzed the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V4 regions by using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Rigorous attention was paid to eliminate potential sources of error or contamination, including a randomized processing order and the inclusion and analysis of exhaustive procedural and sequencing control specimens. Indices of mouth-lung immigration (mouth-lung community similarity, bacterial burden, and community richness) were all significantly greater in airway and alveolar specimens than in bronchoscope contamination control specimens, indicating minimal evidence of pharyngeal contamination. Ecological indices of mouth-lung immigration peaked at or near the carina, as predicted for a primary immigration route of microaspiration. Bacterial burden, diversity, and mouth-lung similarity were greater in BAL than PSB samples, reflecting differences in the sampled surface areas.

Results of such studies showed that healthy human lungs contain diverse bacterial communities (2,\u20135). None of the >25 studies of healthy subjects that used molecular techniques to characterize bacteria in bronchoscopically obtained lung specimens has failed to detect bacteria (2,\u20135). The bacterial load of bronchoscopically acquired specimens is roughly 100-fold greater than that of procedural control specimens (6,\u20138). The viability of most of the bacteria recovered can be verified by using advanced cultivation techniques (9). In health, the lung microbial community composition determined by culture-independent techniques correlates with key features of host inflammation (7, 10), and its variation at spatially distinct lung sites within individuals is lower than intersubject community variation (2).",

Bacterial communities detected in bronchoscopic specimens from healthy subjects more closely resemble those of the oropharynx than those of any competing source community (e.g., nasopharynx or inhaled air) (6, 9). Unlike in the gut, no novel bacteria have been identified within the lungs, and with rare exceptions (notably, Tropheryma [5, 11]), there is scant evidence of site-specific selective survival pressure or local reproduction during health (9). Thus, provided one accepts the validity of bronchoscopic sampling, these findings indicate that the healthy lung microbiome is determined largely by the balance between immigration of the oropharyngeal microbiota and its elimination by mucociliary clearance, coughing, and local host defenses (the adapted island model of lung biogeography) (2, 12,\u201314).",

If bacteria were primarily introduced simply because of contamination of the bronchoscope, ecological indices of mouth-lung immigration (mouth-lung community similarity, total bacterial burden, and community richness [12]) would be high in the BCC specimen but would then decay in subsequent airway samples because of dilution. Conversely, if the primary immigration route were dispersion along the bronchial mucosa, the signal in the BCC specimen would be minimal and there would be a distinct proximal-to-distal signal gradient. Finally, subclinical microaspiration would also show a minimal signal in the BCC specimen but the ecological signal of mouth-lung immigration would be highest near the carina because of the gravity dependence of the central airways in upright humans.",

(OTU00002) that was prominent in oral rinse, PSB, and BAL specimens across subjects. Oral rinse specimens were dominated by Prevotella (OTU00002), Veillonella (OTU00004), and Streptococcus (OTU00003), consistent with previous studies. Whereas these taxa were infrequently detected and in low abundance in BCC specimens, they were common and abundant in both PSB and BAL specimens. Density analysis (Fig.\u00a02) showed that mouth-lung similarity was greatest across subjects at the carina and proximal bronchus intermedius, consistent with the predicted topography attributable to gravity-dependent microaspiration. Several subjects exhibited elevated mouth-lung similarity at the proximal and mid-trachea sites, consistent with direct dispersal along contiguous mucosa.",

Rather, indices of mouth-lung immigration in PSB samples peaked between the proximal trachea and the carina and subsequently decreased with greater distance along the airways. This ecological trend could be seen most distinctly in mouth-lung similarity (Bray-Curtis distance) (Fig.\u00a03A), which failed to fit the linear relationship predicted for dispersion along the bronchial mucosa (P > 0.05) but did fit the parabolic (quadratic) relationship predicted for microaspiration (P = 0.0017), which resulted in less loss of information by the Akaike information criterion (AIC; linear [23.279] versus quadratic [14.847] models). While some subjects exhibited evidence of bacterial immigration at the proximal and mid-trachea sites (see the bimodal density plots for these sites in Fig.\u00a02), the strongest and most uniform evidence of mouth-lung immigration was found at the carina and bronchus intermedius (see the unimodal distribution in Fig.\u00a02). Taken together, the bacterial topography data from PSB samples were most consistent with microaspiration being the primary immigration route (Fig.\u00a01C), though concurrent immigration from mucosal dispersion (Fig.\u00a01B) cannot be excluded and likely contributes in some healthy subjects.",

We interpret these results to reflect differences in the surface areas sampled; whereas PSB samples approximately 1\u00a0cm2 of the airway mucosa, BAL fluid of a wedged subsegment samples approximately 1/40 of the total surface area of the lungs (25) or approximately 17,500\u00a0cm2.

Third, our data favor microaspiration as the primary source of bacterial immigration to human lungs in health, although we cannot exclude a contribution from contiguous mucosal dispersion.

Although an invasive procedure, outpatient investigative bronchoscopy under moderate conscious sedation can be performed safely not only on healthy volunteers but also on those with established lung diseases (26, 27). Investigative bronchoscopy is increasingly being incorporated into multicenter observational trials to link microbiome analyses to intermediate biomarkers of disease activity and progression (28,\u201330). The current results should dispel concerns that the substantial investment of these undertakings is misguided. Bronchoscopy is also well suited to the careful topographical analysis needed to define how the composition of lung bacterial communities responds to the markedly disparate gradients of temperature, oxygen tension, and other variables along the human LRT. Because lung bacterial communities show pronounced anatomic heterogeneity in advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (31) and likely will in other chronic pulmonary diseases, this consideration will take on special significance in the attempt to define how interactions between hosts and microbes contribute to the pathogenesis of different airway diseases. Additionally, our results provide support for the complementary capacities of PSB and BAL to sample the conducting airways and distal lungs, respectively, another important distinction in chronic lung diseases. Further, being able to rely on bronchoscopic sampling as a standard is an essential first step toward testing the validity of less invasive techniques, such as analysis of sputum or exhaled breath condensate, which pose even larger issues of potential contamination when paired with highly sensitive culture-independent microbiological techniques. Hence, bronchoscopic analysis of human LRT microbial communities has the potential to advance pulmonary research in multiple ways, not the least by informing strategies to modify lung bacterial communities therapeutically.",

                    "text": "Consistent with numerous previous studies of the healthy human bacterial lung microbiome (2, 4, 5, 7, 16), we found that airway and lung communities resemble oropharyngeal communities, with minimal evidence of site-specific enrichment by reproducing bacteria. We did not identify lung-specific taxa distinct from oropharyngeal taxa or the stochastic background taxa detected in procedural and sequencing control specimens. Our experimental design, with its meticulous collection of control specimens (including a dedicated postlaryngeal lumenal brush), demonstrated that the microbial signal detected in airway and alveolar specimens is not an artifact of pharyngeal contamination. Instead, this similarity of the mouth and lung microbiotas is far more plausibly explained by the ecological contiguity of these two anatomic compartments and by the ubiquity of subclinical microaspiration (as has been demonstrated repeatedly by using radiographic techniques [17, 33, 34]). In contrast, all negative procedural control specimens (including sterile saline, laboratory reagents, and unused specimen brushes) contained evidence of bacterial DNA when sequenced. The bacterial signal introduced by these sources\u2014referred to variously as the \u201ckitome\u201d and \u201ccontaminome\u201d\u2014is unavoidable in low-biomass microbiome studies (7, 32). Though such a spurious signal cannot be excluded from studies such as ours, it can be managed if prospectively sought and properly analyzed. We have adopted and strongly support recommendations on minimizing the risk of systematic bias and false grouping in low-biomass microbiome studies (32), i.e., sequencing of multiple \u201cnegative\u201d controls for all potential sources of contamination, using a single DNA extraction kit for all specimens, randomizing the order in which specimens are processed, and systematically comparing the taxa detected in negative controls with those in biological specimens to determine the relative influence of reagent contamination.",

Our findings agree with imaging studies indicating that subclinical aspiration is common in healthy subjects (17, 33, 34). Further studies are needed to elucidate how specific pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases (13) alter this balance of ecological forces and, conversely, how deviations in the structure of bacterial respiratory tract communities from the neutral, orally derived microbiome participate in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic lung diseases. Given the meteoric rise in the worldwide prevalence of lung diseases, especially asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, these are important goals.",
