Oral biofilms established on membrane filters were collected from 32 human subjects after 5 different maturation intervals (1, 3, 5, 9 and 14 days) and the respective phylogenetic diversity was analyzed by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Our analyses revealed highly diverse entire colonization profiles, spread into 8 phyla/candidate divisions and in 15 different bacterial classes. A large inter-individual difference in the subjects\u2019 microbiota was observed, comprising 35% of the total variance, but lacking conspicuous general temporal trends in both alpha and beta diversity. We further obtained strong evidence that subjects can be categorized into three clusters based on three differently occurring and mutually exclusive species clusters.",

                    "text": "High-throughput sequencing approaches have revolutionized our prospects and knowledge on microbial communities. For instance the human microbiome with its high variability between host individuals and distinct species assemblies on different parts of the human body was extensively examined [1]\u2013[3]. Studies of these communities may elucidate interactions among microbes, as well as host-microbe interactions of ecological and clinical relevance. This may aid, e.g., the prevention of detrimental biofilms in prosthetics and dentistry. The oral microbiome is one of the most diverse of the human body. More than 700 species are reported to colonize multiple niches [4]\u2013[6], including the soft tissue surfaces and the sub- and supragingival surfaces of the teeth, as a consequence of different environmental conditions (e.g., nutrients or pH) [7], [8]. While the majority of the oral community plays an important role in preserving the oral and systemic health [6], [9]\u2013[12], pathogens are also included at a low percentage. As a consequence of environmental changes, host response and disturbance of microbial homeostasis, an increase of the pathogenic community might promote the development of oral diseases by leading to inflammation and infection [8], [13]. Even though periodontal diseases are initiated by polymicrobial infection, several bacterial species are commonly linked to particular oral diseases. The oral microbiome is also associated with systemic diseases [14]\u2013[17], including for instance cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis [14], [17]. Recently, we demonstrated that even experimentally induced gingivitis - a low-level inflammation in response to bacterial biofilm formation after a few days of suspended oral hygiene - triggers a systemic increase of surrogate markers of atherosclerotic plaque development [18]. However, the changes from health to disease as well as the mechanisms responsible for increased occurrence of pathogens are poorly understood. Likewise, studies of the human microbiome revealed that even healthy individuals could differ extremely in their bacterial community structure in same habitats, with much of this inter-individual difference remaining unexplained [2]. Thus, more insight into \u201chealthy\u201d consortia in oral biofilms is crucial for understanding development, prevention and treatment of oral diseases.",

The primer contained the 454 Life Sciences Adaptor B (forward) and A (reverse) denoted by italics and the underlined sequences represent the broadly conserved bacterial primers 27F and 338R. A two-base linker sequence (TC/CA) and four-base key (TCAG) were added as recommended by Roche (454). A unique 10mer multiplex identifier (designated X) was added to every reverse primer to tag each PCR product. Template DNA (100 ng) was added to a 25 \u00b5L PCR reaction mix including Phusion Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Vantaa/Finland). Cycling conditions started with an initial denaturation step for 30 s at 98\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of 9 s at 98\u00b0C, 30 s at 55\u00b0C and 30 s at 72\u00b0C and ended with a final extension for 10 min at 72\u00b0C. All reactions were performed in duplicates and combined after PCR. Amplicons were size-checked, purified with the MiniElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden/Germany) and quantified with the Quant-iT dsDNA Broad-Range Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Darmstadt/Germany) using a NanoDrop 3300 fluorometer. Equimolar amounts of purified PCR product were pooled and further purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld/Germany). A sample of each library was run on an Agilent Bioanalyzer prior to emulsion PCR and sequencing as recommended by Roche.

Raw sequencing data in standard flowgram format were first assigned to samples according to their multiplex identifiers (MIDs) with the forward primer sequence removed. Only reads between 360 and 720 flows, with a maximum homopolymer count of 8 and no differences to MIDs/forward primer were retained (command trim.flows). Data were denoised (shhh.flows) and kept if their mean phred score [20], [21] was \u226525 after denoising (trim.seqs). Sequences were aligned (align.seqs) to the SILVA reference alignment based on the SSURef database (v102) of bacterial sequences [22] provided on http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Silva_reference_files. The alignment was optimized by deleting the shortest and longest 2.5% of the sequences, respectively (screen.seqs), followed by removal of gap-only columns as well as columns containing missing data at both ends of the alignment (filter.seqs). The resulting alignment had 696 positions with sequence lengths ranging from 239 to 315 nucleotides. In order to further reduce PCR/pyrosequencing errors, reads with one mismatch to a more abundant sequence were merged with the latter (pre.cluster). Chimeras were eradicated employing mothur\u2019s implementation of Perseus [23] (chimera.perseus, remove.seqs). Initial sequence classification was conducted by a Bayesian approach [24] using a k-mer size of 8 and a bootstrap threshold of 60% (classify.seqs). The RDP [25] reference taxonomy (http://www.mothur.org/w/images/4/4a/Trainset7_112011.pds.zip) was used with reference sequences trimmed to the V1\u2013V2 primer region to improve accuracy of the classification [cf. [26]. The dataset was screened for chloroplast sequences to be removed (remove.lineage) as these sequences would obviously have originated from vegetable food rather than from bacteria. A random subset of 1,042 sequences per sample (corresponding to the smallest number of reads above 1,000 across samples) was generated (sub.sample) to eliminate bias due to unequal sampling effort. A coverage of about 1,000 sequences per sample is suggested as a good balance between number of samples and depth of sampling [27]. Three samples (p35d01, p35d03, and p36d09) containing fewer sequences (855, 594, and 957, respectively) were kept in the dataset with reservation. The aligned and subsampled dataset was used to compute a distance matrix (dist.seqs) for binning sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTU) by average neighbor clustering (cluster.split). Based on a 97% similarity threshold (roughly corresponding to species level distinction) 1,779 OTUs were identified. A sample-by-OTU table was generated (make.shared) which for each sample states the number of sequences belonging to a certain OTU. This table was the basis for subsequent bioinformatic analyses. OTUs were classified according to the CORE reference database, a phylogenetically curated 16S rDNA database of the core oral microbiome [28], as described above for the RDP reference taxonomy (classify.seqs, followed by classify.otu).",

Based on this ordination configuration, weighted-average scores of species were calculated by vegan\u2019s (wascores) function for projection of species points into the PCA space of samples (scaling 1). Consistent clusters of species were determined by average-linkage clustering based on Spearman rank correlations of relative species abundances. Cluster number and robustness were assessed by consensus clustering [37] with package ConsensusClusterPlus [38] based on 1,000 random species subsamples (drawing without replacement) with a sampling proportion of 0.8. The optimal number of clusters was determined by assessing the relative change in the area under the consensus cumulative distribution function [cf. [37]. Robust cluster members were defined as species whose item consensus was \u22650.6 for the cluster they were assigned to and \u22640.4 for any other cluster. The multivariate coefficient of variation (RV) was calculated for each pair of robust species clusters based on rank-transformed species abundances.

A total of 160 biofilm samples were analyzed after DNA extraction and amplifying the hypervariable region V1\u2013V2 of the 16S rDNA by 454 pyrosequencing. 1,042 sequences per sample were retained after random subsampling, binned into a total of 1,779 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of which about only 15 were highly abundant across all samples (see Tables S2 and S3 for a list of raw OTU counts and corresponding taxonomy in file S1, respectively). Variability of sample diversity was high, ranging from 7 to 130 OTUs, distributed over 8 major phyla/candidate divisions (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Spirochaetae, SR1 and TM7). The phyla could further be subdivided into 15 identified classes (Bacilli, Clostridia, Erysipelotrichi, Negativicutes, \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, \u03b5-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteridae, Coriobacteridae, Bacteroidia, Flavobacteria, Sphingobacteria, Fusobacteria, Spirochaetes) (see Table S4 in file S1).

Initial data visualization did not reveal conspicuous general trends in 1D with time (Fig. S1 in file S1). To check for a possible less obvious temporal pattern, we fitted a generalized linear mixed model with \u201cDay\u201d as fixed effect. Because residuals showed clear deviation from normality (validated by visual inspection of a quantile-quantile plot), a gamma distribution with log link was used to model 1D. Comparison by AIC suggested the random intercept model (the intercept of the regression line may vary between subjects) as the best choice. While the model was valid (no conspicuous residual patterns were observed), the effect of variable \u201cDay\u201d was not significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.13), thus no time-related change in alpha diversity of oral microbiota was observed.",

For this purpose, we employed Spearman rank correlation for species abundances combined with consensus clustering - a simple and straightforward method of inferring robust clusters by resampling - to obtain robust results. A combined consensus clustering and unconstrained ordination analysis (Principal Component Analysis) revealed three clusters of species mutually excluding each other across subjects and time points (Fig. 2A, B; see also Fig. S2 in file S1 for an interactive version of this image with additional display options such as taxon names, subject codes and individual subject time points; see Table S5 for a list representation of species clusters in file S1). These three clusters of species differed in their relative abundances (averaged over time) in three corresponding subject clusters (Fig. 2C). Separation of the latter was corroborated by a fairly large ANOSIM statistic (R\u200a=\u200a0.54) with high statistical significance (p<10\u22125). The magenta-colored species cluster was dominated by different Prevotella species (\u201cPrevotella cluster\u201d), the green one contained \u03b2- and \u03b3-Proteobacteria (\u201cProteobacteria cluster\u201d) and the orange-colored cluster mainly contained Streptococcus species (\u201cStreptococcus cluster\u201d). The \u201cPrevotella cluster\u201d and the \u201cStreptococcus cluster\u201d showed a strong multivariate correlation (RV\u200a=\u200a0.3; p<0.01) and mutually exclude each other. A weak but still significant multivariate correlation (RV\u200a=\u200a0.07; p<0.01) was observed between the \u201cProteobacteria cluster\u201d and the contrasting \u201cPrevotella cluster\u201d. No significant correlation could be observed between the \u201cProteobacteria cluster\u201d and the \u201cStreptococcus cluster\u201d. Fig. 2C shows the relative species abundances (averaged over time and subjects) in the 3 detected subject clusters. Subject cluster 1 was dominated by the \u201cPrevotella cluster\u201d (60%) and \u201cStreptococcus cluster\u201d (40%). In the second subject cluster the \u201cStreptococcus cluster\u201d dominated (66%), followed by members of the \u201cPrevotella cluster\u201d (32%) and a minority of the \u201cProteobacteria cluster\u201d (2%). The third subject cluster exhibited the largest occurrence of the \u201cProteobacteria cluster\u201d (27%), while the \u201cPrevotella cluster\u201d represented about half of the counts (54%) and the \u201cStreptococcus cluster\u201d was least abundant (20%).",

The number of OTUs within each sample ranged from only 7 up to 130 consequently already suggesting a large variation between individuals. Further evidence for large inter-individual differences in microbial composition was obtained by RDA. This is in accordance with previous findings that the oral community is especially diverse in contrast to other body habitats, e.g. the vagina [2], [45]. The consistency of our 16S rDNA profiles of oral biofilms is comparable to the keratinized gingiva baseline at the phylum level in healthy subjects as reported by the Human Microbiome Project [46]. Comparison to a lower level is impaired by differences due to methods and approaches used, e.g. primer set, database, sequences per sample and number of subjects.",

This suggests that both, the cumulative number of OTUs as well as their individual turnover in a subject, is influenced more by random (or unaccounted/unknown) effects than by time in the course of biofilm formation between 24 h and 14 days. These findings are in agreement with previous reports that propose a high variability in the oral microbiome between individuals [11], [47] as well as a minimal temporal variability in individuals [45]. The Human Microbiome Project Consortium further reported on within-subject stability of the human microbiome by sampling an additional time point after approximately 220 days. They hypothesized that the stable individual microbial community may be another feature of the human microbiome specifically associated with health [2]. This assumption is supported by previous studies of microbial diversities of different body habitats, which has been linked to different diseases [48]\u2013[50]. For instance the complex stool communities were markedly reduced in specific gut diseases and bacterial vaginosis is associated with a high microbial diversity, whereas healthy vaginal sides harbored simpler communities [2]. Our study of oral biofilms in healthy subjects over time correlates favorably with these findings and further supports the idea of stable complex oral microbiota in health that obviously differ among subjects.",

A possible mechanism for such an \u201cinterspecies defense\u201d might be the release of bacteriocins produced by several streptococci as well as by numerous Gram-negative bacteria of the oral cavity. These effectively act against a variety of further bacterial members within this habitat [57]\u2013[60].

We assume that even in health, the oral bacterial community features a broad potential compositional spectrum. The obtained composition of the oral biofilm of a certain individual may be indicative for this person\u2019s ability to resist pathogens or disease susceptibility. Although all species in the identified clusters are members of the oral commensally community, there is evidence that some of these microorganisms are associated with gingivitis [68]\u2013[70]. These include Gram-positive species (e.g., Streptococcus ssp. and Parvimonas micra), as well as numerous Gram-negative species (e.g., Campylobacter gracilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Veillonella). Remarkably, all those bacteria are present in the identified \u201cPrevotella cluster\u201d. Moreover, another study [71] detected Capnocytophaga ssp., which is also a member of the \u201cPrevotella cluster\u201d, on the onset of gingivitis and identified Prevotella spp. in areas with established gingivitis. On the other hand, species that are associated with periodontal health - such as primary or early colonizers (e.g., Streptococcus and Gemella) [9], [72] - have been predominantly found in the identified \u201cStreptococcus cluster\u201d. Since we know from our earlier study with the same subject cohort [18] that the human subjects responded differently to an experimentally induced gingivitis in terms of inflammation severity (Eberhard, unpublished data), we hypothesize a potential association of species cluster prevalence with disease susceptibility and inflammatory condition of human subjects. However, future investigations are mandatory to address this aspect.",

Even though our subject group was quite homogenous in terms of age and health status, several systemic and external factors such as diet, gender, hormone status and stress known to have an impact on the oral microbiome were not controlled for in the present study. This contributed to the observed highly diverse colonization profiles. A subsequent investigation with a stricter control of the subject set-up, optimally over periods longer than 14 days, may reveal clearer temporal trends in alpha diversity. Since a potential correlation between the oral microbiome and inflammatory diseases such as gingivitis might exist at the strain or even at the genomic/metabolic level, this correlation may not be reflected by 16S rDNA based phylogenetic analysis even after optimization of the experimental set up. Consequently, more advanced tools such as shotgun metagenomics or metatranscriptomics [73] should be preferentially employed to uncover such relationships.",
