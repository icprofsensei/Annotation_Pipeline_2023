Recently, ACH production associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages has been reclassified as highly carcinogenic (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization [2]. In particular, increased ACH levels in saliva have been associated with increased risk for upper aerodigestive tract cancer [3\u20135], which was the seventh most common cancer in Japan in 2011 with one million newly diagnosed cases annually worldwide [6,7]. Increased ACH levels in saliva after ethanol consumption are suggested to be due to oxidation of alcohol by the oral microbiota [8,9].",

It has been shown that Neisseria species are capable of producing extremely high amounts of ACH when cultured in vitro in a medium containing ethanol [9]. In addition, we previously analyzed ACH production ability by the prevalent bacteria in the salivary microbiota of orally healthy subjects and found that several bacterial species in the oral microbiota possessed the ability to produce ACH [13]. In particular, Neisseria species were confirmed to produce significant levels of ACH from ethanol in vitro, in agreement with the reported finding by Muto et al. [9]. However, there have been no studies correlating ACH production ability with the complexity of the oral microbiota profiles, which encompass more than 700 bacterial species, 35% of which have not yet been cultured in the laboratory [14]. Analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing has made it possible to more comprehensively profile the oral microbiota in detail. This study aimed to explore the salivary microbiota profiles of healthy adults, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, with respect to ACH production ability in the oral cavity. We hypothesized that the salivary microbiota profile with a higher relative abundance of Neisseria species would show higher ACH production ability.",

The ACH concentration in 5\u00a0mL of the vial headspace gas was determined using the sensor gas chromatograph SGEA-P2 (FIS Inc., Hyogo, Japan). To measure artefactual ACH, 50\u00a0\u03bcL of PCA was first added to the saliva sample (400\u00a0\u03bcL), followed by ethanol. The ACH concentration of this control sample was subtracted from that of the test sample.

The saliva samples were clustered based on the relative abundance of genera using the Jensen-Shannon divergence distance metric, and the partitioning around medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm with the pam function in the cluster library of R. The number of clusters was chosen by maximizing the Calinski\u2013Harabasz (CH) index. The permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed using the adonis function in the vegan library of R. The most discriminant OTUs were determined using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) method [25]. The linear discriminant analysis score (LDA score) was shown to indicate the effect size of each OTU.",

Characteristic differences between the participants in the high and non-high ACH production ability groups were determined using the Pearson\u2019s Chi-square test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. To examine the association between bacterial community types and salivary ACH production ability, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for high ACH production ability based on bacterial community types using logistic regression models. A multivariate logistic regression model was created to adjust for possible confounding factors in the association between bacterial community types and salivary ACH production ability. The multivariate analysis included all independent variables that were significantly associated with salivary ACH production ability at a significance of P-value <0.05 in the descriptive analysis (Table 2). Additionally, a correlation between the most discriminant OTU in each bacterial community type and salivary ACH production ability was evaluated, using the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. All statistical analyses were performed using R or IBM SPSS statistical software (version 24; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant in all cases.",

The type I community was dominated by Streptococcus and Rothia species (Table 1), and OTUs corresponding to Streptococcus salivarius HOT-755 and Rothia mucilaginosa HOT-681 were identified as the most differentially abundant OTUs by the LEfSe approach to detect discriminant OTUs (Figure 2). In contrast, the type II community was dominated by Neisseria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas species (Table 1), and OTUs corresponding to Neisseria flavescens HOT-610, Fusobacterium periodonticum HOT-201, and Porphyromonas pasteri HOT-279 were identified as the most differentially abundant OTUs (Figure 2). In particular, the relative abundance of Neisseria species was significantly lower in the type I community (3.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3% in type I vs 16.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.7% in type II).",

The prevalence of the type I community was significantly higher in the high ACH production ability group compared to that in the non-high ACH production ability group. From a different perspective, the ACH production ability was significantly higher in the type I community (5,508\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03,658\u00a0ppb/mL in type I vs 3,180\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02,223\u00a0ppb/mL in type II). Total bacterial count in the saliva of the members of the high ACH production ability group was significantly higher than that in the members of the non-high ACH production ability group. With respect to frequency of alcohol intake, the difference in the bacterial community prevalence between daily and non-daily drinkers in the high ACH production ability group was shown to be statistically significant. In contrast, there were no significant differences with respect to age, number of present teeth, PPD, BOP, plaque index score, tooth brushing frequency, mouth rinse use, regular visits to the dentist, and smoking habits between the two groups.",

These findings highlighted that the salivary microbiota with higher relative abundance for Neisseria species independently associated with lower ACH production ability, although Neisseria are oral bacterial species that are known high-level ACH producers [9,13]. Furthermore, the association was independent of the total salivary bacterial count, alcohol intake frequency, and other important health characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first population-based sample study to elucidate the oral microbiota profiles affecting the ACH production ability using next-generation sequencing.",

However, the salivary microbiota with less relative abundance of Neisseria species (type I community) showed significantly higher ACH production ability than that with the higher relative abundance of Neisseria species (type II community). In addition, a significant inverse correlation between the relative abundance of Neisseria species and the ACH production ability in saliva was shown in this study. These findings suggest that an in vivo oral environment-derived type II community may arrest ACH production by Neisseria species. For instance, there is a possibility that some of the predominant metabolites produced by the type II community suppress the expression of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene of Neisseria species. Transcriptomic analysis in the future may be helpful in testing this hypothesis.",

Many species of bacteria capable of producing relatively high amounts of ACH, such as S. salivarius, R. mucilaginosa, and Prevotella histicola [13], were observed in relatively higher proportions in the type I community, even though the relative abundance of Neisseria species was less. Our previous study confirmed that S. salivarius, R. mucilaginosa, and P. histicola are the predominant members of the salivary microbiota even in orally healthy subjects and are capable of producing relatively high amounts of ACH from ethanol in vitro [13]. Although these species do not produce as much ACH as Neisseria species, it is possible that their sheer abundance compensates for the absence of Neisseria and explains the high levels of ACH produced in subjects with the type I microbiota. Further studies, using metagenomic approaches, are required to elucidate the functional differences in ethanol metabolism between the type I and type II communities.",

The subjects that resembled those with the type II community in this study showed better oral health conditions (i.e. had fewer teeth with dental caries, were non-smokers, and other such factors) and had a lower risk for pneumonia-related death [20,26], suggesting that the predominance of N. flavescens, F. periodonticum, and P. pasteri is an indicator of healthy oral microbiota. Furthermore, a recent report by Zaura et al. suggested that a bacterial community type characterized by a predominance of N. flavescens and Neisseria subflava positioned away from dysbiosis [27]. However, it is unexpected that a salivary microbiota predominant with Neisseria species is beneficial for health despite their capacity for high ACH production ability. In contrast, in this study, we demonstrated that the type II community dominated by N. flavescens showed significantly lower ACH production ability, showing an inverse correlation with the relative abundance of Neisseria species in the microbiota. Although the reason for this contradictory finding is still not known, our data are relevant to and highlight the clinical significance of the comprehensive analyses of the microbiota.",

As a result of the preliminary data, there was no statistical difference in the ACH producing activity between pre- and post-freezing samples (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.140).
