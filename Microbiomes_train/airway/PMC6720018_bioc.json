Additionally, saliva plays an important role in the maintenance of a natural balance between the host and the oral microbiota, which becomes evident in conditions with salivary gland dysfunction [3,4]. At low saliva flow rates, the salivary bicarbonate concentration drops, causing a reduction in salivary pH, and impairment of the salivary buffer capacity and clearance [5]. This can lead to a shift in the oral microbiota promoting colonization and growth of aciduric and acidogenic microorganisms, which increases the susceptibility for developing dental caries and oral candidiasis [5\u20137]. It has previously been shown that patients with pSS have a higher number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMF-T), as well as oral fungal infections, compared to healthy control subjects [7\u201311]. On the other hand, the risk of developing periodontitis does not appear to be higher in pSS [4,12].",

Zhou et al. found a significantly higher relative abundance of Veillonella species in patients with pSS than in healthy control subjects, but no differences with regard to Streptococcus and Lactobacillus species [11]. On the other hand, Siddiqui et al. found a higher proportion of Firmicutes and Streptococcus species and a lower proportion of Synergistetes and Spirochetes in unstimulated whole saliva from pSS patients with saliva flow rates within the normal range compared to healthy control subjects. The authors suggest that pSS itself is associated with a characteristic microbial shift independent of hyposalivation [18]. Furthermore, our group has recently found a comparable salivary microbiota in patients with hyposalivation and patients with normal saliva flow rates, when both groups had comparable DMF-T and no active caries lesions present. This indicates that oral health status is a stronger determinant of the oral microbiota than the whole saliva flow rate per se [21].",

The DMF-T/-S indices provide solid and valid data on dental caries and are widely used, but also reflect a historical tradition of dental treatments. Thus, the implementation of prevention-oriented school health program several decades ago, the improved oral health behaviour, the regular use of fluoride, and the minimal invasive approach towards dental restorative treatment and indications for dental extractions are also seen in the DMF-T/-S scores of patients with pSS.

Such a study would also enable assessment of the risk of developing oral disease in relation to pSS and hyposalivation. To assess the risk of developing caries, it would also be valuable to collect supragingival plaque samples from various sites in addition to whole saliva. A potential limitation of using stimulated whole saliva is that local oral bacteria are diluted when they become planktonic in saliva. Consequently, a bacterial shift of specific pathogenic bacteria might be discovered in a later stage in saliva than in a plaque sample. We have previously shown that local bacterial alterations in relation to oral hygiene discontinuation and non-surgical periodontal treatment are reflected in saliva [37,38], but the participants all had normal saliva flow rates. To the best of our knowledge, it remains to be demonstrated that the composition of the salivary microbiota reflects local bacterial alterations in patients with severe hyposalivation. Consequently, it may be questioned whether there are differences in the shedding of oral bacteria from oral sites related to the secretion of saliva from the various salivary glands. It may be speculated that bacteria are more adherent to oral surfaces in patients with pSS with markedly reduced salivary secretion as well as in patients with hyposalivation of other causes, and thus the saliva sample does not sufficiently reflect the bacterial composition and diversity in the oral cavity. Therefore, future studies of the salivary microbiota in patients with pSS should ideally also include local microbial samples.",
