Data of the lung microbiome in the setting of AUDs are lacking. The objective of this study was to determine the microbial biogeography of the upper and lower respiratory tract in individuals with AUDs compared with non-AUD subjects. Gargle, protected bronchial brush, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were collected during research bronchoscopies. Bacterial 16S gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed, and the alterations to the respiratory tract microbiota and changes in microbial biogeography were determined. The microbial structure of the upper and lower respiratory tract was significantly altered in subjects with AUDs compared with controls. Subjects with AUD have greater microbial diversity [P < 0.0001, effect size = 16 \u00b1 1.7 observed taxa] and changes in microbial species relative abundances. Furthermore, microbial communities in the upper and lower respiratory tract displayed greater similarity in subjects with AUDs. Alcohol use is associated with an altered composition of the respiratory tract microbiota. Subjects with AUDs demonstrate convergence of the microbial phylogeny and taxonomic communities between distinct biogeographical sites within the respiratory tract. These results support a mechanistic pathway potentially explaining the increased incidence of pneumonia and lung diseases in patients with AUDs.",

                    "text": "Approximately 17 million adults in the United States meet criteria for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) (33a). AUDs are associated with numerous physiological consequences, including liver damage, cancer, immune suppression, and increased risk of infection (23, 38). Bacterial pneumonia is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in patients with AUDs (23), and AUDs are an accepted risk factor for the development of bacterial pneumonia. Furthermore, patients with AUDs who develop pneumonia are frequently infected with highly virulent respiratory pathogens, and consequently experience increased morbidity and mortality compared with the general population (23). Reasons for this association remain unclear; however, host defense mechanisms are reported to be adversely affected by excessive alcohol intake. For example, excessive alcohol use suppresses acute inflammatory responses in the lung along with the ability of resident lung immune cells to kill bacteria. Additionally, alcohol consumption disturbs the bronchial mucociliary escalator, further hindering the host\u2019s ability to efficiently eliminate invading pathogens. People with AUDs also display a significantly increased risk of oropharyngeal aspiration, suggesting that chronic ethanol exposure may render an individual more susceptible to infection due to enhanced exposure to oropharyngeal microbial communities (7, 15, 23, 27, 39).",

In addition, alcohol-related ARDS is associated with poorer outcomes at 90 days, including combined outcomes of death or persistent hospitalization (12). The mechanisms by which alcohol use increases susceptibility to ARDS are still being characterized. Recently, it was found that gut-associated bacteria were enriched in the lung microbiome of both an experimental sepsis model as well as in humans with ARDS, suggesting that gut-lung translocation and dysbiosis of the lung microbial communities may contribute to the development of ARDS (14).",

Protected specimen bronchial brush samples were collected from the right mainstem bronchus. Briefly, the brushing process occurred in a standardized fashion. The sterile brush (inside sheath) was first inserted through the bronchoscope and positioned within the takeoff of the right mainstem; the sterile brush was then extruded through its sheath through the gel barrier. After extruding the sterile brush through its sheath into the right mainstem, the brush was placed at five different positions circumferentially in the airway. In each position, 10 passes of the brush were made. On completion of brushing the five positions, the brush was pulled inside its sheath, then the entire device removed from the bronchoscope. BAL was performed in a subsegment of either the right middle lobe or the lingua. BAL was always initially attempted in the right middle lobe. If a yield of at least 15 ml was not obtainable from right middle lobe lavage, BAL could be performed in the lingula. The majority of BAL specimens were derived from the right middle lobe. Two bronchoscopists performed these procedures using an identical protocol. Two assistants aided in all procedures who had been similarly trained in the procedure.",

The respiratory tract samples were shipped to Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, and genomic DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) modified to include bead-beating. Gene amplicon library sequencing (16S) was performed as previously described (8); 16S ribosomal DNA hypervariable regions V3 and V4 were amplified using gene-specific sequences, Illumina adaptors, and molecular barcodes primers. Precisely, the V3 Forward: 5\u2032-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3\u2032 with a forward adapter (5\u2032-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-3\u2032), a forward pad: (TATGGTAATT), and a forward linker (GG), and the V4 Reverse: 5\u2032-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3\u2032 with a reverse adapter (5\u2032- CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT- 3\u2032), a reverse pad (AGTCAGTCAG), and a reverse linker (CC) were used for sequencing of microbial DNA samples. Samples were then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using the 2 \u00d7 300 bp V3 sequencing kit. In addition, internal sequencing controls (negative water control and a positive mock community control) were included to test for contamination of the sequencing runs. The read files were processed through the UPARSE pipeline (drive5, Tiburon, California), merging forward and reverse reads and then truncating merged reads that covered the V3/V4 region to a uniform length of 400 bp. Reads with quality score less than 15 in the first 400 bp were discarded. Unique reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity. Chimeric OTUs were removed as identified by UCHIME (drive5). Finally, the original filtered reads were mapped to the OTUs by using USEARCH (drive5) at 97% identity. Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME 1.9.1, www.qiime.org) was used to pick and align a representative set (10). UCLUST (drive5) was used to assign a taxonomic classification to each read in the representative set (42). Relative abundance of each OTU was examined at phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species levels. Beta (between communities) and alpha (within a community) diversity metrics as well as taxonomic community assessments were produced using QQIIME 1.9.1 and the R package Phyloseq, as described previously (8, 37, 43).",

Sequencing runs were included as a potentially confounding covariate (2 runs in total). Where AUD n = 16 and control n = 23 is indicated, plotted data represents a single sequencing run, which is representative of both sequencing runs and the full cohort n = 78. For all alpha diversity (\u03b1-diversity) data, OTU tables were rarefied to 2,000 sequences/sample to account for variations in sequencing depth before analysis. \u03b1-Diversity statistics in Table 2 were calculated using a nonparametric t-test with Monte Carlo simulations. Using DESeq2, a negative binomial mixture model to account for overdispersion in sequenced-read count data was used to detect differentially abundant OTUs between control and AUD subjects (Fig. 3) (30). All unweighted UniFrac beta diversity (\u03b2-diversity) data were generated from unrarefied OTUs in which outcome variable P values were adjusted for differences in sample sequenced-read count. All weighted \u03b2-diversity data, as well as the data in Fig. 6, A, D, and G, were normalized by variance stabilizing transformation of raw read counts by using DESeq2. Unweighted UniFrac \u03b2-diversity (considers presence/absence of species) and weighted UniFrac \u03b2-diversity (considers abundance of each species) distances were plotted using nonmetric multidimensional scaling. For inferred metagenomic data, statistically significant differences in relative KEGG gene abundances were tested using the Mann-Whitney U-test with correction for multiple comparison via false discovery rate. Significant group mean differences in UniFrac distance were assessed by Mann-Whitney U-test. Significant group clustering by UniFrac distance was determined by permutational analysis of variance (ADONIS). Fisher\u2019s exact tests were used for statistical analysis on categorical variables. Spearman \u03c1 correlation coefficients were calculated to estimate oligotype abundance covariation between sampled sites as a function of AUD status. Differences in AUD and control group median \u03c1 correlation coefficient were tested using the Mann-Whitney U-test. This analysis was repeated using the more conservative Kendall \u03c4 correlation coefficient to control skew in the correlation estimates. Bootstrapped median correlation coefficient 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated on 5,000 resampling trials. Spearman \u03c1, Kendall \u03c4, and CI calculations as well as the Mann-Whitney U-test were performed using the R software package.

Interestingly, there was a convergence in the microbial communities between biogeographical sites in the AUD cohort. To quantify this we employed two methods. First, we calculated the unweighted UniFrac phylogenetic distance between each sample site (gargle to brush, gargle to BAL, and brush to BAL) within each individual subject. We then compared the mean distances between the control and AUD cohorts. This analysis demonstrated that AUDs were associated with a significantly decreased phylogenetic distance between all sampling sites (P = 0.001, control median = 0.624 \u00b1 0.042 95% CI, AUD median = 0.514 \u00b1 0.037 95% CI; Fig. 6A; P = 0.018, median of control = 0.531 \u00b1 0.034 95% CI, AUD median = 0.488 \u00b1 0.029 95% CI; Fig. 6D; and P = 0.024, control median = 0.466 \u00b1 0.041 95% CI, AUD median = 0.422 \u00b1 0.042 95% CI; Fig. 6G) compared with control subjects. In contradistinction, no significant difference was observed between the UniFrac distance of smokers and nonsmokers (data not shown). Weighted UniFrac distance between sampling sites was also significantly decreased in the AUD cohorts compared with the control subjects (data not shown). Second, to complement our data on differences in community composition, we assessed whether individual taxa that are shared between sample sites correlate in relative abundance across sample sites more so in AUD subjects or controls. We generated strain-level sequence nodes by using the minimum entropy decomposition oligotyping method (19) and calculated same-node, between-site correlation coefficients in the AUD and control cohorts. We found that median correlation coefficients were positive in both AUD and control groups, suggesting that changes in the relative abundance of a node in one site for both groups tended to reflect changes in the relative abundance of that node in other sites. In addition, AUD cohort correlation coefficients were significantly right shifted compared with control cohort coefficients, suggesting that changes in specific node relative abundances are more closely shared by the sample sites of AUD subjects over control. Figure 6, B and C, shows the median correlation coefficients in both AUD and control groups for gargle to brush samples (Spearman \u03c1: P < 2 \u00d7 10\u221213, control median = 0.394 \u00b1 0.032 95% CI and AUD median = 0.478 \u00b1 0.041 95% CI; Kendall \u03c4: P < 3 \u00d7 10\u22126, control median = 0.279 \u00b1 0.025 95% CI and AUD median = 0.333 \u00b1 0.025 95% CI). Figure 6, E and F, shows the median correlation coefficients in both AUD and control groups for brush to BAL (P < 3 \u00d7 10\u22126, control median = 0.248 \u00b1 0.029 95% CI, AUD median = 0.521 \u00b1 0.036 95% CI; Kendall \u03c4: P < 3 \u00d7 10\u221216, control median = 0.169 \u00b1 0.027 95% CI, AUD median = 0.392 \u00b1 0.025 95% CI). Figure 6, H and I, shows the median correlation coefficients in both AUD and control groups for gargle to BAL (Spearman \u03c1, P < 3 \u00d7 10\u221216, control median = 0.321 \u00b1 0.023 95% CI, AUD median = 0.441 \u00b1 0.032 95% CI; Kendall \u03c4: P < 2 \u00d7 10\u221213, control median = 0.230 \u00b1 0.018 95% CI, AUD median = 0.317 \u00b1 0.017 95% CI). We repeated this analysis comparing smokers to nonsmokers. In contrast to subjects with AUD, smokers exhibited a decreased median correlation coefficient between oligotype abundance in gargle and BAL (\u03c1: P = 0.003; \u03c4: P = 0.001) as well as BAL and brush (\u03c1: P < 3 \u00d7 10\u221216; \u03c4: P = < 3 \u00d7 10\u221216) sampled communities compared with control (data not shown). Median coefficients between gargle and brush were slightly greater in smokers over nonsmokers (\u03c1: P = 0.015; \u03c4: P = 0.002; data not shown).",

In addition, these groups have reported enrichment of certain organisms in AUDs as well as a reduction in other normal oropharyngeal microbes (33, 40). We found significant differences in the diversity of populations in the oropharynx of AUD subjects compared with controls. Several taxa, including Neisseria, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Veillonella, were more common in AUD subjects. We also found an increased relative abundance of taxa such as Actinobacillus in the AUD population. These taxa are members of the normal oral microbiota, and other studies have reported increased relative abundance of Neisseria in AUD subjects (33). Similarly, Porphyromonas, a bacteria linked to periodontal disease (11), was significantly increased in AUD oropharyngeal samples. Periodontal disease has been linked to several systemic illnesses such as cardiac disease and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that the microbial communities associated with periodontal disease may influence broader aspects of health (20, 29). Overall, these data support previous work suggesting that alcohol use is associated with a disrupted community structure in the oropharynx.",

Although similar studies have been performed to evaluate the lung microbial populations in other pulmonary conditions, including smoking, cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma (3, 11, 16, 31, 34), to our knowledge this is the first study that evaluates the lung microbiota in the context of AUD. AUDs have been implicated in infectious lung conditions, such as community-acquired pneumonia, and ARDS. Establishing alterations in lung microbial communities related to AUDs while accounting for other potential confounders, including smoking, suggests pulmonary dysbiosis as a novel mechanism underlying alcohol-lung disease associations. Importantly, we found significant differences in the microbial diversity of populations in the bronchial mucosa and the distal lung alveoli of AUD subjects compared with controls that are similar to those seen in other pulmonary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, all of which showed changes in relative abundance and microbial diversity associated with the disease state (16, 25, 34).",

                    "text": "In these investigations, AUDs were associated with a disrupted biogeography of lung microbial communities. We observed that subjects with AUDs had more similar microbial communities across the three biogeographical sampling sites. Specifically, changes in relative abundance of oligotypes in any one sample site more closely reflected changes in relative abundance of the same oligotypes in all other sites in subjects with AUDs over control. These data suggest enhanced communication between biogeographical sites of the respiratory tract that may be influenced by alcohol consumption. Reasons for this similarity in oligotypes across biogeographical sites among subjects with AUDs are unknown, but several potential explanations exist. First, patients with AUDs have significantly higher rates of aspiration (21, 28) that could contribute to deposition of oligotypes across the three compartments. Furthermore, alcohol use impairs ciliary function and may therefore impede clearance of aspirated organisms, further fostering the propensity for oropharyngeal organisms in the upper airway to migrate distally. Clinically, the propensity for aspiration coupled with impaired mucociliary clearance may manifest as decreased resistance to colonization by known pathogens in people with AUDs. Alternatively, alcohol use suppresses host immunity and the acute inflammatory response, leading to an impaired ability to clear pathogens in the distal airspaces. Clinical implications of persistent pathogens in the AUD setting might include increased pulmonary inflammation from retained bacterial products, particularly Gram-negative organisms (i.e., LPS), and immune cells which are hypo-responsive because of chronic antigen stimulation. These two factors may in turn contribute to a more permissive environment for the alcohol-associated bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophilia). To our knowledge, our work represents the first attempt to compared microbial communities across three biogeographical sites. Collectively, our findings suggest that alcohol use has a substantial impact on the microbial composition of the upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbial communities. However, additional investigation will be necessary to determine if these changes to respiratory tract microbiota related to AUDs contribute to susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia among these individuals.",

We took multiple steps to minimize contamination during sample collection, including protected specimen airway brushing. However, the possibility of contamination cannot be completely eliminated. Systematic contamination of biological specimens is a likely and common occurrence (36); however, we suspect that both AUD and control specimens are influenced equally by contaminants.

In addition, chronic alcohol use appeared to drive a relative convergence of microbial phylogeny among otherwise distinct anatomical sites within the respiratory tract. The role of these changes and the nature of the immune response to them will be important areas of future research to illuminate mechanisms of pneumonia pathogenesis and prevention in subjects with AUDs.",
