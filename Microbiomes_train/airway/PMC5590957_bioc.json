While the salivary microbiome has been studied in various world populations, Indian populations have not been examined. We therefore analyzed microbiome diversity in saliva samples from 92 volunteers from eight different sampling locations in India by amplifying and sequencing variable regions (V1 and V2) of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The results showed immense bacterial richness in Indian populations; we identified 165 bacterial genera and 785 unique Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), with substantial sharing among the populations. There were small, but significant correlations in the abundance of bacterial genera in sampling locations from the same geographic region. Most of the core OTUs detected were also observed previously in other populations, but Solobacterium spp., Lachnoanaerobaculum spp. and Alloprevotella spp. were observed to be a component of the saliva microbiome unique to Indian populations. Importantly, nine bacterial genera were observed that were not listed in the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD). These results highlight the importance of analyzing underrepresented populations like those of India.",

A recent study has revised this estimate and proposed that the number of bacterial and human cells in the human body is approximately similar [2]. The bacterial communities differ in their density across various sites in the human body as well as in taxonomic composition and stability [3]. The microbiota of a person differs more at different sites across the body as compared to the interpersonal variation of the microbiome across similar sites [3]. More than 1000 bacterial species, including both disease-causing and health-promoting bacteria have been discovered in the human body, and recent studies have suggested an association of the microbiome imbalance with the health status and predisposition to certain diseases in humans [4,5]. Thus, it is important to understand the bacterial community constituting the \u201cnormal\u201d human microbiome in healthy humans [6\u20139] and its variation across populations. Further, microbiome diversity has been shown to provide insights into the population structure and migratory patterns of humans, highlighted particularly by the studies on Helicobacter pylori, a microbe associated with the human gut; the genetic diversity of H. pylori mirrors human phylogeography and historical migrations [10,11].",

For the purpose of Unifrac analysis, the identified OTUs were aligned in mothur using the 16S rRNA Silva database as template followed by constructing a phylogenetic tree using the generalized time-reversible (GTR) model available in Fasttree [29] and processed in Figtree ver.1.3.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) for visualization, which was subsequently used in GUniFrac [30].

To calculate the diversity indices for each sampling location, 10000 reads from 10 random samples from each population were utilized. For calculating indices across three geographic regions, we took; nine random samples from Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand to represent North India; six samples each from Jharkhand, West Bengal and Assam to represent East India, and six samples each from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu to represent South India. The Venn diagram was plotted with the help of the \u2018VennDiagram\u2019 package in R [33] and geospatial analysis involving the spatial distribution of the salivary microbiome across various populations was carried out with the Adonis function in GUniFrac.

The sequences which could not be assigned to a genus in HOMD (at 90% identity) but were clearly identified in the RDP II project (\u2265 90% sequence similarity) were considered as the probable candidates which could be unique or novel in the oral cavity of the Indian populations. For comparing the salivary microbiome diversity with a previous study of Alaskans, Africans, and Germans [17], 10 samples were randomly selected from the 92 samples such that at least one sample from each of the eight sampling locations was included. From the previous study as well, 10 random samples were selected representing the Alaskans and Africans; the samples were selected in such a way so as to ensure that all the sub-populations are similarly represented. As the German population had only 10 individuals, all of them were included for rarefaction analysis. Here also, equal numbers of reads were sampled from each individual to account for differences in the sequencing depth across the samples in the previous and the current studies.

Finally, we observed enrichment of a few bacterial genera in some of the populations, including: Atopobium, Megasphaera and Prevotella in the Tamil Nadu samples; Streptobacillus and Bacillus in the Telangana samples; and Stenotrophomonas in the Uttarakhand and Assam samples. The distribution of the abundant genera at the regional level also identified interesting candidates showing statistically significant differences in abundance among the studied regions (S3 Table). In particular, Megasphaera was found to be considerably lower in frequency in the East Indian populations, whereas Stenotrophomonas was significantly lower and Neisseria and Streptobacillus significantly higher in samples from South India.",

Also, the abundance of these 54 OTUs were observed to be significantly lower (0.042%) than for those listed in HOMD (0.13%, p = 2.36 x 10\u22129) suggesting that sequencing depth plays a role in identifying the rarer sequences in the current study.

A total of 660 OTUs was found to be shared in all three geographic regions, of which 37 OTUs were found in all the individuals and hence could comprise a putative core microbiome for Indian populations. In order to further understand the structure of this putative core microbiome, the corresponding taxonomy of all 37 OTUs were determined and compared with previous studies [17,37,38]. All the 37 OTUs could be assigned to 12 bacterial genera. A summary of these results is shown in S4 Table. Among the bacterial genera, 19 out of 165 were observed in all the samples.

Employing a high throughput sequencing approach, the informative regions (V1 and V2) of the phylogenetic marker 16S rRNA gene were used to analyze the salivary microbiome diversity in these populations. The findings support the previous observation that the salivary microbiome is among the most diverse in the human body and possesses substantial richness [7]. We observed 165 unique bacterial genera and 785 different OTUs, which was higher than those found in other world populations, including Africans [17,39], where up to 127 bacterial genera were observed. However, rarefaction analyses by subsampling an equal number of reads from the Indian and other world populations [17] suggests that the bacterial richness of Indian populations is in fact similar to that in Africans, Alaskans and Germans (S8 Fig). As the rarefaction analyses were carried out with a much smaller subset of reads for the Indian population, only the more abundant genera were detected. This indicates the importance of deep sequencing to detect the rarer bacterial genera which were previously undetected [17]. For comparison with the previous study [17], only a subset of samples and reads have been utilized to minimize the bias arising from different sample size and sequencing depth while comparing the two datasets. It can be noted that since the subsets of the datasets were constructed so as to incorporate representatives from all the subpopulations, they might not be truly random. However, to accommodate the bacterial richness arising from different subpopulations in each dataset, at least one sample from each subpopulation was considered. Similarly, for calculating diversity indices, we have created subsets of our dataset both for the number of samples and number of reads to eliminate the chances of incorrect inferences drawn due to the variable number of samples in each sampling location and region and also to control for the effects of differential sequencing depth in each sample. This way, although some information might be lost due to non-utilization of all the available data, an unbiased estimate of the diversity indices has been calculated.",

We further show that these OTUs were in fact significantly less abundant than other genera, further indicating the contribution of sequencing depth in detecting the novel bacterial genera in the current study. We also observed nine novel bacterial genera previously unreported in HOMD, highlighting the importance of studying underrepresented populations for a better understanding of the human salivary microbiome. Even though the rarefaction analyses indicated lesser bacterial richness in the Indian populations as compared to Africans, and Germans, the sequence processing steps might have affected the results as more stringent parameters were utilized here. For example, reads containing ambiguous bases and homonucleotide repeats larger than eight were discarded here, but were retained in the previous study [17].",

First, the previous study encompasses an entirely different and diverse set of human populations from Alaska, Germany and Africa. Second, the same variable region (V1 and V2) of the 16S rRNA gene was examined in both these studies, thereby nullifying the effects of differential microbiome detection based on target region [40]. Interestingly, although the detection of the Enterobacteriaceae family (Kleibsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., etc.,) was previously found to be specific to the African populations, they were also detected in the Indian samples, albeit in lower abundance as compared to the Africans. This observation further emphasizes the role of sequencing depth in discovering the rarer bacteria, as their ready detection in African populations might be explained by the favorable climatic and physiological conditions, resulting in higher abundance as discussed previously [17].",

We observed annual temperature to be a major contributor towards the composition of the salivary microbiome. Despite the temperature of the saliva being relatively stable, its exposure to the external environment might affect its temperature with seasonal changes. Consequently, the higher prevalence of the Enterobacteriaceae family in African populations was speculated to be associated with the higher external temperature which promotes their growth [17]. Additionally, sudden changes in the outside temperature owing to seasonal variation might also induce corresponding changes in the salivary microbiome.",

The correlation analysis of the populations and regions clearly suggest that they are more correlated within than between populations, even though substantial sharing of the microbiome was observed across the populations. It also indicates that geographical proximity might enhance sharing of the oral microbiome. Diversity indices, unifrac studies and correlation studies among samples indicate higher sharing of the salivary microbiome within vs. between each region. A potential explanation for these results is food habits, which vary between regions. However, the contribution of food habits towards shaping the microbiome has been equivocal, with a few studies supporting the role of food habits as a key contributor to microbiome composition [20,39], while others observed a minimal role [41,42]. Although detailed information about the food habits of the participants in the current study was not recorded, substantial sharing of the bacterial genera suggests a minimal effect of any variation in the diet on the salivary microbiome.",

However, small but significant differences were observed among the sampling locations, thereby indicating the role of geography as well, which was supported by unifrac and phylogeographic analysis (Figs \u200b(Figs2,2, S5 and S7). The inclusion of urban samples with similar socio-economic levels might have further reduced the diversity observed across the locations. Overall, the general perception of substantial richness and high sharing of the salivary microbiome [7] is corroborated in the current study, as reflected by the higher alpha diversity (representing high richness) and lower beta diversity (representing less inter-individual variation, and therefore higher sharing). In the previous study involving the gut microbiome in Indian populations [20], the authors observed significant differences across the studied populations primarily because the samples were mostly from isolated tribes with a well-defined culture, life-style and food habits. In contrast, the volunteers studied here have similar socio-economic backgrounds and possible overlap in food habit, which might have reduced the overall microbiome variation. Further, as the saliva microbiome is more exposed to the natural environment than the gut microbiota, the governing factors defining the overall composition of the salivary and the gut microbiome might be different.",

For example, although the volunteers were all healthy at the time of saliva collection, it is possible that undetected differences in oral health might be influencing bacterial diversity. However, a recent study found a negligible impact of dental caries on the salivary microbiome [43]. Focusing on only a portion of the 16S rRNA gene (in order to utilize the NGS capacity) instead of analyzing the entire gene could also limit our ability to assign the sequences to different species, as reported previously [20]. Though studies have shown that V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene provides greater robustness for microbiome studies, the V1 and V2 regions were observed to provide more phylotypes [23] and therefore, were targeted here. Recently, improved library preparation protocols were suggested for 16S rRNA amplicon studies [44], however, at the time of designing this study, such protocols were not available. As all samples were analyzed with the same library preparation protocol, this is not expected to influence the differences observed between populations. Also, the relatively low sample size per population (N = 10 to 14) might have reduced the discriminatory power of our study.",

A total of 640 out of 785 OTUs were shared across all the regions, thereby exhibiting high sharing of OTUs among populations, an observation similar to that based on bacterial genera. The 37 core OTUs observed in all samples in the current study, many of which were also previously described for other populations (S4 Table), supports the existence of a common set of bacterial genera across various worldwide human populations, including India. Additionally, Solobacterium spp. and Alloprevotella spp. were found in all the samples in our study but were not a part of the core microbiome in previous studies. Although Solobacterium spp. and particularly Solobacterium moorei has been associated with halitosis [49], a recent study has observed the occurrence of Solobacterium in healthy samples [50], suggesting the occurrence of Solobacterium spp. as part of the \u201cnormal\u201d salivary microbiome. In addition, Lachnoanaerobaculum spp., which was recently isolated from human saliva [51], was observed as a part of the core human microbiome in our study and might be playing a role in glucose metabolism, as reported previously [51]. Several bacterial species from the genus Streptobacillus, that are known to be associated with disease phenotypes, were also found to be differentially distributed among the populations and regions examined in the present study. However, as the resolution in this study could only be obtained up to the genus level, their association with the oral health status of the participating volunteers could not be established. The degree to which this differential distribution might contribute to different patterns of disease across Indian populations could be an important focus of further studies. Additionally, collecting detailed information regarding the socio-economic status of the volunteers, food habits and the frequency of food uptake along with detailed oral hygiene practices would be helpful to better understand how the saliva microbiome might both influence and be influenced by an individual\u2019s lifestyle. Given the extraordinary genetic diversity of Indian populations, the Indian subcontinent is a natural laboratory for further such investigations.",

It also highlights the importance of studying underrepresented populations, as new bacterial genera can be discovered which were not observed in other populations. Supporting the general perception of high sharing of the salivary microbiome among healthy volunteers, we also find small but significant association towards the geographical locations. The study further emphasizes the importance of deep sequencing in discovering rarer bacterial genera. Although most of the core OTUs detected in this study were also observed previously in other populations, Solobacterium spp., Alloprevotella spp. and Lachnoanaerobaculum spp. could be a component of the core saliva microbiome in only the Indian populations. Overall, this study aids in understanding the composition and distribution of the normal saliva microbiome in human populations, which ultimately might aid in determining the role of the saliva microbime in various disease phenotypes.",
