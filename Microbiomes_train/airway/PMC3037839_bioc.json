                    "text": "With the widespread application of vaccines and antibiotics against respiratory pathogens, serotype and species replacement is becoming increasingly important. The occurrence of species replacement depends on the ecological events that occur during the replenishment of the niche left vacant following vaccination or antibiotic treatment. Hence, extensive microbial ecology studies will be necessary to fully understand these events and identify microbes that play a significant role in replenishment. Furthermore, the competitive relations between bacterial types inhabiting the nasopharynx which may alter predisposition to disease will be elucidated by broad comparative community analyses. This reinforces the need to broaden the scope of upper airway microbiology studies [7-10]. However, only a small fraction of bacterial composition can be cultivated by standard laboratory techniques [11,12]. Hence, culture-dependent applications grossly underestimate species richness, relative abundance and composition, limiting their utility in the comprehensive analysis of microbial communities [13]. To address various aspects of diverse microbial communities, microbiologists have employed an extensive array of culture-independent molecular tools which are often based on PCR and target the rRNA gene cluster [14,15]. Although molecular tools avert considerable bias introduced by selective cultivation and have revolutionized our understanding of microbial ecology, they also have several limitations. Common to all PCR-based applications are several pitfalls which can occur at every stage of sample processing [13]. Bias can be introduced during sample collection and transport, sample storage, cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction, PCR amplification, and other downstream applications [13,16-20]. One of the advantages of molecular applications is that samples can be stored and analysed even after the loss of viability of microbial cells. For logistic and technical reasons, frozen storage often precedes the molecular analysis of biological samples. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the deep freezing process can have adverse effects on microbial composition and the detection of specific bacterial strains [4,21,22].",

A fixed detection threshold of 100 fluorescence units (FU) was used to reduce inclusion of noise peaks in the analysis [23,25]. Terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) that differed by \u00b1 1 bp in different profiles were binned in the same OTU. T-RFs between 50 bp and 600 bp were considered in the analysis to obtain 5' terminal fragments within the linear range of GS-600Liz (Applied Biosystems). Composition was calculated as the total number of distinct OTUs detected in a sample. The relative abundance of each OTU was determined by expressing the fluorescence units as a proportion of the sum of relative fluorescence signal for each sample [26]. A random effects model allowing for the within subject correlation was used to investigate the effect of freezing on composition and total RFUs per subject adjusting for age and sex. A random effects logistic regression model was used to study the association of detection of each OTU with the type of sample (frozen versus fresh) adjusting for age and sex where appropriate. Only OTUs detected in both primary and frozen samples were included and correction for multiple testing was done using Holm's method.",

Although the relative proportions of some OTUs changed, overall, the relative distributions were comparable before and after frozen storage (Figure \u200b(Figure3).3). Previous studies which investigated the effects of frozen storage on the detection of various microbes in biological samples have shown minimal or no significant effects [1,21,27-29]. Abdullahi et al. (2007) reported that the recovery of S. pneumoniae from fresh and frozen NP swabs in STGG was consistent, but there were differences in the serotype distributions [21]. This could be attributed to a differential capacity to survive the freezing process among S. pneumoniae serotypes. In another culture-based study, there was no effect of freezing on the recovery of S. pneumoniae and S. aureus from milk samples frozen at -20\u00b0C [27,28], but there was an increase in the detection of coagulase negative staphylococci and a decrease in the recovery of Escherichia coli and Actinomyces pyogenes [28]. Likewise, a recent 16S rRNA gene-based study of Black Band Disease showed that frozen storage increased the proportion of Proteobacteria phylotypes while direct analysis promoted the detection of cyanobacterial and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria [22].",

As such, the deep freezing and thawing processes may alter the odds of detection and relative abundance of some, but not all OTUs in a biological sample. In this study, frozen storage significantly altered the odds of detecting a small proportion (<10%) of the bacterial OTUs found (Table \u200b(Table1)1) and the relative abundance of a couple of OTUs changed by more than 5% after frozen storage (Figure \u200b(Figure2).2). This could be explained by DNA degradation amongst some bacterial taxa; Suomalainen and colleagues demonstrated that the freezing process results in the disintegration of the Flavobacterium columnare cell wall, associated with the release of large quantities of DNAse, lysases and proteases[4]. There is further evidence that the structure and stability of bacterial cells influence cryo-preservation of nucleic acids [30].",

This preliminary data suggests that an effect of freezing on microbial detection may also be differential across sexes. Interestingly, several OTUs detected in both sexes in fresh NP swabs were not detected or were detected at much lower frequencies among female infants post frozen storage. Although sex has been shown to be an important factor in colonization by various bacterial pathogens [31,32], this finding has not been reported elsewhere to our knowledge. It is unclear how an effect of deep freezing on bacterial detection could be differential depending on the sex of a subject, which necessitates further investigations.",

With the widespread use of vaccines targeting commensals of the respiratory mucosae, it is essential to effectively monitor non-vaccine serotypes and species replacement disease [33,34]. Tracking intra-species serotype replacement and/or switching has overshadowed comprehensive research into the long term effects of vaccination on the microbiome, which may influence health, predisposition to disease and the pathogenesis of various infections [35,36]. Loss or increased detection of particular taxa due to deep frozen storage may have a bearing on microbial ecology and species replacement surveillance. Furthermore, the intricate competitive relations between bacterial phylotypes may not be fully understood if deep freezing alters the fingerprint of microbial communities, albeit modestly [7-10].",
