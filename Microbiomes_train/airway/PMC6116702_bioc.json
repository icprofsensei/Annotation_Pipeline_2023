The impact of the device/disc position and toothbrushing during the formation of SF-biofilm was also assessed. Two tests were run. In test 1, 15 volunteers wore two hemi-splints carrying six discs of human enamel, glass, and hydroxyapatite for 2 days, and were instructed to not perform any oral hygiene measure. Biofilm samples were collected from the substrates and the contralateral tooth and were analysed using CLSM. In five volunteers, half of the biofilm present on the discs and their contralateral teeth were scraped and analysed using 16S\u00a0 pyrosequencing. In test 2, the microscopic analysis was repeated only on the SF-biofilm samples, and the volunteers were allowed to brush their teeth. Multivariate analyses revealed that the donors had a significant effect on the composition of the biofilm, confirming its subject-dependent character. The bacterial composition of the SF-biofilm was similar to the TF-biofilm, with significant differential abundance detected in very few taxa of low abundance. The toothbrushing during the formation of SF-biofilm was the only factor that conditioned the thickness or bacterial viability.",

None of these artificial substrates have demonstrated clear advantages over other substrate types. The position of the disc inside the intraoral device can also condition the characteristics of the SF-biofilm.

The following two hypotheses were tested: (1) the in situ, 2-day SF-biofilm formed on different materials has microbial characteristics that are similar to those formed on natural tooth surfaces and (2) different methodological factors, such as the device/substrate position and the toothbrushing protocol, significantly condition the microbial characteristics of an in situ, 2-day SF-biofilm formed on different materials.",

PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed with the high-fidelity ABGene DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Empson, Surrey, UK). The universal bacterial primers were used for the V1-V2-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA genes, 8F-27F (5\u02b9-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3\u02b9) and 514R-533R (5\u02b9-TTACCGCGGCKGCTGGCACG-3\u02b9). An annealing temperature of 52\u00b0C and 20 amplification cycles were applied to minimise the PCR amplification bias. The primers used for the sequencing have been described previously [21]. Two PCRs were performed per sample to amplify the 16S rRNA genes and introduce adaptor sequences and sample-specific barcode oligonucleotide tags into the DNA. In five samples, a PCR product could not be obtained and a nested-PCR was performed. Following Ben\u00edtez-P\u00e1ez et al. [22], the PCR product in these samples was purified and used as a template for a secondary PCR in which the primers were shifted three bp towards the 3\u02b9 end, and included the pyrosequencing adaptors A and B and the eight bp \u2018barcode\u2019 specific to each sample. The 500 bp PCR products were purified using the Nucleofast PCR purification kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) and further cleaned with AMPure XP beads (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) before pyrosequencing. The PCR products were pyrosequenced from the forward primer end only using a GS-FLX sequencer (Roche) with Titanium chemistry at the Centre for Advanced Research in Oral Health, CSISP-FISABIO, Valencia, Spain. One-eighth of a plate was used for each pool of 30 samples, which were amplified with a different forward primer containing a unique eight-bp \u2018barcode\u2019 [23].",

A 40-bp sliding window was used, and the sequence was trimmed when the average quality score dropped below 30. The sequence was also trimmed if any sequence had an ambiguous base call, a homopolymer longer than 8 bp, one or more mismatches to the barcode, or more than four mismatches to the primer. Only reads longer than 200 bp were considered. Unique sequences were then aligned to the appropriate SILVA-based reference alignment [26]. Chimeras were identified using a Mothur-based implementation of the chimera.slayer program. A total of 6.8% of reads were filtered out as potential chimeras. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence similarity and were assigned a taxonomic identity using the mothur-based implementation of the human oral microbiome database (HOMD) [27]. Each read was taxonomically assigned down to the species level using a 90% minimum confidence threshold.

The results were expressed in \u2018Log2foldchange\u2019, which is the mean of the difference of the abundance of counts in a logarithmic base. Hence, for example, a Log2foldchange\u00a0=\u00a00 is 2\u00b0\u00a0=\u00a01, which means the equal abundance of a given OTU between two classes; a Log2foldchange\u00a0=\u00a01 is 21\u00a0=\u00a02, which means a double abundance of the first class compared to the second class; and a Log2foldchange\u00a0=\u00a02 is 22\u00a0=\u00a04, which means there is four times more abundance.

In the SF-biofim on the enamel discs, five genera and two species showed significant differences to the TF-biofilm in the differential abundance analysis. All these genera and species were detected in low abundances (<1.5%) and included: Abiotrophia defectiva, Alloprevotella spp., Bergeyella spp., Capnocytophaga spp., Leptotrichia spp., and P. naceiensis. The abundance of these taxa represented 2.98% of the genera and 0.50% of the OTUs in the TF-biofilm. Except for Alloprevotella spp. and P. naceiensis (Log2foldchange\u00a0=\u00a03.45 and 4.16, respectively), all the genera and A. defectiva were significantly more abundant in the TF-biofilm samples (Log2foldchange ranging from \u22123.66 to \u22122.60).",

A possible reason for these notable differences could be the fact that the TF-biofilm was obtained by physical removal with a sterile curette. This procedure can disrupt the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, with the effect being that the TF-biofilm is less viable than that formed on an artificial substrate that is not further manipulated. Moreover, the TF-biofilm collected with a curette has a stacked and unstructured shape, making it impossible to measure the thickness or the viability in different layers. Consequently, the SF-biofilm in the IDODS has the advantage that it can be withdrawn from the oral cavity without difficulty and subsequently observed and analysed without collapsing its original structure.",

Unlike the results observed in the in-vitro biofilm, in-situ experiments showed no difference in the amount of biofilm formed on the different surfaces after a 24-h incubation in the mouth of healthy volunteers. Consequently, these authors concluded that quantitative differences observed in-vitro models among surfaces with distinct roughness may not be predictive of different colonisation rates in situ [43].",

However, these authors analysed 24-h biofilms and evaluated different substrates to those used in the present series (titanium discs vs supra/subgingival tooth surfaces from the same four subjects). Likewise, we have only identified one in-vitro investigation, the aim of which was to evaluate the effect of two artificial substrates (glass vs hydroxyapatite) on saliva-derived biofilms using 16S rRNA gene sequencing [44].

The most abundant genera found in the biofilm samples were Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Neisseria, Gemella, Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Aggregatibacter, and Leptotrichia. Streptococcus and Fusobacterium were the most abundant genera on the artificial substrates, whereas on the tooth surfaces the most abundant were Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, and Neisseria. Coinciding with the results of Wake et al. on hydroxyapatite discs [14], we have shown that, 48\u00a0h after the initiation of biofilm formation, Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria such as Fusobacterium are predominant, together with Streptococcus, which are more dominant in early phases. In the differential abundance analysis, there were differences in very few genera and species, all of them of low abundance, between the SF-biofilm, especially on the enamel discs, and the TF-biofilm. In none of the case, these specific differences in some taxa did not condition the overall compositional structure of supragingival biofilm. This finding implies that, with the in-situ use of these substrates on IDODS, we can reliably reproduce the supragingival biofilm and extrapolate our observations on the efficacy of antimicrobial agents obtained from the SF-biofilm to the TF-biofilm. These results concur with those previously published by other authors, but on titanium surfaces, and confirm that the influence of surface characteristics on bacterial adhesion is compensated by the development of the oral biofilm [9,46].",

Therefore, IDODS can be used in both the upper or lower arches and represent dental plaque well. The best position for IDODS will depend on a study\u2019s objective. Artificial substrates in the oral cavity are preferentially positioned buccally as bacterial accumulation is very limited on the lingual side [49]. Based on this premise, other authors [11] have concluded that buccally positioned substrates did not differ much regarding SF-biofilm thickness when taking into account the fact that they were located in the upper or lower jaw. This observation is corroborated by the results of the present research, both in the inter-arch and intra-arch positions.",

So far, this variable has not been evaluated, with studies found in which the volunteers did not brush their teeth at all [50,51], while there are others in which they did [7\u20139,52,53]. Our results revealed that the thickness of the SF-biofilm formed after 48\u00a0h and its bacterial viability were significantly affected by the toothbrushing protocol, as these microscopic parameters were higher in test 1 (without toothbrushing), especially in the medial-mesial positions. Consequently, toothbrushing is an essential factor in the development of SF-biofilms, partly because volunteers can eliminate any leftovers that may be a potential source of nutrients for the oral biofilm or because early colonisers are favoured by the constant removal of plaque.",

Based on our findings, the biofilm\u2019s global structure has a subject-dependent character but is not conditioned by the substrate material or the device position. The bacterial composition of the biofilm on the artificial substrates was similar to that on the tooth surfaces, with significant differential abundance only detected in very few genera and species of low abundance. Unlike the substrate material and the device/substrate position, the toothbrushing practice does influence the bacterial characteristics (thickness and bacterial viability) of substrate-formed biofilms and is, therefore, a clinical aspect to consider in supragingival biofilm studies. Accordingly, in-situ SF-biofilms after two days of maturation appear to be highly representative of naturally occurring supragingival biofilms providing promising opportunities for oral microbiology research.",
