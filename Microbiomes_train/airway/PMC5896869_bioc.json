We tested the hypothesis that the composition of the salivary microbiota will reflect local microbial changes associated with accumulated biofilm formation and maturation. Pooled supragingival plaque (n = 145) and stimulated saliva (n = 145) samples were collected and plaque and gingival indices were recorded from 29 orally healthy individuals at baseline, during oral hygiene discontinuation (days 4, 7, and 10), and 14 d after resumption of oral hygiene. Supragingival and salivary microbiotas were processed by next-generation sequencing (Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing) and microbial community profiles were compared. Microbial composition of supragingival plaque samples collected after 4, 7, and 10 d of oral hygiene discontinuation, as well as 14 d after reuptake of oral hygiene, differed significantly from baseline samples, by a 3-fold increase in relative abundance Leptotrichia species and a 2-fold decrease in Streptococcus species (adjusted P < 0.01). In saliva samples, a significant increase in relative abundance of Leptotrichia species (adjusted P < 0.01) was evident at day 7 but completely reversed 14 d after resumption of oral hygiene. While the salivary microbiota was resistant to accumulated local biofilm formation, data from this study showed that compositional changes of supragingival microbiotas were not reversed 14 d after resumption of oral hygiene, despite the restoration of plaque to baseline levels.

As saliva does not harbor an endogenous microbiota, the salivary microbiota is believed to be a compilation of bacteria shed from oral surfaces (Kilian et al. 2016; Krishnan et al. 2017). In oral health, the core salivary microbiota is closely related to microbiotas found on the tongue and the throat, and it differs from supragingival plaque, especially in terms of higher relative abundance of Firmicutes (Segata et al. 2012). Moreover, salivary carriage of specific oral bacterial species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans, might be associated with periodontitis (Liljestrand et al. 2014; Belstr\u00f8m, Paster, et al. 2016) and dental caries, respectively (ElSalhy et al. 2016; Row et al. 2016).",

The hypothesis was that undisturbed growth of supragingival biofilms would cause transient compositional changes of the salivary microbiota but return to baseline after resumption of oral hygiene.",

Traditionally, when using this protocol, oral hygiene is omitted for 21 d and sampling is usually performed at day 7, day 14, and day 21 (Morelli et al. 2014; Schincaglia et al. 2017). The protocol used in this study was slightly modified from the traditional experimental gingivitis model in 2 ways. First of all, the duration of oral hygiene discontinuation was 10 d, with more intense sampling on approximately every third day. Second, another sampling was repeated 14 d after reuptake of oral hygiene. These modifications were made to comply with the primary purpose of the investigation: to characterize the impact and reversibility of perturbation-induced alterations on supragingival and salivary microbial community profiles associated with oral hygiene discontinuation. The clinical data on day 10 demonstrated that all participants had rampant plaque formation and developed moderate to severe gingivitis during the study period (Table). However, we cannot exclude that more pronounced and generalized gingivitis associated with continued discontinuation of oral hygiene would have an impact on the composition of supragingival and salivary microbial communities.",

Clinical data clearly demonstrated a significantly progressive plaque accumulation during the study (Table), but the relative abundance of predominant bacterial genera remained stable from day 4 until day 10 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, no statistical differences were noted between samples from day 4, day 7, and day 10 of oral hygiene discontinuation. These data suggest that discontinuation of oral hygiene quickly facilitated an ecological alteration of the local microbial environment, which favored propagation of Leptotrichia species, which remained the dominant genus until day 10. Leptotrichia species are gram-negative, anaerobic rod-shaped bacteria, which phylogenetically belong to the family of Fusobacteriaceae, which, by use of culturing methods, has been reported as a minor component of dental plaque (Thompson and Pikis 2012). However, the advent of modern molecular methods has revealed potent sugar metabolism in oral species of Leptotrichia (Thompson and Pikis 2012). As participants were instructed not to change their diet during the period of oral hygiene discontinuation, it is likely that undisturbed biofilm formation in combination with regular sugar intake created local ecological conditions in favor of Leptotrichia species.",

This finding could not be explained by clinical findings of the P-index and GI-index (Table). Therefore, even though the amount of biofilm was reversed by reuptake of regular oral hygiene, compositional changes of the supragingival biofilm were still evident (Figs. 1, \u200b,2).2). Alterations in expression of antimicrobial peptides and gingival tissues and in saliva have been reported in gingivitis (Gursoy et al. 2013; Dommisch et al. 2015). It is therefore possible that this finding highlights equilibrium between the supragingival biofilm and the immune system, which were not reversed after reuptake of oral hygiene. On the other hand, it is also possible that another round of sampling (e.g., 1 mo after reuptake of oral hygiene procedures) would have revealed a complete return of compositional changes to the supragingival microbiota. Thus, further studies are needed to reveal the impact of this finding.",

A 4-fold increase in mean relative abundance of Leptotrichia species was recorded at day 7, while relative abundance of all other predominant genera remained unchanged compared to baseline (Fig. 3). The level of relative abundance of Leptotrichia recorded in saliva in this study from individuals during a period of oral hygiene discontinuation is, however, significantly higher than what we have noted in previous studies on the salivary microbiota using the same molecular method (Belstr\u00f8m et al. 2016a, 2016b; Belstr\u00f8m, Holmstrup, et al. 2016; Belstr\u00f8m, Paster, et al. 2016). Thus, with this overabundance, the Leptotrichia species were likely shed from abundant supragingival biofilm formation, affecting the salivary abundance at day 7 of oral hygiene discontinuation (Fig. 3). It is surprising, however, that the salivary abundance of Leptotrichia species was almost reversed at day 10. One possible explanation of this finding could be a structural alteration of supragingival biofilms from day 7 to day 10, resulting in the positioning of Leptotrichia species in the deeper layers of the maturing biofilm, including less intensive interaction with saliva. This assumption is supported by the clinical data, which showed a major increase in amounts of visible plaque from day 7 to day 10 (Table). However, as we did not perform ultra-structural analysis of supragingival biofilms, this remains speculative. Nevertheless, when comparing saliva sampled at baseline and 14 d after resumption of regular oral hygiene, comparable microbial profiles were identified (Figs. 3, \u200b,4).4). Thus, the composition of the salivary microbiota is apparently resistant to reversible perturbations. Obviously, this is advantageous when considering the use of salivary microbial profiles as biomarkers of periodontitis or dental caries.",

However, this limits the external validity of the data presented, as differences in hormone levels between sexes could potentially have an impact on supragingival and salivary microbiotas. On the other hand, based on cross-sectional analysis of a large Danish cohort, we were not able to find any sex- or age-associated salivary microbial characteristics (Belstr\u00f8m et al. 2014). Another limitation was that subgingival plaque samples were not collected, and therefore it was not possible to address the influence of oral hygiene discontinuation on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Thus, further studies characterizing both supragingival and subgingival plaque microbiotas in experimental gingivitis are warranted.",
