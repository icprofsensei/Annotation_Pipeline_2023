Interestingly, adults with upper respiratory tract infections and allergic rhinitis have increased sinus inflammation by computed tomography than do patients with upper respiratory tract infections who are not allergic.6 Similar studies in children have found a higher prevalence of ARS in children with allergic rhinitis compared with those who are not allergic.7 However, the specific underlying cause of increased risk of either ARS or ABRS in patients with allergic rhinitis remains unclear.",

Disruption of the normal sinus microbial ecosystem by environmental perturbation may therefore result in the emergence of increased numbers of pathogenic flora, leading to disease.

Subjects then underwent nasal lavage for quantification of eosinophils.18 A baseline disease-specific Rhinitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) was completed before swab or lavage collection each time.19 Subjects went home with diary cards on which to record nasal symptoms twice daily when the allergy season began, as in prior work.18 We used the diaries to rank four symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, and other symptoms) on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms). Once respective pollen counts were determined to be elevated for at least 3 consecutive days by the study staff, subjects were contacted to begin their symptom diaries as well as to schedule their second visit in 2 weeks. Median daily total nasal symptom scores were calculated across the 2-week period and were analyzed. When the subjects returned to the laboratory, swabs for microbial evaluation were obtained again, followed by a second nasal lavage. Subjects completed an in-season RQLQ at this second visit.

Both measures are standard measures in microbiome studies (see the study by Hamady and Knight13) These three measures were chosen because of the complexity of the data analysis. Both the fragment length and the abundance of the terminal fragment were measured using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and data were processed as described.21 For standardization, each peak was expressed as the fraction of the sum of all peaks for each sample. Peak sizes were then calibrated to be comparable across samples. The number and height of the peaks correspond to the number and abundance of bacterial phylotypes represented in the samples. Transformation was performed by expressing the value of each metric as the square root of itself, standard for such analyses. Initial analyses showed no significant differences between the left and right sides; therefore, these data were combined, and the averages were analyzed.",

In this analysis, Simpson's index was inverted such that increased Simpson's index corresponded to a decreased diversity level. Finally, we performed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to determine which specific operational taxonomic unit (OTU) patterns (here, referring to T-RFLP fragment pattern) were characteristic of each group. LDA is a statistical tool for finding linear combinations of variables that best separate classes of observations. We used LDA to identify OTU patterns that differentiate between the four allergy groups (nonallergic/allergic subjects before/during allergy season) for each of the two sites (vestibule and middle meatus). To adjust for demographic variables, we first fitted linear models for proportional intensities of the OTUs against age, sex, and race. We then performed LDA on the residuals of the linear regressions, instead of the original OTU intensities.",

Most importantly, subjects with SAR show increased bacterial diversity (in bacterial number and ecological diversity indices) during the allergy season at the anatomic site (the middle meatus) relevant for ARS, but not consistently at a site not thought to be involved in this disease (the vestibule). This is consistent with recent findings showing increased diversity in sputum from asthmatic subjects compared with nonallergic subjects23 but in contrast to other diseases, mainly those of chronic rather than acute inflammation (see later in text). Additionally, eosinophil counts were correlated with altered sinonasal microbiota in subjects with SAR, but not in nonallergic subjects, suggesting that allergic inflammation, an extrinsic factor caused by seasonal exposure, increases microbial diversity at the opening to the sinuses in sensitized subjects but not in subjects without allergic inflammation. This could potentially explain the increased number of sinus infections in allergic subjects.",

Absence of microbes also causes derangements of the mucosal immune response in animal models, again highlighting the interrelationship of allergic inflammation and bacteria.29 Further study of these findings in a larger sample is warranted to confirm our findings and to test these hypotheses to determine the mechanism.",

However, our data do support the concept of allergy changing the sinonasal microflora perhaps via expansion of the sinonasal microbiome by creating conditions to allow a greater diversity of bacteria to exist. Such a disruption then might set the conditions for a \u201csecond hit\u201d to cause acute infection, with subsequent predominance of a pathogenic organism. We speculate that this could be caused by reductions in protective flora, changes in virulence of colonized organisms, alterations in physical conditions (e.g., hypoxia related to ostial obstruction), or local changes in immune defense. Our study design did not allow us to address these possibilities. We note that none of our subjects developed acute sinusitis and there was no frank pus present on follow-up endoscopy during swab collection at visit 2, consistent with the fact that, despite increased risk of this condition in allergic subjects, only a small fraction of patients develop a sinus infection, similar to other risk factors (e.g., viral infections31). We also acknowledge that not all in the field consider allergy a risk factor for the development of a sinus infection. Additional studies of bacterial diversity before and during episodes of acute sinusitis in allergic subjects and assessment of subsequent risk of infection can address this issue.",

We do not feel that allergic exposures in the preseason could have affected our results: subjects reported major symptoms consistent with the relevant season (tree or grass in Chicago), and only four were sensitized to both allergens (one studied in grass season; three studied in tree season).
