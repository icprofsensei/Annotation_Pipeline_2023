Oral daily tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) is highly effective for the prevention of HIV-1 infection. This has been demonstrated in multiple placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials in men who have sex with men (MSM) [3], serodiscordant or other high-risk heterosexual men and women [4\u20137], and people who inject drugs [8]. Post hoc analyses of these and other studies have shown that efficacy is highly dependent upon adherence [9, 10], with minimum of 4 doses per week needed for protection among MSM [9]. Given its efficacy and general tolerability, uptake of oral PrEP has increased significantly since it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012. Currently, there are an estimated 270 000 PrEP users in the United States [11].",

Side effects, which are most commonly observed during the initial month of treatment and abate with continued use, include gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; this is most common during the initial month of treatment and generally abates with continued use.

Although this likely allows for its efficacy in preventing mucosal HIV transmission, it also raises the question of how the presence of TDF/FTC may interact with commensal intestinal bacteria at that site. The trillions of bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract, commonly termed the microbiome, have an increasingly appreciated role in health and disease [16, 17], including in HIV acquisition and progression [18\u201323]. Dysbiosis, or changes in microbiome composition, has been associated with HIV infection and may not fully resolve with antiretroviral therapy (ART) [20, 24, 25], suggesting that ART itself could affect dysbiosis. At least 2 studies have also shown microbiome differences by ART regimen among treated HIV-infected individuals [25, 26]. Dub\u00e9 et al [27] recently found microbiome changes in a small longitudinal study of MSM initiating PrEP over 48 weeks, although this analysis was unable to account for sexual behavior.",

Negative controls from the DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) steps, as well as independent aliquots of a bacterial mock community, were processed in parallel to identify contaminant sequences and ensure data reproducibility. The PCR products were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using 2 \u00d7 150 base pair v2 chemistry. Sequences were demultiplexed with Golay error correction using QIIME v1.9.1 [32]. Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA2) version 1.8 was used for error correction, exact sequence inference, read merging, and chimera removal [33]. The resultant amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table comprised 3 576 558 total merged read pairs (mean per sample = 48 332; range, 10 906 to 96 109) after removal of contaminant ASVs, defined as those with at least 10% of their total abundance derived from negative control samples. Rarefaction was performed at a depth of 10 906 reads for the corresponding analyses (zero-inflated negative binomial, alpha diversity). For all other analyses, counts were transformed to relative abundances. Taxonomic assignment was done using RDP trainset 16 [34].

A recent study similarly identified significant associations between PrEP and Streptococcus abundance in the rectal microbiome of MSM [27], although it observed decreased Streptococcus after initiation of PrEP in 4 of 8 participants. Differences in our results and this study could be explained by study design (cross-sectional vs longitudinal), microbiome analysis method, and potential differences in confounders between study populations. Nonetheless, the similar identification of Streptococcus abundance with PrEP use in both studies suggests this may be an interaction worthy of further study.",

Fusobacterium has similarly been associated with other intestinal inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease and proinflammatory gene expression in colorectal cancer [39, 40]. The mucosal immune consequence of these changes in the rectal microbiome in HIV-negative individuals on PrEP is not known. However, given the clinical associations between inflammation and HIV acquisition risk despite the use of TFV products [41], this may be an area of important further investigation.",

Multiple studies have recently highlighted the effects that multiple drug classes can have on gut microbiome variation, including commonly used medications such as metformin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [42\u201346]. One plausible explanation is off-target antibacterial activity of TDF/FTC. A recent high-throughput screen of drugs for anticommensal activity with 40 representative bacterial strains found that 24% of human-targeted drugs have antibacterial activity including 40% of antiviral drugs [42]. Another recent in vitro study specifically examined unintended antibacterial effects of commonly used antiretroviral drugs. This study did not show activity with TFV or FTC; however, drugs were only tested against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis [47]. In the vaginal compartment, microbiota have been associated with decreased concentrations of oral antiretroviral drugs [48], and direct interactions between commensal bacteria and topical TFV have been demonstrated [49, 50]. Even in the absence of direct antibiotic effects, these drugs may alter local cellular or bacterial metabolic activity or gene expression such that certain bacterial communities are favored.",

In the case of metformin, changes in the microbiome appear necessary for drug activity in a study using germ-free mice [46]. Klatt et al [49] showed that specific vaginal bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis metabolize TFV leading to decreased efficacy of TFV gel microbicide for HIV prevention in women. Taneva et al [50] similarly found that Lactobacillus crispatus and G vaginalis decreased TFV bioavailability and anti-HIV activity, respectively, in women using TFV gel. Because our study was cross-sectional and modest in size, we could not examine the relationship between the microbiome and PrEP effectiveness. However, defining the role of the microbiome in PrEP efficacy may be an important consideration in future clinical trials of PrEP therapeutics. Microbiome interactions may also contribute to drug side effects and even toxicities. Oral TDF/FTC for PrEP is associated with varying gastrointestinal symptoms during the first month of use, often termed PrEP \u201cstart-up syndrome\u201d. It is possible that these symptoms occur due to PrEP-associated microbiome alterations and abate as the gastrointestinal tract acclimates to these changes.",

The overall study size is modest (n = 74); however, this study is the largest study to date to examine microbiome changes in HIV-negative MSM on oral PrEP. More important, we used 1:1 matching on a multitude of important clinical and behavioral confounders, including sexual behavior, which greatly strengthens the study results. However, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of residual confounding from additional unidentified factors. Furthermore, we did not have dietary data available, and we were unable to account for this potentially important confounder. Finally, the cross-sectional design limits our ability to precisely attribute the observed microbiome differences solely to PrEP use. Our ability to detect dose-response relationships between increasing TFV or FTC drug levels and the abundance of specific bacterial taxa does provide further evidence to support the relationship between PrEP use and these microbiome changes.",

It is the largest such study to specifically examine the effects of oral TDF/FTC for PrEP on the gut microbiome. We identified several specific bacterial taxa associated with PrEP, including Streptococcus, which was similarly identified in a prior study [27], and also showed a dose-dependent association between TFV exposure and Fusobacterium abundance. With increasing efforts focused on expanding PrEP use for HIV prevention, it will be important to consider these potential interactions with the microbiome and continue research to better understand their clinical consequences.",
