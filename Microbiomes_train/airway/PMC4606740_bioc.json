During the outbreak, we collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients in the Lower Hudson Valley of New York. Here, we conduct a retrospective study on the genomic diversity of EV-D68 strains. We first employ a metagenomic shotgun sequencing protocol on a total of 93 clinical samples, including 21 negative controls, the results of which allow assembly of 20 EV-D68 genomes, six complete and 14 near-complete. We then investigate their genetic relationships, along with additional 20 EV-D68 strains having whole-genome sequences publicly available. Our comparative genomic analysis uncovers that the majority (26/29) of EV-D68 strains circulating in the 2014 outbreak differ significantly from prior ones, have a main feature of three variables, C1817T, C3277A, and A4020G, and belong to a new clade. C3277A causes amino acid substitution T860N in the protease 2Apro cleavage site between VP1 and 2A, whereas A4020G causes S1108G in a 3Cpro cleavage site between 2B and 2C. The two functional mutations may alter the proteases\u2019 cleavage efficiency, leading to increased rate of viral replication and transmission. These provide insights into the evolution of epidemic EV-D68 strains.",

The genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae includes seven species that commonly cause human disease: enterovirus A, B, C, and D and rhinovirus A, B, and C. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is one of four serotypes assigned to enterovirus D. EV-D68 was first identified in California in 1962 from four children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis1. However, reports of respiratory disease due to EV-D68 were rare until 2009 when an upsurge commenced worldwide2,3. In 2014, the USA experienced an unprecedented nationwide outbreak of EV-D68. From mid-August 2014 to January 15, 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or state public health laboratories confirmed a total of 1,153 people in 49 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/ev-d68-outbreaks.html). Almost all of the confirmed cases were among children, many of whom had asthma or a history of wheezing. The clinical presentation of EV-D68 infections in the outbreak ranged from mild upper respiratory illness to severe respiratory complications requiring hospitalization and, in rare instances, subsequent death. As the 2014 outbreak unfolded, a possible association was also perceived between EV-D68 infection, polio-like acute flaccid paralysis, and cranial neuropathy in children4,5.",

The polyprotein ORF is flanked by a long untranslated region at the 5\u2032 end (5\u2032UTR) and a short untranslated region at the 3\u2032 end. The 5\u2032UTR contains a variable spacer region between a highly conserved internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the polyprotein ORF. The polyprotein is processed co- and post-translationally to yield individual mature viral peptides, including structural VP1-VP4 from P1 capsid precursor; 2A protease (2Apro), 2B and 2C (ATPase) from P2 enzymatic precursor; and 3A, 3B (VPg), 3C protease (3C\u2009pro), and 3D (RNA polymerase) from P3 enzymatic precursor. Whereas 2Apro is responsible for the primary cleavage of the capsid precursor P1 from the non-structural region P2-P3 (between VP1 and 2A), 3Cpro performs eight cleavages within the polyprotein. In addition to processing of the viral polyprotein, 2Apro and 3Cpro are also involved in shutting off host cell activities that help the virus evade host defense mechanisms and promote its own replication6,7.",

We used these negative controls to monitor if there was any cross-sample contamination. We identified a very low number of short reads aligned to the EV-D68 genome (\u22643) in each EV-D68-negative sample, except 11 short reads (8/3) in sample NY266. Nevertheless, to date it is difficult for us to justify whether these short reads were from cross-sample contamination or not. The detection of EV-D68 in these 93 samples using our MSS protocol is summarized in Suppl. Table 1. Due to the uniqueness of each clinical sample (carrier RNA added or not, more RNA virus infection or less, more inhabiting microbiome or less, etc.), the number of short reads for each sample varied significantly, from hundreds to hundreds of thousands.",

                    "text": "For the genetic association study on the 2014 outbreak of EV-D68 in the USA, we separated 40 EV-D68 strains into two defined groups, Group O and Group N, based on their collection time and places. Through a multivariate approach, we further identified three variables significantly contributing to the partition of these 40 strains (Fig. 4). Two of the three variables were non-synonymous, leading to amino acid changes at protease cleavage sites, T860N at position P2 of the 2Apro cleavage site between VP1 and 2A and S1108G at position P1\u2032 of the 3Cpro cleavage site between 2B and 2C. Previous work6 on the specificity of picornaviral proteases unveiled that glycine was uniquely required at the P1\u2032 position of the 2Apro cleavage site, whereas 3Cpro preferentially cleaved between Glutamine-Glycine (Q\u2013G) pairs. At the 2Apro cleavage site, threonine at position P2 was the most conserved residue after P1\u2032-Glycine6. Therefore, it is very likely that the T860N replacement at position P2 would alter the efficiency of 2Apro cleavage, which co-translationally releases the capsid precursor P1 peptide. Of important note, different enteroviruses may be quite selective about their substrate preferences and rates of cleavage. Recently, it was reported that EV-D68 3Cpro displayed different activities toward cleavage sites, very low toward VP3-VP1 with Glutamine-Leucine (Q\u2013L) pair and 2B-2C with Glutamine-Serine (Q\u2013S) pair, but high toward the others with Q\u2013G pair23. Since 3Cpro has a cleavage preference over Q\u2013G pairs6,23, the S1108G replacement, changing Q\u2013S pair to Q\u2013G pair, might increase the rate of 3Cpro cleavage between 2B and 2C, thereby altering the stability of peptide 2BC and the maturation of peptides 2B and 2C. Peptide 2B is implicated in altering the host cell membrane permeability and peptides 2B, 2C, and their common precursor 2BC are implicated in the production of the membranous vesicular structures on which viral replication takes place7. Further, a recent research demonstrated that enteroviral particles are packaged within phosphatidylserine vesicles, non-lytically releasing from cells and providing greater infection efficiency than free single viral particles24. Therefore, it is very possible that mutation S1108G may affect EV-D68 viral replication as well as transmission.",

We speculate that these two variables are the main feature in characterization of EV-D68 strains circulating in the outbreak. Both variables are functionally related to protease cleavage activity and peptide maturation, hence they may have potential to impact viral replication and transmission. Moreover, combined together, the two functional variables may show synergistic effect, which could lead to EV-D68 dissemination and causing more severe disease. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the sample size for our population-based case-control genetic analysis is small, because resources for the whole-genome sequences of EV-D68 are limited. Therefore, caution should be taken in interpreting the results of our genetic association study. Further observation and experimental validation are required. Most recently, Greninger et al. reported six coding polymorphisms identified in new appearing EV-D68 strains, which included both T860N and S1108G mutations5.",

Spread of EV-D68 as a pathogen causing acute respiratory infection was also observed in other countries in 201419,25,26,27,28. To date, the epidemiology and pathogenesis of EV-D68 infection remain elusive. Our present retrospective study represents one effort toward understanding of EV-D68 infection and the recent outbreak. With more detailed clinical features of patients available, a study on the correlation between the high severity of disease and the genomic elements may provide further insights. We believe in the near future the whole-genome sequence data will predict the outcome of EV-D68 infection and help clinicians in patient treatment.",
