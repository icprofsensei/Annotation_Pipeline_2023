A state of taxon domination was defined as 30% or greater relative abundance of the most dominant taxon identified in a stool specimen collected until Transplantation Day 35, hospital discharge, or death (10). Using this threshold, domination states by bacteria from the taxa proteobacteria (phylum), Enterococcus (genus), and Streptococcus (genus) were included based on previous findings as the most abundant and clinically relevant taxa in this allogeneic HCT population (10).",

Thirty-three PCs (29.2%) occurred during the first 30 days, and 86 (76.8%) occurred by the end of the first post-transplantation year. PCs developed preengraftment in 19 subjects (28.8%), postengraftment in 56 (84.9%), and during both intervals in 9 patients (13.6%). Forty-eight subjects (51.1%) died during the study, and one-half of the deaths were considered transplant-related. Median time to death was 218 days. Subjects who died were more likely to have abnormal baseline PFTs (P\u2009=\u20090.006) and exposure to azithromycin (P\u2009=\u20090.026) compared with those who were alive at the end of the study period.

In separate pre- and postengraftment analyses, low baseline diversity was solely predictive of PCs occurring preengraftment (hazard ratio [HR], 6.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42\u201331.80; P\u2009=\u20090.016) (see Table E2). The relationship between Enterococcus-domination and preengraftment PCs (HR, 5.72; 95% CI, 2.12\u201315.45; P\u2009=\u20090.001) was attenuated after adjusting for antibiotics (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.38\u20134.95; P\u2009=\u20090.625), whereas \u03b3-proteobacteria domination remained a strong predictor of postengraftment PCs in the fully adjusted model (HR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.49\u20138.21; P\u2009=\u20090.006) (see Table E3). Relationships between microbiota domination states and PCs using Kaplan-Meier analysis are shown in Figure 3, including associations between \u03b3-proteobacteria domination and postengraftment PCs (log-rank P\u2009=\u20090.006) (Figure 3A), as well as Enterococcus-domination and preengraftment PCs (log-rank P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) (Figure 3B). Figure 4 presents a timeline for a case of pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae, a known respiratory pathogen from the \u03b3-proteobacteria class, which developed after the transition to fecal domination by K. pneumoniae in serial stool samples, raising the possibility of translocation from the gut to the lung.",

By identifying features of fecal microbiota that may predict PCs, we were able to extend the impactful scope of these treatment-related shifts in gastrointestinal flora on clinically relevant endpoints. Early gut domination by \u03b3-proteobacteria, a class of bacteria that includes respiratory pathogens such as K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, was associated with the development of postengraftment PCs, which, in turn, more than doubled the risk of mortality. Interestingly, the identification of abundant K. variicola, a recently named and virulent phylogroup of K. pneumoniae (38), in several specimens from subjects with PCs may highlight missed opportunities for isolating potential pathogens in clinical specimens using traditional diagnostic methods. The same may be true for E. asburiae and L. adecarboxylata, formerly known as E. adecarboxylata, which have also been isolated from clinical specimens in patients with pneumonia and bacteremia (39,40).",

The latter may best explain the attenuation of the relationship between gut domination by bacteria belonging to the genus Enterococcus (where most of the sequences were identified as vancomycin-resistant E. faecium [10]) and preengraftment PCs, because antibiotic use for prophylaxis and/or empiric treatment is heaviest at this time and may foster its aberrant colonization (10). However, although E. faecium is infrequently considered a true lung pathogen in the clinical setting, perhaps because of its diminished virulence compared with K. pneumoniae (41), infection and direct lung injury may occur, especially in the compromised host (42). Conversely, the emergence of low diversity as an independent predictor of PCs only once antibiotics were included in the model is consistent with previous findings in this population (13) and may have biological relevance. Although diversity and domination states did not always occur in close proximity to the PC (an unavoidable limitation to our study design), changes in gut microbiota composition early during HCT might have affected long-term pulmonary health, as shown in association with other post-transplant outcomes (43).",

The origin of some lung communities has been speculated to derive from nonpulmonary sources, including the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal system. In the absence of lung colonization or infection, several studies have shown that gut dysbiosis triggers inflammation in asthma and allergic airways diseases (14\u201316), cystic fibrosis (17), and infection-mediated lung inflammation (18\u201321). Intestinal permeability may be implicated in the translocation of bacteria and/or microparticles, such as lipopolysaccharide, on the pathway to acute lung injury and sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (53\u201355). Because of the emerging recognition of shared mucosal immune responses in these parallel systems, it is possible that changes in gut microbiota associated with treatment-induced mucosal damage elicit injurious lung inflammation, which may persist or recur after engraftment. Further investigation into these relationships will be important to inform novel mechanistic hypotheses and develop predictive risk tools.",

The latter is a validated summary measurement of multisystem pretransplant comorbidities, including moderate or severe pulmonary impairment, which has been shown to predict mortality (30, 56). PCs have also been associated with HCT-related mortality throughout the literature (57\u201360), albeit using varied definitions and study designs. Although it is difficult to determine whether PCs proximal to death were causal in our study, their contribution is likely underestimated based on autopsy studies (59, 61). The strength of association between mortality and postengraftment PCs was also interesting. In a study of HCT recipients with bloodstream infections, postengraftment events were associated with worse outcomes, including death (62). \u201cLate onset\u201d noninfectious PCs, which may be subjected to diagnostic inaccuracy (63), have been associated with acute and chronic GVHD (35, 64, 65) and mortality (66). Many subjects in our study had multiple PCs, suggesting susceptibility to recurrent lung injury, incomplete resolution, and/or misdiagnosis and treatment of a previous PC. Most postengraftment PCs were empirically treated as infectious, but they may represent an infection-mediated alloimmune or inflammatory mechanism (67, 68). However, it is reassuring that a preengraftment PC may not be a harbinger of death, as supported by survival rates of HCT recipients in the intensive care unit with acute respiratory distress that developed prior to engraftment who are comparable to noncancer patients in that setting (69).",

First, we used a broad clinical\u2013radiographic definition of post-transplant PCs to maximize capture of poorly defined events. We used commonly accepted abnormal radiographic patterns (8, 9) in conjunction with clinical information, similar to the approach taken by Garcia and colleagues, to identify a \u201cpneumonia syndrome\u201d in patients with acute leukemia (70), and our PC yield compared well with reported estimates (3). However, the inclusion of all PCs into one primary endpoint, regardless of severity, distribution or diagnosis, could inflate or dilute the impact of PCs on mortality. Prospective characterization of clinical and radiographic features of PCs will improve insight into which processes portend the greatest risk of death.",

Although PC data were identified retrospectively, the microbiota protocol was prospective in nature. We thus used time-dependent variables to address this issue. Third, the small sample size limited the power to analyze specific measures of baseline pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., impaired diffusing capacity in predicting PCs), and overlapping variables within PFT and HCTCI assessments may have contributed. Lastly, although this cohort was representative of the HCT population at our center (10, 13), it might not reflect patient characteristics or clinical practice elsewhere.",

The interaction between PCs and engraftment suggests that the graft\u2013lung relationship may play an important role, which may be mediated either directly or indirectly by gut microbiota composition. Further study is warranted to delineate mechanisms, identify risk factors, and design interventions that could improve outcomes for at-risk patients.",
