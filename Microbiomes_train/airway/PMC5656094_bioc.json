Lactobacillus fermentum was enriched in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (p=0\u00b7028), and lactic acid bacteria dominated the microenvironment in seven (47%) of 15 cases of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Comparison of oesophageal sampling methods showed that the Cytosponge yielded more than ten-times higher quantities of microbial DNA than did endoscopic brushes or biopsies using quantitative PCR (p<0\u00b70001). The Cytosponge samples contained the majority of taxa detected in biopsy and brush samples, but were enriched for genera from the oral cavity and stomach, including Fusobacterium, Megasphaera, Campylobacter, Capnocytophaga, and Dialister.

The incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has increased by six times in developed countries during the past three decades.1 Both Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma are thought to develop in response to chronic acid reflux in the lower oesophagus, which precipitates inflammation and mucosal injury over time.2 Reflux disease has increased with the obesity epidemic and altered eating habits in high-income countries, and central adiposity might also influence carcinogenesis through the release of adipokines.3 Additionally, epidemiological evidence suggests that the rising incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma coincides with the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, which could alter the composition of microbiota and promote bacterial overgrowth.4 Furthermore, reflux disease is treated with antacid drugs such as proton-pump inhibitors, which have profound effects on gastric acidity and might affect the gastro-oesophageal microbiota.5",

One of the best described examples is colon carcinoma, in which gastrointestinal microbiota have been shown to promote carcinogenesis in the setting of colonic inflammation.6, 7, 8 Studies have also linked Fusobacterium nucleatum to colon carcinoma through an altered tumour immuno-environment, but without associated colitis.9, 10 The oesophagus has far fewer bacteria than the colon; nevertheless, alterations in the microbiota might occur in reflux oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus.11, 12, 13 However, the role of the microbiota in Barrett's carcinogenesis is not clearly defined and there is no clinical reference standard at present for sampling the oesophageal microbiota. One of the challenges in studying the oesophageal microbiota is that endoscopy is an invasive test that provides only a focal sampling of the microbiota in biopsy samples, and a slightly larger surface area with endoscopic brushings. Minimally invasive methods for sampling the oesophageal microbiota could be clinically useful for detection and risk stratification of patients with Barrett's oesophagus.",

The microbial diversity was reduced in the lower oesophagus regardless of whether cancerous or healthy oesophageal tissue was sampled within the same patients. We further translated our findings to the setting of early detection, using the Cytosponge to sample the microbiota in Barrett's oesophagus and high-grade dysplasia.

Endoscopic brushings were taken from an area of normal squamous oesophagus only. The tissue samples collected in the OCCAMS/ICGC study included endoscopic biopsies, endoscopic mucosal resection specimens, and surgical biopsies after oesophagectomy. Sampling from oesophagectomy specimens was done with a sterile scalpel blade (cutting down to submucosa) within 1 h of surgical resection. All samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C except for the Cytosponge samples, which were preserved in BD SurePath liquid at 4\u00b0C. All patients fasted overnight before endoscopy or surgery. As part of routine perioperative procedure, patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma who underwent oesophagectomy received prophylactic intravenous antibiotics at the time of surgery, up to 6 h before the research samples were obtained. The very close timing of this perioperative antibiotic exposure should not greatly affect microbial community composition profiles because 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing detects both live and dead bacterial cells cross-sectionally (appendix p 1).17",

DNA was isolated from all oesophageal samples using the Precellys Soil DNA Kit (Peqlab, Southampton, UK). The 16S rRNA gene was amplified using primers for the V1-V2 region: 27F 5\u2032AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC TATGGTAATT CC AGMGTTYGATYMTGGCTCAG and 338R 5\u2032CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT NNNNNNNNNNNN AGTCAGTCAG AA GCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT, where Illumina adapter sequences are at the 5\u2032 end, and the N string is a unique barcode. Most samples had two barcoded replicates to ensure reproducibility (labelled A or B in the appendix p 5), and negative controls from every DNA extraction step underwent additional PCR cycles to identify contaminant organisms. The reaction conditions were 98\u00b0C for 2 min, 25 cycles at 98\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 90 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Negative controls were kit reagents or nuclease-free water, which underwent 45 amplification cycles. All samples were amplified in duplicate and pooled to minimise PCR bias and maximise yield. The PCR products were concentrated using ethanol precipitation and quantified using a Qubit 2\u00b70 Fluorometer before sequencing on the MiSeq Illumina platform using 2\u2008\u00d7\u2008250 bp read length. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number ERP005191. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis was done with mothur.18 The MiSeq standard operating procedure19 was followed with the exception of chimera checking, which was done with chimera.perseus, and unique sequences were removed using the split.abund and remove.seqs commands before building the distance matrix. Contaminant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined as having greater proportional abundance in negative controls, alongside previous evidence that these OTUs were derived from genera that are common contaminants,20 and these reads were removed using remove.seqs (3434 OTUs defined as contaminants from 5757 total OTUs). Comparisons between replicate samples (using Metastats21 as implemented in mothur) showed no significant differences so replicates were pooled using the Linux sed command to maximise the number of reads per sample, and samples with fewer than 550 reads or Good's coverage less than 95% were removed with remove.groups. The Good's coverage estimator22 is used to assess what proportion of the total OTUs present within a given sample are detected in the sequencing results, and thus gives an indication of how thorough the sampling has been at the chosen sequencing depth. For measures of diversity that are sensitive to the sequencing depth, random subsampling was done at the lowest number of reads per sample using the sub.sample command in mothur. Data were subsampled at 631 reads for the analysis of tissue samples (median Good's coverage 96\u00b736%, range 92\u00b708\u201399\u00b737), 656 reads for matched tumour-normal pairs (97\u00b741%, range 95\u00b727\u201398\u00b778), 631 reads for the comparison of different sampling methods (96\u00b751%, range 91\u00b713\u201399\u00b784), and 19\u2008303 reads for the analysis of Cytosponge samples (99\u00b783%, range 99\u00b770\u201399\u00b795). When determining the shared genera between Cytosponge samples, biopsies, and brushes, a cutoff of 0\u00b70001% proportional abundance was used to focus on the more abundant OTUs that are less likely to be susceptible to errors introduced by subsampling (below 0\u00b70001% there were less than 27 reads supporting each OTU across all the samples). A second cutoff value of 0\u00b71% was chosen arbitrarily to show the similarity between sample types and is a common cutoff used in previous studies.23, 24 Sequence identity was confirmed at the species level, where possible, by carrying out NCBI BLAST analysis on representative sequences using MegaBLAST.25",

Within Graphpad, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for analyses involving matched tumour-normal pairs, and the Friedman test and Dunns post-test were used for analyses of matched samples from endoscopic biopsies, brushes, and the Cytosponge. We used LEfSe,27 a metagenomic biomarker discovery method, to identify microbial taxa that differed significantly between controls, Barrett's oesophagus, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples. LEfSe was used within mothur. All sequencing reads were included for the composition analysis using LEfSe. LEfSe ranks OTUs in the order that it considers these taxa to be most likely to explain differences between microbial communities using linear discriminant analysis to estimate effect size. A full explanation of the statistical approaches used in LEfSe can be found in the original article by Segata and colleagues.27 Within mothur, the Bray-Curtis calculator was used to describe the dissimilarity between communities by taking into account both the overlap in OTUs that are present between samples and the proportional abundance of those OTUs in each sample. Using dissimilarity information calculated with the Bray-Curtis calculator, the parsimony test and the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) test were used to show significantly different clustering between microbiota profiles from the different diagnostic groups. IBM SPSS Statistics (version 24) was used to analyse patient data (ANOVA for mean age and Fisher's exact test for sex, ethnicity, and antacid usage).

The control samples were enriched for several taxa at the family level, including the Gram-negative, anaerobic Veillonellaceae (p=0\u00b7012, overall proportional abundance 5\u00b73%) and microaerophilic Campylobacteraceae (p=0\u00b700038, overall proportional abundance 0\u00b72%), the Gram-positive, anaerobic Lachnospiraceae (p=0\u00b7012, overall proportional abundance 1%) and Erysipelotrichaceae (p=0\u00b70021, overall proportional abundance 0\u00b74%), and the Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic Carnobacteriaceae (p=0\u00b7038, overall proportional abundance 1\u00b76%), and Actinomycetaceae (p=0\u00b70019, overall proportional abundance 0\u00b78%; figure 1A). Significant genera within these families included Veillonella (p=0\u00b7002, overall proportional abundance 3\u00b78%), Megasphaera (p=0\u00b70027, overall proportional abundance 0\u00b73%), Granulicatella (p=0\u00b7037, overall proportional abundance 1\u00b76%), Actinomyces (p=0\u00b70022, overall proportional abundance 0\u00b78%), Solobacterium (p=0\u00b7012, overall proportional abundance 0\u00b73%), and Campylobacter (p=0\u00b70004, overall proportional abundance 0\u00b72%; figure 1B). In oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples, the Gram-positive, anaerobic Coriobacteriaceae was enriched at the family level (p=0\u00b701, overall proportional abundance 1\u00b79%), but there were no significant genera identified within this family. At the species level, the Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic Lactobacillus fermentum was enriched in oesophageal adenocarcinoma with mean proportional abundance of 0\u00b76% (median 0\u00b7009%, SE 0\u00b75%) compared with 0\u00b701% (median 0%, SE 0\u00b7007%) in Barrett's oesophagus samples and 0\u00b7004% (median 0%, SE 0\u00b7003%) in control samples (p=0\u00b7028). Sequence identity was confirmed where possible with NCBI BLAST. One Barrett's oesophagus sample contained a high proportional abundance of H pylori sequences (>99%).",

The Bray-Curtis algorithm describes the dissimilarity between communities by taking into account both the overlap in OTUs that are present and the proportional abundance of those OTUs. Samples that have fewer overlapping OTUs and OTUs with less similar proportional abundances will cluster separately, and this differential clustering was further shown by principal coordinate analysis (p=0\u00b7001, AMOVA test; appendix p 1). The microbial communities of seven of 15 oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples were dominated by the Gram-positive order Lactobacillales. Of the seven patients with a high proportion of acid-tolerant Lactobacillales, six were taking antacid drugs. Five oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples had a high proportional abundance of Streptococcus spp (69\u201398%) and two samples had a high proportional abundance of Lactobacillus spp (87% and 92%). NCBI BLAST showed that the representative species were Streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, Streptococcus salivarius/vestibularis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus helveticus/suntoryeus/gallinarum (/ indicates where it was not possible to differentiate between different species using the 16S rRNA gene regions sequenced). Although abundant in the acidic stomach environment, such a high proportional abundance of Lactobacillus spp was an unexpected finding in the oesophagus. When we examined matched healthy and tumour tissue for the two patients with high Lactobacillus spp, we found that this genus dominated the lower oesophagus regardless of disease state (appendix p 2). Gram-positive rods were visualised in areas of ulceration in tumour PS003 with a high proportional abundance of Lactobacillus spp (appendix p 2).",

Three indices of alpha diversity, observed OTU richness (p=0\u00b70012; figure 3A), the Chao estimate of total OTU richness (p=0\u00b70004; figure 3B), and the Shannon diversity index (p=0\u00b70075; figure 3C) showed that diversity was lower in oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples than in controls. In comparison with Barrett's oesophagus samples, the oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples showed a decrease in observed OTU richness and the Chao estimate, but not in the Shannon diversity index. 13 patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma had matched normal squamous tissue sampled proximal to the tumour, and in these patients there was no difference in OTU richness between the normal and tumour tissue (p=0\u00b79065; figure 3D). Similarly, there was no difference for the Chao estimate (p>0\u00b7999) or the Shannon index (p=0\u00b76355). Furthermore, there was no difference in overall bacterial abundance between matched normal squamous and tumour tissue (p=0\u00b7782; figure 3E). These results suggested that the decreased microbial diversity was pervasive throughout the lower oesophagus in oesophageal adenocarcinoma and was independent of the absolute quantity of oesophageal bacteria.",

Overall, 1455 OTUs were identified and mapped to 381 genera. Using a cutoff of 0\u00b70001% overall proportional abundance (138 genera classified), 84\u00b71% of genera were shared between Cytosponge samples, biopsies, and brushes, and 83\u00b76% were shared between Cytosponge samples and throat swabs. A stricter cutoff of 0\u00b71% overall proportional abundance (41 genera classified) showed supporting reads for 100% of genera in all sample types, suggesting an overlap in community membership between the oral cavity, oesophagus, and gastric cardia.",

The mean number of reads for Cytosponge samples was 40\u2008753 (SD 9717) and the median was 40\u2008821 (11714), and the proportion of reads that were subsampled was 47% (for 19\u2008303 reads cutoff). The observed OTU richness was decreased in high-grade dysplasia compared with controls (p=0\u00b70147; figure 5A), as were the Chao estimate of total OTU richness (p=0\u00b7023; figure 5B) and the Shannon index (p=0\u00b70085; figure 5C). There was decreased diversity in Barrett's oesophagus, but this was significant only for the Shannon index. In general, the Cytosponge samples showed homogeneous results for microbiota composition between diagnostic groups at the phylum and family levels, suggesting that the fraction of microbiota sampled from the area of Barrett's oesophagus was diluted by the copious bacteria sampled from the rest of the oesophagus, oral cavity, and stomach. Despite this, three genera were identified that distinguished controls from the other sample types using LEfSe: Dialister (p=0\u00b7027, overall proportional abundance 0\u00b73%), Schlegelella (p=0\u00b7016, overall proportional abundance 0\u00b71%), and unclassified Prevotellaceae (p=0\u00b7047, overall proportional abundance 1\u00b73%).",

The genera that were decreased in proportional abundance in oesophageal adenocarcinoma included Gram-negative (Veillonella, Megasphaera, and Campylobacter) and Gram-positive taxa (Granulicatella, Atopobium, Actinomyces, and Solobacterium). There was significantly increased proportional abundance for L fermentum in patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma compared with control patients and those with Barrett's oesophagus, and there was a high proportional abundance of acid-tolerant Lactobacillales (Lactobacillus spp and Streptococcus spp) in a subset (seven [47%] of 15) of oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples. To translate our findings to the setting of early detection, we investigated the use of the Cytosponge device for sampling the oesophageal microbiota in Barrett's oesophagus and high-grade dysplasia.

Lactic acid fermentation can also produce noxious by-products, such as hydrogen peroxide, that directly inhibit the growth of competitor bacteria and enable Lactobacillales to dominate the lower oesophagus. Given the altered microbial composition in oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples, it would be interesting to correlate microbiota data with expression and activity of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR2, given the increased proportional abundance of Gram-positive genera in a subset of cancer samples. Other authors have investigated TLR expression in Barrett's carcinogenesis and found overexpression of TLRs 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9 in human oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples30, 31, 32, 33 and TLRs 1\u20133, 6, 7, and 9 in a rat reflux model.34",

                    "text": "Although the microbial community structure differed significantly in oesophageal adenocarcinoma in our study, there was only a modest reduction in diversity in Barrett's oesophagus and no genera were identified that discriminated between controls and Barrett's oesophagus, or between Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. It is possible that very low abundance genera might be difficult to detect in oesophageal biopsies given the low microbial DNA yield, and notably some pathogens have been shown to cause overt disease while only accounting for a low proportional abundance of the total microbiota, such as Clostridium difficile,35\nCitrobacter rodentium,36 and Fusobacterium spp.37 Similarly, Amir and colleagues5 were unable to identify any taxa that differentiated between controls (n=15) and Barrett's oesophagus (n=6), or oesophagitis (n=13) using LEfSe. By contrast, Yang and colleagues11 reported that Gram-negative bacteria were significantly enriched in Barrett's oesophagus (n=10) and reflux oesophagitis (n=12) compared with controls (n=12).11 The main limiting factor of these microbiota studies is the relatively small sample size and substantial inter-individual variation in microbiota composition. Another limitation is that although LEfSe is useful for biological interpretation of metagenomic data, it does not correct for multiple comparisons, so there is a risk of false discovery (p value, \u03b1=0\u00b705). The inclusion of appropriate negative controls and replicate samples is also paramount for low microbial biomass samples to facilitate removal of contaminant OTUs that might also lead to false discovery,20 and this was a major strength of our study. We also imposed strict quality control criteria, resulting in the exclusion of 14 tissue samples with low sequencing read numbers and Good's coverage estimates. The difficulty in obtaining good quality sequencing data from oesophageal samples highlights the potential use of the Cytosponge device, which samples a larger surface area.",

                    "text": "Our results suggest that it is feasible to sample oesophageal microbiota using the Cytosponge, and the device detected the majority of genera present in endoscopic biopsies and brushes. The high microbial DNA yield collected by the Cytosponge reflects sampling of the entire length of the oesophagus as well as the proximal stomach and oral cavity as it is withdrawn. The throat swabs showed similarities in community membership between the oral cavity and oesophagus, but the proportional abundances differed, as shown by distinct clustering in principal coordinate analysis. Despite dilution from sampling the upper gastrointestinal tract, it was still possible for the Cytosponge to detect a decrease in diversity and community composition between normal squamous controls and high-grade dysplasia. Similar to the Cytosponge, Fillon and colleagues38 described a minimally invasive oesophageal string test to sample the microbiota in a paediatric population. The oesophageal string test detected a similar microbial composition to that in matched oesophageal biopsies, but required the patients to remain in hospital overnight with the string secured to their cheek. Alternatively, the Cytosponge is a convenient test that can be given in a general practitioner's or family doctor's office with the supervision of a trained nurse, and takes only 5\u20137 min to complete.14, 39 The Cytosponge can also provide histological data for inflammatory pathologies such as candidal oesophagitis, herpes oesophagitis, and eosinophilic oesophagitis.40 Our initial results using the Cytosponge are promising, and future test development should focus on longitudinal sampling of the microbiota to monitor changes in microbial diversity over time in a larger cohort of patients. Further research should also examine the role of diet, dysphagia, and other external influences on the oesophageal microbiota.",
