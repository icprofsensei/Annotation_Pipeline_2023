The ISR strategy resulted in a 5.2-fold increase in community resolution compared to reference-based 16S rRNA gene analysis and showed 100% accuracy in predicting the correct source of a clinical sample. Individuals\u2019 microbial communities were highly personalized, and although they exhibited some drift in membership and levels over time, that difference was always smaller than the differences between any two subjects, even after 1\u00a0year.

Use of this approach has revealed the remarkably diverse character of the microbiota [2] and significantly advanced our understanding of its role in human health and disease in multiple body sites [3\u201310]. Microbiome studies are increasingly focusing on functional relationships, and functional differences among bacterial strains of the same species have long been observed. More recent evidence from comparative genomics has shown a significant amount of variation within the genomes of different strains of the same species [11]. These genetic variations often lead to significant phenotypic differences among strains [12], which can result in varying degrees of pathogenicity [13].",

In addition, while the oral cavity is colonized by a diverse bacterial community [14], many species are widely shared among all human hosts [2]. Metagenomic studies of the gut [15\u201317] and skin [18] microbiomes have shown that microbial profiles show little individuality at the level of species but high individual specificity when characterized at the subspecies level.

Recently, high-throughput short-read sequencing of the ISR for species-level analysis has been reported. Ruegger et al. showed improved resolution by short-read sequencing of the ISR, as compared to 16S regions [31]. Schanche et al. also used high-throughput ISR sequencing and de novo OTU binning, suggesting microbiome transmission from mother to child [32].

We tracked microbial communities from dental plaque of five adult subjects over a 1-year period. The ISR sequencing technique combined with DADA2-based processing allowed resolution of individual species into multiple subspecies variants and revealed highly personalized bacterial profiles for individual subjects.

Both sets of amplicon libraries were prepared based on the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol (Illumina, USA), a two-step protocol in which the region of interest is first amplified with gene-specific primers and then dual indices are added through a brief second PCR. Optimizations were made to the Illumina protocol to allow for high-fidelity amplification and automation. For each sample, purified DNA was adjusted to 5\u00a0ng/\u03bcL concentration and 2\u00a0\u03bcl of DNA was PCR amplified in a total volume of 25\u00a0\u03bcL with Accuprime Taq DNA Polymerase, High Fidelity (ThermoFisher Scientific) using primers (IDT, USA) composed of region-specific sequences (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S1) and attached Illumina adapter sequences. Forward Illumina adapter used was TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG and reverse Illumina Adapter used was GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG. PCR parameters consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min, followed by 25\u00a0cycles of denaturation at 94\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, annealing at 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, and extension at 68\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min followed by a final extension at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. PCR products were purified with the Agencourt AMPure XP PCR Purification system (Beckman Coulter, USA) using manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. This was followed by a subsequent 8-cycle PCR amplification step (temperature and timing as before) to add dual indexing barcodes for multiplexing, with barcode sequences derived from the study by Kozich et al.

The index PCR products were further purified using the AMPure system as above and quantified using Quant-iT\u2122 High-Sensitivity dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA) on a Spectramax Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA).

All pipetting steps were performed using a Biomek 4000 Liquid Handling Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter) for consistency.

For draft genomes, another custom R script utilizing command line BLASTN [41] application 2.5.0 with ISR-flanking primers was used to identify and extract ISR sequences. When creating our 16S database of oral bacteria, CORE, we could not distinguish between certain closely related species and therefore found it necessary to group them together. Distinct phylogenetic clades were observed within each of these species groups. However, we were not able to assign each clade to a specific species. As a result, to avoid ambiguous taxonomic assignments and maintain consistency with our 16S database, we combined ISRs from these species into groups matching those in our CORE database.

Unexpected length sequences and those with >\u200910 ambiguous bases were filtered out and PCR primer sequences were removed. The resulting sequences were then filtered to keep only those reads which had average Phred quality scores \u2265\u200928, using a script based on BioPython [45] 1.63 (Python 2.7.6). Next, these high-quality reads were aligned with the command line BLASTN application 2.5.0 against the OSU CORE reference database of human oral 16S sequences [46]. A custom PHP script was used to recalculate percent identities (avoiding counting ambiguous bases as mismatches) and to filter by the length of the alignments. Sequences which matched \u2265\u200998% and had a minimum alignment length of 400 base pairs with the reference database entries were classified taxonomically as the highest identity match. Overall, 77.1% of quality screened 16S V1-V3 reads matched the CORE database with this criteria.

Oral streptococci are among the most difficult organisms to distinguish by 16S-based analysis. Multiple sequence alignments for the two regions for 14 species of streptococci (Fig.\u00a01) showed substantially higher diversity among the ISR sequences, with the main region of homology being the locus coding for an alanine tRNA. Similar patterns were observed for species from other genera (data not shown). These alignments indicated, as expected, the ISR could be targeted as a higher resolution marker for amplicon sequencing of the oral microbiota.",

We selected the three species which showed maximum ISR-type diversity, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Granulicatella adiacens, and the Streptococcus mitis group, for an in-depth analysis. These species could be resolved into 41, 38, and 33 ISR types respectively, and were labeled Hp 1\u201341, Ga 1\u201338, and Sm 1\u201333, respectively, based on decreasing overall sequence abundance. Rarefaction analysis for each of the 15 species showed that generally, our sequencing strategy provided sufficient depth to profile all real ISR variants for these species.

Instead, we processed the ISR sequences with the DADA2 pipeline and compared the results to standard 16S rRNA gene V1-V3 region amplicon sequencing processed by reference database matching and to the same 16S sequences processed using DADA2.",

This is consistent with a recent metagenomic strain profiling showing that this bacterium has high strain diversity compared to other human-associated microbes [20]. Rarefaction analysis showed that sequencing depth was sufficient to estimate population structures for all 15 species we analyzed. Three species were selected for more detailed profiling based on highest diversity and overall abundance, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Granulicatella adiacens, and Streptococcus mitis (Fig.\u00a06). The degree to which ISR types were shared among subjects, or prevalence, ranged from one S. mitis group variant that was shared by all subjects to a large number of variants from each species that were present in only one subject (Fig.\u00a06b, \u200b,c).c). These individually unique variants are major contributors to the ability to discriminate among subjects based on the beta diversity analysis (data not shown).

The relationship between the ISR and the rest of the genome can vary from species to species. One study involving several species of phototrophic bacteria belonging to the order Rhizobiales showed that 70% DNA hybridization was associated with 92% ISR sequence similarity [57]. How closely this correlates with conventional phenotype-based strain designations is not presently fully understood. Our future work in this area will focus on establishing genomic and functional correlations for ISR types.",

However, some taxa such as Veillonella spp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis have multiple non-identical ISR sequences. This information is currently available for a limited number of species and strains.

In Illumina paired-end sequencing, the second sequencing reads are lower quality compared to the first reads. Since the ISR read quality was critical, these were sequenced first, followed by the 16S V8-V9 reads. This resulted in the loss of over 25% of the V8-V9 reads during quality and length filtering. Additionally, species assignments using the V8-V9 region are not as accurate as those based on the well-validated, standard V1-V3 sequences [58]. So we instead developed the ISR database to map the ISR variants to species level taxa and relied on separate amplification of the V1-V3 region for species-level community characterization.",

                    "text": "Although it was not ideal for species mapping, the inclusion of the V8-V9 region in the ISR fragment did allow comparison of microbial diversity of the 16S-ISR library with the standard, comprehensive 16S-only library. Mapping the V8-V9 sequences generated a subset of these species-level taxons (222 of the 359) identified from the V1-V3 region in our dataset. Comparison of taxa represented in the two libraries showed that many of the species missing in the V8-V9 library had longer (>\u2009500\u00a0bp) ISRs, resulting in very long amplicons (>\u2009800\u00a0bp) that are not amplified or sequenced as well as the shorter amplicons from species with smaller ISR regions. Species missing due to the length bias included some potentially clinically important members of the genera Prevotella, Veillonella, Neisseria, Tannerella, and Porphyromonas. However, with the development of the ISR database, it is no longer necessary to include the V8-V9 region for species mapping. A pilot experiment targeting only the informative ISR fragment, using the rD1f primer GGCTGGATCACCTCCTT [59] in place of the 1237f primer, produced libraries of shorter amplicons that included these missing genera (data not shown). Rothia, Actinomyces, and Fusobacterium were also missing in the 16S V8-V9-ISR library, compared to the 16S V1-V3 library. Examination of genomic sequences showed that, although the V8-V9-ISR amplicons were generated using previously validated universal primers (1237f and EricM primers, Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S1), the primer contained mismatches for these genera. Conveniently, adoption of the shorter fragment schema described above also solves this problem, as the primers used to target only the ISR (rD1f) generated amplicon libraries which included Rothia and Actinomyces. Fusobacterium was missing due to a mismatch in the distal primer EricM and can be included using a Fusobacterium-specific primer (EricM_fuso: ACCTAGGCATCCTTT). These adjustments parallel the early work done to develop 16S rRNA gene approaches for taxonomic assignment, including both modifications to the universal primer sequences and building of comprehensive databases. Ultimately, refinements should allow the expansion of the phylogenetic range of the ISR approach for broader application in future studies.",

However, the ultra-deep sequencing required to profile strain level communities can be prohibitively expensive and computationally challenging when applied to large-scale surveys of the human microbiome. Our ISR pipeline provides a high-resolution yet cost-effective approach for molecular epidemiology studies by allowing subspecies level tracking of microbiota. This method can be easily integrated into existing amplicon sequencing protocols by simply changing PCR primers, where it could provide the ability to resolve communities into a large number of variants.",

The human oral microbiome is a complex system whose composition is driven by the host and environmental factors, with community alterations at the level of species being implicated in several common diseases such as dental caries and periodontitis. It is unclear if these perturbations in species abundance are simply fluctuations in levels within the existing community or if strains adapted to the changing environment are acquired or lost. Transmission and acquisition of communities is not thoroughly understood either. Insights into these questions have far-reaching implications for therapeutic approaches. Further, the ability to accurately predict the source for a dental plaque sample analyzed using the ISR method could be useful for microbial fingerprinting and forensic tracking applications.",
