We employed a meta-omics approach that included microbial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and tandem mass spectrometry to analyze sub- and supragingival biofilms in adults with chronic periodontitis pre- and posttreatment with 0.25% sodium hypochlorite. Microbial samples were collected with periodontal curettes from 3- to 12-mm-deep periodontal pockets at the baseline and at 2\u00a0weeks and 3\u00a0months. All data types showed high interpersonal variability, and there was a significant correlation between phylogenetic diversity and pocket depth at the baseline and a strong correlation (rho = 0.21; P = 0.008) between metabolite diversity and maximum pocket depth (MPD). Analysis of subgingival baseline samples (16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomics) found positive correlations between abundances of particular bacterial genera and MPD, including Porphyromonas, Treponema, Tannerella, and Desulfovibrio species and unknown taxon SHD-231. At 2\u00a0weeks posttreatment, we observed an almost complete turnover in the bacterial genera (16S rRNA) and species (shotgun metagenomics) correlated with MPD. Among the metabolites detected, the medians of the 20 most abundant metabolites were significantly correlated with MPD pre- and posttreatment. Finally, tests of periodontal biofilm community instability found markedly higher taxonomic instability in patients who did not improve posttreatment than in patients who did improve (UniFrac distances; t = \u22123.59; P = 0.002). Interestingly, the opposite pattern occurred in the metabolic profiles (Bray-Curtis; t = 2.42; P = 0.02). Our results suggested that multi-omics approaches, and metabolomics analysis in particular, could enhance treatment prediction and reveal patients most likely to improve posttreatment.",

Despite decades of research, the reasons for the substantial differences among periodontitis patients in disease incidence, progressivity, and response to treatment remain poorly understood. While deep sequencing of oral bacterial communities has greatly expanded our comprehension of the microbial diversity of periodontal disease and identified associations with healthy and disease states, predicting treatment outcomes remains elusive. Our results suggest that combining multiple omics approaches enhances the ability to differentiate among disease states and determine differential effects of treatment, particularly with the addition of metabolomic information. Furthermore, multi-omics analysis of biofilm community instability indicated that these approaches provide new tools for investigating the ecological dynamics underlying the progressive periodontal disease process.",

Traditionally, periodontal disease is divided into gingivitis and periodontitis (2). Gingivitis refers to inflammatory disease limited to gingiva with no loss of tooth-supporting structures and with periodontal pocket depths typically ranging from 2 to 4\u00a0mm. Periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection and an extension of gingivitis. The disease appears as a breakdown of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone that can lead to loss of teeth (2, 3). Periodontitis affects the majority of adults worldwide (4) and may contribute to various systemic diseases, including atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease (4, 5), diabetes (6), and rheumatoid arthritis (7), among others (8).

Conventional periodontal therapy includes a stabilization phase and a maintenance phase (11). Stabilization of the disease is accomplished by periodontal biofilm disruption and removal of calculus and other biofilm-retentive factors and may involve adjunctive antimicrobial medication and/or surgery (12). Long-term goals in the maintenance stage are to have patients exercise proper plaque control and commit to professional prophylactic treatments to minimize the likelihood of a clinical relapse. While conventional periodontal therapy and follow-up maintenance can be effective in reducing inflammation and restoring damaged tissue, many patients do not improve significantly and may even continue to decline posttreatment (13, 14). The addition of antibiotic therapy may improve treatment outcomes, but some patients still do not improve over the long term (15). Hurdles to the successful treatment of periodontitis include microbial community complexity (16,\u201318) and its pathogenicity (19), as well as various protective and destructive immune responses to specific microbes or the microbial consortium (9).",

Single-marker gene studies assaying bacterial diversity using small-subunit rRNA gene sequences (16S rRNA) have revealed highly complex and distinct periodontal disease communities associated with healthy and diseased pockets even within the same mouth (15,\u201321). Other studies have revealed a pattern of extreme interpersonal variability in microbiome composition that includes dramatic differences in response to the same treatment regimen (15, 16). Shotgun metagenomic studies have also been applied to study periodontitis. Metagenomic methods provide a less biased assessment of species diversity (though with reduced depth) (22) and can be used to investigate the gene content of microbial communities in relation to disease status. For instance, metagenomic studies have suggested that the more diseased (deeper) pockets tend to be richer in metabolic pathways, have a greater abundance of virulence factors, and are poorer in biosynthesis pathways than healthy (shallower) pockets (23, 24).",

While Gonzales et al. (25) demonstrated a significant clinical improvement in periodontal disease during a longitudinal 3-month study, they did not determine whether or not treatment altered the biofilm communities. Using the multi-omics approach, we determined microbial composition, functional gene content, and metabolic profiles at the baseline and how these communities shifted after 2\u00a0weeks and 3\u00a0months both within and among individuals. Overall, our study demonstrated how combining multi-omics data sets provides deeper insight into periodontal disease and showed the promise of MS/MS in particular for enhancing our understanding of periodontal biofilm dynamics.",

In other words, there was a correlation between a sample collected from the deepest periodontal pocket of an individual at a particular time point, which we term the MPD, and a higher overall PD of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences in the sample (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation; rho = 0.27, P = 0.01). While the correlation with MPD was strong, there was no significant correlation between 16S rRNA PD and pocket depth (rho = 0.1, P = 0.32). The per-sample diversity of MS1 metabolite features was also assessed in relationship to MPD. Since ecological alpha diversity estimates (e.g., Faith\u2019s PD and Chao1) assume the presence of distinct, independent species-like units that have the same ancestry, such measures appeared to be inappropriate for investigating the diversity or complexity of metabolic features from MS data. Instead, we calculated the mean and median numbers of metabolic features of the pockets in an individual at a particular time point and determined whether these were correlated with MPD. Both the mean (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation; rho = 0.21, P = 0.0001) and median (rho = 0.22, P = 0.007) numbers of metabolites were strongly correlated with MPD. The correlations of mean and median numbers of metabolites with pocket depth were also significant, but the correlations were not as strong (mean, rho = 0.15; P = 0.05; median, rho = 0.21, P = 0.008).",

To minimize the total number of comparisons evaluated, we performed correlations of only the 20 most abundant taxa, pathways, or features in each data set. Table\u00a03 summarized the results; for the full set of results for all of the data sets, see Table\u00a0S4. The majority of the 16S rRNA OTU clusters were identifiable to the genus level, with a few exceptions that were only classified at the family or order level. Most of the metagenomic taxa were classifiable to the species level with MetaPhlAn2, but several were only classifiable to the family or order level. In contrast, we were unable to classify any of the metabolic features with the network pattern matching when using the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) reference database.

Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences found that only the genus Desulfovibrio remained among the 20 most abundant taxa. In addition to a number of uncultivated genera, Butyrivibrio, Methanobrevibacter, Pedobacter, Peptococcus, and Filifactor were significantly positively correlated with MPD, while Streptococcus, Aerococcus, and Slackia became more abundant and were negatively correlated with MPD (Table\u00a0S4). The posttreatment metagenomic data set was dominated by unclassified Selenomonas spp. and Prevotella and Dialister spp., which were all negatively correlated with MPD, while Mogibacterium and Eggerthia spp. were positively correlated with MPD.",

Under our definition of stability, greater UniFrac or Bray-Curtis distances between two samples of the same periodontal pocket at different time points indicated greater instability of the microbial community in the pocket. Using this measure, we compared the average community stability of periodontal pockets that improved after treatment with those that did not improve. A periodontal pocket was considered \u201cimproved\u201d if the pocket depth measurement became smaller after treatment (shallower) and \u201cnot improved\u201d if it stayed the same or increased (deeper pocket). Our analysis of instability based on the 16S rRNA data found significantly greater CIS in periodontal pockets that did not improve than in pockets that improved, while analysis of the Bray-Curtis distances calculated on the basis of the MS/MS metabolite features found the exact opposite (Fig.\u00a03).",

                    "text": "The etiology of periodontal disease has proven to be especially difficult to disentangle because of both the complexity of the periodontal biofilm community and the high level of individual variability among patients in both bacterial composition and treatment outcomes. Our multi-omics analysis of patients with severe periodontal disease provided deep and nuanced insights into the complex dynamics of this polymicrobial infection. The combination of 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics complemented each other in the analysis of taxonomic diversity. The different data sets concurred on a number of key taxa previously implicated in periodontal disease but also highlighted other microbes that were \u201cmissed\u201d in some data sets. Most surprisingly, however, was the strength of the patterns in the untargeted metabolomic data set. Of the three different data sets, MS diversity and abundance had the strongest associations with disease and pocket depth. Moreover, our time series analysis of the metabolomic features showed that diversity moved in the opposite direction with respect to taxonomic diversity, suggesting that the addition of MS information could add an important new dimension to our understanding of periodontal disease dynamics.",

In other words, the evolutionary biodiversity of the biofilm bacterial communities was generally higher in deeper periodontal pockets, which coincides with the progressive nature of the disease. The mean per-sample abundance of metabolic features (MS1 data) was also strongly correlated with MPD with a much lower P\u00a0value than with the 16S rRNA data (rho = 0.21, P = 0.0001), suggesting that metabolite abundance may be a more sensitive indicator of community status in regard to changes in periodontal disease status.",

These findings run somewhat counter to those of previous studies using 16S rRNA data, which found that \u201chealthy\u201d sites could be distinguished from \u201cdiseased\u201d sites on the bases of beta diversity comparisons. One explanation for this discrepancy could be the difference in classification between our study and previous studies. Many of the patients in our study had extremely deep periodontal pockets, and the healthiest category in our study included patients with periodontal pockets that would have been classified as diseased in those other studies. What was a consistent theme across the studies, however, was the high level of individual variability among patients with the same disease classification or pocket depth in all of the data sets. While having proven useful in other deep-sequencing studies to classify environments, supervised learning methods were not effective at classifying samples on the basis of disease class or MPD (Table\u00a02).",

On the basis of the analysis of the 16S rRNA data, a number of genera containing known oral pathogens were positively correlated with MPD pretreatment (i.e., the abundances tended to be higher as MPD increased), including Porphyromonas, Treponema, and Mycoplasma, while other genera previously associated with a healthier periodontium were negatively correlated, including Haemophilus and Eikenella (Table\u00a03). These results were supported by the shotgun metagenomic data, which found similar positive correlations with multiple Porphyromonas and Treponema species/strains, as well as a number of Tannerella species and several unknown members of the class Spirochaetes (Table\u00a03). Also notable in the analysis of the 16S rRNA data was the high number of relatively rare, poorly studied, or completely unknown bacterial taxa (e.g., SHD-231, TG5, and ML615J-28) that correlated with MPD. Genera such as Desulfovibrio, Acholeplasma, Mogibacterium, and Scardovia have all been identified in the oral cavities of humans or animals and can be found in the HOMID database (27), but their specific roles in periodontal disease are unknown.",

Furthermore, the majority of the most abundant pretreatment MS1 features (16 of 20) were negatively correlated with MPD, but after treatment, the majority (18 of 20) were positively correlated with MPD. These data suggest that the metabolite abundance information may provide a particularly sensitive indicator of periodontal pocket status and biofilm dynamics over time or after disturbance. Furthermore, the switch from negatively correlated to positively correlated associations in the MS1 data was particularly striking and may indicate a fundamental shift in the whole community\u2019s metabolic function.",

A 1.8% match rate is the mean rate of matching for all metabolomic data sets in the GNPS database (28).

Nevertheless, we did find some surprising patterns in the number of features that were unique to samples before treatment as opposed to after treatment (Fig.\u00a02). Around 42.9% of the total of 2,153 features determined by MS2 were found only in samples before or after treatment, with 57.1% of the rest shared. Interestingly, the same pattern was not true of pocket depth (Fig.\u00a0S1). In a previous study of human skin that combined MS/MS and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, Bouslimani et al. (30) found no correlation between bacterial diversity and metabolic features, indicating that many or most of the features detected were not bacterial in origin. In the present study, on the other hand, Mantel tests assessing the correspondence between distance matrices determined a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.103 (P = 0.039; corrected P = 0.101; Table\u00a01). This correlation was nearly as strong as the one between the 16S rRNA genera and shotgun metagenomic taxon distance matrices (Table\u00a01). However, since MPD is also correlated with bacterial alpha diversity, this make it difficult to conclude that the metabolites were of bacterial origin, especially since host-derived metabolites might also be expected to increase in deep infected pockets.",

To test this hypothesis, we performed a CIS analysis that used the UniFrac, Bray-Curtis, or other community distance metrics to determine how much a community changes over time. For example, a large 16S rRNA UniFrac distance between two samples of the same periodontal pocket community indicates a greater change in the overall community composition (more \u201cinstability\u201d) than a small UniFrac distance. Using this test, we found a striking difference in the stability of periodontal pockets that showed improvement versus those did not change or worsened: average CIS values based on the 16S rRNA data were higher for periodontal pocket communities that did not improve than for those that did improve (Fig.\u00a03). Interestingly, a CIS analysis of the metabolomic data showed the exact opposite trend; i.e., average CIS (16S rRNA) values were lower for pockets that did not improve than for those that did improve (Fig.\u00a03).",

Thus, the higher instability of individuals who did not improve could be a reflection of a more easily disrupted homeostasis. Since periodontal disease is a complex polymicrobial infection with many pathogens and individual immune responses to specific pathogens can vary significantly, this may help explain why it has been so difficult to correlate the presence of specific pathogens or even community structures with treatment success in periodontal studies.",

Alternatively, the greater average metabolic instability in periodontal pockets that showed improvement may be attributable to the host rather than the bacterial communities. For metabolites, the unhealthy pockets are probably inflamed and microbes are suppressed by the immune system. Host metabolites might dominate in this scenario, which would probably lead to higher stability. On the other hand, if the microbial community is active, it is probably producing a diverse array of metabolites that change constantly, resulting in lower stability.",

Particularly exciting were the high sensitivity of the MS/MS data to temporal changes in the microbial community and the fact that the shifts in MS features appeared to reflect different processes than the taxonomy-based analyses. This indicates that the MS/MS approach could be a powerful additional tool for studying periodontal disease. To better understand the progression and treatment of periodontal disease, future studies should also include a more direct analysis of the host immune system over time (e.g., blood serum and gingival cytokine analysis), include bacterial transcriptome analysis, and focus more on the origins of the metabolic features. In addition, future studies should also follow a more rigorous time series sampling protocol by sampling the same subgingival pocket from the same tooth regardless of changes in health status. Switching pockets disrupts the ability to follow changes in the biofilm over time and determine the effects of treatment by culture-independent methods. It is also important to note that using a nonconventional treatment may cause less of a disturbance of the biofilm than conventional periodontal treatment. Finally, future studies should attempt to analyze a larger number of individuals, especially by shotgun metagenomic analysis, which has become ever more feasible as the price of sequencing continues to decrease.",

Patients had an average of 27 teeth. Each patient exhibited at least four separate teeth with a pocket depth of \u22656\u00a0mm. The patients were divided into a test group of 17 who received a sodium hypochlorite rinse, and a control group of 17 who received a water rinse (Tx_Ctl column, Table\u00a0S1). This treatment has been described elsewhere in detail (25, 32). All study patients received a comprehensive clinical examination at the baseline (visit 1), at day 14 (visit 2), and at month 3 (visit 3). No scaling was performed before or during the study, and the patients did not use a chlorhexidine rinse. Microbiological samples from 3- to 12-mm-deep periodontal pockets and from supragingival sites were obtained of each study patient at all three study visits (Table\u00a0S1). For deep periodontal pocket sampling, three teeth were sampled per patient per time point with a sterile Gracey curette per sampled tooth. Samples from individual teeth were analyzed separately. In a few patients, where the previous diseased sample sites became minimally diseased or healthy after therapy (25), other deep pockets in the same dentition were then sampled. For the supragingival sampling, one sample pooled from three teeth with the heaviest plaque accumulation was collected per patient per time point with a sterile periodontal curette. After sampling, the paper points were stored in 200\u00a0\u00b5l of 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline solution and frozen immediately at \u221280\u00baC at USC. Samples were shipped on dry ice to San Diego State University and stored at \u221280\u00baC until they could be processed. Clorox regular bleach (The Clorox Company, Oakland, CA) diluted with tap water served as the source of 0.25% sodium hypochlorite. Participants were asked to rinse their mouths twice weekly for 30\u00a0s with either 15\u00a0ml of a fresh solution of 0.25% sodium hypochlorite or 15\u00a0ml of water. Participants were also instructed in conventional oral hygiene, but they received no subgingival or supragingival scaling prior to the study. This study was approved by the USC Health Sciences Campus Institutional Review Board (no. HS-10-00509). All patients understood and signed informed-consent forms and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act documents before enrolling in this study.",

This was not always possible because the same teeth and pockets were not always sampled at different time points because of the protocol. There were 352,668,299 reads before filtering, and 164,498,456 reads were left after human sequences were removed (53% human contamination). The remaining bacterial reads were analyzed with the HUMAnN2 pipeline (41) to investigate microbial pathways. The metagenomes were also run through MetaPhlAn2 (42) to identify species-level taxonomic assignment in the samples. MetaPhlAn2 uses Bowtie2 (43) to align reads.

From that value, the MS1 abundance of each molecule was extracted (feature detection shown by parent mass and retention time), and these data were used for all of the statistical analyses in this study (e.g., correlation analyses, supervised learning, and Mantel tests). The MS2 results generated during data-dependent acquisition were used to create molecular networks and Venn diagrams. Molecular networks were created by using the GNPS database online workflow at http://gnps.ucsd.edu, and the data set was used to search various MS/MS libraries available in the GNPS database by using the same workflow. The data set is publically available at the online MassIVE repository of the GNPS database under MassIVE ID number MSV000078894.
