Consequently, dysbiosis of microbiota in dental plaques can cause the oral diseases of periodontitis and caries (3). Additionally, oral dysbiosis has been associated with systemic cancers, including head and neck cancer (4), pancreatic cancer (5), and esophageal cancer (6). While the importance of the oral microbiome in human health is becoming increasingly clear, little is known regarding factors that influence oral microbiome composition. The human oral microbiota comes into direct contact with orally ingested dietary factors, undoubtedly contributing to food metabolic pathways (7); at the same time, dietary exposures lead to ecological adaptation and selection of the microbial community (7).",

Reports from large cohort studies indicate a robust inverse association of coffee consumption with total mortality and cause-specific mortality from cancer (10-12). Similar findings have been reported for tea consumption (13-15), though effects may differ for green vs. black tea (14). Coffee and tea have also been inversely associated with head and neck cancer risk (16-18), while tea may also prevent dental caries, periodontitis, and tooth loss (19-21). Both coffee and tea are complex mixtures containing many biologically active compounds, including caffeine and polyphenols, which may have antioxidant, anti-mutagenic, anti-proliferative, and/or anti-inflammatory effects (22-24); a wide variety of mechanisms may contribute to disease protection at different systemic sites.",

Finally, we stratified by smoking status (never, former, or current smoker) as those with highest coffee intake were more likely to smoke, and smoking is known to influence the oral microbiome; however, associations of coffee intake with diversity and overall composition were similar among never, former, and current smokers (Supplementary Table 5).",

More specifically, increased tea intake was associated with higher oral microbiota diversity, and altered abundance of several taxonomic groups, including lower abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae, Bergeyella, Lactobacillales, and Kingella oralis, and higher abundance of Fusobacteriales, Clostridiales, and Shuttleworthia satelles. Findings were generally more apparent for regular tea intake than decaffeinated tea intake, perhaps because regular tea was more commonly consumed in this study population. Additionally, significant findings were often restricted to those drinking 1 or more cups of tea per day compared to no consumption, indicating that occasional tea drinking may not impact the oral microbiome. As only 22% of participants reported drinking 1 or more cups of tea per day, power was limited for these tea drinking categories, further underlining the strength of the significant findings.",

Green tea polyphenolic catechins, including epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate, possess moderate antimicrobial activity and can inhibit the growth and adherence of a wide range of bacteria (40,41). Black tea, the fermented form of green tea, contains these catechins at lower concentrations, in addition to containing oxidation products (e.g. theaflavins) not found in green tea (40). Roasted coffee \u03b1-dicarbonyl compounds (42) and melanoidins (43) may result in antimicrobial activity of brewed coffee. Caffeine is present in both coffee and tea, and may also contribute to antibacterial activity (42).",

Though we did not observe significant associations of tea intakes with known cariogenic or periodontal pathogens (i.e. Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis), tea drinking was associated with significantly greater diversity and altered composition of the oral microbiota. Greater diversity of a microbial community is generally thought to be beneficial, as it bestows functional versatility on the community and indicates non-dominance by pathogenic bacteria. Specifically in regards to the oral microbiota, oral disease states (caries, periodontal disease) have been associated with reduced oral microbiome diversity (44,45), suggesting that tea promotes a healthy oral microbiome. Only a few studies have examined the relationship between tea intake and oral microbiota in humans. Similar to our findings, a study of 21 healthy adults in Austria found that the oral gingival microbiota composition was significantly associated with tea consumption, but not coffee (27); however, that study did not present results on the associations of tea with oral microbiome diversity or specific taxa. Another study of 93 subjects in Italy observed that tea drinkers had lower counts of total bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus in saliva samples than non-drinkers (26). Similarly, we observed that higher tea intakes were associated with lower abundance of the order Lactobacillales, though not its genus Lactobacillus, which is more specifically related to dental caries (46). In our study, tea intake was associated with a greatest increase in abundance of the species Shuttleworthia satelles. This bacterium was first isolated from the human oral cavity in 2002 and described as obligately anaerobic and saccharolytic (i.e. carrying out sugar fermentation) (47). While little is known regarding the role of S. satelles in human health, one study showed higher abundance of S. satelles in the saliva of caries-free compared to caries-affected 11\u201312 year old children (48), suggesting its association with improved oral health.",

We did not observe associations of coffee intake and overall oral microbiome diversity or composition in our study, even after exclusion of participants adding sugar to their coffee (though this sensitivity analysis was limited by small sample size). This result is inconsistent with two Italian studies, one (n=93) reporting that coffee was associated with lower counts of total bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus in saliva (26), and the other (n=75) reporting that coffee was associated with reduced oral microbiome diversity and altered composition (25). The study of 21 healthy adults in Austria previously mentioned reported no association between coffee intake and overall oral microbiome composition, consistent with our findings. Though many factors can contribute to inconsistencies among studies, including different sample types and laboratory methodologies, it should also be noted that Mediterranean populations (e.g. Italy) prepare coffee differently than North American and Northern European populations; this could also contribute to differences in results between our studies (52).",

Our study also has several limitations. The cross-sectional design does not allow us to infer causality of associations, though reverse causation is unlikely in the case of a dietary exposure. We did not have information on the oral health status of the study participants, which may be an important confounder in our analysis. Residual confounding may also contribute to our findings, as tea drinking may be associated with other diet and socioeconomic factors which could also influence oral microbiota. Measurement error inherent in FFQs (53) may lead to misclassification of coffee and tea drinking level, though coffee and tea are among the best of the dietary exposures that can be assessed by FFQs (54,55). We lacked information on type of tea (green or black) and whether tea was drunk iced or hot. Green tea contains higher levels of antimicrobial catechins than black tea (40), while hot or cold beverages transiently change oral temperature (56); these distinctions may lead to different effects on the oral microbiota and thus on oral health. Finally, as our study population was mostly white, results may not be generalizable to other racial or ethnic groups.",

These findings are consistent with a potential beneficial effect of tea on oral diseases, but, as our study was cross-sectional, future studies are required to determine whether these oral microbiome changes contribute to oral and other diseases. Tea and coffee have both been associated with reduced risk for head and neck cancer (16-18), a cancer type with possibly bacterial etiology (57,58). Though beyond the scope of the current study, further research may elucidate whether tea-driven changes to the oral microbiome contribute to tea\u2019s chemopreventive action. Additionally, studies are needed to confirm our findings, particularly due to inconsistencies observed between the two cohorts in our analysis, CPS-II and PLCO. As the oral microbiota are vital players in oral and systemic health, it will be important to further analyze how common drinking habits influence this dynamic ecosystem.",
