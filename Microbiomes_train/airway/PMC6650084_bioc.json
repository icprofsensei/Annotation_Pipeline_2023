Three subjects (20%) were current tobacco users and 2 subjects (13%) used inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Subjects had a mean of 49.1 pack-years of tobacco exposure. Bacterial biomass was associated with anatomic site, but no differences in biomass were observed with age, FEV1 percent predicted (FEV1pp), ICS use, smoking status, or edentulous state. Shannon index was associated with site (lower nasal diversity than oral and sputum diversity, p<0.001), but not age, ICS use, FEV1pp, tobacco use, or edentulous state. \u03b2-diversity was illustrated by principal coordinate analysis using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and PERMANOVA analyses, showing sample clustering by anatomic site (p = 0.001) with nasal samples forming a cluster separate from the combined oral wash samples and sputum samples. Clustering was also observed with ICS use (p = 0.029) and edentulous state (p = 0.019), while FEV1pp and current tobacco use were not significant. In an amplicon sequencing variant (ASV)-level analysis of oral samples using a linear regression model with Benjamini-Hochberg correction at an FDR<0.10, 10 ASVs were associated with age while no ASVs were associated with FEV1pp or smoking status. Sputum sample analysis demonstrated that 51 ASVs (25 unique genera) were associated with age, 61 ASVs (32 genera) were associated with FEV1pp, and no ASVs were associated with smoking status. In a combined dataset, the frequent exacerbator phenotype, rather than ICS use, was associated with decreased sputum Shannon diversity.",

To compare 16S rRNA copy numbers, a generalized estimating equation with an exchangeable correlation structure was used with anatomic site as a predictor and patient as a random effect. Pairwise t-tests with Holm correction were used to compare 16S copies between anatomic sites. Additional clinical factors were added to the model individually. Alpha diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson diversity) were evaluated by site using linear mixed models with diversity as a response, site as predictor, and patient as a random effect. Paired t-tests with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment were used to compare sites. Permutation tests with estimates from linear models were performed to evaluate clinical predictors. Alpha diversity was the response, with site, age, FEV1pp, current tobacco use, and edentulous state as predictors. Oral wash samples were combined and p-values were FDR adjusted for the number of covariates. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the hclust function and Euclidean distance metric after filtering the dataset as described above. \u03b2-diversity analyses were conducted using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and PERMANOVA analyses with default parameters. Mean within- and between-subject similarity was compared using permutation tests for the 6 possible comparisons between the 4 sample sites. The mean Bray-Curtis within-subject dissimilarity for each of the 6 comparisons was calculated. To calculate p-values for within- vs. between-subject comparisons, we used permutation tests to estimate the mean between-subject dissimilarity for each pair of samples. Similarly, to compare oral samples with the sputum samples, we calculated the mean within-subject Bray-Curtis dissimilarities for sputum samples and oral wash 1 as well as sputum samples and oral wash 2. The Wilcoxon signed rank permutation test was used to test the null hypothesis of no significant difference between sputum-oral wash 1 similarity and sputum-oral wash 2 similarity within patients. Clinical factors associated with ASV abundance were determined separately for oral wash and sputum samples. To determine sputum ASVs associated with clinical factors, we fit a linear regression model with log(reads+1) as the response and age, FEV1pp, and smoking status as explanatory variables. To determine oral wash ASVs associated with clinical factors, we fit linear mixed effects regression models with patient as random effect, log(reads+1) as the response, and age, FEV1pp, and smoking status as explanatory variables. For both sites, each clinical variable was fit individually and p-values were adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg. After combining the present study dataset with our exacerbation phenotype dataset, we used a linear mixed model with alpha diversity (Shannon index) as a response, patient as a random effect and phenotype and clinical factors as fixed effects. Clinical factors were evaluated individually unless otherwise stated and p-values were determined with permutation tests. All permutation tests employed 1,000 permutations. All analyses were performed in R version 3.4.2.",

We estimated the mean between-subject dissimilarity for each pair of samples. We tested the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between within- and between-subject Bray-Curtis dissimilarity for each of the 6 sample pairs. For all sample pairs, the within-subject similarity was greater than the between subject similarity. Despite the disparate anatomic sites, the 14\u201320 hour separation between oral samples, and the overnight fast prior to oral wash 2 sampling, subject-specific features of the microbiota drive significant within-subject sample similarity. It is also apparent, by reviewing the mean within-subject dissimilarities in column 2, that the two most similar sites on beta diversity analysis are oral wash 1-oral wash 2, followed closely by oral wash 1-sputum and oral wash 2-sputum. The sputum-nasal and both oral wash-nasal pairs are much less similar in \u03b2-diversity.",

It is clear that there is significantly greater within-subject than between-subject similarity regardless of which oral wash sample is considered (Fig 7). To determine if OW1 samples (obtained just prior to sputum sampling) are more similar to sputum samples than OW2 samples (obtained the following morning after fasting) are similar to sputum samples, we calculated the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between each subject\u2019s sputum samples and OW1 samples and each subject\u2019s sputum samples and OW2 samples. We tested the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between median sputum-OW1 similarity and sputum-OW 2 Bray-Curtis dissimilarity within patients. The median within-subject Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between OW1 and sputum samples was 0.302 and the median dissimilarity between OW2 and sputum samples was 0.309. The p-value for this test was 0.99, consistent with the finding that both oral wash samples are very similar to the sputum samples.",

To evaluate the relationship between individual clinical predictors and Shannon diversity, we used linear mixed models. When exacerbation phenotype was included in the model, site (oral vs. sputum) was significant (p = 0.008), while exacerbation phenotype was not significant. Individual inclusion of ICS use, age, and FEV1pp with exacerbation phenotype resulted in significant effects for phenotype in each model, but non-significant effects for ICS use, age and FEV1pp. Because the effects of ICS use may differ based upon exacerbation phenotype or site sampled (oral vs. sputum), models individually examining ICS use:phenotype and ICS use:site interactions were performed. These models demonstrated that when phenotype, ICS use, and phenotype:ICS use interactions were included, all factors were non-significant. When phenotype, ICS use, site, and ICS use:site interactions were included, only phenotype was significant (p = 0.024). These results suggest that exacerbation phenotype, rather than ICS use, is more closely associated with changes in \u03b1-diversity.",

Most of the taxa identified in these analyses were common oral or sputum taxa (Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, Moraxella, Prevotella, Rothia, Streptococcus, Veillonella). In instances where associations between multiple ASVs from the same genus (such as Streptococcus or Prevotella) were identified, there was not always uniformity in the direction of the change in abundance. For instance, most sputum ASVs mapping to Streptococcus and Prevotella increased in association with increasing age and decreased in association with less severe obstruction. However, one or two ASVs mapping to these two genera demonstrated the opposite correlations. This illustrates both the breadth and complexity of the Streptococci as well as the role that speciation or whole-genome sequencing may play in understanding the complex relationship between the microbiota and the immune system.",

Caution must be taken in interpreting these analyses, as ICS use was closely tied to study population and, to a lesser extent, exacerbation phenotype. Furthermore, the patient populations demonstrated differences in lung function, as shown in Table 6. Our combined analysis of both oral wash and sputum alpha diversity took both patient effects and exacerbation phenotype effects into account. The effect of exacerbation frequency was significant when ICS use was taken into account, but ICS use was not a significant predictor of alpha diversity when phenotype, anatomic site, or their interactions with ICS use were considered. Exacerbation phenotype, rather than ICS use, appears to be associated with changes in alpha diversity. These findings should be interpreted cautiously, however, as other clinical factors that are associated with exacerbation phenotype and ICS use (such as age or obstruction severity) could be responsible for the decreased alpha diversity instead.",

None of the other subjects\u2019 samples processed alongside these 4 samples exhibited similar clustering or very low alpha diversity. All samples were sequenced in the same MiSeq lane. Once we ensured that these findings were due to the biological nature of the samples, rather processing or sequencing effects, we considered possible clinical associations. This subject was not only the only woman in our dataset, but also the only subject who was diagnosed with multiple lung tumors simultaneously (two independent adenocarcinomas and a squamous cell carcinoma).

We showed that the oral microbiota is sufficiently stable over ~24 hours and following an overnight fast to maintain significant within-subject similarity. By combining two datasets, we were able to evaluate potential associations between ICS use and the sputum microbiota\u2014of significant clinical interest given the widespread use of ICS to treat COPD and recent changes to the GOLD guidelines on the use of ICS in this patient population. Our study also had several weaknesses. Our patients\u2019 lung tumors may have altered their oral and lung microbiota, restricting the generalizability of our findings. We were likely underpowered to detect some associations. One of our subjects did not meet lung function criteria for COPD. Despite analyzing FEV1pp as a continuous variable, inclusion of this subject with a FEV1/FVC ratio \u2265 0.70 may have impacted our conclusions. Furthermore, any correlations identified in this study should not be assumed to play a causative role; interventional randomized studies are necessary to address causation. In particular, our analysis of ICS use and exacerbation phenotype should be interpreted cautiously given the number of other colinear predictors (study population, age, obstruction severity, etc.) that may be driving the association observed here. Nevertheless, our data support the observation that several clinical factors in addition to disease severity are associated with oral and sputum microbiota changes.",
