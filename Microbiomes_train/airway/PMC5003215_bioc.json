Analysis of the respiratory microbiome was initially hindered by the belief that the healthy lung is sterile.

Because pulmonary complications remain a major cause of morbidity in subjects infected with HIV even in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (6), the fundamental question raised by the LHMP was whether HIV infection altered the respiratory microbiome. In a recently published consortium paper, the primary finding was that in a large healthy HIV cohort (median CD4 count in treatment-naive subjects, 668 cells/mm3; in subjects on HAART, 618 cells/mm3), the respiratory microbiome measured in whole bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was indistinguishable between an HIV-infected and uninfected population (7). To further address whether subjects infected with HIV with more advanced disease had a respiratory microbiome that differed from uninfected subjects and to determine the effect of HAART on the respiratory microbiome, we took advantage of a cohort of subjects infected with HIV who were studied with BAL before and up to 3 years after starting HAART. We found that treatment-naive subjects infected with HIV with lower CD4 counts have a respiratory microbiome that differs significantly from uninfected subjects. Furthermore, we show that HAART induces significant changes in the respiratory microbiome, although it remains different from uninfected control subjects even up to 3 years after starting therapy.",

High-quality 16S sequences from each sample were classified using the RDP Classifier (version 2.5) (11) with the default cutoff value of 0.8 from phylum to genus level. Species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were produced by Mothur and BLASTed (12) against the RDP 162 database release 11.4 (13). Top BLAST hits were used as species-level annotations if the BLAST alignment achieved greater than or equal to 95% coverage and greater than or equal to 98% sequence identity.

Differences in the abundance of specific genera between groups (i.e., uninfected vs. untreated, uninfected vs. 1-yr treated, and uninfected vs. 3-yr treated) were analyzed using negative binomial regression models. Alpha diversity richness was measured using Chao 1 and abundance-based coverage estimators (ACE) indices, and diversity evenness was assessed using the Shannon diversity index and Simpson\u2019s index of diversity (1-D) (16). Alpha diversity between uninfected and infected groups was compared using linear regression models. Alpha diversity between untreated and treated groups was compared using mixed linear regression models (i.e., subject as random effect) by taking the correlations among the longitudinal data from the same subject into consideration. Beta diversity was visualized using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (17) and analyzed by measuring Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (18, 19) and UniFrac distances (20, 21). The PERMANOVA test was used to compare UniFrac distances or Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (22, 23) between various populations. Multivariate dispersion of groups was compared using the betadisper command in R vegan package (24, 25). Principal coordinates analysis (26) was performed at http://unifrac.colorado.edu. Benjamini-Hochberg corrections were used to adjust for multiple testing. The Methods section in the online supplement provides statistical details.",

All 30 subjects had a minimum follow-up of 1 year on HAART, and 12 subjects had 3 years of follow-up. HIV infection was advanced at baseline as evident by a median CD4 count of 280 cells/mm3 and a median viral load of 76,556 copies/ml. Antiretroviral treatment was effective as evidenced by a rapid and sustained drop in viral load and improved CD4 counts over the course of the study, although CD4 counts still remained well below those in the LHMP consortium paper (7). Importantly, although the HIV cohort was from a prospective cohort to identify IRIS in subjects infected with HIV starting antiretroviral therapy, none of the subjects had clinically significant IRIS events at the time of study. Furthermore, despite the increased incidence of smoking in the HIV population, spirometry was normal in this group (see Table E1 in the online supplement). As a result, no subject was on inhaled steroids and only 3 of the 30 subjects were on inhaled albuterol.",

Similar results were obtained when analyzing population beta diversity at the genera level using Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity (see Figure E3). Interestingly, when dispersion of the two communities was analyzed, the untreated population infected with HIV was significantly more spread out compared with the normal population (average weighted UniFrac distance to centroid at the OTU level: 0.167 for the uninfected group, 0.204 for the untreated HIV-infected group; P\u2009=\u20090.041).

However, UniFrac distances between uninfected subjects and subjects infected with HIV treated for 1 year were significantly less than distances between uninfected subjects and untreated subjects infected with HIV (P\u2009=\u20090.012) (see Figure E5), suggesting after 1 year of treatment HIV BAL contained more taxa similar to uninfected control subjects. Furthermore, principal coordinates analysis using weighted and normalized UniFrac distance showed beta diversity within the population infected with HIV decreased with time on HAART (Figures 4A\u20134D), suggesting the population was becoming more uniform over time. This was confirmed by dispersion analysis using weighted UniFrac distance (Figure 4E), showing that the population spread in subjects infected with HIV after 1 year of HAART was significantly less than in the untreated population (average distance to centroid: 0.157 for the 1-yr treated group, 0.204 for the untreated group; P\u2009=\u20090.005) and was no longer significantly different from uninfected control subjects (average distance to centroid: 0.167 for the uninfected group, 0.157 for the 1-yr treated group; P\u2009=\u20090.48).

The top 15 most abundant genera after 1 year of treatment are shown in Table E3. Streptococcus remained more abundant in the HIV population and Flavobacterium remained more abundant in the control population. Interestingly, after 1 year of HAART BAL from the HIV group now contained a greater amount of Veillonella and Prevotella compared with uninfected BAL. By 3 years after starting HAART the differences in the abundance of Streptococcus and Flavobacterium were much less compared with previous time points (P\u2009=\u20090.03 for Streptococcus and P\u2009=\u20090.04 for Flavobacterium). Furthermore, at this time point differences in abundance of Veillonella and Prevotella were no longer statistically different between the two groups. However, 3-year data should be viewed cautiously because they are based on only nine subjects infected with HIV from the original cohort.",

These differences improve with time on HAART, but still have not returned to normal up to 3 years after starting therapy, at a time when the peripheral blood CD4 count has improved but is still significantly below normal. Population dispersion in the untreated group infected with HIV is significantly greater than in the uninfected cohort, but declines with treatment. We further identify differences in relative bacterial abundances in HIV-infected BAL compared with uninfected BAL both in untreated subjects and those who have been on HAART for 1 year. Finally, after 1 year on HAART, HIV BAL contains an increased abundance of Prevotella and Veillonella, bacteria previously associated with lung inflammation (28).",

This finding was unexpected given the high incidence of pulmonary complications in this population. Our results demonstrate that subjects infected with HIV with more advanced disease have a significantly different respiratory microbiome when compared with uninfected subjects and that differences decrease with time on HAART. Taken together, these two reports suggest that in healthy subjects infected with HIV, even those who have low CD4 counts before starting antiretroviral therapy, it is possible to attain a more normal-appearing lung microbiome as assessed by various diversity indices and the presence of signature bacteria. Our findings and those of the consortium further support the evolving practice of starting patients infected with HIV on antiretroviral therapy at earlier time points to try and prevent more severe immunologic and inflammatory perturbations and limit HIV-related complications (29, 30).",

Despite differences in the cohorts, some interesting similar results were seen. First, Prevotella was one of the shared taxa identified in the entire Ugandan population, and Prevotella was the most significant contributor to the bacteria found in our patients infected with HIV after 1 year of HAART. Second, both the Ugandan and U.S. cohort demonstrated a large amount of beta diversity within the population suggesting it was not unusual for different specific bacteria to dominate the lung microbiome in individual subjects infected with HIV. In fact, we speculate that the large beta diversity in an untreated population infected with HIV makes comparisons of specific bacterial abundances between this group and an uninfected population problematic. This could explain why after 1 year of treatment, at a time when beta diversity has declined and the population infected with HIV has become more uniform, greater number of different bacterial abundances are now found between the HIV-infected and uninfected population comparison.",

Furthermore, these investigators demonstrate this pneumotype is associated with markers of lung inflammation. Numerous studies have demonstrated persistence of chronic lung inflammation even in subjects infected with HIV on HAART (32\u201334). It is tempting to speculate that this chronic inflammation may contribute to lung complications seen in the HAART era, which have moved away from classic opportunistic infections toward more chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and lung cancer (35). It is important to determine if similar correlations between the lung microbiome and markers of inflammation exist in these cohorts.",

The literature is mixed with some reports using acellular BAL (28), whereas others use whole BAL (2). Dickson and colleagues (36) have shown that analysis of whole and acellular BAL microbiomes yields different results. We also found that analysis of acellular and whole BAL yields different results (9). Furthermore, we found that acellular BAL is more distinct from oral wash (the presumed major source of upper airway contamination when obtaining BAL using bronchoscopic techniqes) compared with whole BAL, which we speculate is because of the pulling down of larger upper airway biofilms and bacterial clumps during the cell separation process (9). Because analysis of acellular BAL contains fewer bacteria shared with the upper airway, it may more closely represent true unique lung organisms. However, the loss of potential cell-associated bacteria during this process is an important consideration when viewing our results in the context of other published data.",

The importance of upper airway and environmental controls when trying to define a unique lower respiratory microbiome has been emphasized (37). Because the HIV-infected cohort came from a prior prospective study, environmental and upper airway controls were not available. Nevertheless, the longitudinal nature of this cohort strongly suggests that the changes observed over time are significant. Furthermore, our uninfected volunteer population did have oral wash and environmental controls. As previously described (4), we saw clear separation between BAL and oral wash samples in the uninfected population (see Figure E6). Furthermore, environmental controls demonstrated that preprocedure bronchoscopic washes, an appropriate control for environmental contamination (37), were completely different from lung and oral specimens (see Figure E6). Finally, we had fewer subjects who participated in research BAL at 3 years after initiation of HAART, limiting conclusions that can be drawn at this time point.",

In contrast to subjects infected with HIV with preserved CD4 counts, those with lower CD4 cell counts have an altered alveolar microbiome characterized by a loss of richness and diversity within individuals, but an increase in differences between subjects. These differences decrease with time on HAART, but have not returned to normal up to 3 years after starting treatment, when CD4 counts have improved but still remain lower than normal. Finally, the alveolar microbiome in subjects infected with HIV contain increased amounts of some signature bacteria even after 1 year of HAART, some of which have been previously associated with chronic lung inflammation. Future studies need to link lung microbiome alterations in HIV infection with pulmonary immunologic and inflammatory perturbations as potential mechanisms to explain the changing spectrum of pulmonary complications in patients living with HIV.",
