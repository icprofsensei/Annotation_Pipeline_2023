Elderly adults had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes (p = 0.035) and lower relative abundance of Proteobacteria (p = 0.014), including specific genera Haemophilus (p = 0.024) and Lautropia (p = 0.020) which were enriched in the younger adults. Alpha diversity was comparable between young and elderly pairs (p>0.05) but was inversely associated with lung function (FEV1%Predicted and FVC %Predicted) in the young (p = 0.006 and p = 0.003) though not the elderly (p = 0.481 and p = 0.696). Conversely, alpha diversity was negatively associated with PWV in the elderly (p = 0.01) but not the young (p = 0.569). Specifically, phylum Firmicutes including the genus Gemella were correlated with lung function (FVC %Predicted) in the young group (p = 0.047 and p = 0.040), while Fusobacteria and Leptotrichia were associated with arterial stiffness (PWV) in the elderly (both p = 0.004).",

During ageing, subclinical lung function decline [3, 4], vascular endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening occur in the healthy population [5\u20137]. In older individuals above age 40 [8], parameters of lung function are inversely associated with arterial stiffness parameters, even after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, smoking history and lung disease [9, 10]. Reduced pulmonary function is independently associated with precursors for CVD including arterial stiffness, regardless of age, sex or anthropometry [8\u201312] and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [13]. Pulmonary function also predicts the development of atherosclerotic plaques and is a strong risk factor for arterial stiffness, suggesting a causal relationship between the decline in lung function and arterial stiffness [11, 12, 14].",

Lower microbiome diversity and the presence of specific microbial taxa are associated with decreased lung function in pathogenic disease states [19, 20]. In healthy individuals, the lung microbiome comprises a community of low density and transiently present microorganisms, whereas pathogenic organisms predominate in disease [21\u201323]. While the effects of ageing on the lung microbiome remain to be established, the gut microbiome has been found to influence healthy ageing through alteration of inflammatory markers, diet and immune response [24\u201326]. Furthermore, age-associated alterations in immune function may affect the microbiome (or vice versa), generating low-grade inflammation, a key contributor to arterial stiffness and declining lung function [27]. An emerging question is whether the observed immunopathological associations between gut microbiota and disease also hold true at other anatomical sites such as the lung, where the microbiome may underpin age-associated changes in lung function with a consequent impact on arterial stiffness.",

The participants rested quietly in a supine position at room temperature for 15 min before measurements of arterial pulse pressure waveforms, by an inflated cuff at the brachial artery. SphygmoCor system calculates the central aortic augmentation pressure (AP) by subtracting the pressure at the first systole resulting from the return of the reflected wave from the systolic pressure. The AIx was calculated as the ratio of AP to pulse pressure [33]. PWV was measured simultaneously with pressure transducers, by acquiring a carotid pulse by applanation tonometry and a femoral pulse by volumetric displacement, within a cuff around the upper thigh (femoral artery) [34, 35]. The pulse waves were captured electronically on a computer using the SphygmoCor system and accepted by the system after consistent high-quality waveforms were measured.

Compared with younger adults, older adults had 41% or 1.4 L lower FEV1, 33% or 1.3 L lower FVC and 7% lower percentage of FEV1/FVC. However, adjusted FEV1 (%Predicted) and FVC (%Predicted) were comparable between younger and older adults (p = 0.063 and p = 0.361) suggesting lower lung function values were reflective of natural lung function decline in our healthy elderly cohort. The percentage of predicted value for FEV1/FVC percentage in younger and older family pairs was comparable (p = 0.157), and the values were all within healthy ranges [39]. Compared with younger adults, older adults had increased arterial stiffness, indicated by PWV and AIx (all p < 0.001). In both younger and older adults, arterial stiffness indicated by PWV and AIx were also within healthy ranges [35], and were 1.3-fold and 3.9-fold higher in older than in younger adults respectively (Table 1). Lung function was inversely associated with arterial stiffness. However, when age was adjusted for, in a partial correlation model, the associations between FEV1, FVC and percentage FEV1/FVC, with arterial stiffness parameters AIx and PWV were not significant (S1 Table).",

However, sputum samples, which are commonly used to represent the lung microbiome, exhibited subtle differences in specific taxa including higher relative abundance of Granulicatella (4.3% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.031), lower relative abundance of Leptotrichia (0.8% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.013) and lower relative abundance of Corynebacterium (0.7% vs. 0.1%, p = 0.031) (S1 Fig).",

Here, the measured Bray Curtis distance of matched young-elderly pairs was lower (equating to more similar microbiome profiles) when compared to the average distance between all other possible un-matched young-elderly comparisons (p = 0.036) (Fig 1C and 1D). Paired analysis showed that older adults generally had higher relative abundance of Firmicutes (47.4% vs 43.9%, p = 0.035) and lower Proteobacteria (13.9% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.014) with lower average relative abundance of Proteobacteria including Haemophilus (2.0% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.024) and Lautropia (0.5% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.020) (Fig 2). No significant differences in alpha diversity measures were observed between young and elderly groups (S2 Fig).

Although several studies have investigated the airway microbiome in the context of respiratory disease, the present study is the first to explore age-associated differences in lung microbiome composition, with specific focus on healthy individuals of Asian origin. Our findings demonstrate remarkable consistency between young and elderly healthy microbiome profiles while identifying subtle taxonomic differences related to lung function and arterial stiffness in an age-dependent manner. These include associations between the lung microbiome and lung function (FEV1%Predicted and FVC %Predicted) in the younger adults, and arterial stiffness (PWV) in the elderly, suggesting that these relationships have greater relevance at different stages of life.",

Here, we have explored the effects of ageing on microbial constituents of the healthy airway microbiome by employing a paired genetic matching strategy, which controls the confounding influence of host genetics. Among patients with chronic respiratory disease such as COPD, overrepresentation of the Proteobacteria and reduction of Firmicute abundance is observed [44\u201347]. Enrichment of specific Proteobacteria including Haemophilus in the sputum microbiome of patients with COPD [48], and Lautropia in cystic fibrosis patients represent examples of disease-associated dysbiosis [46, 49]. In our healthy participants, however, the overall representation of phylum Proteobacteria (16%) was much lower than in disease states (~44%) [44]. Likewise, the average Firmicutes representation in our study (46%) was higher compared to diseased states (~16%) [44]. It is plausible that \u2018healthy\u2019 ageing of the lungs promotes enrichment of the Firmicutes and reduced relative abundance of Proteobacteria such as Haemophilus and Lautropia, which contrasted with the dysbiosis associated with chronic respiratory diseases.",

Microbial diversity thus negatively correlated with lung function in our study, which contrasted with respiratory disease states where positive correlation is generally observed [50, 51]. At the phylum level, overall Firmicutes abundance positively associated with lung function (FVC %Predicted) in the younger adults in this study. This suggests enrichment of the Firmicutes has a beneficial effect on lung function and might explain the negative correlation between lung function and SDI. The increased Firmicute abundance, or that of other beneficial microbiome, could drive a corresponding reduction in SDI. Observed association between Gemella (a Firmicute linked to pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis patients) is also associated with reduced lung function in our young cohort, further suggesting its potentially negative implications for respiratory health [20, 52]. The positive influence of Firmicute abundance on lung function might be contingent on the presence and abundance of specific genera within this phylum, such as Gemella. The Actinobacteria (in the elderly) the genus Actinomyces (in the young) were associated with increased absolute FVC and decreased FEV1 respectively (Fig 5). However, absolute values of FEV1 and FVC are less robust lung function parameters that do not take into consideration normative physiological lung function decline with age. The association between lung microbiome and lung function parameters (FEV1 and FVC %Predicted) may thus be more relevant and pronounced in the younger group (Fig 5).",

Here, lung microbiome diversity was inversely associated with arterial stiffness parameter PWV (a negative clinical indicator), in the older adults. Reduced microbial diversity in lower airways is linked to inflammatory phenotypes of the airways [53\u201355], which could increase both systemic inflammation and arterial stiffness that occur during ageing [23, 48]. Our findings highlight the relative abundance of Fusobacteria phylum and its genus Leptotrichia in inverse association with arterial stiffness in older adults. The relevance of the Fusobacteria in lung respiratory disease has been noted, where they are associated with beneficial effects [56\u201358]. While associations between particular organisms and lung function occur mainly in the younger group, distinct organisms in the lung are linked to arterial stiffness in the elderly. These results highlight the complexity of the microbial interactions that may underpin age-dependent relationships between lung function and arterial stiffness across different stages of life (Fig 5).",

This study is also unable to directly assess temporal dynamics of the lung microbiome during ageing given the lack of a longitudinal component. While the younger and older participants in this study are family pairs, which minimize genetic influences, we did not control for other confounders such as environmental factors, lifestyle or living conditions, that could have influenced the lung microbiome and represent significant confounders. As targeted bacterial 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was employed, the resolution does not support species-level characterization of the microbiome, which could be important in understanding the ecological and functional interaction with ageing. Though our study was explorative in nature, it provides a first insight into age-dependant variability in the airway microbiome and its potential implications for respiratory and cardiovascular health. We have identified several potential microbial taxa whose clinical relevance should be further explicated in larger studies incorporating longitudinal experimental design to fully delineate the core healthy airway microbiome and the temporal dynamics of beneficial and deleterious taxa that may serve as early prognostic indicators of lung health status.",
