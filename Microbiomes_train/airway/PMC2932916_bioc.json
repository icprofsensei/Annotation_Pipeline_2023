Candidate primers evaluated were from the European rRNA database. To assess the effect of sequence length on accuracy of classification, 16S rRNA genes of various lengths were created by trimming the full length sequences. Sequences spanning various hypervariable regions were selected to simulate the amplicons that would be obtained using possible primer pairs. The sequences were compared with full length 16S rRNA genes for accuracy in taxonomic classification using online software at the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP). The universality of the primer set was evaluated using the RDP 16S rRNA database which is comprised of 433 306 16S rRNA genes, represented by 36 phyla.",

Among 350-nt sequence reads within various regions of the 16S rRNA gene, the reverse read of an amplicon generated using the 343F/798R primers had the least (8.2%) effect on classification. In comparison, truncation to 900 nt mimicking single pass Sanger reads misclassified 5.0% of the 219 sequences. The 343F/798R amplicon accurately assigned 91.8% of the 219 sequences at the species level. Weighted by abundance of the species in the esophageal dataset, the 343F/798R amplicon yielded similar classification accuracy without a significant loss in species coverage (92%). Modification of the 343F/798R primers to 347F/803R increased their universality among foregut species. Assuming that a typical polymerase chain reaction can tolerate 2 mismatches between a primer and a template, the modified 347F and 803R primers should be able to anneal 98% and 99.6% of all 16S rRNA genes in the RDP database.",

The classical method of culturing bacteria from human subjects excludes a large number of unculturable or not-yet-cultivated bacteria, and also misrepresents the abundance of some species due to selection by culture conditions. To overcome these drawbacks, culture-independent methods have been developed. The most commonly used culture-independent method relies on amplification and analysis of the 16S rRNA genes in a microbiome[1]. 16S rRNA genes are widely used for documentation of the evolutionary history and taxonomic assignment of individual organisms[2-6] because they have highly conserved regions for construction of universal primers and highly variable regions for identification of individual species[7]. Analysis of a microbiome is classically performed by amplifying all 16S rRNA genes in a sample, cloning the 16S amplicons into a vector transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli), randomly selecting transformed colonies, producing high copies of the amplicon containing plasmid, purifying the plasmids, and sequencing the 16S rRNA inserts by the Sanger method[8].",

Disadvantages include annealing bias[9], cloning bias[10], as well as time and expenses. The high cost associated with this approach has been prohibitive for in-depth sampling of a complex microbiome. Inadequate sampling overlooks low abundance species. As a result, a low abundance species that could be a microbiome core species often cannot be consistently observed amongst different individuals. For example, a recent 16S rRNA gene survey of the human distal esophageal microbiome yielded 6800 sequences but revealed only one of the 166 species, Streptococcus mitis, shared by all 34 subjects sampled[11].",

One 454 sequencing run can produce 1.2 million sequences in 8 h[12], which would require months or years of work with older methods. Because many sequences are acquired in one run, the unit cost per sequence read is a very small fraction of that for Sanger sequencing. This improvement allows sufficient sampling of a complex microbiome at affordable cost. The new technology also eliminates the cloning bias by directly sequencing the 16S rRNA genes generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Therefore, high throughput sequencing is ideal if adaptable to meet the requirements needed for microbiome work.",

Reads from next generation sequencing technologies are considerably shorter than those from Sanger sequencing. Illumina\u2019s Solexa and Applied Biosystem\u2019s SOLiD platforms generate reads of about 25-100 bases[13,14], while 454 sequencing technology reads up to 400-500 bases per sequence. The general approach to analyzing microbiomes in health and disease focuses at 2 levels. Population level analyses, such as the Fst test, P test, Unifrac analysis, clustering analysis, and normal reference range, relate samples of microbiomes by combined genetic distance between the samples. These types of analyses are relatively insensitive to variation in read length[15]. In Unifrac clustering analysis, reads of 100-200 nucleotides can yield the same clustering as full-length sequences if the correct regions are chosen for sequencing. Detailed analyses at the level of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) depend on read length - the longer the more accurate[16]. Compared with full length sequences, single pass reads of approximate 900 bases (of full length 1500-1600) from Sanger sequencing is associated with a slight loss of classification accuracy, which has been acceptable considering the significant reduction in sequencing cost from sequencing the entire 16S rRNA genes.",

Another is to target certain hypervariable regions (HVR) that are most informative for a specific microbiome of interest.

Our area of focus is the foregut microbiome during disease progression from GERD to esophageal adenocarcinoma (the fastest increasing cancer in the Western world). As the first step of the foregut microbiome project, we identified the most informative HVRs, and designed and validated a broad range primer set most suitable for the foregut microbiome.

In addition, we removed sequences that were derived from patient gastric samples with Helicobacter pylori (300), chimera sequences (127), as well as sequences with more than 8 bases missing after E. coli position 27 (186). The final foregut dataset contained 9484 sequences (2373 oral, 6626 esophageal, 485 gastric). These sequences were represented by 220 species.

Using full length sequences from 219 representative foregut species, we created sequence truncations that were 50-900 bases long beginning from base 28, the first base after the 8F primer. A length of 900 bases was chosen as the longest sequence to analyze because it is the length of a single pass Sanger sequence and generally accepted as accurate taxonomically. Each of the truncated versions of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was analyzed using RDPII classifier down to the genus level. The results showed that loss of classification accuracy was length dependent (Figure \u200b(Figure1).1). At the genus level, sequences as small as 200 bases showed relatively good classification accuracies (94.1% accuracy for 900 base sequence, 90.0% for 400 bases, and 81.7% for 200 bases). Once the sequences became smaller than 200 bases, the classification accuracies decreased considerably, with the 100 base sequence having only 61.2% accuracy and the 50 base sequence having only 8.2% accuracy at the genus level. Overall, for identification at the genus level, the data showed that sequence sizes generated by Solexa or SOLiD platforms would have drastically lower classification accuracies (less than 50 bases, 8%-61% accuracy) than those sequence sizes generated by 454 technology (over 400 bases, over 90% accuracy).",

Sequence reads from the designed amplicons were simulated by trimming the full length 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 219 foregut species as described in Materials and Methods. Because all amplicons were longer than the maximum read length of 454 technology, 2 sequence reads were simulated from the amplicons. A forward read, analyzing the first 350 bases from the 5\u2019 end of the sense strand, and a reverse read analyzing the first 350 bases from the 3\u2019 end. In total, 6 amplicons were created (A-F), and 12 reads were analyzed (forward reads A-F and reverse reads A\u2019-F\u2019).

Of the 219 species, 217 (99.1%) had 100% homology to 343F and 197 (90.0%) had 100% homology to 798R. While the 343F primer had favorable homology with all sequences, it was extended 8 bases to position 365 and deleted 4 bases between positions 343 and 346 because the original primer sequence was too short, having a low melting temperature that would not have worked with PCR conditions when used in tandem with the 798R primer. This new primer, designated as 347F is a 19mer but this modification resulted in only 113 sequences (51.6%) with 100% homology. The 798R primer was also lengthened to base 803, but shortened from 784 to 785 to ensure CG at 5\u2019 end of replication and to bring the melting temperature closer to the forward primer\u2019s. This modified primer, designated as 803R is a 19mer and the modification resulted in only 180 sequences (81.4%) with 100% homology. To improve the universality of the modified 343F and 798R primers, we analyzed both at each individual base (Figure \u200b(Figure3).3). For both the modified 343F and 798R there are positions of relatively low consensus. In the modified 343F, the consensus bases at positions 359 and 360 match with only 77.2% and 74.4% of the 219 species, respectively. In 798R, the consensus bases at positions 798 and 784 have 90.0% matches, respectively. To improve on these mismatches degenerative primers were constructed. Thus bases 359 and 360 in the modified 343F were changed from G (guanine) to R (guanine or adenosine). For 798R, base 798 was changed from A (adenosine) to R (guanine or adenosine) resulting in improved base matching as shown in Figure \u200bFigure3.3. The optimized 347F was 100% homologous with 205 (93.6%) species and 803R had 100% homology with 209 (95.4%) species. The sequences of the optimized primers are 5\u2019-GGAGGCAGCAGTRRGGAAT (347F) and 5\u2019-CTACCRGGGTATCTAATCC (803R).",

To evaluate their potential to detect species not included in the foregut dataset, 347F/803R primer sequences were searched against the 16S rRNA gene database at RDP (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). The database has a collection of 16S rRNA genes from 5165 type strains and 433 306 high quality, near full length 16S rRNA genes from both cultured and uncultured bacterial species, representing 36 phyla. For optimized primer 347F, the introduction of ambiguity codons improved the coverage to 91.1% from 65.7% for the type strain sequences and to 90.4% from 63.7% for all 16S rRNA genes (Table \u200b(Table6).6). In comparison, the optimized primer 803R had an identical match with 91.8% of the type strain sequences and 84.9% of all 16S rRNA genes. Assuming a typical PCR can tolerate 2 mismatches between a primer and a template, the modified 374F will be able to anneal 99% of the type strain sequences and 98% of all 16S rRNA genes, compared with 99.9% and 99.6% for 803R primer, respectively.",

We have shown that read lengths comparable to current 454 output (300-400 bases) give satisfactory 16S rRNA gene classification of bacteria at the genus and species level while shorter read lengths (such as those from Solexa and SOLiD technology) do not. However, with a change in sequencing read lengths of 16S rRNA from about 900 bp (as is commonly used with Sanger sequencing) to read lengths of 400, it is important to revisit which portion of the 16S rRNA gene to focus on to gain the most information from shorter reads. With the selection of the most informative stretch of the 16S rRNA gene, it is also important to ensure that the designed primers achieve a level of universality to be able to detect a wide array of microbial species. Although the primer pairs we chose to analyze were already available from the European Ribosomal Database, Wang has recently reported coverage rates of existing and predicted primers which span various regions of the 16S rRNA gene[34].

We expect that this more in-depth analysis of the foregut microbiome made possible by 454 sequencing will allow us to more clearly characterize the association between commensal bacteria of the esophagus and GERD-related esophageal disease progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. In addition to identifying bacteria already shown to occupy the foregut, 454 sequencing will broaden the range of bacteria found within the human foregut with the increased coverage.
