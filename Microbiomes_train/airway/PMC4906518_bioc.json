Nucleosomal DNA, the predominant form of plasma cfDNA, can be adapted for sequencing via ligation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) adapters. dsDNA library preparations, however, are insensitive to ultrashort, degraded cfDNA. Drawing inspiration from advances in paleogenomics, we have applied a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) library preparation method to sequencing of cfDNA in the plasma of lung transplant recipients (40 samples, six patients). We found that ssDNA library preparation yields a greater portion of sub-100\u2009bp nuclear genomic cfDNA (p\n 10\u22125, Mann-Whitney U Test), and an increased relative abundance of mitochondrial (10.7x, p\n 10\u22125) and microbial cfDNA (71.3x, p\n10\u22125). The higher yield of microbial sequences from this method increases the sensitivity of cfDNA-based monitoring for infections following transplantation. We detail the fragmentation pattern of mitochondrial, nuclear genomic and microbial cfDNA over a broad fragment length range. We report the observation of donor-specific mitochondrial cfDNA in the circulation of lung transplant recipients. A ssDNA library preparation method provides a more informative window into understudied forms of cfDNA, including mitochondrial and microbial derived cfDNA and short nuclear genomic cfDNA, while retaining information provided by standard dsDNA library preparation methods.",

The predominant type of cfDNA is derived from the nuclear genome and has a fragment size centered around 166\u2009bp, approximately the length of a segment of DNA wound around a histone octamer7,8. These nucleosomal fragments of cfDNA are readily accessible for sequencing using standard library preparation methods that are based on ligation of dsDNA sequencing adapters. The most commonly used implementations of this method rely on multiple bead-based size-selective steps that eliminate unwanted adapter-dimer products. These methods, although relevant to a wide range of applications, are not sensitive to the full diversity of circulating DNA9; in particular shorter fragments, highly degraded fragments and (partially) single-stranded fragments of DNA in circulation remain undetected (Fig. 1).",

To evaluate the performance of the ssDNA library preparation method, we directly compared data of fragment types, lengths and abundance to results from conventional library preparations performed on the same plasma DNA extracts13,15. Transplant recipients are subject to immunosuppressive therapies that reduce the risk of rejection, but increase their susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Analyses of microbial cfDNA in plasma are therefore particularly relevant in the context of transplantation. Here, we examined the yield of microbial cfDNA that results from the ssDNA and conventional library preparations. Donor specific nuclear genomic cfDNA is present in the circulation of solid-organ transplant patients and is a marker of transplant rejection2,4,16. In this study, we used a single-stranded library preparation to study the properties of donor and recipient specific DNA across a wide length range. To test whether donor specific mitochondrial cfDNA can be found in the circulation of transplant recipients, we directly compared data of cfDNA to reference sequences of amplified mitochondrial genomes obtained from pre-transplant samples. We note that Karlsson et al. recently applied a ssDNA ligation protocol to the amplification-free sequencing of cfDNA17. These authors, however, did not perform an analysis of fragment lengths and did not examine the presence of mitochondrial and microbial DNA in plasma.",

We used digital PCR (dPCR) assays with varying amplicon length (49\u2013304\u2009bp) to assess the abundance of mitochondrial cfDNA prior to library preparation and compared this to the abundance of nuclear genomic cfDNA (Fig. 2A). The experimental design with variable amplicon lengths provided information about the underlying fragment length distribution7: cfDNA is randomly fragmented in plasma, the genomic abundance, as measured by PCR, is therefore expected to decrease monotonically with amplicon length, with a gradient that is a function of the underlying fragment length distribution. These experiments revealed that mitochondrial DNA is more fragmented than nuclear genomic DNA, but present in much greater abundance in plasma (56-fold greater representation, genome equivalents). The consequence of the short fragment size of mtDNA is that conventional dsDNA library preparation protocols, which require multiple bead-based size-selective steps that eliminate unwanted adapter-dimer products, are relatively insensitive to mitochondrial sequences.",

Figure 2B\u2013D shows a direct comparison of the fragment length profiles measured after ssDNA and conventional library preparation. We found that cfDNA shorter than 100\u2009bp becomes more accessible for sequencing following ssDNA library preparation.

The lower limit of efficient capture, as shown by the local maxima of the short fragment cfDNA, for the ssDNA library preparation, was 40\u201360\u2009bp, for all subclasses (mitochondrial, microbial, nuclear genomic cfDNA), pointing to a limit set by the DNA isolation method (Fig. 2E), rather than the library preparation12.",

This property has been reported in previous studies and is observed for both the ssDNA and dsDNA library preparation protocols19. A second peak at shorter lengths (<100\u2009bp) is unique to the libraries prepared by single-stranded ligation15. The relative proportion of nuclear genomic DNA shorter than 100\u2009bp made up a substantial proportion of nuclear cfDNA (20.54%\u2009\u00b1\u200911.51%). We partitioned non-nucleosomal DNA into two groups, those with length under and over 100\u2009bp, to examine distinguishing features between the two groups. The GC content between the groups differed significantly (Fig. 2D, inset; p\n 10\u22125, Mann-Whitney U Test); the GC content of the super-100\u2009bp group was 40.9%, while that of the sub-100\u2009bp group was 43.5%.

This feature offers the potential to profile the bacterial and viral components of the microbiome in plasma more effectively and to perform infectious disease diagnostics based on sequencing of cfDNA with increased precision and at lower cost. The ssDNA library preparation detected viral fragments with clinical relevance in transplantation, including polyomaviruses (BK Polyomavirus, one sample, and Merkel cell Polyomavirus, two samples) and single-stranded DNA, transfusion-associated viruses (including torque teno virus, 18 samples, and SEN virus, 19 samples); the impact of these viruses on the outcome of solid organ transplant patients has been investigated previously15. Current methods to detect infections are predominantly limited to testing one pathogen at a time21. Metagenomics approaches have the potential to broadly screen for all known pathogens (with a DNA genome) in a single test13,15,22,23. Blood can be collected non-invasively and the majority of tissues in the body are connected to the blood circulation, making cfDNA an attractive sample type for such approach. A number of caveats remain; for example, it may be difficult to inform about an infection by organisms that are part of the normal flora in certain body sites, but are pathogenic in others. cfDNA may be of limited use in such cases as it lacks body-site specificity.",

The same attributes make mitochondrial DNA a promising candidate marker of post-transplant graft injury. We therefore asked whether donor-specific mitochondrial DNA can be detected in the plasma of transplant recipients. We built mitochondrial reference sequences to assign mitochondrial cfDNA to the transplant donor or recipient. To this end, DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected from the donor and the recipient prior to the transplant procedure. Mitochondrial DNA was selectively amplified and sequenced. One million sequences led to a per-base coverage greater than 100-fold (genome size 16.5\u2009kb), sufficient to determine subject-specific mitochondrial variants. Based on the reference sequences, we compiled lists of SNPs that are unique to either the donor or recipient (Fig. 4B, see Methods). On average, 152 informative SNPs were found per donor-recipient pair, roughly leading to a SNP every 114\u2009bp. For samples prepared via ssDNA ligation, 8.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4% of the mitochondrial sequences were informative, and 9.5% of the informative SNPs were assigned to the donor.

Mitochondrial DNA has conserved similarities to bacterial DNA and contains inflammatogenic unmethylated CpG motifs29. It is therefore not surprising that mitochondrial DNA was identified as a powerful damage associated molecular pattern\u2013an endogenous molecule that can activate innate immunity when released during cellular injury30.
