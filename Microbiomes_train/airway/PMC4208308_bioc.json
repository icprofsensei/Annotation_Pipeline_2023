We employed the SDI, as is commonly used in studies of complex microbial environments, to measure overall oral microbial diversity as well as microbial population changes between groups (\u0394SDI). To address the variation among regions of the oral cavity, we initially compared the dorsum of the tongue to buccal mucosa. The 43 tongue samples from our control patients were pooled and compared with the 19 buccal samples from unique subjects (as described above using SDI and PCA analysis). Levels of Fusobacteria (\u0394SDI = \u22120.158, P < 0.0001) and Firmicutes (\u0394SDI = \u22120.037, P = 0.037) were significantly reduced in buccal samples as compared with tongue samples of control patients, whereas Bacteroidetes were enriched (\u0394SDI = 0.032, P = 0.030). The SDI of buccal samples as a whole (SDI = 1.129) showed an overall trend toward decreased diversity when compared with tongue samples (SDI = 1.252, \u0394SDI = \u22120.122, P = 0.067) (Fig. 1a). Therefore, comparing the locations sampled demonstrated alterations in overall diversity with significant changes among several phyla including Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Furthermore, PCA analysis used as a data compression technique to visualize intersample similarity demonstrated clustering based on sample location (Fig. 1b).",

Furthermore, loss of specific phyla such as Fusobacteria and Firmicutes has been demonstrated in studies of the intestinal microbiome in CD and is mirrored in our study of the oral microbiome. 22,41,42 We presented evidence to suggest that the oral microbiome is uniquely altered in patients with IBD, especially in CD. We have begun to assess the diagnostic accuracy of this technology in children in whom IBD is suspected. Future work will evaluate the impact of potential clinical confounders such as disease phenotype, immunosuppression, disease activity, and diet as we expand our statistical and bioinformatic approach. With the prevalence of oral pathology in CD, the ease of visualization, and direct oral mucosal sampling, further study of the oral microbiome in IBD is of potential diagnostic and prognostic value.",
