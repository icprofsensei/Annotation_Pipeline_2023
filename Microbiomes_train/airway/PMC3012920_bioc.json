Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity to previously encountered viruses. Little is known about CRISPR composition in members of human microbial communities, the relative rate of CRISPR locus change, or how CRISPR loci differ between the microbiota of different individuals. We collected saliva from four periodontally healthy human subjects over an 11- to 17-mo time period and analyzed CRISPR sequences with corresponding streptococcal repeats in order to improve our understanding of the predominant features of oral streptococcal adaptive immune repertoires. We analyzed a total of 6859 CRISPR bearing reads and 427,917 bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. We found a core (ranging from 7% to 22%) of shared CRISPR spacers that remained stable over time within each subject, but nearly a third of CRISPR spacers varied between time points. We document high spacer diversity within each subject, suggesting constant addition of new CRISPR spacers. No greater than 2% of CRISPR spacers were shared between subjects, suggesting that each individual was exposed to different virus populations. We detect changes in CRISPR spacer sequence diversity over time that may be attributable to locus diversification or to changes in streptococcal population structure, yet the composition of the populations within subjects remained relatively stable. The individual-specific and traceable character of CRISPR spacer complements could potentially open the way for expansion of the domain of personalized medicine to the oral microbiome, where lineages may be tracked as a function of health and other factors.",

The primary tool for characterizing these communities is community-wide sequencing, as it provides a culture-independent method for examining aspects of community genomic content and variability. Both cellular life and viruses are subject to this type of analysis, with bacteria and archaea thus far as the primary focus, through exploration of microbial diversity based on analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Angly et al. 2006; Huber et al. 2007; Pride and Schoenfeld 2008; Antonopoulos et al. 2009; Willner et al. 2009). There now have been numerous community-wide sequencing studies of microbes in the human oral cavity, vagina, gastrointestinal tract, and skin (Lepp et al. 2004; Eckburg et al. 2005; Jenkinson and Lamont 2005; Gao et al. 2007; Palmer et al. 2007; Costello et al. 2009; Bik et al. 2010; Ravel et al. 2010).",

In contrast to the well-studied habitats in the environment (Breitbart et al. 2002; Rohwer and Thurber 2009; Rodriguez-Brito et al. 2010) and to the analysis of virus\u2013host interactions in vitro (Roucourt et al. 2009), few studies have examined the diversity and potential impact of human bacteriophages (Breitbart et al. 2008; Willner et al. 2009). Because of their alternate lifestyles, in which they may be lytic and decimate their bacterial hosts or lysogenic and potentially confer new functional potential and selective advantage to their host (Canchaya et al. 2003), these viruses have a substantial capacity to alter human microbial communities (Weinbauer and Rassoulzadegan 2004; Kunin et al. 2008; Rodriguez-Valera et al. 2009). A few studies of virus communities in the human respiratory tract and feces have provided early insight into these microbial ecosystems (Breitbart et al. 2008; Nakamura et al. 2009; Willner et al. 2009). The viral communities found in hosts with cystic fibrosis differ greatly from those of healthy hosts, suggesting that these viruses might contribute to host pathology (Willner et al. 2009). However, as yet, there are limited data to suggest that viruses may be major sources of bacterial population control in the human oral cavity (Hitch et al. 2004).",

The majority of bacteria and archaea possess at least one of these systems. As new viruses are encountered, a small portion of their genome is sampled and placed between often palindromic repeats at the end of the locus (Barrangou et al. 2007; Mojica et al. 2009). As the host is re-exposed to these same viruses, it resists predation through a mechanism of nucleic acid interference (Brouns et al. 2008; Hale et al. 2009). Analyses of CRISPR loci from bacteria and archaea in various environments have demonstrated substantial locus diversification, reflecting dynamic interactions among hosts and their viruses (Andersson and Banfield 2008; Deveau et al. 2008; Horvath et al. 2008; Tyson and Banfield 2008; Heidelberg et al. 2009; Semenova et al. 2009; van der Ploeg 2009). Others have used these loci to gather information about the history of virus exposures, and to type bacterial strains (Pourcel et al. 2005; Vergnaud et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2009). However, CRISPRs have not been examined to any significant degree within human ecosystems. Given the nature of CRISPR systems, we believe that these genomic loci may serve as records of host\u2013virus interactions in human environments and may reveal previously unrecognized mechanisms that underlie bacterial community evolution.",

We chose a conserved repeat sequence found in several streptococcal species, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae, as the basis for a broad-range PCR, as the Streptococcus genus had been identified as a predominant community member in the oral cavity of many human subjects (Lazarevic et al. 2009; Nasidze et al. 2009a,b; Bik et al. 2010).

We sequenced the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene after PCR amplification from samples (Supplemental Table 4), and in general, found a typical picture of bacterial diversity in saliva (Fig. 5). Each subject had a distinct pattern of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) membership in the saliva that differed between time points. As with principal coordinates analysis of CRISPR spacer diversity, the patterns of variation in the bacterial communities reflected a strong contribution from host (Fig. 6).",

C3, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguinis were much more variable in their relative abundances. Similar findings were noted for subjects #2 and #4.

Using Fisher z-transformed correlations to assess the predictive power of spacer content on streptococcal community composition, significant P-values were found only for subjects #1 (P < 0.012) and #4 (P < 0.018), while no significance was found for subjects #2 and #3.

                    "text": "Because CRISPR spacers are believed to contain short sequences from virus genomes, we subjected the spacers from each subject to BLASTN analysis to identify homologs and the possible origins of these spacers. For subject #1, only one of the 823 spacers had homologs to known sequences, while \u223c7% (61 of 847) for subject #2, 15% (152 of 1015) for subject #3, and 3% (19 of 559) for subject #4 had known homologs. Most homologs were sequences of streptococcal viruses (Table 2) or sequences of proviruses found in streptococcal genomes. Numerous homologs to Streptococcus phage CP-1 (Podoviridae isolated from S. pneumoniae), Streptococcus phage PH-10 (Siphoviridae isolated from S. oralis), and Streptococcus phage SM-1 (Siphoviridae isolated from S. mitis) were found. Interestingly, the spacer homologs were distributed across the genomes of these viruses, suggesting that these particular virus types were prevalent in the community (Supplemental Fig. 6). A few homologs were non-streptococcal genome sequences, which may reflect the presence of viruses with broad host range, or reflect shared features of viruses that parasitize disparate genera. The lack of identifiable spacer homologs in subject #1 as compared to the other subjects suggested that subject #1 had minimal exposure to these known virus types.",

Each isolate was then subjected to streptococcal CRISPR repeat-based PCR amplification; four to six isolates from each subject were chosen for further analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates, based on amplification of their 16S rRNA genes, identified most of the isolates as Streptococcus salivarius, and others as S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and Streptococcus anginosus (Supplemental Fig. 7; Supplemental Table 5). Interestingly, isolates of S. mitis and S. sanguinis were found in this study to harbor repeat sequences that differ from those of previously sequenced strains of these species. We analyzed CRISPR spacers from the isolates (Supplemental Table 5) to determine if they had been previously sampled in our direct analysis of the salivary CRISPR population. For subjects #1 and #2, each of the isolates analyzed harbored spacers that had previously been sampled (Supplemental Fig. 8A,B), while many of the strain spacers from subjects #3 and #4 were newly identified (Supplemental Fig. 8C,D).",

Most of these homologs were to streptococcal viruses or plasmids; however, there were numerous spacers homologous to a plasmid from Lactococcus lactis (Table 3). The presence of spacers in Streptococcus isolates with homology with Enterococcus and Halothermothrix genomes suggests that they are derived from viruses with relatively broad host range. The Halothermothrix spacers were found in both the Streptococcus isolates and the CRISPR spacer population, providing further evidence that Streptococcus was predominantly sampled in the direct PCR-based spacer analysis rather than other genera that had received a Streptococcus-like repeat via lateral gene transfer of the locus.",

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the structure of a single CRISPR locus over the course of the study period. We chose a CRISPR locus from subject #2 because a similar locus was identified in a Streptococcus isolate from this subject (2Mut38), and because all of its sampled spacers also were sampled in our analysis of the salivary CRISPR population (Supplemental Fig. 8B). Because in our analysis of the salivary CRISPR population, at each time point we detected numerous CRISPR sequences that began and ended with the same terminal spacer, we developed primers specific for these spacers to verify CRISPR locus structure. We reconstructed each locus at each time point using 100% nucleotide identity over a minimum overlap of 100 nt, and the resulting structure was independently verified by spacer-specific PCR followed by sequencing of the resulting amplicons. Over the 17-mo course of the study, three spacers were added to the locus, while one spacer was lost (Fig. 9). Interestingly, the locus was not detected on Day 60 by either method, but was detected once again at Month 11.",

While the study of the relationships between human bacterial and viral communities remains in its infancy, our data suggest on-going interactions between oral streptococci and their respective viruses, with potential importance for the stability of the human microbiota. The limited degree of shared spacers between human subjects (Supplemental Fig. 4) suggests that either each subject was exposed to different virus populations, which would be supported by a recent finding that fecal viromes are highly subject-specific (Reyes et al. 2010), or that similar virus populations were sampled differently by the streptococcal populations in each of the subjects. The presence of unique CRISPR spacer complements in each subject with shared characteristics across time (Fig. 4) suggests that CRISPR spacer complements may be used to trace individual human subjects; however, further study with a larger group of subjects is needed to verify this potential.",

This strategy allowed us to amplify many loci that could not be detected using primers based on flanking sequences in S. mutans UA159 (data not shown). The disadvantage of a repeat-based amplification strategy was that CRISPR loci had to be assembled from fragments. In fact, there were numerous instances of CRISPR loci with multiple, alternative spacer orders or duplicate spacers that suggested error-prone amplification, perhaps as a result of the repeat-based priming methodology. Spacer-based PCR-priming used for part of this study was not subject to these errors, and based on spacer priming, the definitive arrangement of spacers in CRISPR loci could be defined (Fig. 9). CRISPR locus diversification in this single locus (Fig. 9) over the course of the study suggests real-time virus encounter, genome assimilation, and locus evolution taking place in the salivary environment similar to that seen in acidophilic microbial biofilms (Tyson and Banfield 2008), the oral cavity of a rat (van der Ploeg 2009), and the ocean (Sorokin et al. 2010).",

Good's coverage and rarefaction analysis demonstrated that there was reasonably deep sampling of our subjects (Fig. 1; Supplemental Fig. 3). In this context, we believe that the variable number of unique spacers in each population over time cannot be explained by sampling bias alone. This observation could indicate diversification of CRISPR loci over time or differential representation of streptococcal strains at each time point (due to virus predation or other factors). The possibility of changes in streptococcal composition over time is supported by the finding of heterogeneity in repeat sequence representation at certain time points (Supplemental Fig. 2).",

The first is the maintenance of a core of shared spacers over time. This could reflect selective pressure to maintain certain spacers from repeated exposure to the same virus types or inheritance of spacers along strain lineages. We observed numerous spacer homologs spread out over virus genomes (Supplemental Fig. 6), indicating that the host bacteria may have been repeatedly sampling these virus types. The second observation is the rapid change in spacer complements across the time periods sampled. A large proportion of novel spacers were not identified at subsequent time points (Fig. 2). Given that the species composition of the Streptococcus population in each subject was relatively stable (Fig. 7), it is less likely that these newly identified spacers were the result of new species entering the community; however, we cannot rule out Streptococcus strain variation over time, of a type that 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis might fail to resolve. It is well-known from other studies that CRISPR spacers vary at the strain level (Horvath et al. 2008; McShan et al. 2008; Salzberg et al. 2008; Heidelberg et al. 2009; Diez-Villasenor et al. 2010), which reinforces that some of the CRISPR spacer variation found in the present study may result from the presence of new and diverse streptococcal strains.",

Our analysis of salivary streptococcal CRISPR populations provides only a glimpse into the potential complexities of these interactions. The choice of a single streptococcal repeat sequence for our experimental approach in this study underscores this point, as there are many other known CRISPR repeat sequences in streptococci and other organisms that might provide a similar but distinct picture of diversity. Despite the limitations of our approach, there are numerous benefits, such as the ability to identify virus types to which the community has been exposed without isolating the individual viruses, and the ability to identify the portions of virus genomes targeted by host bacteria. With the ever-increasing depth of virus genome databases, CRISPR spacer community-wide sequencing constitutes a powerful tool for understanding host\u2013virus dynamics in complex ecosystems.",

Primer sequences were removed, and only those sequences with a length of \u2265100 nt and a Sequencher quality score >80% were chosen for further analysis. CRISPR repeats were identified based on an algorithm that searches for the first 5 nt of the CRISPR repeat sequence (GTTTT) followed by the last 5 nt (AAAAC) of the sequence, with allowances for a single nucleotide polymorphism in the repeat at any nucleotide position. The repeats were defined as any set of nucleotides \u223c36 nt long that begins and ends with the aforementioned nucleotides. In addition, for all samples the sequences were manually examined to ensure no repeat motifs went undetected and that no errors occurred in the classification of repeat motifs. Spacers were defined as any sequence (length \u2265 20) flanked by repeat motifs. Only clone sequences containing at least two repeat motifs flanking a single spacer were retained; all others were removed from the analysis. Contigs were created for each subject at each time point using 100% identity over a minimum overlap of 100 nt to prevent the creation of quasi-CRISPR loci. Spacers were grouped according to three rules: (1) spacers that were identical; (2) spacers that were identical, with the exception of a single nucleotide polymorphism; and (3) spacers that differed in length, but were identical over the length of the shorter spacer. For each sample, a database of spacers and repeat motifs was generated and was used to create heatmaps using Java TreeView (Saldanha 2004) and to determine shared spacers and repeats. Heatmap input data were normalized by the total number of spacers for each time point, and then multiplied by 100 so that the heatmap color intensity was represented as percentages of the total number of spacers. Good's coverage was determined as the estimation of the number of singletons in the population (n), compared to the total number of sequences (N), using the equation [1 \u2212 (n/N)] \u00d7 100 (Good 1953). Rarefaction analysis was performed based on species richness estimates of 10,000 iterations using EcoSim (Lee et al. 2005). Beta diversity was determined using Sorensen's similarity, which also was used as input for principal coordinates analysis. Correlations in CRISPR spacer content and streptococcal species composition were performed using Pearson's correlation in the R Statistical Package (http://www.R-project.org). Regression analysis was performed on Fisher z-transformed correlations to determine significant P-values. Spacers from each subject were subjected to BLASTN analysis based on the NCBI non-redundant database. Hits were considered significant if they had bit scores of \u226550, which roughly correlates to 2-nt differences over the 30-nt average length of the spacers.",

The forward primer consisted of a 10:1:1 ratio of the following primers (8FM-B, 5\u2032-CCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGCAAGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3\u2032; 8FT-B, 5\u2032-CCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGCAAGAGTTTGATTCTGGCTCAG-3\u2032; and 8Fbif-B, 5\u2032-CCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAGCAAGGGTTCGATTCTGGCTCAG-3\u2032). This primer incorporated the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) primer B sequence and a two-base linker sequence \u201cCA,\u201d and modifications of the broad range 16S rRNA primer 8F. The reverse primer (515R-A, 5\u2032-CATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAGNNNNNNNNNNGGTACCGCGGCKGCTGGCAC-3\u2032) incorporated the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) primer A sequence, a unique 10-nt barcode for each subject sample (represented in the above sequence by N), the broad range bacterial 16S rRNA primer 515R, and a two-base linker sequence \u201cCA.\u201d PCRs were performed in 50-\u03bcL reaction volumes using the Roche FastStart HiFi polymerase kit (Roche Applied Science). Each reaction consisted of 39.8 \u03bcL of H2O, 5 \u03bcL of HiFi buffer with MgCl2, 1 \u03bcL of dNTPs, 1.2 \u03bcL of forward primer, 1 \u03bcL of reverse primer, 1 \u03bcL of HiFi polymerase, and 1 \u03bcL of salivary DNA template. The following were used as cycling parameters: 3 min of initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation (30 sec at 95\u00b0C), annealing (45 sec at 51\u00b0C), and extension (5 min at 72\u00b0C), followed by a final extension (10 min at 72\u00b0C). Products were \u223c550 bp and were gel-purified using a QIAGEN QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN), and further purified using Ampure bead purification (Beckman Coulter Genomics). Purified amplicons were quantified using PicoGreen (Invitrogen) and were pooled in equimolar ratios. Pyrosequencing was performed using primer A on a 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium instrument.",

Sequences were removed from the analysis if they were <200 nt or >800 nt, had an uncorrectable barcode, contained any ambiguous characters, or contained more than 10 homopolymers. These sequences were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive database under accession number SRA024393.1. Sequences were assigned to their respective samples based on their 10-nt barcode sequence, and similar sequences were clustered into OTUs using a minimum identity of 97% using CD-Hit (Li and Godzik 2006). To limit overestimation of the microbial diversity present, pyrosequencing noise was reduced using Pyronoise (Quince et al. 2009). Representative sequences from each OTU were chosen and aligned using NAST (DeSantis et al. 2006b) based on the Greengenes database (DeSantis et al. 2006a). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using FastTree based on Kimura's two-parameter distances, and taxonomy was assigned to each OTU using the RDP classifier with a minimum support threshold of 60% (Wang et al. 2007; Price et al. 2009). Shared OTUs were compared between each subject at each time point to generate heatmaps using Java TreeView (Saldanha 2004). Heatmap input data were normalized by the total number of sequences for each time point and then multiplied by 100 so that the heatmap color intensity was represented as percentages of the total number of sequences. Principal coordinates analysis was performed based on beta diversity using weighted Unifrac distances. The presence of streptococcal species was determined by identifying sequences assigned to the genus Streptococcus from each subject at each time point, and analyzing each sequence with RDP Seqmatch (Cole et al. 2009). Each of the taxonomic assignments that were processed had a threshold value \u22650.85 at the species level; therefore, each sequence was assigned at the species level. Results of RDP Seqmatch were confirmed independently for representative OTUs by phylogenetic analysis using RDP Tree Builder (Cole et al. 2009).",
