Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the archetypal clinical phenotype (Khan, 2002). The strong familial association amongst close relatives with AS is linked with the allele HLA-B27 present in approximately 90% of individuals with AS (Roberts et al., 2013). In 2009 the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) proposed new nomenclature for SpA, based on classification criteria (Rudwaleit et al., 2009), which has changed the perspective of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (Van der Horst-Bruinsma, 2013). The axial form of SpA (AxSpA) is now subdivided in the (early) non-radiographic type (nr-axial SpA) and the radiographic type, which equates to AS (according to the older modified New York criteria (Van der Linden, Valkenburg & Cats, 1984)). The advantage of the new nomenclature is that it encompasses patients with earlier and less severe disease, and reflects the spectrum of severity seen in clinical practice.",

In order to investigate aetoiological mechanisms associated with genetic predisposition in AxSpA, transgenic murine models expressing human HLA-B27 have been derived. These animals develop inflammation of the peripheral joints and spine and also develop colitis (Hammer et al., 1990). It is thought that the microbiome plays a role in disease pathogenesis, since germfree HLA-B27 transgenic rats do not develop arthritis (Taurog et al., 1994). However, arthritis develops when commensal bacteria, such as Bacteroides vulgatus, are introduced into these germfree models (Rath et al., 1996).",

Although dental plaque represents a relatively small biomass, it is characterized by a highly dense microbial community which is almost as diverse as those found in the intestinal tract (Costello et al., 2013; HMPConsortium, 2012).

Epidemiologic studies show that as many as 10% to 15% of the adult population have severe or advanced periodontitis (Petersen & Ogawa, 2005). The oral microbiota has a role in periodontal disease and, in turn, is thought to play a contributory role in chronic systemic inflammatory diseases (Pizzo et al., 2010). For instance, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a higher prevalence of severe periodontitis and tooth loss than healthy controls (De Pablo, Dietrich & McAlindon, 2008) and the severity of periodontal disease correlates positively with disease activity in RA (Ribeiro, Le\u00e3o & Novaes, 2005; Loyola-Rodriguez et al., 2010). The composition of the oral microbiota also appears to be a factor in RA (Yeoh et al., 2013) and treatment of periodontitis ameliorates RA disease activity (Ortiz et al., 2009). It is noteworthy that periodontal pathogens have been detected in the synovial fluid of patients with RA and AxSpA (Kempsell et al., 2000; Martinez Martinez et al., 2009; Moen et al., 2005; Moen et al., 2006).",

The principal examiner (PS) underwent calibration prior to clinical data collection with intra-examiner calibration (with ten volunteers not recruited to the study). Data collected included: probing pocket depth (PPD) and gingival recession, clinical attachment loss (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP) at six sites per tooth. Other clinical information recorded included assessment of plaque deposits, oral mucosal conditions, and dental caries status: including enumeration of decayed missing or filled teeth (DMFT). The clinical assessor was not formally blinded to the status of the participant (AxSpA or control), this was impractical as many of the patient group had very obvious clinical features of AxSpA. Periodontitis was defined in this study as PPD \u2265 4 mm at \u22654 sites. There is considerable variation in the definition of periodontitis and no international consensus (Savage et al., 2009). In this study a definition of periodontitis used for epidemiological studies and defined by the Centre for Disease Control was selected (Eke et al., 2012). Observed clinical differences between the two groups were tested for statistical significance in SPSS (Version 21), using (as appropriate) Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests and Chi-square tests, with an alpha value of 0.05.",

Briefly, The primers used were CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAGXXXXXCWACGCGARGAACCTTACC and CCTCTCTATGGGCAGTCGGTGATACRACACGAGCTGACGAC with XXXXX being a sample specific index. 25 cycles of PCR were carried out using GoTaq Colorless Master Mix (Promega) and amplicons were confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Amplicons were quantified and pooled at equimolar concentration using Qubit HSDNA (Life Technologies) before clean up (QIAquick PCR Purification kit). The resulting pool was sequenced at the London Regional Genomics Centre according to standard protocols using an Ion Torrent 316 chip. Raw reads are available in the NCBI Short Read Archive (accession: SRX513907) and the pipeline for demultiplexing and processing is available at github.com/ggloor/miseq_bin. Reads were filtered to only those containing perfect primer sequences, barcodes and a length between 70 and 90 for the V6 region. Taxonomy was assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97% clustering) using the RDP classifier. \u03b1 and \u03b2-diversity analysis and subsequent OTU level associations were made using the VEGAN and GUniFrac R Packages (Chen et al., 2012; Oksanen et al., 2016). To control for uneven sampling depth, all samples were subsampled to 9,064 reads. To examine differentially abundant taxa and to avoid spurious correlations common with the use of Pearson\u2019s correlation and proportional data (Pearson, 1896), ALDEx2 (version 2.0.6) (Fernandes et al., 2013; Fernandes et al., 2014) was used to calculate the centered-log ratio (CLR) of each OTU within a sample from raw read counts. Additionally, this approach includes an estimation of technical variation common to microbiota datasets by randomly drawing Monte-Carlo instances from the Dirichlet distribution. Stringent multiple test correction was applied using Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate. Associations were then examined in R software using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. Differential abundance of taxa was represented in an effect plot (Gloor, Macklaim & Fernandes, 2015). To completely recapitulate analysis, the raw code for read processing and analysis, associated metadata, and OTU table (.biom format) are available at github.com/jbisanz/ankspon.",

This is despite the confounders that patients with AxSpA had significantly worse oral health than age- and sex-matched controls, with more plaque and a higher prevalence of periodontitis, despite their young mean age. In a similar study examining the oral microbiome in patients with RA, no difference in community profile was found amongst early RA, chronic RA and healthy controls, but differences in the subgingival microbiota were noted in relation to periodontitis (Scher et al., 2012).",

                    "text": "Analysis at the OTU level failed to demonstrate an association between AxSpA and several bacterial taxa with stringent multiple testing corrections. While this suggests that no single causative-agent in the subgingival plaque is involved in the aetiopathogenesis, it should be noted that, without very many more samples, the sheer number of OTUs compared would make it unlikely that small effect-sizes would be detected. This is a limitation of the current study, and the data presented here should be viewed as a discovery-based approach warranting replicating studies with greater enrollment in order to conclusively rule out false negatives. All aspects of the data have been made publicly available for those researchers wishing to use the data set for hypothesis generation. The use of CLR-normalized relative abundances and modeling of technical error reduces the risk of false associations with low-abundance taxa and spurious correlations frequently reported in microbiota research (Fernandes et al., 2013; Fernandes et al., 2014). While being a relatively new technology, 16S rRNA variable region surveys via high-throughput sequencing are a relatively coarse method of analysis, and further studies using shotgun-metagenomic and meta-RNA sequencing may provide more in-depth analysis that could discover strain or gene-level associations with disease. Furthermore, given the growing evidence for an association between periodontal disease and AxSpA (Keller, Kang & Lin, 2013; Pischon et al., 2010), future studies should address the potential for the oral microbiota as a causative factor in AxSpA, as opposed to being simply a marker of periodontal disease and inflammation. This is particularly relevant given recent advances in our understanding of the genetic predisposition to AxSpA. Potential mechanisms can only be postulated. However, given evidence from elsewhere in the gut, it is possible that interactions between the autologous microbiome and the host immune system may be implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of AxSpA, since evidence for such a process in the ileo-colon continues to accumulate (Costello et al., 2013). At present, there is limited objective evidence that either specific bacteria or alterations in the microbiome as a whole influence the aetiopathogenesis of these conditions (Yeoh et al., 2013; Costello et al., 2013). Gingivitis and periodontitis are both host immune responses to plaque microbial challenge (Seymour et al., 1988). Credible biological mechanisms associating periodontitis and systemic inflammatory conditions have been proposed, but epidemiological confirmation of a causal relationship remains elusive. Associations are not necessarily causal and may comprise but one aspect of a variety of associated environmental risk factors (Seymour et al., 2007).",
