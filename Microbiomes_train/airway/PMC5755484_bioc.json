Previous researchers analyzed certain suspected periodontopathogens to reflect the relationship between periodontal diseases and microbial ecology (Fujinaka et al., 2013). Yet recent research found that periodontal diseases may be caused by an obvious shift in the microbial community instead of by the changes of individual periodontopathogens (Kumar et al., 2006; Zijnge et al., 2012). Changes in the microbial community could disrupt the balance between host and microorganism, and in turn lead to periodontal disease. It is crucial to understand the composition and changes of the microbiome during orthodontic therapy to avoid the development of periodontal diseases with the use of orthodontic appliances.

Among these, Streptococcus (11.95%), Neisseria (7.29%) and Actinomyces (7.27%) showed high abundances at T0, while Actinomyces (13.10%), Streptococcus (11.09%) and Fusobacterium (8.34%) manifested high abundances at T1, and Rothia (11.36%), Actinomyces (10.53%) and Fusobacterium (8.36%) had highest abundances at T2. The relative abundances of core genera, which were defined as most commonly detected (relative abundance >\u00a01.0%), and shared genera among groups are expressed in Fig. 7A. Among those core genera, Rothia and Actinomyces were relatively abundant at T2, with higher abundance of Streptococcus at T0, but all of these changes were not statistically significant. In addition to core genera, Bergeyella and Mycoplasma exhibited significant differences in abundance (Fig. 7B). The relative abundance of Bergeyella was significantly higher at T0 (0.34%) compared with T1 (0.11%). Mycoplasma showed a significantly reduced abundance between T0 (0.10%) and T2 (0.01%). Additionally, the relative abundances of eight predominant genera that could cause periodontal disease were found to have no significant difference during the first three-month CAT (Fig. 7C).",

Many research studies have been carried out on microbial changes during fixed appliance treatment (Freitas et al., 2014; Ireland et al., 2014). Our previous research found that the level of subgingival periodontal pathogens could temporarily increase after the placement of a fixed appliance (Guo et al., 2017). However, we know little about how clear aligner treatment impacts microbiota and periodontal health. To the best of our knowledge, only one study using PCR techniques reported that patients with clear aligners had a better periodontal status and found no detectable periodontal pathogens (Levrini et al., 2015). However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has never been applied to analyze the changes of the subgingival microbial community during CAT. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, our study has described the change of the microbial community during the first three-month clear aligner treatment, and we found that clear aligners could affect the subgingival microbial community by decreasing the overall microbial diversity and changing the microbial structure, but the periodontal pathogens and core microbiota were less affected.",

A systematic review by Rossini et al. (2015) reported that there was no statistically significant increase in probing depth during the clear aligner treatment. Hence, it is generally assumed that clear aligners have a better, or at least equal, periodontal health status compared with fixed appliances. These studies all found no significant change in the probing depth during the clear aligner treatment. It is reported that the PI and GBI were slightly higher during the CAT than that before CAT (Kumar et al., 2006). Hence, instead of periodontal disease, maybe we should be concerned about gingivitis. However, in our study, the PI and GBI at T0, T1 and T2 were not significantly increased, which indicates that the clear aligner was not susceptible to induce gingival inflammation at the first three-month treatment.",

Both cultured and uncultured periodontal pathogens can be detected with this method. Unlike other microbial detection techniques, such as traditional detection methods and PCR, the 16S high-throughput sequencing is able to reflect the composition and structure of the subgingival microbial community (Xiao et al., 2016). Kumar et al. (2006) used 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to analyze the stability of subgingival microbial community and found the close relationship between shifts in microbial community and changes in periodontal health status (Levrini et al., 2015). During the orthodontic treatment, changes in the subgingival microbial community during the early stage of periodontal disease would aid in diagnosis to avoid further periodontal destruction.",

In our study, the alpha diversity indices, which reflect microbial richness and evenness, were slightly decreased overtime without statistical significance. In addition to these decreasing indices, the higher Simpson index at T1 and T2 also support a lower microbial diversity. Based on the results, a stable periodontal status was considered with a less diversity community that may not cause periodontal inflammation during the first three-month CAT.",

Based on weighted UniFrac distance, beta diversities were significantly higher at T1 and T2 compared with T0, indicating that a more variable community structure was observed at T1 and T2. The discrepancies of microbial community structure at three different phases were also exhibited by the relative segregation in PCoA. In addition, the heatmap and microbial distribution based on the relative abundance illustrated a more detailed comparison of the microbial structure at the genus and phylum level.

However, significant changes in abundance were observed in several microorganisms between time-points. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Tenericutes were significantly more abundant at T0 compared to T2. The phylum Actinobacteria exhibited an increased tendency in abundance. At the genus level, we found that Mycoplasma and Bergeyella showed a significantly reduced abundance at T2 and T1, respectively. Among these, the phylum Firmicutes and the genus Mycoplasma were recognized as predominant microorganisms in the periodontal disease and decreased during the first three-month CAT. Previously, Li et al. (2014) and Abusleme et al. (2013) confirmed the association of Firmicutes with periodontitis. Holt, Wilson & Musa (1995) found that Mycoplasma may play a role in gingivitis. One explanation for the decrease in these two periodontal pathogens could be that clear aligners may facilitate in oral health maintenance. Of course, considering the less relative abundance of Mycoplasma at T0, another explanation for the decrease of might be bioinformatic artefacts.",

At the species level, considering the limited information derived from the v3-v4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rDNA, most species cannot be discriminated. Only five putative periodontal pathogens, including Aa, Pi, Cr, Fn and Td, were identified. No significant changes in the relative abundance of these five putative periodontal pathogens were detected during the first three-month CAT. These results indicate that clear aligners may not specifically affect the periodontal pathogens, at least without increasing the relative abundance of periodontal pathogens, some of which was even significantly decreased.",

The core microbiome plays a key role in periodontal health (Zaura et al., 2009). In our study, 21 genera, of which the relative abundance constituted more than 1% and were shared by all included subjects, were identified as establishing the core microbiome. Among these genera, the relative abundances of the genera Rothia and Actinomyces were higher at T2, the relative abundance of the genera Streptococcus was lower, but without statistically significant difference. Rothia and Streptococcus were both considered non-pathogenic microorganisms in periodontal disease (Nightingale et al., 2014). Hence, the relative stability of core microbiomes might associate with a relatively periodontal health status .",

There are many possible factors contributing to the change of the subgingival microbial community during clear aligner treatment. Firstly, the gingival margin of the clear aligner, an apparent undercut, would cause extensive biofilm accumulation that can have an influence on subgingival bacteria. In addition, a clear aligner, a type of removable thermoplastic appliance, is prone to be adhered by the salivary film (Shpack et al., 2014). A clear aligner is not completely smooth, and the microcracks and abraded areas would facilitate bacterial adhesion (Low et al., 2011). However, the microorganisms can spread from other oral areas, such as saliva and mucosa, into the subgingival pocket (Fu et al., 2016). Hence, changes in oral microbiota in other areas caused by clear aligner could influence the subgingival microbial community.",
