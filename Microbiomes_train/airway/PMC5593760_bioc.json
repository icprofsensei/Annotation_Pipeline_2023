However, more recently, breath methane excretion was not an accurate marker of colonic methane production in healthy people and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, nor was it associated with the clinical features or colonic transit in IBS (8). Indeed, several aspects of microbial carbohydrate fermentation limit the utility of using breath gases to assess the abundance or activity of hydrogen-producing (hydrogenogenic) microbes or intestinal gas production. First, preformed gas in hard stools may be released in response to treatment with a laxative {Di Stefano, 2014 #3753}, thereby affecting the accuracy of breath tests. Second, the proportion of H2 excreted in breath depends on total production. At a low production rate (<200 mL/day), 65% of H2 is exhaled (7), but at a high rate (>500 mL/day), most was expelled as flatus and only 25% was exhaled (7). Third, the magnitude of fermentation varies among carbohydrates (7). Fourth, hydrogen from hydrogenogenic microbes is utilized by hydrogenotrophic microbes (6), which reduces the accumulation of hydrogen, thereby decreasing feedback inhibition of fermentation.",

Categorized by their metal functional cores, hydrogenases are phylogenetically widespread and functionally diverse and include both hydrogen evolving and hydrogen uptake [NiFe] hydrogenases, hydrogen evolving [FeFe] hydrogenases, and hydrogen uptake [Fe]-only hydrogenases (10). Hydrogenotrophic microbes utilize hydrogen to convert carbon dioxide to acetate (i.e., acs, fhs genes) (11), methane (mcrA gene) (12), and hydrogen sulfide (dsrA gene) (13). Conceivably, low methane production may reflect low hydrogenotrophic methanogenic abundance or low substrate availability (i.e., hydrogen), perhaps due to fewer hydrogenogenic microbes. Measuring the colonic abundance of hydrogenogenic and hydrogenotrophic microbes may distinguish amongst these possibilities. Previous studies have characterized hydrogenogens (14) or methanogens (12) with functional genomics, but none have done so concurrently.",

The delayed-release coating dissolves in the alkaline pH of the terminal ileum, releasing 111In in the cecum. Gastric and small bowel transit was evaluated with two scrambled eggs labelled with technetium-99m (99mTc) sulfur-colloid that were eaten with one slice of whole wheat bread and one glass of whole milk (300 kcal total). Established approaches were used to summarize the gastric emptying (GE) half time (t1/2), small intestinal transit (i.e., proportion of 99mTc in the colon at 6 hours) and colonic transit, expressed as the geometric center (GC) at specified times. The GC is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions (ascending, transverse, descending, rectosigmoid colon) and stool, respectively, 1 to 5. A higher GC reflects a faster colonic transit.",

After extraction, total DNA was quantified using a Qubit assay kit (Life Technologies Corporation, NY, USA), with an average yield of 4.1 (range 0\u201322.5) ng/\u03bcL. 16S rRNA-based sequencing was performed with an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Phylotype profiles of the microbiota from healthy and constipated populations were generated using deep rDNA hypervariable tag sequencing of the hypervariable V3\u2013V5 region of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, which has been validated for use with human microbiota and is the preferred technique in the Human Microbiome Project. With the longer reads from the MiSeq (300\u00d7300 paired end reads), sequencing included the V3\u2013V5 regions, thereby optimizing the phylogenetic analysis (17); the 300 base pair reads ensured optimal phylogenetic identification. Barcoding of samples prior to sequencing yielded a range of 3,116 \u2013 425,701 reads per sample, ensuring detection of both dominant (core microbiota) and poorly represented taxa (variable microbiota). Paired end reads were stitched, aligned, and classified using a custom pipeline (TORNADO v2.0) (18). Briefly, low base quality reads were either trimmed or discarded (19), and these reads were not classified as a bacteria kingdom (20) or matched to the bacteria 16S rRNA secondary structure (21). To evaluate the microbial diversity and abundance, UPARSE was used for Operational Taxonomical Units (OTU) clustering (22), and FastTree was used for phylogeny (23). The 16S data were clustered into OTUs at 97% sequence similarity, and the taxonomy was assigned using the Ribosomal Database Project classifier.",

Associations between (i) breath tests and diet and separately with colonic transit, and (ii) gene abundance and demographic factors (i.e., age and body mass index [BMI]), diet, colonic transit, and breath methane production were evaluated with multiple variable regression with permutation based on the F-statistic, all adjusted for constipation status.

These metrics capture different parameters, with unweighted UniFrac reflecting differences in community membership (i.e., presence or absence of OTU), while the weighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity better reflect differences in OTU abundance.(28) To prevent artifacts in the analysis that can arise from unequal sequencing depth, rarefaction was performed on the OTU table before calculating the unweighted UniFrac distance. In order to identify associations between microbial community profiles and variables of interest (e.g., constipation status, colonic transit), we used the Microbiome Regression-Based Kernel Association Test (MiRKAT) that adjusts for potential confounding covariates (29).",

Methane delivered at very high concentrations increased ileal muscle contractility in an ex vivo model of the guinea pig ileum and delayed small bowel transit in dogs (31). In this study, breath methane excretion was numerically greater in patients than in controls at individual time points. However, the overall breath methane excretion profile was not associated with constipation or slow colonic transit. One explanation is that only a subset of healthy individuals, approximately 30% in our population, produce methane at quantities detectable in breath (32), which is lower than the corresponding proportion (53%) in a study from Spain (33). The abundance of individual hydrogenogenic genes was not significantly associated with breath hydrogen production, even after adjusting for its utilization, i.e., to produce methane. Similarly, the abundance of individual hydrogenotrophic genes was not associated with breath methane production, even after adjusting for the availability of hydrogen, its substrate. Taken together, these observations suggest that breath methane and hydrogen excretion is not a useful measure of the abundance of hydrogenogenic and hydrogenotrophic genes in humans.",

The abundance of the methanogenic gene mcrA and the hydrogenogenic gene FeFe-hydA, were respectively not correlated with breath methane and hydrogen production, perhaps because breath methane and likely also hydrogen, are not accurate markers of colonic methane and hydrogen production (8).

                    "text": "Relationships between taxa abundance and functional gene targets may provide insights into the contribution of individual organisms to the overall microbial hydrogen economy. For example, first, some Bacteroidetes express the gene FeFe-hydA, which may explain the correlation between this phylum and FeFe-hydA (24, 37). Second, taxa belonging to phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria correlated inversely with FeFe-hydA. To speculate, the colonic abundance of these phyla may be inversely correlated with the abundance of the phylum Firmicutes, which are strong hydrogen producers (6). Third, Bacteroidetes encode sulfatases (38), which liberate sulfate from sulfated mucins. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) contain dsrA, which utilizes sulfate and hydrogen to produce hydrogen sulfide. Sulfate promotes the growth of SRB (39). Perhaps this explains the correlation between Bacteroidetes and dsrA-harboring SRB, which generate sulfate and synthesize hydrogen sulfide, respectively. Subject to the caveat that the phylogenetic assessment relied on 16S rRNA gene sequences while the functional gene abundance was evaluated with qPCR techniques, taxa that are known hydrogen producers (e.g., Roseburia spp. and Ruminococcus spp) were not significantly different between healthy and constipated subjects. Refining our understanding of the relationships between specific taxa and functional genes will require metagenomic approaches.",

Correlations between the abundance of mcrA and a positive hydrogen breath test and between the abundance of the hydrogenogenic gene FeFe-hydA and the hydrogenotrophic gene mcrA were significant, likely due to the syntrophic nature of organisms which create these respective metabolites. Similar to the phylogenetic assessment of the microbiome (4), the abundance of gene targets in stool and colonic mucosa were not correlated, which reinforces the importance of obtaining both fecal and colonic mucosal samples. Dietary carbohydrate intake was associated with the abundance of FeFe-hydA in feces, presumably because fermentable carbohydrates are a major substrate for microbial hydrogen production (40).",

While microbial communities are ubiquitous throughout the colon, there may be regional differences (6). The current sample size provided 80% power to detect a relatively large effect size, that is 0.8SD (within-group standard deviation) between groups. Hence, a type 2 error may explain why some differences were not statistically significant and may have also limited our ability to identify significant relationships, for instance, between the abundance of genes and the composition of specific microbiota as also between the abundance of FeFe hydA and breath hydrogen excretion. The relationship between the abundance of mrcA and 16S rRNA genes of methane producing microbes (i.e., Archaea) was not evaluated.",

While the abundance of hydrogenogenic and hydrogenotrophic genes was correlated, the abundance of these genes was not associated with the breath levels of their respective gases after lactulose ingestion. Breath methane was not related with constipation or colonic transit. A larger study integrating phylogenetic, transcriptomic, functional genomic, and metagenomics techniques with physiologic parameters is necessary to more fully resolve how microbes generating and disposing of H2 impact colonic function.",
