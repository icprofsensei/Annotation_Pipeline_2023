However, sampling the pulmonary microbiome is difficult. Sputum is fraught with significant contamination from the oral cavity, and percutaneous sampling is unpractical with a high risk of complications like pneumothorax or bleeding. The emerging gold standard for sampling is bronchoscopy. But bronchoscopy also has its technical challenges, besides issues of discomfort, cost and sedation. The bronchoscope must pass through either the oral or nasal cavity in addition to the pharyngeal cavity, and might carry contaminants from the upper airways to the lower biomass compartment of the lower airways. Samples are collected through the same bronchoscope working channel through which fluid is suctioned up and out. The different modes of sampling (bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) brushings, biopsies) might be carried through catheters, which may or may not have a wax-sealed tip to ensure sterility. Added to this is the conundrum caused by the constant influx of microbiota by microaspiration and inhalation that probably is responsible for maintenance and creation of a large fraction of the lung microbiome [5].",

Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks tests showed that the oral wash samples were more alpha-diverse than all other sampling methods (p<0.001). The diversity was lower in COPD patients than controls, for most all sample types (figure 2).

As can be seen, most respiratory tract samples clustered differently from the OW samples, but the visual impression is that the differences in diversity were smaller between OW and SVL and OW and PBAL samples than for OW and the PSB samples. Another way of comparing the beta-diversity was employed using a permanova test; estimating the beta-diversity between OW samples and each of the other sampling methods. This method tests to which degree the variation in a matrix of UniFrac distances can be explained by an imposed categorisation (i.e. sampling method). Overall permanova test confirmed that the beta-diversity differed by sampling method (pseudo F 8.73, p=0.001, 999 permutations). When the distance matrix was split according to the comparisons in figure 3, all were significant (p<0.01, permanova, corrected for multiple comparison), with the permanova pseudo F-statistic gradually increasing for the comparison of OW with SVL, PBAL1, PBAL2, right PSB and left PSB respectively, again indicating that PSB samples were more clearly separated from OW samples than SVL and PBAL.",

They examined 49 subjects, with supraglottic brushes and BAL through the working channel, and observed that two clusters dominated airway samples: one dominated by OTUs present in negative control samples, and one dominated by OTUs present in supraglottic brushes. One interpretation might be that these two clusters represent two different modalities of contamination, the first one from laboratory procedures and the second from bronchoscopic carryover. Segal\net al. argue that if it was bronchoscopic carry-over, they would have observed a dilutional effect when they compared a first BAL of the lingula, with the second BAL of the right middle lobe. However, this comparison was done for only 15 individuals, and anatomically one might expect lower biomass in the lingula than the right middle lobe.",

Bassis\net al. examined oral wash samples of 12 subjects and compared them with a first BAL of the lingula and a second BAL of the right middle lobe [6]. They did not find any difference in quantitative PCR between the first and second BAL, and no difference in beta-diversity when comparing the OW with the two BALs. Their interpretation was that if there was significant carryover, there should have been observed some sort of dilutional effect. Nevertheless, the two sampled sites are separated by the carina, and the bronchoscope must be repositioned between sampling, and these two sites are indeed in different communication with the outside world, possibly leading to an a priori larger biomass in the right lung. Also, Dickson\net al. compared supraglottic brushes with PSB and BAL through the working channel [8]. In principal component analyses of beta-diversity they found no clustering by sample type, except that the supraglottic samples differed from the intrapulmonary sample communities. However, by performing unprotected BAL before PSB, residual BAL fluid might have affected the brush areas making them more similar to the BAL sample sites. Finally, 15 sampled subjects might not be sufficient to detect the differences we observed in the current study with more than 100 participants.",

But as we have shown, co-existing sample contamination likely also is an issue. The oropharyngeal microbiome has a known large biomass, with a high diversity. By passing through this cavity, contamination to the outside of the bronchoscope including its tip is inevitable. Use of suction will contaminate the working channel [7]. Since the oral biomass is much greater than the airway biomass, even a small contamination will have a disproportionate effect on the supposed airway microbiome if the unprotected measurements are performed through the working channel. Using the working channel for unprotected lavage repeatedly at different lobes will lead to contamination from one lobe to another. Using larger volume lavage may negate this effect to some degree, but not eliminate the problem.",

A direct comparison of protected and unprotected lavage from the same lobe is impossible, as any washing will impact the contents of later washings.

[7] sampled laboratory reagents, the bronchoscope itself during various parts of the procedure, and the oropharyngeal microbiome in addition to BAL through the working channel and PSBs. They concluded that the microbiome from the lower respiratory tract was indiscriminate from the oropharyngeal microbiome irrespective of sampling method. However, the study included only one PSB per sampling, had lower sequencing depth than the current study, included only six healthy individuals and there were no adjustments made for OTUs seen in the negative control samples [7]. Hogan\net al. compared PSB, and SVL samples of nine CF patients [19]. For eight CF patients who had PSB and SVL taken from the same lobe, diversity was consistently higher in the PSB samples [19], the opposite of our findings. Hogan\net al. employed the PSB only at visible mucus plugs, and the airways of adult CF patients are perhaps no longer representing a low biomass environment.

However, some potential weaknesses should be acknowledged. First, we have not performed quantitative PCR, and thus cannot conclude regarding the amount of 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples before amplification. Second, our analyses do not include a mock community, and we are therefore not able to provide sequencing error rates for the current study. We could also have spiked our samples with bacteria that would have indicated the efficiency of our DNA extraction. Third, pre-bronchoscopy all participants received 0.4\u2005mg salbutamol. This was done for obtaining pre-bronchoscopy post-bronchodilator lung function values, but had the added benefit of protecting against procedural bronchospasm. Salbutamol was given as an aerosol through large volume spacers that are cleaned daily, and we are not aware of reports on contamination through metered dose inhalers. Furthermore, since both patients and controls received salbutamol, our conclusions should not be affected. Fourth, some results are difficult to compare with those of other authors because of differences in DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing and bioinformatic approach. This is the result of a field where standards for 16S rRNA gene amplicon studies of microbial communities currently do not exist. To facilitate reproducibility we have used well-documented analytic approaches and mostly default settings for our bioinformatic pipeline (QIIME), in addition to using primers and PCR recommendations from a major next-generation sequencing provider (Illumina). Regardless of this, we cannot rule out that some of our findings only pertain to the current set of methodological choices such as the choice of sequencing hypervariable region V3V4 [34]. To minimise the influence of small/spurious OTUs we have excluded singletons by using default settings in our OTU picking, and removed OTUs that constituted less than 0.005% of the total number of sequences.",
