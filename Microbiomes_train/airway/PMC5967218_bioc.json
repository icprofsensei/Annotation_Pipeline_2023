The design and profile of the clinical trial, in which the primary outcome was the development of infectious complications after colorectal resection, were described elsewhere22. Briefly, patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery were eligible to participate in this study and were enrolled between June 2008 and December 2013. Exclusion criteria were current routine use of probiotics or synbiotics, preferring or disliking taking probiotics or synbiotics and a schedule that did not allow for synbiotic intervention for more than seven days before surgery. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a synbiotics group or a control group. Randomization was performed using a computer-based randomization programme, without stratification or weighted minimization. Eligible patients were informed that 50 per cent of them would receive no treatment corresponding with synbiotic intervention (control group) and that assignment to the synbiotics or control groups would be based on a randomization programme, with written informed consent before participating in the trial. Every patient received standard pre- and post-operative care, including antibiotic treatment, regardless of which group the patient was assigned to. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Nagoya Daini Red Cross Hospital. An English-language summary of the protocol was submitted (registration ID UMIN000003439) to the Clinical Trials Registry managed by the University Hospital Medical Information Networks in Japan (http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/). The sample collection of mucus of the surgically resected intestines and the analysis of mucosa-attached microbiota in this study were planned in the original protocol of the study, as a secondary outcome of the clinical trial.",

Heterogeneous and conflicting results concerning the composition of the human ileal microbiota have been reported previously, presumably due to the limited number of individuals, high inter-individual variations and differences in sampling methods or bias caused by the disease state. Furthermore, little information is available regarding the effects of synbiotics/probiotics on the ileal microbiota. This study was an attempt to examine the composition of the microbiota attached to or embedded in the mucus layer of the terminal ileum, using a relatively large number of samples and to assess the effects of oral administration of synbiotics on the ileal microbiota.",

There are a few published data concerning the survival or maintenance of probiotics strains in the small intestine19. L. casei strain Shirota and B. breve strain Yakult, administered as probiotics, were detected in 42 and 76 per cent, respectively, of the ileal samples from the synbiotics group, while these species were detected at about tenfold higher levels in 100 per cent of the faecal samples following synbiotics treatment22. Thus, it is likely that such probiotic species become highly abundant members of the population after passing through the terminal ileum into the colon.",

This composition is similar to those reported for the human ileum, mostly from biopsy samples, and likely represents the normal ileal microbial population1,2,8,9,14. It has been reported that facultative anaerobes constitute a substantial part of the ileal microbial community in studies examining ileal effluent from ileostomies13,14. The diffusion of oxygen inward from the ileostomy port may have influenced the growth of the obligate anaerobes, allowing facultative anaerobes to predominate14. Alternatively, retrograde flow of the contents of the large intestine into the small intestine may account for the higher levels of obligate anaerobes in the studies of patients without ileostomies17. In addition, there is a possibility that the difference between surface-adherent and luminal microbial populations may have affected the results of the ileal microbiota5.",

Therefore, our microbiological data may represent the microbiome of elderly people because ageing profoundly affects the composition of intestinal microbiota31.
