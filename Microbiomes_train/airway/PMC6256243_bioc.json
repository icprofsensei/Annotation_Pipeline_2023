There was significantly lower microbial diversity and richness in lung cancer patients when compared to the control group (Shannon index, P < 0.01; Ace index, P < 0.0001). Based on the analysis of similarities, the composition of the microbiota in lung cancer patients also differed from that of the control group (r = 0.454, P < 0.001, unweighted UniFrac; r = 0.113, P < 0.01, weighted UniFrac). The bacterial genera Sphingomonas (P < 0.05) and Blastomonas (P < 0.0001) were relatively higher in non-smoking female lung cancer patients, whereas Acinetobacter (P < 0.001) and Streptococcus (P < 0.01) were higher in controls. Based on Spearman's correlation analysis, a significantly positive correlation can be observed between CK7 and Enterobacteriaceae (r = 0.223, P < 0.05). At the same time, Napsin A was positively associated with genera Blastomonas (r = 0.251, P < 0.05). TTF-1 exhibited a significantly positive correlation with Enterobacteriaceae (r = 0.262, P < 0.05). Functional analysis from inferred metagenomes indicated that oral microbiome in non-smoking female lung cancer patients were related to cancer pathways, p53 signaling pathway, apoptosis and tuberculosis.",

                    "text": "Recently, the study of oral microbiome has developed from oral diseases to systemic diseases, even systemic cancers (6\u201312). It has been proposed that oral microbiome play a causal role in the dynamic equilibrium with the immune-inflammatory response of the host (13, 14). The human respiratory tract is the primary and consistent entry point for numerous microorganisms, primarily airborne, but also those transferred through saliva. Oral bacterial communities may originate from the oropharynx and tracheobronchial or from the environment through inhalation, and probably seed the lungs with oral bacteria (15, 16). The association extends into the systemic circulation and holds the answer for understanding disease and developing non-invasive approaches to health care (17\u201320). However, cigarette smoking may lead to oral microbiome imbalance, thereby causing potential shifts in functional pathways, and having implications for smoking-related diseases (21). Previous studies on oral microbiome in lung cancer have not stratified clinical samples based on the smoking status and fully evaluated confounding factors such as smoking on the discovered bacterial biomarkers (18). Furthermore, there has been no report on characterizing oral microbiome in non-smoking female lung cancer patients.",

The main goal of this paper is to place into perspective different experimental and methodological views, to better understand the effect of oral microbiota changes on disease onset or during different disease stages. In this pilot study, we performed a comprehensive comparison of the salivary microbiota of non-smoking female lung cancer patients and that of healthy control subjects, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We characterized the variation in salivary microbiome balance in non-smoking female lung cancer patients and the dysbiosis of the salivary microbiome, based on structure, composition, and function. We also identified the relationship between salivary microbiota and immunocytochemistry markers containing thyroid transcription factor(TTF-1), Napsin A and cytokeratin(CK7), as well as the specific microbial signatures of lung cancer (24, 25). The role of oral microbiota composition is important to evaluate how salivary microbial biomarkers at the community level could improve assessment for individuals and populations at risk, especially with respect to developing non-invasive diagnostic tests.",

Figure \u200bFigure22 illustrates the per subject bacterial taxonomy distribution at the genus and phylum level. It can be seen that the inter-individual variation in taxonomic composition is high and that no taxa is dominantly present among all individuals at the sequencing depth employed. Venn diagrams are used to evaluate the number and identity of the shared OTUs between the cancer and the control groups. The result indicates that 64.08% (66/103) and 5.82% (6/103) of the core OTUs were identified in these two groups (Figure \u200b(Figure3A).3A). At the phylum level, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla representing over 97% of the total phyla in both the cancer and control groups. The microbiome composition was dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria (71.80% \u00b1 23.22% in patients and 69.35% \u00b1 18.97% (s.d.) in controls) and Firmicutes (13.74% \u00b1 15.96% in patients and 16.22% \u00b1 16.83% (s.d.) in controls), followed by Bacteriodetes (11.88% % \u00b1 17.06% in patients and 11.93% \u00b1 10.82% (s.d.) in controls; Figure \u200bFigure3B).3B). The genus Acinetobacter (16.79% \u00b1 22.70% in patients and 21.48% \u00b1 20.42% (s.d.) in controls) dominated the microbiome, followed by Streptococcus with a high variation (8.19% \u00b1 12.64% in patients and 10.76% \u00b1 13.91% (s.d.) in controls).

A high-throughput method was used to analyze bacterial populations in the saliva samples of non-smoking female lung cancer subjects and matched controls. It was found that there was lower microbial diversity and richness and obvious dysbiosis in the salivary microbiota of non-smoking female lung cancer patients, and the structure also differed when compared to that of the healthy controls. There is also evidence that certain clinical immunocytochemistry markers may be correlated with the variation in salivary microbiome.

Several studies have observed effects of smoking on oral bacteria (21). Quite often, lung cancer is considered as a disease of smokers, however there have been limited efforts to study lung cancer in non-smokers (3, 42). Recently, major differences in terms of gender, and molecular and clinical-pathological discrepancy in non-smokers and smokers with lung cancer have been identified, indicating that they may not be the same disease (2, 12). It was also suggested that gender-dependent hormones could play a potential role in the development of lung cancer, based on the fact that lung cancer in female non-smokers exhibited a higher proportion compared with male non-smokers (5, 43). It is as yet unknown whether there is a greater contribution of risk factors other than smoking to the increased risk of carcinogenesis in non-smoking female patients (44). Non-smoking female lung cancer patients are considered a different population (45) and our unique study population is a major strength of our study, as the correlation between lung cancer and oral microbiome could be suitably studied because the effect of smoking was excluded.",

Recent studies also identified Streptococcus in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (46) and cystic fibrosis (CF) lung microbiota (47). Under certain circumstance, Streptococcus could become potentially invasive to target the host fibronectin. Thereafter, a cytokine response could be induced to promote inflammation and further lead to carcinogenesis (48, 49). Blastomonas and Sphingomonas were previously identified as present in relatively high abundance in pneumonia patients (50). They also have a critical impact in systemic immune responses and affect the therapy for COPD and lung cancer (51, 52).",

When there is any disturbance in this balance of the immune system, the symbiotic relationship could shift, causing extensive colonization, and growth of conditioned pathogens.

TTF-1 and CK7 exhibited a significantly positive correlation with Enterobacteriaceae, and Napsin A was positively associated with genus Blastomonas. The major advantage of this study is the novel hypothesis and the first report on the relationship between salivary microbiota and immunoreactivity markers in non-smoking female lung cancer patients. The results provide novel insights that are important for studies on salivary microbiome associated with lung cancer in non-smoking women, and which correlate with immunocytochemistry markers. TTF-1 is found in epithelial cells from thyroid and lung tumors. Studies have shown that TTF-1 could play a critical role in the pathogenesis of primary lung adenocarcinoma (25, 56). CK7 is clinically used to label certain types of normal and neoplastic glandular epithelia, which may be positive in lungs (57). As a member of the aspartic proteinase family, Napsin A is expressed in healthy lungs and is also frequently expressed in lung adenocarcinomas. Using immunohistochemistry for TTF-1, CK7 and Napsin A, we can reduce the false diagnosis rate due to aberrant immunoreactivity and thus increase reliability (58).",

However, it is not necessarily that the functions of the microbiota are solely dependent on any one of these interactions, and alterations in these relationships may affect human health and cause disease (60). These bacteria may shed different microbial bioactive molecules and affect the host (69). It is known that apoptosis is highly regulated and plays an important role in immune response and tumorigenesis (70, 71). The p53 signaling pathway is recognized as a potential risk factor in lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis and survival (72). The observed up-regulation in the p53 signaling pathways suggests potential pathogenic functions of these salivary microbiota. These findings suggest that oral microbiome potentially regulate of lung cancer cell apoptosis through p53 pathway, albeit it is not the exclusive pathway in this process.",
