Although high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes provides enormous amounts of census data, accurate identification of taxa in these large datasets remains problematic because widely used computational approaches do not resolve closely related but distinct organisms. We used a computational approach that relies on information theory to reanalyze the human oral microbiome. This analysis revealed organisms differing by as little as a single rRNA nucleotide, with dramatically different distributions across habitats or individuals. Our information theory-based approach in combination with habitat analysis demonstrates the potential to deconstruct entire microbiomes, detect previously unrecognized diversity, and provide deep insight into microbial communities in health and disease.",

A high-resolution method termed oligotyping overcomes this limitation by evaluating individual nucleotide positions using Shannon entropy to identify the most information-rich nucleotide positions, which then define oligotypes. We have applied this method to comprehensively analyze the oral microbiome. Using Human Microbiome Project 16S rRNA gene sequence data for the nine sites in the oral cavity, we identified 493 oligotypes from the V1-V3 data and 360 oligotypes from the V3-V5 data. We associated these oligotypes with species-level taxon names by comparison with the Human Oral Microbiome Database. We discovered closely related oligotypes, differing sometimes by as little as a single nucleotide, that showed dramatically different distributions among oral sites and among individuals. We also detected potentially pathogenic taxa in high abundance in individual samples. Numerous oligotypes were preferentially located in plaque, others in keratinized gingiva or buccal mucosa, and some oligotypes were characteristic of habitat groupings such as throat, tonsils, tongue dorsum, hard palate, and saliva. The differing habitat distributions of closely related oligotypes suggest a level of ecological and functional biodiversity not previously recognized. We conclude that the Shannon entropy approach of oligotyping has the capacity to analyze entire microbiomes, discriminate between closely related but distinct taxa and, in combination with habitat analysis, provide deep insight into the microbial communities in health and disease.",

The use of Sanger sequencing in these studies allowed species-level taxon assignment but limited the depth of sequencing and thus limited our understanding of the degree to which taxa occurred consistently across individuals. High-throughput sequencing methods allow a more complete assessment of bacterial richness, and the first studies applying next-generation sequencing methods to samples from the human mouth (4\u20136) indicated the complexity of the oral microbiome. However, their taxonomic resolution was limited by the use of de novo clustering, in which sequences that were more than 97% identical were grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as proxies for phylotypes.",

Results from these data have been published in several articles (7\u20139), including an in-depth description of the oral sites by Segata et al. (10). Although Segata et al. were able to identify similarities and differences among oral sites and provide genus-level characterization of oral microbial communities, a fuller understanding of the biology of the oral microbiota was hindered by their limited taxonomic resolution. The HMP adopted the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier (11), which does not classify below the genus level even when the underlying sequence information can differentiate species. Thus, both the genus-level taxonomy used by HMP and the OTU clustering used in other studies lumped together members of the oral microbiome that showed small differences in their rRNA genes.",

Among oral microbes, for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis have more than 99% similarity in their 16S rRNA gene sequences but substantial differences in their gene complement, leading to distinct phenotypic and ecological characteristics (14, 15). For the human mouth, being a comparatively well-studied habitat, we know of many such examples of species that differ from one another by less than 3% in rRNA sequence and for which clustering at a 97% identity level is clearly unsatisfactory because it would group such species into the same OTU. Some authors have used more stringent thresholds; Dewhirst et al. (1), for example, used a 1.5% distance criterion to define Human Oral Taxon boundaries when named strains are absent. Clustering to any percentage, however, is an arbitrary process. In principle, a single nucleotide change over the \u223c1,500 bases in the 16S rRNA gene, corresponding to a 0.07% difference, could be a tag for a unique genomic, taxonomic, and functional entity.",

Oligotyping facilitates the identification of biologically relevant groups by using Shannon entropy (17), and is thus conceptually different from widely used methods that rely on pairwise sequence similarity. Shannon entropy, a measure of information content, identifies the nucleotide sites that show high variation. Oligotyping makes use of the fact that phylogenetically important differences occur at specific positions in the gene, causing high variation at these positions, whereas many sequencing errors are, to a first approximation, randomly distributed along the sequence (18, 19). Concatenation of only the high-information nucleotide positions defines oligotypes, which are then used to partition sequencing data into high-resolution groups while discarding the redundant information and noise. In this way, oligotyping allows the identification of taxa that differ by as little as a single nucleotide in the sequenced region.",

We analyzed the distribution of each oligotype across the sampled oral sites and among individual volunteers, and we characterized the diversity of the normal human oral microbiome within each site. By discriminating highly similar sequences we detected different microbial communities among oral sites, and site-specialists at the subspecies level, which were previously undetectable by standard approaches for classification and clustering.

In our analyses, oligotypes were defined by as few as three nucleotide positions (for Epsilonproteobacteria, the least species-rich group we oligotyped) and as many as 28 (for Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes). Sequences belonging to an oligotype are identical at the canonical nucleotide positions but may differ at other sites owing to several factors, including noise arising from sequencing errors and polymorphisms that were too rare to be distinguishable from noise. We will hereafter use the term \u201coligotype\u201d as shorthand for \u201cthe representative sequence,\u201d which is operationally defined as the most abundant unique sequence belonging to an oligotype.",

Some groups of two or more named species in HOMD are identical over the \u223c250-nucleotide regions covered in our dataset; these species were, naturally, indistinguishable by any method using these data, and an oligotype matched to such a set of sequences was assigned multiple species names, e.g., Streptococcus salivarius/vestibularis.

To what extent are they markers for important functional differences or to what extent do they represent sequence variants of little functional significance? A key approach to answering this question is to determine whether the oligotypes show preferences for different oral habitats that would suggest differences in ecological adaptation and hence function.",

Approximately one-third of oligotypes were detected almost exclusively in plaque, whereas 5% were detected almost exclusively in KG. We implemented a method that uses the t statistic to calculate the site preference of each oligotype across the oral sites (Materials and Methods). By this metric, 147 oligotypes of V1-V3 were significantly more abundant in SUBP, SUPP, or both at P < 0.01, and together made up more than two-thirds of plaque reads but only 11% or fewer reads at each of the other oral sites (Dataset S4). Similarly, in V3-V5 140 oligotypes were significantly more abundant in SUBP, SUPP, or both and represented more than 60% of plaque reads and 10% or fewer at each of the other oral sites. Twenty V1-V3 oligotypes were significantly more abundant in KG, accounting for 19% of the overall KG data, 3% of BM, and 2% or less at each of the other oral sites. There were 22 oligotypes from V3-V5 significantly more abundant in KG and accounting for 31% of the overall KG data, 7% of BM, and 3% or less at each of the other oral sites. In addition to these KG-specific oligotypes, a small number of very abundant oligotypes with strongly differential distributions contributed to the distinctiveness of KG from plaque and TD. For example, a single V1-V3 oligotype, identical to Streptococcus mitis, contributed 33\u201346% of the data from KG, BM, and HP but was significantly less abundant at other sites (Dataset S4). This one oligotype therefore was responsible for a significant fraction of the overall similarity of KG, BM, and HP seen in Fig. 1.",

                    "text": "Most oligotypes demonstrate preferential distribution among oral sites, but do closely related oligotypes show similar preferences or do they show differences in distribution suggestive of underlying functional differences? Both situations occur and are exemplified in the genus Neisseria (Fig. 2). In V3-V5 there were five abundant oligotypes of Neisseria (Fig. 2A). Four of the five were detected abundantly in plaque, and one of these, Neisseria flavescens/subflava, made up nearly 100% of the Neisseria found in TD. Intriguingly, the fifth oligotype, N. flavescens/subflava_99.2%, made up the majority of Neisseria detected in KG but was rare at all other sampling locations. This oligotype differed by only two nucleotides from the primary oligotype of N. flavescens/subflava, corresponding to 99.2% similarity as shown in the heat map (Fig. 2A), but the marked difference in distribution of the two oligotypes suggests different functional roles caused by genomic differences for which the small difference in 16S rRNA gene sequence acts as a marker. In contrast, Neisseria pharyngis had a distribution very similar to that of Neisseria sicca/mucosa/flava, except being in lower abundance across all of the sites. The similarity of habitat distribution is consistent with, but does not prove, their functional equivalence.",

For example, the two regions displayed different degrees of resolution of the same taxon, N. flavescens. The V1-V3 region distinguished three oligotypes of N. flavescens, all at least 98.8% identical to one another as shown in the heat map (Fig. 2B), whereas in the V3-V5 region a single oligotype corresponded to the group N. flavescens/subflava. Both the V1-V3 data and the V3-V5 data clearly showed a single Neisseria oligotype specific to KG, but this oligotype was identified in the V3-V5 data as 99.2% identical to N. flavescens/subflava and in the V1-V3 data was identical to Neisseria polysaccharea/meningitidis. Given the close similarity of the taxa, the short read data do not allow assignment of the KG-specific oligotype to any one of these taxa, but it can be assigned with confidence to the N. flavescens/polysaccharea/meningitidis grouping.",

In two genera, Fusobacterium and Campylobacter, a species abundant in the HP-SV-PT-TH-TD cluster of habitats was also represented by one or more oligotypes that were nearly exclusive to KG (Fusobacterium periodonticum and Campylobacter concisus, respectively). In the genus Porphyromonas, a taxon (HOT 279) that was abundant throughout the mouth was also represented by three distinctive oligotypes found primarily in KG and with lesser abundance in BM. In the fourth example, the Veillonella genus, two oligotypes that differed by only a single nucleotide showed distinctive distributions, with one predominating in plaque and the other abundant in the HP-SV-PT-TH-TD cluster; both were identical to Veillonella parvula and Veillonella dispar, but the identity was to different reference strains of these species in HOMD. Additional major oral genera such as Actinomyces, Gemella, Granulicatella, Haemophilus, Leptotrichia, Rothia, Selenomonas, and Streptococcus contained oligotypes distinctive for two or all three oral habitat groupings (plaque, KG-BM, and HP-SV-PT-TH-TD) (Dataset S1). The results of our habitat analysis point to widespread functional diversity within the oral microbiota that is not well captured by genus- or even species-level assignments but is revealed by the higher phylogenetic resolution of oligotyping.",

For instance, the two abundant N. flavescens V1-V3 oligotypes (N. flavescens_99.6% and N. flavescens in Fig. 2B, shown in orange and bright green) differ by only a single nucleotide and have very similar distributions across the oral sites, averaged across individuals. Three hypotheses consistent with this information are (i) that the oligotypes represent two copies of the rRNA gene present in the same cell; (ii) that they represent two distinct microbial lineages that are present in similar relative abundances in each individual because they engage in a close mutualistic relationship with one another; or (iii) that they represent distinct lineages that can exist independently of each other and are subject to competition, selection, and stochastic variation. Hypotheses i and ii predict that the two oligotypes would be present in every individual in the same proportion, whereas hypothesis iii predicts that individuals would contain the oligotypes in differing proportions.",

For example, in the majority of subjects, the Neisseria population in TD was overwhelmingly dominated by a single oligotype that made up 90% of the Neisseria population found in the sample, but which oligotype was dominant varied from individual to individual, whereas it was generally consistent across the oral sites within an individual. Clearly the averages across subjects at each oral site, although useful as an overview, do not accurately represent the relative proportions of oligotypes in individual samples. The individual-level data clearly rule out the possibility that these closely related oligotypes of N. flavescens are distinct operons in the same cell, or that they represent distinct lineages each of which is part of the N. flavescens population in every individual. Instead, one of these oligotypes, in general, dominates any given TD sample to the near-exclusion of the others, indicating that they represent distinct microbial lineages that can occur in different individuals. The significance of oligotype dominance by individual is a question for further study.",

Two oligotypes differing by a single nucleotide, identified with Streptococcus mitis/oralis/peroris and Streptococcus infantis, are both present in every subject and in almost every sample from KG, BM, HP, SV, PT, and TH, in different proportions across the sites. Similarly, two oligotypes that differ by two nucleotides (equivalent to 99.2% sequence identity) and are identified as Streptococcus salivarius/vestibularis and Streptococcus parasanguinis/cristatus/australis/sinensis are both present in every TD sample and in most samples from HP, SV, PT, and TH, again in varying proportions across the sites. We conclude that these Streptococcus taxa, although closely related, are not functionally redundant, a conclusion consistent with their recognition as separate described species.",

We illustrate this phenomenon with the abundant genera Neisseria (Fig. 4) and Streptococcus (Fig. 5C), but a similar pattern held for all genera analyzed. Although individuals differed in the relative abundance of specific oligotypes at different sites, there was a clear tendency for correlation of the oligotype composition between sites within an individual. The two plaque sites, SUBP and SUPP, resembled one another within an individual subject; likewise the group HP, SV, PT, TH, and TD resembled each other. The Streptococcus sampled from KG and BM were similar, whereas the Neisseria in BM resembled those in the HP, SV, PT, TH, and TD group. This correlation across sites within an individual mouth suggests that factors tending to homogenize the microbial communities in similar habitats within a mouth, such as dispersal or host-specific selective regimes such as salivary composition, diet, or immune system characteristics, can be stronger than local effects that might cause these communities to differ, such as colonization priority effects and competition for space.",

To test the significance of this observation we analyzed plaque-associated oligotypes in V3-V5 with a strong SUBP preference judged by at least a threefold greater mean abundance in SUBP than in SUPP. The 44 oligotypes that satisfied these criteria matched a number of known or suspected periodontal pathogens, each of which is anaerobic, including Filifactor alocis, Eubacterium brachy, Prevotella oris, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia (Dataset S5). For comparison we assessed the 37 oligotypes that were preferentially detected in SUPP (Dataset S5); this list matched taxa such as Corynebacterium matruchotii, Streptococcus sanguinis/agalactiae, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, all of which are either aerobes or facultative anaerobes. The oligotypes that preferred SUBP made up a significantly higher fraction of the PT community relative to their SUBP abundance than did the SUPP-preferring oligotypes relative to their SUPP abundance (Fig. 6). Thus, it seems that the oligotypes that preferentially inhabit SUBP also show a preferential localization and relatively high abundance in the tonsils, to a far greater extent than do taxa that prefer SUPP. This suggests that the tonsils provide a habitat for anaerobes in the oral microbiota.",

The V3-V5 oligotype matching Neisseria flavescens/subflava (Fig. 2A), for example, was detected in 98% of individuals (Dataset S2) and thus could be considered \u201ccore\u201d at a threshold of 95%. In V1-V3, however, this taxon is decomposed into three oligotypes matching N. flavescens (Fig. 2B), which were detected in 87%, 86%, and 19% of individuals (Dataset S1). Thus, the greater resolution of V1-V3 for this taxon eliminates it from the core microbiome in V1-V3 at a 95% threshold. However, such a definition is not particularly satisfying because it depends strongly on the depth of sequencing, which determines the fraction of individuals in which a taxon is detectable, as well as depending on the phylogenetic resolution with which \u201ctaxon\u201d is defined.",

The presence of pathogens is of interest because the samples came from healthy sites in healthy volunteers screened using stringent criteria for oral health (20). Notably, oligotypes identical to several potential pathogens were detected in high abundance in a small number of samples. In the V3-V5 data, for example, the oligotype matching Moraxella catarrhalis dominated two throat samples with 43% and 63% of the sample, and the oligotype identical to Haemophilus aegyptius constituted 35% of one throat sample. The oligotype matching Porphyromonas gingivalis was detected in 11% of individuals, with a maximum abundance of 10.5% in one SUBP sample. The 26 Treponema oligotypes collectively reached a maximum abundance of 38% in one SUBP sample and made up at least 10% of the sample from SUBP in 11% of volunteers. The oligotype matching Streptococcus mutans reached 0.5% abundance in samples from 10% of individuals and constituted 10\u201312% of the plaque of one subject. Details of all these distributions can be found in Dataset S2. These results resolve potential pathogens from nonpathogens that were previously lumped together and they provide a baseline estimate for the carriage rate and abundance of potential pathogens in clinically healthy individuals.",

To address this question we included stool as well as oral samples collected from the same individuals in the dataset subjected to oligotyping. We found that stool and oral oligotypes separated cleanly; oral oligotypes were found in only trace amounts in stool and stool oligotypes only in trace amounts in the mouth (generally <0.01% overall; Datasets S1 and S2). Only one oligotype, matching the species Dialister invisus, was found in roughly equal proportions in both SUBP and stool samples; the occasional oral samples in which stool oligotypes were detected at >1% are consistent with cross-contamination of samples from the same subject (Dataset S6). These results indicate that the oral and stool environments are home to separate microbial taxa, despite the apparent commonalities at the genus level.",

The Shannon entropy metric may be considered the information theory counterpart of the coefficient of variation which has been used as an indicator of variation in gene expression studies. Oligotyping detects distinct sequence types independently from taxonomy and without clustering based on pairwise sequence similarity. The independence from taxonomy preserves the ability to detect taxa that were previously unknown, whereas the absence of clustering based on pairwise similarity allows the discrimination of very closely related sequences that may differ from each other by less than 1% over the sequenced region. User-curation steps in the oligotyping pipeline (16) mitigate pitfalls that might arise from random and nonrandom sequencing errors.",

This study breaks new ground by applying oligotyping to the analysis of an entire microbiome. We chose the phylum level as a starting point, oligotyping each phylum separately. In the case of the large and diverse phylum Proteobacteria, we chose to oligotype each of its classes separately. Oligotyping each phylum individually reduced the complexity of the supervision process, and the high-level starting point allowed us to encompass nearly all sequences as well as to avoid ambiguities resulting from conflicting or inconsistent taxonomy at lower levels of classification such as genus or even family. All together, our oligotyping accounted for more than 99% of the sequencing data generated from the nine sampled oral sites of healthy individuals by the HMP.",

Clustering sequences into OTUs based on arbitrary similarity thresholds is widely recognized as an unsatisfactory method, adopted out of necessity with large datasets but generating heterogeneous OTUs of limited biological relevance.

However, as we demonstrate here, short reads are fully capable of differentiating taxa as long as the taxa of interest are not identical in the sequenced region. Limitations arise from commonly used analysis methods, such as the RDP classifier, which reports an identification to the genus level even when more specific information is available, and pairwise alignment, which is unable to distinguish phylogenetically important variation from noise. Others have also noted that species-level information is present and have devised specific ways to exploit it (25\u201327). In contrast, oligotyping is designed to be a generally applicable method that can recover the full information available in sequences of any length. Although oligotyping does not require preexisting reference sequences to differentiate highly similar taxa, it is nevertheless useful to associate individual oligotypes with the vast reservoir of information available for many microbes. Thus, after oligotyping is complete, oligotypes may be associated with taxonomic names by using tools such as BLAST that rely on pairwise sequence similarity for classification. Such postoligotyping classification proved useful in our analysis of the oral microbiome.",

Likewise, targeted cultivation and genomic sequencing of the organisms represented by distinct N. flavescens oligotypes (Fig. 4) would provide insights into the population dynamics that influence which of these apparently competing strains establishes itself in a given host.",

Instead of merely recognizing the existence of sequence variation within a taxon, it is possible to associate a particular sequence variant with a differential localization and thus with a likely difference in the underlying biology of the strain carrying the sequence variant. Similarly, the sampling by HMP of a large group of subjects allowed us to identify whether particular oligotypes frequently co-occur in individuals or are generally mutually exclusive. This information serves as a basis to generate hypotheses about the functional significance and the mechanisms behind these different distributions, and can guide future, hypothesis-driven studies. For example, does the mutual exclusiveness pattern of closely related oligotypes arise from founder effects, priority effects, or competitive exclusion among functionally indistinguishable lineages, or does it arise from environmental factors such as host characteristics or phage predation?",

Instead, most major oral genera have oligotypes specialized for at least two of the three major habitats: plaque, KG-BM, and the HP-SV-PT-TH-TD grouping. Often these oligotypes are very similar, within 98.5% sequence identity, rendering the overall pattern undetectable unless a high-resolution method is used. The exceptions, genera represented primarily in one habitat, are mostly specialized to plaque, such as Corynebacterium and Treponema (10), as well as a few specialized to SV. Genera represented in all three habitat groups include those containing obligate anaerobes such as Fusobacterium and Veillonella, which suggests that anaerobic microhabitats occur in regions such as TD and KG as well as in SUBP and PT. This pattern of subgenus adaptation present in many genera suggests a coadaptation of the oral microbial community and its coevolutionary expansion into distinct oral habitats. The microbiota themselves constitute a major feature of the environment for other microbes, and thus adaptation to the environment likely includes coadaptation to other members of the microbiome.",

Our results suggest that the tonsils present a habitat that specifically selects for the growth of periodontal anaerobes outside of the periodontal pocket. This conclusion is consistent with culture-based studies that have shown that anaerobes can be recovered from surface swabs of the tonsils (e.g., ref. 28). It is also consistent with a recent study of the tonsillar crypts using pyrosequencing, which detected a broad range of microbes and suggested that the tonsillar crypts represent a habitat more hospitable to the periodontal microbiota than mucosal surfaces (27). Taken together, the evidence of plaque anaerobes in tonsils in the healthy subject population suggests that such colonization of the tonsils is not inherently pathological but instead represents a physiological mechanism for encouraging contact of potentially pathogenic microbes with lymphoid tissue.",

The minimum membership in an oligotype was set by the \u201cminimum substantive abundance\u201d criterion used for oligotyping each phylum, and was 500 for most phyla and 50 for those containing fewer than 100,000 reads overall (Spirochaetes and the class Epsilonproteobacteria). Legitimate sequence variants that were rare as a proportion of the overall community, and were therefore represented in the data by fewer than the cutoff number of counts, were discarded as indistinguishable from the noise arising from sequencing errors. Deeper sequencing would allow for greater discriminatory power and the detection of more oligotypes.",

An oligotype in the 10th percentile of the abundance spectrum was therefore represented by less than one read per sample on average. Even more abundant oligotypes will sometimes be represented by single reads: the oligotype matching S. mutans, for example, had a membership of 2,671 reads in V3-V5 (the 52nd percentile) and was represented by only a single read, across all of the oral sites, in one-fourth of the 75 subjects in whom this oligotype was detected.

The two plaque sites, SUBP and SUPP, resemble each other within individuals as well as overall. Factors differentiating the subgingival from the supragingival environment, such as the bathing of the plaque biofilm in SV vs. crevicular fluid (29), seem to be relatively insignificant for the majority of plaque oligotypes, which are common to both SUPP and SUBP.

It has revealed predominance of certain oligotypes within individuals, and correlations between sites within individual mouths, that would not have been seen at the genus level. It has revealed the distribution in healthy individuals of potentially pathogenic taxa. In general, it has enabled a better understanding of the distribution of precisely defined taxa within the mouth, and demonstrated a level of ecological and functional biodiversity not previously recognized. The ability to extract maximum information from sequencing data opens up new possibilities for the analysis of the dynamics of the human oral microbiome. We anticipate that the oligotyping approach will be equally useful when applied to other microbiomes and that it will enable similar insights into a variety of microbial communities.",

Aagaard et al. (20) describe methods for subject screening and recruitment, demographic and clinical data for participants, and sampling methods. The 16S rRNA gene tags were amplified from samples using primers targeting two hypervariable regions, V1-V3 and V3-V5. We used the sequencing data generated from the 16S rRNA gene amplicons and analyzed both regions separately. Details of the initial quality filtering, quality trimming, and chimera removal of the tag sequences we used in this study are described by The HMP Consortium (7). Briefly, during the quality-filtering step, the HMP Consortium removed sequencing reads that contained one or more ambiguous base calls, as well as the ones with homopolymer regions of 8 or more bases. Reads were then trimmed from where the average Q-score dropped below 35 within a 50-bp-long window moved along each read. Quality-trimmed reads that were shorter than 200 bases were also removed from the analysis (7). From all 242 subjects who participated in the study with at least one sample, we used only the subjects from whom samples were available for all nine oral sites. The number of individuals satisfying this criterion was 148 for the V3-V5 and 77 for the V1-V3 datasets. The total number of samples we analyzed was 1,475 for V3-V5 because five subjects lacked stool samples, and 770 for the V1-V3 (all subjects had stool samples). Volunteer ID numbers and number of reads retained per volunteer are reported in Datasets S1 and S2.",

For Proteobacteria, because of its size and complexity, we oligotyped the classes Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Epsilonproteobacteria separately. Alphaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria constituted less than 0.05% of the reads overall and were not oligotyped. The relative abundance of reads classified within phylum TM7 was low in the V3-V5 dataset (an average of 0.03%); however, this phylum was much more abundant in the V1-V3 dataset (an average of 2.3%). Hence, in addition to the six phyla we used for the V3-V5 dataset, we also included the phylum TM7 for analysis of the V1-V3 dataset. The number of high-quality reads for the V1-V3 dataset classified within the seven selected phyla was 4,483,032 and represented 99.39% of all reads for 77 subjects.",

We retrimmed the data so that the reads within each phylum have the same starting and ending positions, using an approach designed to maximize the length of the trimmed reads by eliminating shorter reads but never eliminating more than 10% of the reads from any phylum (Python script \u201co-smart-trim\u201d is available in the oligotyping pipeline). This criterion led to trimming of the data to \u223c245 bases for the V1-V3, and \u223c235 bases for the V3-V5 datasets. Datasets S1 and S2 report the average read lengths for each phylum before and after the quality trimming. The trimmed V1-V3 data contained the V3 hypervariable region but was trimmed just before the V2, whereas the trimmed V3-V5 data contained the V5 hypervariable region but was trimmed just before the V4. Thus, despite the labels \u201cV1-V3\u201d and \u201cV3-V5,\u201d only a single hypervariable region (V3 or V5) was in fact present in each dataset after trimming. Finally, we aligned reads in each phylum individually using PyNAST (31), a template-based aligner, against Greengenes alignment templates (32) (October 6, 2010 release) before oligotyping analysis.",

After the initial calculation of Shannon entropy using the analyze-entropy script in the oligotyping pipeline, we ran oligotyping for each phylum (or Proteobacterial class) separately and supervised the process until each oligotype had converged, that is, until the remaining entropy was attributable to noise and/or the inclusion of additional nucleotide positions in the oligotype would not increase the degree to which the added oligotypes were differentially abundant in different samples (16), in this case different oral sites. To minimize the impact of sequencing errors on oligotyping results, we used a minimum substantive abundance criterion (M), which requires the most abundant unique sequence in an oligotype to be more abundant than the user-defined value of M. We set M to 500 for all phyla and Proteobacterial classes except for Epsilonproteobacteria and Spirochaetes, the groups with the smallest number of reads, for which M was set to 50. M values averaged 0.15% of the total number of reads in all phyla analyzed in both datasets and never exceeded 0.5% for any individual phylum. Oligotypes not meeting the minimum substantive abundance criterion were discarded as noise, although these might have included valid but rare oligotypes for which we have insufficient data for proper analysis. This noise filtering removed 9.3% of reads from the V1-V3 dataset and 3.8% of reads from the V3-V5 dataset. High-information positions resulting from systematic errors such as those introduced at homopolymer regions by 454 sequencing (18, 19, 33) are also detected during the oligotyping process and can be selectively disregarded through the user-curation steps of oligotyping. Because we ensured the convergence criterion to be met only for oral sites, oligotypes composed of reads found mostly in stool samples may contain unexplained diversity of very closely related organisms; hence, the diversity of stool samples may have been underestimated in our final results.",

These observation matrices report counts (i.e., number of reads assigned to each oligotype in each sample). We then converted counts to percent abundances within each sample and used these normalized relative abundances for all further analyses. To assign taxonomy for each oligotype, we searched representative sequences of our oligotypes against the HOMD (16S rRNA RefSeq Version 12.0 obtained from www.homd.org on January 16, 2013), using blastn (34) version 2.2.26+, the National Center for Biotechnology Information\u2019s open-source tool.

                    "text": "We developed an ad-hoc classification algorithm using Student t test to associate each oligotype with one or more sampling sites where that oligotype is most differentially abundant. Our algorithm first creates a list of all possible binary mappings of ten sampling sites (BM, HP, KG, PT, stool, SUBP, SUPP, SV, TD, and TH) to generate all two-group combinations of sampling sites. For example, the first map in the list ({1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}) would identify BM in group 1 and the rest of the sampling sites in group 2. The second map in the list ({1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}) would identify BM and HP in group 1, and so on. The total number of binary combinations of 10 sampling sites is 1,024; however, this number includes two maps to be discarded where only one group has all of the sites and the other group is empty (the case of {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} and {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}). Each of the remaining 1,022 maps would also have a symmetrical counterpart that can be discarded, because both would result in identical groupings of sites (i.e., {1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} and {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}). Hence, our algorithm investigates the distribution of an oligotype in 10 sampling sites using 511 maps. For instance, for the map {1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, the algorithm places relative abundances of the oligotype observed in sites BM and HP from all individuals in group 1, and relative abundance values from the remaining sites in group 2. Then it tests whether the central tendencies of group 1 and group 2 differ significantly using Student t test. The map that yields the largest absolute t statistic is used to associate the oligotype with sampling site(s) listed in group 1 (if t is positive) or in group 2 (if t is negative). Datasets S1 and S2 report the oligotype\u2013site associations for each oligotype along with the recovered statistic and significance values. The purpose of our approach is similar to the purpose of LEfSe, which is a biomarker discovery package that can associate taxa with environments based on differential abundance profiles (35). However, in our algorithm an oligotype can be associated with multiple sampling sites, which is a critical requirement of our study given the nature of the dataset. Datasets S1 and S2 also report results of LEfSe analysis performed with default parameters for each oligotype for comparison.
