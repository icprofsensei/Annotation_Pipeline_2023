However, as approximately 30%\u201060% of health information is forgotten within one hour4 and as not all affected patients may even have access to professionally guided oral hygiene training, antimicrobial agents are often added as toothpaste ingredients to level out insufficient mechanical cleaning efficacy. Their anti\u2010inflammatory efficacy in the treatment of gingivitis has been recently reviewed.5 The combination of amine fluoride and stannous fluoride (AmF/SnF2) showed antimicrobial and plaque\u2010reducing, that is, anti\u2010adhesive properties against in situ oral biofilms grown on intraoral splints.6 Likewise, studies with hydroxyapatite (HA) containing oral care products reported anti\u2010adhesive effects7, but observed no specific antimicrobial effects of the hydroxyapatite particles in situ.8 To evaluate those different formulations under clinical conditions, a randomized controlled study was conducted with stage I and II periodontitis patients9 using either a HA\u2010 or an AmF/SnF2\u2010containing toothpaste for 12\u00a0weeks while receiving periodontal therapy.10 Results of this study showed no differences between toothpastes in reducing the visible plaque on teeth or interfering with the de novo plaque formation. However, in this study, only quantitative plaque parameters were evaluated, so it remains open, if there are any compositional changes of bacteria within the dental plaque microbiome during the 12\u2010week study period.",

Inclusion criteria were pocket probing depths (PPD) of \u22654\u00a0mm at a minimum of four teeth (except third molars). Age \u226518\u201075\u00a0years. Patients must have had at least 10 natural teeth (except third molars) and were nonsmokers. Exclusion criteria were known systemic diseases that may influence the periodontal conditions and also regular consumption of drugs that may interfere with periodontal conditions. Patients undergoing or requiring extensive dental or orthodontic treatment, were pregnant or breastfeeding were also excluded from the study. Furthermore, patients undergoing professional periodontal therapy during the 6\u00a0months prior to baseline and patients with periodontal pockets \u22656\u00a0mm in more than two sextants were excluded.

At all sample teeth, three different tooth sites were sampled: the supragingival buccal/lingual sites that are expected to be highly accessible for daily oral hygiene, the supragingival interproximal sites, expected to be poorly accessible for daily oral hygiene, and also, at subgingival sites expected to be not accessible for daily oral hygiene. Interestingly sub\u2010 and interproximal sites harbored similar proportions of Fusobacterium and Prevotella previously associated with periodontitis25 (Figure\u00a02). These sites differed to the buccal/lingual sites that contained mainly Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Rothia previously associated with periodontal health.25 Those findings are partly supported by the study of Simon\u2010Soro et\u00a0al27 who further distinguished lingual from buccal sites. They used 500\u00a0bp 454 pyrosequencing and found that especially Streptococcus was highly prevalent at exposed buccal and nearly absent in more covered lingual sites. Intra\u2010individual differences between lingual, buccal, and oral mucosa were also found using 400\u00a0bp 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina HiSeq 2500.28 Here regardless of tissue type (mucosal, palatal, dental), surface\u2010associated bacterial communities varied along an ecological gradient from covered to more exposed surfaces. Taken this together, the limited access of oral niches might influence the microbiome composition and improvement of homecare daily plaque removal.",

This is supported by similar findings of previous microbiota\u2010based studies.11, 36, 37, 38 However, those studies did not include different toothpaste formulations. Other studies found qualitative microbiota changes after periodontal therapy at very favorably responding sites.39, 40 According to our pooled and randomized sample strategy, we cannot separate the individual well responding from non\u2010responding sites, but moreover give insights into the global changes of the individual microbiota. Furthermore, these findings suggest that mechanical periodontal therapy might be able to reduce the total bacterial load, but not always induce a global compositional microbiome change in every patient. Alternatively, microbiome changes might represent primarily habitational changes, that is, decreasing pocket depth after periodontal therapy. Therefore, those changes would be more pronounced at initial deep sites, which were not investigated by our study. Irrespective of using solely anti\u2010adhesive or anti\u2010adhesive and antimicrobial agents in toothpastes, patients were clinically successfully treated.10\n",

No negative control toothpaste group without any measurable effect on bacteria was included. Therefore, we cannot assess the extent of the antimicrobial or anti\u2010adhesive effect for each toothpaste alone. The patient population was older than patients from the referenced toothpaste/rinsing studies above. And our patients were already performing adequate oral hygiene and had only limited signs of gingival inflammation. Furthermore, by including only patients with mild to moderate periodontitis, the observed improvements of pockets and plaque parameters are expected to be lower; therefore, habitational changes were moderate. This might have an influence on detecting changes in microbiome composition, after therapy. The known center effect from the main study10 was also observed in alpha diversity in this study and had to be considered statistically as a confounding cofactor. Additionally, DESeq2 does not allow to include random effects in the aRSV level analysis, for example, to account for dependencies between multiple samples from the same patient.",
