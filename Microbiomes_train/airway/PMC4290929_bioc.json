While most CF patients experience periods of stability, pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) can occur multiple times per year and result in permanent damage to the lungs. Little is known of the shift from a period of stability to a PE, but this shift is likely to be attributed to changes in the bacterial community. Here, we identified changes in the lung microbiota to determine if they reflect patient health, indicate the onset of exacerbations, or are related to antibiotic treatment. In contrast to most bacterial studies on CF, we collected weekly samples from an adult CF patient over a period of 3 years and performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina sequencing on those samples. While many DNA-based studies have shown the CF microbiota to be relatively stable, we observed an increase in the total bacterial abundance over time (P < 0.001), while the number of different taxa (bacterial richness) and the number of different taxa and their abundances (diversity) significantly decreased over time (P < 0.03), which was likely due to repeated antibiotic exposure. Using genus-specific primers with qPCR, we observed an increase in the abundance of Burkholderia multivorans, a CF-associated pathogen, prior to the occurrence of a PE (P = 0.006). Combining these DNA-based techniques with frequent sampling identified a potential initiator for exacerbations and described a response of the CF microbiota to time and antibiotic treatment not observed in previous CF microbiota studies.",

The exact cause of a PE, often identified by an increase in pulmonary disease symptoms, remains uncertain but is commonly attributed to factors associated with established bacteria, and possibly to viruses or newly acquired bacterial strains (7, 8). In 2004, Rogers et al. used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis to target the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in order to analyze DNA extracted from sputum samples from CF patients. This method of analysis revealed a complexity that included 15 species not previously identified in the lungs. The study by Rogers et al. laid the foundation for redefining CF as a polymicrobial disease (9). These culture-independent studies have led to clinical treatment for CF lung infections focused on multiple species instead of a single agent.",

If bacteria are involved in eliciting a PE, bacterial population changes could be used as an early indicator of a PE (11).",

The samples collected from this patient were sufficient to generate conclusions based on statistically significant changes in the microbiota. We identified a correlation between the time period shortly before the onset of a PE and an increase in the abundance of Burkholderia, a major CF pathogen within a microbial community dominated by Pseudomonas. Monitoring these changes to the microbiota allowed us to determine how individual taxa, including specific pathogens, change over time, change prior to a PE, and respond to antibiotic therapy.",

We defined four different treatment conditions as (i) before treatment, defined as samples collected \u226430 days prior to antibiotic treatment for a PE, (ii) treatment, defined as any sample collected during the administration of antibiotics used to treat a PE, (iii) recovery, defined as samples collected \u226430 days after antibiotic treatment for a PE, and (iv) stable, defined as any sample not meeting any of the above criteria. We used a series of linear models to evaluate whether these treatment categories were associated with differences in qPCR signals. Our linear models had terms for time (for Burkholderia or total bacteria) or time-squared (second-order model) for Pseudomonas, as well as terms for treatment category and interactions between time and treatment variables (see Table S2, models 3 and 4 in the supplemental material). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) (utilizing an F-test comparing the full model to a reduced model with interactions terms set to zero) found that P values associated with interactions terms were all >0.05. To simplify the interpretation of our models, we dropped the interaction terms, thus removing them as complicating conditional effects, to yield models 5 and 6 in Table S2. The fit from these models is shown in Fig. 1. An ANOVA (utilizing an F-test comparing the full model to a reduced model with terms for treatment set to zero) evaluating the null hypothesis that treatment has no effect was rejected for Burkholderia (P < 0.003), Pseudomonas (P < 0.0006), and 16S rRNA (P < 0.002), as measured by qPCR. In terms of our model, these P values can be interpreted as testing the hypothesis that separate lines for each treatment category have identical intercepts given a constant slope (for 16S rRNA and Burkholderia) or shape (for Pseudomonas). That is, we tested the null hypothesis that a single line (the reduced model) can fit the qPCR data as well as the four separate lines (the full model) shown in Fig. 1. Our model's rejection of this null hypothesis suggests that we are able to detect antibiotic treatment temporarily depressing bacterial load, despite the high variability of each individual measurement.",

Viewed this way, antibiotic treatment clearly temporarily depresses Pseudomonas (Fig. 2B) and 16S rRNA (Fig. 2C) but not Burkholderia (Fig. 2A). We could not use simple t tests to evaluate the statistical significances of these relationships because the data viewed in this way contain multiple samples from the same individual binned across time points, which would violate the assumption of independence in a test statistic that did not explicitly consider time. We can, however, use models 5 and 6 in Table S2 in the supplemental material to test the hypothesis that the intercepts (in Fig. 1) from the line of best fit for the data from any pair of treatment conditions are identical. Under this procedure, we find that the higher bacterial loads observed during the postantibiotic recovery time points, compared to those during treatment for Burkholderia (Fig. 2A), Pseudomonas (Fig. 2B), and 16S rRNA (Fig. 2C), are all statistically significant (Table 2). We also find that bacterial load is significantly lower in treatment than in before treatment for Pseudomonas (Fig. 2B) and 16S rRNA (Fig. 2C), with a nonsignificant trend for Burkholderia (Fig. 2A and Table 2). Our data are consistent with the conclusion that antibiotics relieve exacerbating symptoms by temporarily depressing the bacterial load.",

The abundance of Burkholderia is significantly higher (P = 0.006) in the before treatment time points, which indicate the beginning of a PE, than in the stable time points (Fig. 2A). Pseudomonas is less abundant before treatment than in the stable time period (Fig. 2B), but our model (model 6 of Table S2 in the supplemental material) does not assign significance to this difference (P = 0.32). No significant change was observed in the total bacterial load between the stable and before treatment time points. Interestingly, the change in abundance of Burkholderia exhibits a pattern consistent with a posttreatment rebound, even while the patient showed improved symptoms. Our data are therefore consistent with an increase in Burkholderia being associated with the onset of a PE but not as an indicator of overall patient health.",

In order to more fully characterize the microbial community, we utilized 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing on some of the sputum samples. Funding limited our analysis to 72 of the 130 samples, chosen based on their time of collection under the four treatment conditions (see above). The sequences were clustered with AbundantOTU+, and the consensus sequences for each OTU were classified to the family level using the RDP classifier (see Materials and Methods). Comparisons between the CF-associated taxa at the family and genus levels within our pipeline and within the QIIME pipeline showed a similar response to antibiotics and time (data not shown). We chose the family level because the RDP calls to the family level were generally consistent between our pipeline and a parallel analysis using the QIIME pipeline, but there was considerable divergence at the genus level (data not shown). Given the short sequence (<100 bp) reads of the Illumina sequencing technology we used, such divergence at more narrow taxonomic levels is not surprising between different analysis methods.",

No pattern of change in the relative abundances of the top five families was observed surrounding the occurrence of a PE. Pseudomonadaceae was the most dominant family and showed little change in its relative abundance in the majority of the sputum samples. An increase in the relative abundance of Burkholderiaceae or Streptococcaceae was observed only in those samples in which the relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae showed short-term decreases (Fig. 3A); this, however, did not correspond to the occurrence of a PE and likely reflects the compositional nature of relative abundance measures (28, 29). Little variation in relative abundance was observed over time when the other less abundant families were combined into the \u201cother\u201d category (Fig. 3B). Using model 10 (see Table S2 in the supplemental material), we were able to test the hypothesis that the relative abundance of any individual family significantly changed over time. We did not achieve significant results for this model for the abundant taxa Pseudomonadaceae, Burkholderiaceae, and Streptococcaceae. The slope of the fit for 14 of the less abundant families, however, did not exhibit a significant decrease, while the slope of the fit for one family significantly increased over time (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). The relative abundance of each of these less abundant families consisted of <0.5% of the total sequences. We conclude that for all but a few of the least abundant taxa, our sequencing data are consistent with overall stability over time.",

Our goals were to determine if changes in bacterial abundance may predict an oncoming PE and to identify changes in the microbiota associated with antibiotic use or time. While other studies have attempted to identify biomarkers that aid in the prediction of a PE and the progression of lung disease in CF (11, 30), ours is the first to obtain samples so frequently from a CF patient over a long-term period. Our study was based upon the assumption that a detectable shift in the bacterial community precedes a PE. Testing our assumption required a longitudinal study to reveal the relationship between disease progression, the occurrence of a PE, and various components of a bacterial community, such as the change in diversity, richness, or the abundances of specific members of the microbiota (31). Our goal was to determine if a bacteria-derived biomarker can be identified and result in antibiotic treatment being initiated early in the course of a PE and reduce the symptoms that would otherwise cause damage to the lungs. Identifying a change in microbiota that precedes a PE requires frequent patient sampling, since the length of time between the changes in the bacterial community and PE onset is unknown (14). Previous cross-sectional studies examining the diversity of the microbiota in the lungs of CF patients collected samples at a frequency or for a length of time that did not reveal potential short-term changes associated with a PE (32, 33).",

This change in absolute bacterial abundance between adjacent samples may be subject to misinterpretation if a sputum sample containing a low number of bacteria was compared to a sequential sample that originated from a region of the lungs containing a large number of bacterial cells. Recent culture-independent studies have revealed a spatial distribution of distinct microbial communities in the CF lung. Goddard et al. (34) and Willner et al. (35) both observed distinct clustering of microbial communities in various areas of the lung by examining explant lung samples. These studies suggest that since the origin of expectorated sputum cannot be identified, any two sputum samples collected from an individual patient are expected to vary. The degree to which the microbiota may vary between samples may be difficult to resolve using 16S rRNA gene sequencing due to, as Willner et al. (35) stated, \u201cspatial heterogeneities.\u201d Based on these studies and our small standard deviation in the qPCR data between at least three technical replicates for each sample (see Fig. 1), it is likely that the variation in our qPCR data may have occurred due to spatial distribution of dense bacterial clusters within the lungs. As we demonstrated across a 3-year period, a high variation between any two samples can be compensated for by frequent collection of samples.",

Interestingly, we observed a possible saturation phase of the most abundant pathogen, Pseudomonas, toward the second half of our study period. This saturation may reflect the effectiveness of the antibiotic regimen that was tailored to Pseudomonas. Consistent with this idea is the finding that Pseudomonas was significantly lower in abundance in the treatment category than in any of the other treatment status categories (Table 2). The second most abundant pathogen measured in our samples, Burkholderia, decreased in abundance during treatment compared to that before treatment, but this decrease was not significant (Table 2). The lack of a significant decrease in the abundance of Burkholderia in samples collected before treatment compared to those collected during treatment suggests that the antibiotic regimen was less effective against this taxon, which may be due to increased antibiotic resistance or other unidentified factors.",

Next-generation sequencing has shown that little change in diversity occurs over time in sputum samples collected from CF patients (31). A decade-long bacterial study by Zhao et al. (31) examined the diversity in sputum samples, which were collected and grouped according to treatment status, from six adult CF patients, three with stable lung disease and three with progressive lung disease. Bacterial diversity remained stable over the course of the study in the stable patients but showed a significant decrease over time in the progressive patients. The authors did detect a significant decrease in diversity during treatment for all six patients (31). Similar to the Zhao et al. study, we observed a significant decrease in diversity over time in our patient, an adult with CF who was considered to have progressive lung disease, but unlike in their study, diversity remained stable across changes in treatment status. A possible explanation for the difference in the change in diversity during treatment between these two studies may have been due to a difference in sampling frequency. Another possibility arises from our having used propidium monoazide (PMA) pretreatment. Rogers et al. (39) reported that diversity can be under- or overestimated without prior PMA treatment.",

We observed no significant change in richness in the samples collected prior to antibiotic treatment compared to that in the samples collected during periods of stability, although a highly significant decrease in richness was seen during antibiotic treatment. A similar decreased richness during antibiotic treatment has been reported in other studies that examined serially collected sputum samples (14). For example, Fodor et al. (37) observed an impact of antibiotic treatment on both the relative sequence abundances of seven OTUs and on taxon richness from sputum samples collected from 23 patients at the onset of a PE and at the end of treatment. Additionally, Daniels et al. (14) used TRFLP to show that mean taxon richness decreases in sputum samples as a response to antibiotic treatment for a PE. That richness is decreased during treatment in the Fodor and Daniels studies and significantly reduced during treatment in our study suggests there is a concomitant effect of antibiotics on bacteria other than the major pathogens (see Table S3 in the supplemental material).",

These results are consistent with those of previous studies that used pyrosequencing to characterize the microbial community and found high overall levels of stability (34, 37). In contrast, our qPCR results suggest a steady increase in bacterial load over time. We are investigating the possibility that the discrepancy between the two methods is caused by saturation effects and the compositional nature of the sequencing data. In sequencing reactions in which Pseudomonas represents the vast majority of sequencing reads, as it does here, increases in absolute Pseudomonas abundance may not be reflected by a corresponding increase in relative abundance. The discrepancy between our Burkholderia qPCR and sequencing results is harder to understand but may involve the saturation of nonquantitative PCR steps that are a necessary precursor to 16S rRNA sequencing, as well as complex compositional effects that can skew sequencing results in low-diversity environments (28, 29). Taken together, our qPCR results suggest that our sequencing results, as well as the sequencing results from other studies, may exaggerate the stability of the dominant pathogens within the low-diversity CF microbial community.",

Based on our sequencing data alone, time and antibiotic use appeared to decrease the number of different taxa in the lungs but only of those taxa that are the least abundant (see Table S3 in the supplemental material) in the sputum of our CF patient. That antibiotics usually alleviate PE symptoms while affecting the less abundant taxa suggests that identifying the role of taxa other than the major pathogens may be useful in understanding the progression of lung disease and the occurrence of exacerbations.",

For example, we observed a reduced load of Pseudomonas but not of Burkholderia during times of antibiotic use over our study period, throughout which there was no decline in patient lung function. The results suggest that antibiotics helped to maintain a relatively stable health condition but did not affect the persistent increase in Burkholderia, a potential driver of PE onset. Based on the qPCR results alone, we can speculate that if the greater recovery of Burkholderia after antibiotic treatment that we observed were to continue to exceed that of Pseudomonas, Burkholderia would eventually become the dominant pathogen.",

However, we were able to identify changes over time that have been only partially documented in other quantitative and deep-sequencing studies of the CF lung microbiota. These changes were identified because of the frequent sampling regimen used. The current sampling methods of a CF patient typically limit the identification of changes in the microbial community to after the PE has been diagnosed in a clinical setting. Frequent sampling increases the likelihood of collecting a pre-PE sample, which would be beneficial in studies aimed at identifying the biological initiators of a PE. The identification of microbiota indicators is the first step toward making this approach technically and financially viable in a clinical setting. We plan to similarly examine additional patients to determine if our observations represent a theme common to CF or if microbiota changes are patient specific.",
