This study aimed to identify clinically relevant subgroups of CRS patients based on distinct microbial signatures, with a comparison to the commonly used phenotypic subgrouping approach. The underlying drivers of these distinct microbial clusters were also investigated, together with associations with epithelial barrier integrity. Sinus biopsy specimens were collected from CRS patients (n\u2009=\u200923) and disease controls (n\u2009=\u20098). The expression of 42 tight junction genes was evaluated using quantitative PCR together with microbiota analysis and immunohistochemistry for measuring mucosal integrity and inflammation. CRS patients clustered into two distinct microbial subgroups using probabilistic modelling Dirichlet (DC) multinomial mixtures. DC1 exhibited significantly reduced bacterial diversity and increased dispersion and was dominated by Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, and Achromobacter. DC2 had significantly elevated B cells and incidences of nasal polyps and higher numbers of Anaerococcus, Megasphaera, Prevotella, Atopobium, and Propionibacterium. In addition, each DC exhibited distinct tight junction gene and protein expression profiles compared with those of controls. Stratifying CRS patients based on clinical phenotypic subtypes (absence or presence of nasal polyps [CRSsNP or CRSwNP, respectively] or with cystic fibrosis [CRSwCF]) accounted for a larger proportion of the variation in the microbial data set than with DC groupings. However, no significant differences between CRSsNP and CRSwNP cohorts were observed for inflammatory markers, beta-dispersion, and alpha-diversity measures. In conclusion, both approaches used for stratifying CRS patients had benefits and pitfalls, but DC clustering provided greater resolution when studying tight junction impairment. Future studies in CRS should give careful consideration to the patient subtyping approach used.",

While various microbes have been implicated, there is no clear understanding of the role they play in CRS pathogenesis. Another equally important observation made for CRS patients is that the epithelial barrier in the sinonasal cavity is defective. Finding a robust approach to subtype CRS patients would be the first step toward unravelling the pathogenesis of this heterogeneous condition. Previous work has explored stratification based on the clinical presentation of the disease (with or without polyps), inflammatory markers, pathology, or microbial composition. Comparisons between the different stratification approaches used in these studies have not been possible due to the different cohorts, analytical methods, or sample sites used. In this study, two approaches for subtyping CRS patients were compared, and the underlying drivers of the heterogeneity in CRS were also explored.",

The close cell-to-cell proximity that is central to the integrity of this barrier is maintained by tight junctions, which play a critical role in host defense (2, 3). Tight junctions comprise a range of transmembrane and scaffolding adaptor proteins, including occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecules, and zonula occludens (ZO) (4). These proteins limit the passage of macromolecules by sealing off the paracellular spaces between epithelial cells. On the other hand, in cases of tissue inflammation, the opening of tight junctions assists in the release of tissue fluids and the influx of inflammatory cells, and by doing so, helps speed resolution. Accordingly, tight junctions are considered the gatekeepers of inflammatory disease.",

Symptoms include nasal discharge, facial pain, loss of smell, and headaches. CRS is a complex and heterogeneous disease with many underlying factors that present with similar symptoms, making it challenging to separate CRS into clinically relevant subtypes. Traditionally, the classification of CRS has been based on the clinical phenotypes, namely, the presence (CRSwNP) or absence (CRSsNP) of polyposis. Approximately 25% to 30% of CRS patients present with nasal polyps (8), and this cohort is considered to have a Th2-predominated inflammatory response, whereas patients with idiopathic CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) have Th1-type responses.

It has been suggested that a loss of overall microbiota diversity and deleterious community changes (collectively termed dysbiosis) are more characteristic for CRS patients than a single disease-causing organism (15).",

Using a similar approach, a recent study subtyped CRS patients based on their microbial community profiles (11). Each distinct microbial state was dominated by one bacterial family and associated with a unique clinical and host immune response. Previous studies have found that large interpersonal variations in the sinonasal microbiomes of CRS patients (subtyped based on clinical diagnosis) can make classification difficult (12). Accordingly, the distinct advantages of stratifying patients based on microbial community profiles are that it will help to resolve the microbial heterogeneity of CRS and that it is a step toward the implementation of a precision medicine approach. The underlying drivers of these distinct microbial states in CRS are yet to be investigated.",

It remains unclear whether the microbes are the cause of tissue damage or if microbial patterns or associations are the consequence of a leaky epithelium, leading to a buildup of microbial cells in the tissue. The mechanism by which bacteria penetrate the epithelial barrier is unknown, but their presence in CRS tissue (in particular, CRS with cystic fibrosis [CRSwCF]) presumably reflects a breakdown in mucosal integrity (21). Furthermore, any changes to the microenvironment (such as a lack of mucociliary clearance and damaged surfaces for bacterial cell adherence) could impact microbial composition and structure, as observed previously in gut studies (22).",

The bacterial taxa Pseudomonas (average relative abundance \u00b1 standard deviation [SD], 19% \u00b1 37%), Achromobacter (7.6% \u00b1 27%), and Haemophilus (8.5% \u00b1 27%) dominated DC1, while DC2 was dominated by Moraxella (18% \u00b1 31.5%) and Stenotrophomonas (6.7% \u00b1 17.7%); however, these taxa all had low prevalences, as shown in Fig.\u00a02B. Interestingly, controls were not dominated by any single bacterial taxon but instead had a low abundance of multiple genera, some of which were highly prevalent.",

We then sought to understand the underlying influences on these cohorts by investigating sinonasal mucosal integrity, tight junction gene/protein expression, and inflammatory status. The two approaches of clustering CRS patients will be compared and discussed further.",

Although this novel way of classifying CRS samples explained some of the microbial variations in the data set, there was still a large proportion of the variation that was not accounted for. This was most likely due to the sizeable interpatient variation observed in this study and reported previously (15, 25). We anticipate, with larger cohort sizes, these microbial states will be more pronounced and less obscured by individual variation. While studies that use less invasive approaches to obtain samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs and rinses are able to obtain larger cohort sizes (26, 27), these samples are not suitable for analyses of histology and mucosal integrity. In addition, tissue biopsy specimens are required to study host gene expression levels. For these reasons, tissue biopsy specimens were used in the analyses within this study.",

The most common hypothesis for the pathogenesis of CRS is that the epithelial barrier is defective (28). Allergens (such as pollen), host genetics, bacteria, viruses, or inflamed tissue could all contribute to the disruption of the sinonasal epithelial barrier (29). In this study, we chose to investigate several of these potential host factors that might contribute to CRS pathogenesis and determine their influence on the sinonasal microbial state. Of the 42 measured tight junction genes, 9 exhibited reduced expression in CRS patients compared with that in controls. Reduced expression of tight junction genes in CRS patients compared with that in controls was observed previously (6). The reason for the overexpression of ACTA1, which encodes a protein involved in cell motility, structure, and integrity (according to www.uniprot.org), is unclear but presumably reflects the host\u2019s response to an impaired epithelial surface. Each DC in this study had a unique tight junction gene expression profile, suggesting that the two identified CRS DCs are functionally different. It remains unknown whether the expression of a specific tight junction gene could play a role in determining distinct microbial states in the nasal cavity, or vice versa. The significant association between tight junction genes and bacterial community compositions observed in this study needs further validation with in vitro tests. However, this observation provides some evidence of interactions between host tight junction gene expression and sinonasal microbial communities.",

ZO-1\u2019s adhesive function between transmembrane proteins and the underlying actin skeleton denotes its critical role at the epicenter of the tight junction complex (30, 31). Furthermore, depletion of ZO proteins in mammary epithelial cells results in the failure of tight junction strands to assemble and a consequent loss of barrier function (31). These findings suggest an important role for ZO-1 in the establishment of functioning tight junction complexes. It is possible that reduced expression of ZO-1 protein could underlie subsequent downregulation of integral tight junction proteins, resulting in a loss of barrier properties. A loss of claudin-4, ZO-1, occludin, and E-cadherin in tissue biopsy specimens of CRS patients was found previously (6, 32). The lack of any significant observations on the tight junction protein measurements in the phenotypic CRS subgroups compared with those in controls also emphasizes the need to look at other ways to stratify CRS.",

Interestingly, DC2 cohorts had significantly lower goblet cell counts and reduced integrity of cilia than the DC1 cohort and controls. This observation was also made for subgroup CRSwNP patients in comparison to other CRS cohorts and controls. Mucociliary function in CRS is essential for the physiological function and immunity of the nose (36). A loss in function promotes the formation of biofilms and bacterial infections. Certain species of Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus produce ciliostatic or ciliotoxic agents that could result in loss of ciliary function (37). In this study, correlations with cilium integrity, goblet cell numbers, and bacterial taxa were not observed. However, further research into toxin production by signature members of each cohort that results in cilium loss is required.",

In addition, Cope et al. (11) found that distinct microbial clusters have unique patterns of immune response. Evidence from these studies suggests that microbial states are influenced by various host factors, possibly including cellular junctions. Furthermore, consistent with findings from other groups, CRS patients in this study based on microbial states (DC1 and DC2) or phenotypic subtyping (CRSwNP) had a higher abundance of B cells in the mucosa than the controls. Previous efforts have shown a proliferation of B cells in the sinonasal mucosa when exposed to antigens (39). Inflammatory cytokine IL-13 is a key factor in stimulating antibody production (such as IgE and IgA) by B cells in response to antigen exposure in airway inflammatory diseases (40). IgE levels are elevated in eosinophilic CRSwNP patients (41). Accordingly, the elevated level of B cells in CRS patients is a good indication of the inflammatory status of the sinonasal tissue of CRS patients.",
