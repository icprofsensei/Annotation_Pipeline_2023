Recent reports have highlighted the potential role of mucosal surface microbes in the pathogenesis of AMD. In this case-control study, the composition of the nasal and oral microbiota in newly diagnosed neovascular age-related macular degeneration cases (6 male, 7 female) was compared to controls without retinal diseases (2 male, 3 female). PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes was performed with universal primers amplifying the V4 variable region (515F-806R). Distinct microbial community characterization was achieved using Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) of the Bray-Curtis index with comparative analysis between cases and controls performed within QIIME\u00a02. Sequencing of all cases and controls revealed clear separation with strong beta diversity between oral and nasal microbial communities (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Microbial composition differed between cases and controls in both oral and nasal samples. The top three oral microbes identified as different compared to controls included Burkholderiales (7.41 log2fold change, p\u2009=\u20093.29E-05), Actinomyceataceae (6.22 log2fold change, p\u2009=\u20093.73E-06) and Gemella (5.28 log2fold change, p\u2009=\u20090.0002). The top three nasal microbes identified as different compared to controls included Rothia (13.6 log2fold change, p\u2009=\u2009 3.63E-18), Actinobacteria (10.29 log2fold change, p\u2009=\u20099.81E-10) and Propionibacteriales (8.73 log2fold change, p\u2009=\u20096.74E-09). These relative shifts in communities of bacteria detected in newly diagnosed neovascular AMD patients may suggest additional mechanistic links in disease pathogenesis.",

Microbes have been implicated in the induction of local inflammation, leading to increased mucosal permeability, thereby allowing inflammogenic material direct access to the systemic circulation. This material up-regulates immune mediators at distal sites, inducing local inflammatory pathways in end organs. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is considered a disease of chronic inflammation. Amongst the numerous factors implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD, oxidative stress and inflammation are two key themes. Consistent with these paradigms, inflammatory proteins, complement by-products and other immune-associated responses are implicated in the formation and progression of choroidal neovascularization, the form AMD associated with the majority of vision loss experienced by patients4.",

Gene-environment interactions have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD. Patients with the CFH gene risk variant also exposed to Chlamydia pneumonia (as measured by titres of antibodies against C. pneumonia) have been found to be at increased risk of AMD disease progression8. The role of microbes in AMD is in its infancy, but recent studies have shed light on particular gut and pharyngeal microbes present in patients with AMD, suggesting the diversity in microbial composition as a potential contributor to AMD pathophysiology9,10. To our knowledge, two studies have sought to characterize the microbiome in clinical cases of AMD. Zinkernagel, M. S. et al. sequenced the gut metagenome using fecal samples from 12 patients with recent signs of neovascular AMD in comparison to 11 controls9. The investigators found an increased abundance of Ruminococcus torques, Oscillibacter, Anaerotruncus and Eubacterium ventriosum9. Ho, E. X. P. et al. examined the pharyngeal microbiome in 245 AMD cases and 368 controls. Gemella was present in a higher abundance of AMD cases while Prevotella was reduced10.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that patients with newly diagnosed neovascular AMD are associated with a distinct oral and nasal microbiome. The diverse microbial environment surrounding the eye, namely the nose and mouth, represents a unique region where microbial diversity could lead to distant chronic inflammatory changes in the eye.",

Cases and controls did not differ with respect to gender, smoking status, last cigarette inhaled and antibiotic use (Table\u00a01). Principle coordinates analysis plots of Bray-Curtis distances was plotted for all oral and nasal samples analyzed. Axes 1 and 2, representing 42.2% and 13.1% of the variance, respectively, are displayed in Fig.\u00a01. The difference between all sampled oral and nasal microbiota was statistically significant (P\u2009=\u20090.001). The bacterial communities clustered together based on site sampled, with nasal communities more similar to each other than oral. Oral communities of cases and controls appeared to cluster together. Greater variance was observed within all nasal samples sequences in both cases and controls (Fig.\u00a01).

The nasal mucosa of cases showed a shift in the dominant species, with streptococcus being most prevalent. Burkholderiales, Gemella and Actinomycetaceae showed the greatest fold change compared to controls. In the oral cavity, cases showed a shift in a composition of microbial communities, with members of the Actinobacteria phyla being the greatest: Rothia (genus), Proprionbacteriaceae (family), Corynebacteriaceae (genus). Considering the pathogenesis of AMD is partly regulated by the innate immune system, it is therefore possible that local changes in microbial composition are driving the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways at distant organ sites, including the choroid/RPE complex1,2,11.",

Rothia, Proprionbacteriaceae and Corynebacterium, have all been found simultaneously within the oral and atherosclerotic plaques of patients with coronary artery disease3. Considering the finding of characteristic pathogenic oral microbes in patients with newly diagnosed neovascular AMD, these bacteria may represent pathogenic species linked to promoting inflammation. Further, 16S rRNA of Gemella and Streptococcus are part of the pharyngeal microbiome recently described in late AMD patients as opposed to early AMD or controls10. Our report confirms the finding of Gemella and Streptococus as part of the nasal microbiome in newly diagnosed cases of neovascular AMD. Taken together, these species may hold pathogenic links to AMD progression and shed light onto previously unrecognized areas of research.",
