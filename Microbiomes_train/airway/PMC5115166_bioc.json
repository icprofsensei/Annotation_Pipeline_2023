Changes within the dental plaque microbiome during MV have been documented previously, primarily using culture-based techniques. The aim of this study was to use community profiling by high throughput sequencing to comprehensively analyse suggested microbial changes within dental plaque during MV. Bacterial 16S rDNA gene sequences were obtained from 38 samples of dental plaque sampled from 13 mechanically ventilated patients and sequenced using the Illumina platform. Sequences were processed using Mothur, applying a 97\u2009% gene similarity cut-off for bacterial species level identifications. A significant \u2018microbial shift\u2019 occurred in the microbial community of dental plaque during MV for nine out of 13 patients. Following extubation, or removal of the endotracheal tube that facilitates ventilation, sampling revealed a decrease in the relative abundance of potential respiratory pathogens and a compositional change towards a more predominantly (in terms of abundance) oral microbiota including Prevotella spp., and streptococci. The results highlight the need to better understand microbial shifts in the oral microbiome in the development of strategies to reduce VAP, and may have implications for the development of other forms of pneumonia such as community-acquired infection.",

                    "text": "Mapping the oral microbiome has been a developing task for molecular microbiologists over the past decade (Wade, 2013a). Since the introduction of Sanger sequencing, technological evolution has allowed in-depth analysis of whole microbial communities and of individual species genomes (Lazarevic et al., 2009; Perkins et al., 2010). The oral cavity is colonized with an array of micro-organisms including bacteria, fungi and viruses, and currently over 800 bacterial species have been identified via culture-independent approaches (Avila et al., 2009; Dewhirst et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Wade, 2013b; Wang et al., 2013; Zaura, 2012). The use of contemporary DNA-based technologies facilitates identification of uncultured, dormant and dying cells that are unable to replicate even on the most tailored media. In this way, the diversity of microbial species within the oral cavity of healthy individuals is increasingly well characterized. The microbiome of a range of oral niches has also been analysed, including the mucosal membranes, the cheeks and tongue and scrapings of dental plaque (Dewhirst et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012). Several species within the polymicrobial biofilm of dental plaque have been associated with oral diseases including periodontitis and dental caries, and are increasingly linked with systemic infections and disorders. Analysis of dental plaque from patients with a particular illness, condition or hospitalized state could provide insight into the involvement of the oral microbiota in such systemic diseases (Gomes-Filho et al., 2010).",

There is a large surface area provided by teeth for colonization and maturation of plaque. Areas with lowered oxygen potentials, such as the interproximal spaces of teeth and in deep periodontal pockets, are frequently colonized by large numbers of predominantly anaerobic species (Jefferson, 2004; Faran Ali & Tanwir, 2012). The difference in the microbial composition at different sites emphasizes the adaptability of the microbiome to specific surroundings. There is a natural progression in plaque development to maturation, with initial colonization by \u2018pioneer\u2019 bacteria including Streptococcus and Lactobacillus species, and subsequently combinations of anaerobic species such as Prevotella, Veillonella and Porphyromonas are detected (Kolenbrander et al., 2005; Peyyala & Ebersole, 2013; Xie et al., 2010).",

Sequences were scanned for errors by a series of error command checks. To analyse the microbial communities of samples, Mothur was used to cluster the data according to operational taxonomic units (OTUs), to a species level of 97\u2009% similarity (sequence data <\u200997\u2009% confirmation were not identified in this study). Singletons and any OTUs which were not found more than 10 times in any sample were collated into OTU_singletons and OTU_rare phylotypes, respectively, to maintain normalization and to minimize artefacts. The raw data output from Mothur (phylogenetic data) was analysed using a combination of statistical programs R-script (R Development Core Team 2008), stamp (Parks & Beiko, 2010), SPSS V20 and Microsoft Excel. The two methods used in this study to compare the similarity between each sample were Jaccard's index of similarity and the Bray\u2013Curtis distance measure (measure of dissimilarity) (Lozupone & Knight, 2005; Wang et al., 2013). The terms \u2018non-oral\u2019 and \u2018potential respiratory pathogens\u2019 were employed to describe those micro-organisms not generally isolated from or considered part of the oral microbiome. Weighted Unifrac distance matrices were analysed in R using non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and the shared OTU file was used to determine the number of times that an OTU was observed in multiple samples and for multivariate analysis in R. OTU taxonomies (from phylum to genus) were determined using the RDP MultiClassifier script to generate the RDP taxonomy (Wang et al., 2007) while species level taxonomies of the OTUs were determined using the USEARCH algorithm combined with the cultured representatives from the RDP database (Edgar, 2010).

In the majority of cases, sample 1 was collected shortly after (\u2009<\u200912\u200ah) intubation to reflect the dental plaque community at the time of initiation of MV. The number of identified OTU sequences was used as a direct measure of species abundance. Fig. 3 shows the five most abundant microbial species within dental plaque at the first time point (insertion of ETT, introduction of MV) comparing prevalence of oral species and potential respiratory pathogens. Both potential respiratory pathogens and oral micro-organisms are represented. The stacked bar graph compares the five most abundant species per patient (with the largest bar representing the most abundant species). The occurrence of multiple bands in oral commensal genera such as Streptococcus, Veillonella and Prevotella indicated their presence in multiple patients. A total of seven patients were colonized with potential respiratory pathogens from within 12\u200ah of the onset of MV. When present, potential pathogens were amongst the most predominant micro-organisms as illustrated by larger bars on the graph.",

As shown in Fig. 4, dental plaque samples were grouped according to stage of MV for comparative analysis revealing that a shift in the composition of dental plaque was evident between the stages of MV. Dental plaque samples obtained at the start and midpoint of MV showed a high prevalence of bacteria not frequently identified in the oral cavity, also demonstrated in the heat map (Fig. 5). Veillonella are regarded as frequent members and a key component of dental plaque, and this was confirmed by the present study with Veillonella species present within the top three most abundant microbial species during the entirety of MV and into the recovery period. Escherichia coli/Shigella flexneri and Staphylococcus aureus persisted as abundant members of the dental plaque biofilm into the recovery period. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) coupled with t-tests were used to analyse the level of similarity between sample types using non-parametric relationships (Fig. 6). Each sample was furthermore assigned coordinates based on weighted Unifrac (phylogenetic community distance measure) analysis to generate a scatter plot. Although there were overlapping components, statistically the communities were shown to change during MV. Pairwise comparisons using t-tests with pooled sd were performed to compare each of the time point groups. P value adjustment was performed using the FDR Benjamini\u2013Hochberg (BH) method, to control the false discovery rate when performing multiple comparisons. The parameters used were Unifrac against time, to determine whether time point communities were statistically different. The differences in the plaque compositions at the start and midpoint were shown to be statistically significant, P\u2009=\u20090.0033. Furthermore, the differences in the communities between the start and end (ETT-extubation sampling) were also significantly different (P\u2009=\u20090.0403), with a P value of P\u2009=\u20096.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20095 when comparing the communities between midpoint and end of MV.",

Inclusion of non-oral pathogens to the plaque community was demonstrated for all 13 patients. However, for four patients these micro-organisms were detected only in low numbers.

A total of six from 38 samples analysed within this study were microbial culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Following species-specific PCR of these dental plaque samples, five out of six were positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as shown in Fig. 7. This suggests that although Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be isolated from the dental plaque community using microbial culture, this result may be due to the fact that members of this genus are well adapted to grow on culture media and are over-represented when using culture-based approaches. Although significant numbers of respiratory pathogens were detected, culture-independent analysis did not detect any Pseudomonas aeruginosa from mechanically ventilated patients within this study.",

There were similarities between these two groups of dental plaque, initially suggesting that the microbial shift does not necessarily revert back to normal oral microbiota upon extubation. Furthermore, patients (patients 3, 9 and 13) were shown to be colonized with respiratory pathogens, namely Escherichia coli/Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, in the post-ETT extubation period, as shown in Table 2. There was no significant difference between these groups. A pairwise t-test measuring the weighted Unifrac against the datasets indicated a lack of significance (P\u2009=\u20090.1945), furthermore highlighting the occurrence of both oral and respiratory organisms in both start- and ward-designated samples. However there was a noticeable decrease in the occurrence and abundance of potential respiratory pathogens, especially Gram-negative respiratory pathogens such as Escherichia coli. The dental plaque communities may not revert back to levels found in the initial samples; however, 50\u2009% of the most abundant species in post-ETT samples were frequent members of the oral microbiota such as streptococci, lactobacilli and Veillonella species, with a decrease in respiratory pathogens. This can be seen in Fig. 8, by visually comparing the distribution of oral organisms and respiratory pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus was present only in low numbers in mechanically ventilated patients at the start of MV; however, this species was detected during MV (Fig. 3) and during the recovery period (Fig. 8).",

This study examined the dental plaque microbiome at multiple stages during MV and into the recovery period. An average of three dental plaque samples were collected per patient covering four different time points, with the patient demographics summarized in Table 2. Longitudinal analysis of the polymicrobial dental plaque community in this way revealed that there were significant differences in bacterial composition at discrete stages of MV. Next-generation sequencing-based applications such as community profiling allow simultaneous detection of micro-organisms and the generation of species quantitative data (Zaura, 2012). During this study, MiSeq Illumina sequencing provided comprehensive microbial profiles for mechanically ventilated patients and highlighted increases in relevant pathogens within dental plaque of ventilated patients. These findings confirmed and considerably extended those of culture-based studies that have previously demonstrated microbial shifts, which may facilitate the development of secondary respiratory infections such as VAP (Mori et al., 2006; Zuanazzi et al., 2010). In this context, it has been proposed that the placement of the ETT may actually facilitate a change in the biochemical composition of the oral cavity (Cairns et al., 2011). The microbial changes demonstrated that several non-oral genera can co-exist in the dynamic, ever-changing biofilm that is dental plaque.",

Previous studies have suggested Pseudomonas aeruginosa to be a predominant colonizer of dental plaque during MV and a causative pathogen of VAP (Parker et al., 2008; Raad et al., 2011; Tarquinio et al., 2014). Current microbiological analysis relies on cost effective, readily available and reproducible microbial culture. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a rapid colonizer on nutritional media and can effectively outcompete the growth of other microbial species perhaps inaccurately presenting as a predominant species in this setting. The composition of dental plaque is extremely diverse with many species regarded as currently uncultivable, reinforcing the potential for Pseudomonas aeruginosa to out-compete and be over-represented on microbiological media. Although, as explained, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered an opportunistic pathogen of the oral cavity within mechanically ventilated patients, further high-throughput studies could elucidate the true extent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa within dental plaque during MV to determine whether Pseudomonas aeruginosa should still be considered the predominant bacterium in this context compared with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative species such as Escherichia coli.",

The latter is a marker of host immune activity in response to the elevated plaque levels and can highlight the importance of plaque scoring in critical care medicine (Wise & Williams, 2013). Oral hygiene, predominantly tooth brushing, can be effective in disrupting the plaque biofilm; however, small amounts of potentially pathogenic biomass firmly attached to the enamel surface are likely to remain (Alhazzani et al., 2013).",

Proteins within saliva aid the attachment of early pioneer organisms including streptococci and have a key role in oral microbial homeostasis (Hojo et al., 2009). Therefore, any alteration in saliva production or composition may contribute to changes in microbial composition within dental plaque. Non-oral organisms, from several genera, are rapid formers of resistant biofilms (Fux et al., 2005) and are relatively efficient in competing with resident members of the microbiome following changes in oral homeostasis, and may significantly affect the biofilm composition (Marsh, 2003, 2006). Furthermore, this may add to changes in the microenvironment of the oral cavity within intubated patients. The insertion of the ETT, coupled with the immunocompromised status of many critically ill patients, and administered antibiotics and drugs, may all contribute to the initial changes at the proteome level of saliva.",

Within this study, a total of 40 genera were identified, ranging from frequently identified and studied genera such as streptococci, to less obvious organisms such as Tannerella spp. and Oscillibacter spp., some of which lesser known genera have been revealed in similar community profiling studies (Galimanas et al., 2014). Haemophilus influenzae, an organism associated with respiratory infection, was also isolated within the dental plaque of mechanically ventilated patients. Although an opportunistic pathogen, Haemophilus influenzae is a common commensal of the nasopharynx (King, 2012). Physical alterations (such as the insertion of ETTs) may influence microbial detachments and translocation within the upper and lower respiratory system. The dynamics and influence of dental plaque may in fact be underestimated and the biomass of dental plaque can be a significant contributing factor to several oral and systemic infections, such as VAP. The microbial shift occurred in a high proportion of mechanically ventilated patients, and at least one pathogen was isolated in the dental plaque of all 13 patients tested in this study. Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae has also been suggested as an early onset VAP causative pathogen, alongside Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli (Kalanuria et al., 2014). Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen identified within the four most frequently occurring species in dental plaque during MV, has the ability to integrate into the polymicrobial dental oral biofilm in situ (Al-Ahmad et al., 2010). Enterococcus faecalis, although not commonly regarded as a member of the oral microbiota in health, may be isolated from the oral cavity in some individuals and is interestingly frequently isolated from secondary endodontic infections (Al-Ahmad et al., 2009).",

Previous reports indicate that low concentrations of chlorhexidine may have effects largely against native oral biofilm species, particularly after initial plaque removal via brushing (Zanatta et al., 2007). Other studies including a trial reported by Scannapieco et al. (2009) suggest activity of chlorhexidine against Staphylococcus aureus, and highlight the need to evaluate whether this and similar antimicrobials are effective against the biofilm consortia of intubated patients, which in this study are shown to be predominantly colonized by putative and opportunistic pathogens.",

However, potential pathogens were isolated from dental plaque obtained during patient recovery from critical illness, suggesting that once these organisms establish within the biofilm, they may be hard to eliminate completely. This may be related to the continued relatively immunocompromised state of the patient during the post critical illness phase (Frazier & Hall, 2008). Future studies could analyse the dental plaque microbiome of a larger patient sample size to statistically reflect the community of critical care patients at pre-defined time points during MV.",

A microbial shift in the composition of dental plaque was demonstrated with the incorporation of several potential respiratory pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Interestingly, and in contrast to previous cultural studies, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not represented in the molecular analysis. Both the prevalence and abundance of potential respiratory pathogens were shown to decrease following extubation. However, some of these microbial species could still be identified at low levels within the community, and may therefore serve as a reservoir for infection in the longer term. To our knowledge this is the first report of the comprehensive characterization of dental plaque in this patient group. A better understanding of the compositional changes with dental plaque will usefully inform interventional strategies to reduce the incidence of VAP.",
