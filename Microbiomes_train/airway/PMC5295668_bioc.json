DNA based methods offer better identification and quantification of microbial constituents of sputum than standard clinical culture and may help inform patient management strategies. Our study objective was to determine the longitudinal variability of the non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis microbiome in sputum with respect to clinical variables. Eighty-five patients with non-CF bronchiectasis and daily sputum production were recruited from outpatient clinics and followed for six months. Monthly sputum samples and clinical measurements were taken, together with additional samples during exacerbations. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the sputum microbiota was successful for 381 samples from 76 patients and analysed in conjunction with clinical data.",

Patients gave their full informed written consent and the study was approved by South West London Research Ethics Committee under reference number 10/H0801/53. Patients had all previously been screened according to the British Thoracic Society bronchiectasis guidelines[2]. Patients had monthly research visits at which fresh sputum samples were collected and spirometry and clinical assessment performed. Body mass index (BMI) measurements were taken only at the initial visit. Patients were encouraged to attend the centre for a suspected exacerbation and to provide a further sputum sample. An exacerbation was defined as an acute deterioration with worsening local symptoms (increased cough, sputum volume, viscosity, purulence, breathlessness) and/or systemic upset and the physician determined need for antibiotics as per the BTS bronchiectasis guidelines. The clinical state for each sample was defined as baseline (B), exacerbation (E), treatment (T), or recovery (R) as previously published [12]. Briefly, B was defined as well or mild increase in respiratory symptoms, no doctor defined respiratory exacerbation, not hospitalised, not on episodic antibiotics for more than 30 days. E was defined as a doctor defined respiratory exacerbation, the sample was prior to the start of episodic intravenous (IV) or oral antibiotics, not on episodic antibiotics for more than 30 days. T was defined as on IV or oral episodic antibiotics for treatment of doctor defined respiratory exacerbation whilst R was defined as off episodic antibiotics for less than 30 days and may or may not be back to baseline clinical state. Patients recorded antibiotic use during the six-month period. Patients gave their full, informed, written consent and the study was approved by South West London Research Ethics Committee 1 under reference number 10/H0801/53",

Non-significant variables were backward removed from the models and samples with missing data were removed list wise. The order of the variables remaining was also tested as this can influence a PERMANOVA and the final model explains the maximum variance possible in the most limited number of variables. The final variables included in order were: isolation of mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolation of Haemophilus influenzae, prophylactic treatment with Colistin and isolation of Staphylococcus aureus and a more detailed description of the model and R2 values can be found in the S1 Appendix. PERMANOVA was also used with the longitudinal dataset, but only to look at the variance explained by subjectID as it is not suitable for repeated measures.",

In particular the presence of H. influenzae appears under-recognised by culture, and Pseudomonas spp. and S. aureus were at times present in culture and not detected by sequencing. This may reflect the capacity of culture to isolate pathogens when they are present in very low numbers, and the ability of Pseudomonas spp. and S. aureus to outgrow other organisms in culture. Since the discrepancy in S. aureus was most marked, primer sequences were checked for specificity for this group of organisms and found to have 100% identity to the S. aureus target. Inefficient DNA extraction can be of concern with Gram positive organisms, although the bead-beating approach has been employed widely and in our hands efficiently lyses Mycobacteria and fungi[17]. It has also been validated for endospore extraction, so we do not believe that inefficient DNA extraction has occurred here. It is possible however that relatively inefficient amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences from genomic DNA of S. aureus against a mixed template background may have occurred.",

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acquisition of a new bacterial strain has been associated with exacerbations [20]. Here we lack strain level resolution, although new OTUs could only rarely be seen associating temporally with exacerbations. For example, Subject 15 Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_915 takes over from Streptococcus_338 at exacerbation, in subject 24 Stenotrophomonas_401 from Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_915 whilst there is an increase in Staphylococcus_300 in patient 67.",

Overall in these studies no, or poor associations with clinical state are seen when taking each cohort as a whole. However, as we have also demonstrated here, in subsets of patients associations can be seen. CF is a much more clinically defined disease than non-CF bronchiectasis, though strong individuality in the microbiota may also mask the influence of the microbiota on clinical state. Viral PCR is not routinely performed in these patients, so we are unable to rule this out as associated with exacerbations. Fungal culture is routinely performed and one subject did culture an Aspergillus at exacerbation although this was not treated and was also present in the following recovery sample when the patient was no longer exacerbating and completing courses of antibiotics. This result also underlines the complexity of these disease processes as other factors such as undiagnosed comorbidities, viral and fungal infection, environmental exposure and the immune response are all also likely to all also play a role to a greater or lesser extent in each subject.",

Our study was not designed to examine exacerbation specifically, as its aim was to observe changes of the microbial community in a diverse non-CF bronchiectasis cohort over time. Consequently, only a relatively small number of exacerbation (E) or treatment (T, exacerbation with current antibiotic treatment) samples were obtained.",

More frequent sampling could establish whether changes in the microbiota not coincident with clinical change were due to sampling variability, community variability as a result of drivers with no clinical impact (e.g. competition between microorganisms) or clinical changes that occurred between visits and were not captured. Longer and more frequent sampling may also allow the development and application of more sensitive statistical and ecological methods that will also be of benefit.
