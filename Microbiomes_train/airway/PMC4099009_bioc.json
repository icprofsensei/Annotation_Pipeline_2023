In human hosts, how health status shapes the composition of oral microbiota is largely unknown. Taking advantage of advances in high-throughput sequencing, we compared the composition of supragingival plaque microbiota of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) pediatric patients with healthy controls. The oral microbiota of leukemia patients had lower richness and less diversity compared to healthy controls. Microbial samples clustered into two major groups, one of ALL patients and another of healthy children, with different structure and composition. Abundance changes of certain taxa including the Phylum Firmicutes, the Class Bacilli, the Order Lactobacillales, the Family Aerococcaceae and Carnobacteriaceae, as well as the Genus Abiotrophia and Granulicatella were associated with leukemia status. ALL patients demonstrated a structural imbalance of the oral microbiota, characterized by reduced diversity and abundance alterations, possibly involved in systemic infections, indicating the importance of immune status in shaping the structure of oral microbiota.",

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a malignant disorder of lymphoid progenitor cells, is the most common type of leukemia among children, accounting for 75% of all childhood leukemia and 25% of all malignancy in childhood [1]. Among some individuals leukemia first manifests in oral cavity [2], [3]. Oral manifestations that frequently occur in leukemia patients include gingival bleeding, oral ulceration, gingival enlargement, candidiasis and periodontitis [4], [5], [6]. Oral microbes are believed to be involved in the occurrence or exacerbation of such complications [7]. Certain oral microbiota have been shown to contribute to septicemia, which might delay antineoplastic treatment, compromise treatment efficiency, or even jeopardize the patients' life [8], [9]. Therefore, an adequate treatment of oral lesions could lead to a more favorable resolution of both oral and systemic diseases. At present, limited knowledge is available on the oral microbiota of leukemia patients. Previous studies dependent on a culture-based approach have mainly focused on limited cultivable bacterial species and failed to determine the holistic pattern of oral microbiota in leukemia patients [10], [11], [12], [13]. Furthermore, because most previous studies were primarily focused on the effect of antineoplastic treatment on oral microbes, limited information can be obtained on the oral microbiota per se under the diseased condition. To determine the role of oral cavity microbiota to local and systemic complications in ALL patients, it is first necessary to generate a more complete picture of the oral cavity microbiota population that is specific to this disease.",

In the human host, the role of health status in shaping the composition of oral microbiota is still largely unknown.

Remarkable advances in high-throughput sequencing have recently improved practicality in analysis of microbiota from a variety of biological and environmental samples under various conditions. Whereas conventional culture-dependent approaches underestimate microbial composition, new culture-independent molecular techniques are capable of investigating entire bacterial communities and characterizing the biodiversity of oral microbiota. High-throughput sequencing has been widely and successfully applied to the exploration of oral microbial diversity in health [16], [17], [18] and disease-associated communities from those associated with dental caries [19], [20], periradicular lesions [21], atherosclerosis [22], and head-neck tumor undergone radiotherapy [23], [24]. However, application of these techniques in investigating the oral microbiome under immunocompromised conditions has so far been limited. In this study, we characterized the biodiversity of supragingival plaque microbiota in pediatric clinic ALL patients using a high-throughput sequencing technique (454 pyrosequencing). The oral microbiota compositional profiles were compared to those of ALL-free healthy subjects.",

Briefly, the sampling sites, the teeth in upper right and lower left quadrants or upper left and lower right quadrants, were isolated with cotton rolls and dried before sampling. A sterile Gracey curette was used to collect a pooled supragingival plaque sample from the mesial surfaces of each of these teeth in turn. The collected plaque samples were released from the curette by agitation in 700 \u00b5l of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5] and 1 mM EDTA). The microbial samples were immediately transported on ice to the laboratory and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further DNA extraction and pyrosequencing analysis.",

Unique 10-bp barcodes were incorporated into the reverse primers so that sequences of different samples can be differentiated. Each 25 \u00b5l PCR reaction consisted of 1 \u00b5l of forward primer (10 \u00b5mol/l), 1 \u00b5l of barcoded reverse primer (10 \u00b5mol/l), 0.5 \u00b5l of dNTP mix (10 mmol/l), 2.5 \u00b5l of FastStart 10\u00d7 buffer with 18 mmol/l of MgCl2, 0.25 \u00b5l of FastStart HiFi Polymerase (5 U/\u00b5l), 1 \u00b5l of genomic DNA, and 18.75 \u00b5l of water. FastStart HiFi Polymerase, FastStart 10\u00d7 buffer with MgCl2 and dNTP mix were included in the FastStart High Fidelity PCR System, dNTP Pack (Roche Applied Science).

Sequences that contained ambiguous bases, incorrect primer sequence, or identified to be shorter than 200 bp, or homologous sequences longer than six nucleotides were also removed. UCHIME (http://drive5.com/uchime) was used to detect potentially chimeric artifacts. Sequences were clustered to operational taxonomical units (OTU) using CD-HIT-EST at 97% similarity level. RDP Na\u00cfve Bayesian Classifier was applied to perform read level taxonomic assignments with an 80% bootstrap score [27]. Qualified sequences were submitted to the SILVA database (SILVA 111; http://www.arbsilva.de) for taxonomic alignment. Community richness (ACE, Chao1) and diversity indices (Simpson diversity index) were determined by the MOTHUR program at 97% similarity level. The statistical significance of these indices was determined by SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) with nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples. The heatmap profile was generated by the R program (http://www.r-project.org/). For phylogeny-based cluster comparisons, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots were generated with the distance matrix calculated using the weighted UniFrac algorithm. The composition of the microbial communities present in the samples from the ALL patients (n\u200a=\u200a13) and control (n\u200a=\u200a12) groups were analyzed using unweighted and weighted UniFrac analysis [28], [29] and Parsimony p-tests [30].

We compared the oral microbial communities present within each of the 13 ALL patients and 12 control subjects using three different types of cluster analysis: OTU-based, taxonomy-based (at the order level) and phylogeny-based cluster analyses. The dendrogram from the OTU-composition presented two clusters, with one cluster composed of leukemia oral samples and the other mainly comprised of healthy control samples (Figure 1). Moreover, the supragingival plaque samples from the ALL patients and healthy controls could be divided into two subsets based on microbiota composition and microbe abundance at the order level. This taxonomy-based clustering at the order level was better associated with the health or disease status (ALL-affected vs. ALL-free) of subjects as shown in Figure S1. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the weighted UniFrac metric was also performed. Although 5 subjects from ALL patients group clustered with the healthy controls, a segregation trend for ALL patients and healthy subjects was observed, especially by principal coordinate P1 (Figure 2). To further validate the statistical significance of the aforementioned sample clustering, we performed three different types of pair-wise comparisons, including parismony test, Unifrac unweighted and Unifrac weighted analyses. A single NJ phylogenetic tree containing all 16S rRNA sequences from the samples from the 13 ALL patients and 12 control subjects (identical to that used for the PCoA analysis) was used as the input for all three methods. All three statistical approaches showed significant difference (parismony test, p\u200a=\u200a0.006; Unifrac unweighted, p\u200a=\u200a0.005; Unifrac weighted, p<0.001), indicating that the oral microbial structure of the ALL-affected population is distinct from that of the healthy controls.",

While there have been several reports investigating oral microbiota in leukemia patients [10], [11], [12], [13], [33], most of these studies relied on traditional culturing methods and were focused on only a few kinds of common bacteria, failing to characterize the overall pattern of oral microbiota in leukemia patients. In addition, most of these cross-sectional investigations were focused on the effect of antineoplastic treatment on oral microbiota, and limited information can be obtained regarding the oral microbiota under ALL-associated immunocompromised conditions. These limitations have severely confounded efforts to pinpoint leukemia-associated oral microbiota in patients.",

We believe that compared to subgingival and salivary microbiota, which alter under periodontal pathologies [34], [35], the supragingival microbiota is less affected by gingivitis/periodontitis, but more by the host immune status given that the caries status is normalized. Therefore, in the present study, we sampled pooled supragingival plaque in carefully controlled ALL and healthy populations, and analyzed its microbial composition via 16S-based 454 pyrosequencing. Oral health conditions, except for periodontal conditions, were well balanced between the ALL patients and healthy groups, further validating the use of supragingival plaque as a representative microbiota to delineate the influence of the immune status on oral microbiome.",

ALL patients had lower richness and less diversity of oral microbiota compared with healthy subjects. Similar results were reported by Sixou et al, in which the microbial composition of supragingival plaque from the leukemia patients, analyzed by traditional culture methods, were found to be less complex than that of healthy controls [10]. However, Cargill et al. found that the complexity of oral microbiota was not statistically different between leukemia patients and healthy controls until initiation of antineoplastic treatment [33]. This inconsistency might be attributed to techniques used to profile the oral microbiota. Previous studies, mainly using culture methods, based their results on a few selected cultivable bacteria, neglecting characteristics of other bacteria in oral cavity of leukemia patients. At the time of sampling, oral bacteria might have already undergone selection after the disease manifested, with some bacteria inhibited and others thriving, resulting in divergent conclusions from different studies which focused on a few types of bacteria. By using 454 pyrosequencing, a holistic pattern of oral microbiome was presented and bacteria with low abundance and under the detection limit of culture methods could be investigated [36]. A decrease in intestinal microbial diversity was found in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia [37]. The decrease of richness and diversity observed in the current study points to dysbiosis of oral microbiota in ALL patients. In addition to richness and diversity, we report altered structure and composition of oral microbiota in ALL patients. Altered structure and composition of oral microbiota in ALL patients were related to health status of investigated subjects. This was revealed in the separation pattern of samples based on cluster analyses, which were consistent with the presence/absence of leukemia. Since age, dentition stage, plaque pH, plaque index and caries status (dmfs/DMFS) were comparable between ALL patients and healthy children, microbial differences observed in supragingival plaque are likely directly caused by leukemia itself.",

                    "text": "It is well-known that the host and microbiota have a dynamic interaction, which is closely associated with health [38]. The host immune system is believed to play an important role in shaping human microbiota [39]. A study on the bacterial and fungal microbiota of the stomach fluid indicated that immune status plays a major role in shaping the gastric fluid microbiota in terms of both diversity and composition [40]. Important effectors of innate immunity, \u03b1-defensins that are a kind of secreted antibacterial protein produced by epithelial cells, can affect the composition of intestinal microbial communities [41], [42]. Immune-driven dysbiosis in the intestine has been found in mice deficient for the transcription factor T-bet, which is associated with both the innate and the adaptive immune system [2]. Here we showed the importance of the immune system in shaping the oral microbial structure. This is not surprising, because like the small and large intestine, the lamina propria of oral mucosa typically has organized and diffuse lymphoid tissues [43]. In ALL patients, the disorder of lymphoid progenitor cells, the major part of the body's immune system, can lead to impairment of the host immunity [14], [15]. The malignant proliferation of lymphocytes in bone marrow infiltrates into the peripheral lymphoid tissues including the lymphoid tissue of oral mucosa, leading to impairment of oral immunity [7], [44]. Furthermore, the salivary defense system which contains various antimicrobial components such as secreted immunoglobulin A (SIgA), \u03b1-amylase and lysozyme, has been reported to be significantly impaired in leukemia [45]. However, the exact mechanisms involved in the interaction between the oral immune system and microbiota need further research.",

                    "text": "Our investigations of oral microbiota in ALL patients also provided the opportunity for identifying potential microbiota associated with systemic infections in leukemia patients. The present data suggest two taxonomical lineages (Firmicutes/Bacilli/Lactobacillales/Carnobacteriaceae/Granullicatella, and Firmicutes/Bacilli/Lactobacillales/Aerococcaceae/Abiotrophia) that are much more abundant in the supragingival plaque of ALL patients than healthy controls from the phylum down to the genus level; this indicates that favorable conditions existed for their development in the oral cavity of ALL patients. This could be responsible for an increased risk of bacteremia in leukemia patients. Granulicatella and Abiotrophia, formerly known as nutritionally variant streptococcus (NVS), have been commonly implicated in endocarditis and bacteraemia, and also in several other infections such as central nervous system infections, otitis media, cholangitis and arthritis [46], [47]. A high mortality rate for endocarditis by NVS has been reported [48], [49]. Previous studies found that oral bacteria are responsible for 25% to 50% of systemic infections in neutropenic patients [50]. An increase in abundance of opportunistic pathogens might be an important factor to the increased risk of systemic infections in leukemia patients. Altered health status in ALL patients predisposes the host to developing oral infection by favoring pathogenic bacteria thriving in the oral niche. Prevention of oral microbiota dysbiosis might be a promising measure for decreasing mortality in patients with ALL. It should be noted that the 16S rRNA gene assay has its own limitation, i.e. the detection of 16S rRNA sequences does not imply that live bacteria are present. Therefore, either combination of 16S rRNA gene assay with traditional culture-based approach, or further cohort studies are needed to elucidate the exact relationship between oral microbial disequilibrium and risk of systemic infection in ALL-affected patient.",
