Since the global prevalence of IBS is estimated to be between 10 and 20% depending on diagnostic criteria and geographic region, it constitutes a major medical burden and is thereby considered a public health issue [1]. The subtype diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) reflects diarrhea as the predominant symptom. Diagnosis is made by the symptom-based ROME criteria after the exclusion of organic disease [2]. To date, the treatment of IBS-D is focused on relief of symptoms rather than cure and consists of nutritional interventions, psychological or medical therapies [3].",

Specific compositional changes in the microbiota are thought to trigger these mucosal inflammatory responses in IBS-D which in turn are able to stimulate visceral hypersensitivity and pain [3, 4, 6, 7]. Thereby, the possible dysbiosis-triggered mucosal inflammation involves elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines that can interact with colonic nociceptive and non-nociceptive afferent nerves. If activated, these afferent nerves can sensitize mechanosensory colonic c-fibers to mediate pain symptoms in IBS-D patients [4]. Furthermore, activated mast, B and plasma cells accompanied with an impaired barrier function in jejunal specimens are present in IBS-D patients and the grade of mucosal inflammation is thereby associated to clinical disease activity. These microbiota-neuro-immunological interactions might, therefore, be involved in triggering intestinal hypersensitivity and pain, suggesting that IBS-D has a microbiota-dependent immune-mediated pathogenesis [8\u201310].",

However, extensive research is ongoing to clarify the role of specific probiotic strains and formulations on the host [11\u201313]. A recent meta-analysis including several oral probiotics in IBS suggests a clinical efficacy with significant decrease in various IBS-related symptoms after treatment [14]. The proposed mechanisms of action of different orally given probiotic strains are influences on mucosal immune cells, e.g., the IL-10 inducing effect of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in dendritic cells (DCs) and subsequent modulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, a mix of Clostridia strains stimulated mucosal Tregs, Lactobacillus rhamnosus had direct impacts on the mucosal barrier and Bifidobacterium bifidum changed the gut microbiota composition [15\u201318]. In IBS, different types of probiotics showed influences on fecal and mucosal microbiota composition as well as intestinal barrier function, but systematic investigation of the effects on different regions of the GI tract and the mucosal immune system is lacking [19\u201321]. Furthermore, Bifidobacterium bifidum has been shown to influence the level of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in humans, which are known to play an important role in mediating gastrointestinal homeostasis [18, 22]. However, data on clinical efficacy and mechanisms of action of synbiotics in IBS, especially regarding possible region-specific differences in the upper and lower GI tracts, remain to be scarce [23]. To elucidate which regions and levels of the intestinal ecosystem could be involved in mechanisms of action of synbiotics in IBS-D, we investigated the GI tract in ten patients with IBS-D before and after a 4-week treatment with an open-label oral synbiotic mixture (containing multiple species of probiotic strains and prebiotics including inulin, starch, and fructooligosaccharides). The effects of synbiotic treatment were determined by exploring mucosal immune cells (sampled in duodenum and ascending colon), SCFAs, and zonulin (a surrogate for the intestinal barrier function [24]), from stool and the gastrointestinal microbiota (from stool as well as from mucosal samples originating from stomach, duodenum, and colon).",

Thereby, biopsies for FACS analysis were separately taken from the duodenum and ascending colon during the retraction of the endoscope and immediately processed. The colonic biopsies were obtained between the right-colonic flexure and the caecum. In addition, biopsies from the gastric corpus, duodenum, and ascending colon were obtained for mucosal microbiota analysis. Furthermore, analysis of fecal SCFAs, zonulin, and fecal 16S rDNA was performed.",

Briefly: paired reads were merged using mothur\u2019s make.contigs command, whereby reads less than 200 bps were filtered out of the data set. In addition, sequences containing ambiguous bases or more than eight homopolymeres were removed together with chimeric sequences or sequences outside of the core alignment with the SILVA reverence database (version 119). Furthermore, noisy sequences were identified using pre.cluster and finally deleted from the data set. Remaining pre-processed and filtered sequences were clustered by mothur\u2019s de novo OTU-picking strategy into OTUs at a distance of 0.03. Finally, taxonomic classification was assigned using the RDP Bayesian classifier (version 2.10.1, trainingsset 10/29.10.2014) with default settings and a classification confidence cutoff of 80% [34]. Subsequent OTU-based microbiota analyses were performed in QIIME (version 1.8.0), including core.diversity analysis with rarefaction to a sampling depth of 9.538 reads per sample for all four locations (COR\u2009=\u2009corpus, COL\u2009=\u2009colon, FEC\u2009=\u2009feces, and DUO\u2009=\u2009duodenum) [35]. Unweighted UniFrac distance metrics as measure of between-sample (beta) diversity was calculated and applied for principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) to visualize patterns of diversity [36]. Within-samples (alpha) diversity was calculated using four different measures (1) observed species, (2) ChaoI Index, (3) Shannon Index, and (4) Faith\u2019s phylogenetic diversity [37, 38]. Statistical significant differences between sample (alpha) diversity were assessed by a nonparametric two-sample t test (p values were determined by Monte Carlo permutations. Calculations are based on the greatest rarefaction depth. Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple comparisons). Differences in taxonomic microbiota compositions (differentially abundant features/genera) within the four locations and between treatments were determined using linear discriminant effect size analysis (LEfSe) on the filtered data sets at species level. If not otherwise specified p values below 0.05 were considered as statistically significant [38].",

Helium was used as carrier gas at 1.3\u00a0ml/min in splitless mode at 250\u00a0\u00b0C injector temperature. The initial oven temperature of 60\u00a0\u00b0C was held for 2\u00a0min, and then, the temperature first was ramped up to 150\u00a0\u00b0C at a rate of 15\u00b0C/min. This was followed by a ramp of 5\u00b0C/min up to 170\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C/min up to 250\u00a0\u00b0C, where the temperature was held for another 2\u00a0min. The mass spectrometer was run in electron impact (EI) mode, where the SCFAs were detected in SIM mode on m/z 60, 63, 73, 74, 76, 79, and 80. The source temperature was set to 250\u00a0\u00b0C and the transfer line temperature was 280\u00a0\u00b0C. Data analysis was performed by Mass Hunter (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany).",

In addition, Lactobacillaceae, belonging to the synbiotic mixture, were elevated only in fecal samples, but were not found in any mucosal sample. Fecal samples depicted a notably reduction of Moraxella and Moryella, but the importance of this observations is unclear. The observed elevations of phylogenetic diversity in gastric and duodenal specimens were not chaperoned by increases of the orally administered probiotic strains used for treatment, which is a known phenomenon in probiotic therapy. Nevertheless, oral probiotics might have a catalyzing effect on mucosal richness [13]. Although changes in microbial composition of the rectal mucosa have been described after probiotic therapy of IBS patients, we herein show a more comprehensive investigation of how synbiotic preparation affects the intestinal ecosystem in different regions of the GI tract [19]. Furthermore, our results suggest that synbiotic effects on microbial composition in IBS-D are preferentially observed in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Whether the observed treatment-induced changes are due to the probiotic or prebiotic ingredients of the administered mixture remain unclear, since prebiotics are also known to influence intestinal microbial composition in humans [41]. Taken together, this study gives a comprehensive oversight of 16S rRNA changes in different habitats and locations of the gastrointestinal tract induced by an oral synbiotic. Specifically, we show for the first time that the focus of mucosal microbial responses to oral synbiotic therapy is located in the upper but not the lower gastrointestinal tract.",

Increased mucosal inflammation is associated with IBS-D pathogenesis and disease activity. Moreover, elevated numbers of T cells have been shown in jejunal and colonic specimen of IBS-D patients vs. controls. However, these cells were not differentiated further, which could be of relevance, because na\u00efve T cells can develop into pro-as well as anti-inflammatory T cells [5, 42, 43]. The treatment-induced reduction of colonic CD4+ T cells in our study is likely to lead to an alteration of the colonic inflammatory status. In conjunction with the observed trend towards an induction of double-negative (CD4\u2212 CD8\u2212) T cells, for which Treg-like anti-inflammatory properties (suppression of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, B cells and DCs) have been proposed, one could hypothesize an anti-inflammatory effect [44]. It is one of the limitations of this study that we neither differentiated further CD4+ T cells into pro- and anti-inflammatory subsets. It is worth noting that T cells in the upper GI tract, where the microbial changes were most pronounced, remained unaffected. In addition, neither mucosal regulatory T cells nor DCs could be shown to be affected by synbiotics in any compartment. In sum, the reduction of mucosal CD4+ T cells accompanied by enhanced double-negative T cells in the ascending colon could represent an anti-inflammatory modulation of the colonic mucosa, but this needs further confirmation.",

The synbiotic mixture could stimulate acetate and butyrate levels by its prebiotic or probiotic components, as prebiotics are known to stimulate, e.g., butyrate production in humans and Lactobacillaceae (elevated in fecal samples after treatment) can mediate butyrate production [41, 45]. Furthermore, probiotic bacteria are metabolically active depending on the host microbiota and initial fecal butyrate level in healthy individuals. Thereby, the impact of probiotics on fecal butyrate level was highest in individuals with low butyrate concentration, as observed in our study participants, before treatment [18, 22, 46]. It was previously demonstrated that IBS patients show decreased fecal butyrate levels, which is of importance, since acetate and butyrate are known to induce mucosal Tregs and regulatory DCs [22, 47]. We hypothesize that the treatment-associated elevation of acetate and butyrate could be involved in the observed mucosal T-cell changes and the clinical responses to the study preparation.",

IBS-D patients exert intestinal permeability disruptions and abnormalities in their epithelial barrier function, as shown in the previous studies [8, 10]. In this study, fecal zonulin concentration, a surrogate marker for the intestinal barrier, was significantly reduced by synbiotics. This reflects a possible treatment effect on intestinal barrier function in our IBS-D cohort. The stabilization of the epithelial barrier could subsequently influence mucosal inflammation in IBS-D [9, 10] and contribute to a significantly lower symptom severity score after treatment. In sum, synbiotic therapy elevated fecal acetate and butyrate levels accompanied by a reduction of fecal zonulin and symptom severity. These observations indicate possible effects of synbiotic therapy on microbiota metabolism and intestinal barrier function.",

The observed effects comprise an elevation of mucosal microbial diversity, the elevation of colonic CD4+ T cells, the elevation of fecal acetate and butyrate levels and a decrease of fecal zonulin, and a surrogate of intestinal barrier function. The potency of oral synbiotics in the treatment of IBS-D is underlined by the clinical response observed in this study by decreased IBS-SSS counts. The major limitations of the study are the lack of a placebo-controlled double-blinded design and the limited number of participants, which are limitations owing to the design as a pilot study. This in turn does not allow any causal interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, our study provides a systematic analysis of the possible effects of oral synbiotic therapy in IBS-D patients and gives the rationale for a larger-scale randomized trial.",
