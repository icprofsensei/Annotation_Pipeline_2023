                    "text": "It has long been proposed that the gut microbiome contributes to breast carcinogenesis by modifying systemic estrogen levels. This is often cited as a possible mechanism linking breast cancer and high-fat, low-fiber diets as well as antibiotic exposure, associations previously identified in population-based studies. More recently, a distinct microbiome has been identified within breast milk and tissue, but few studies have characterized differences in the breast tissue microbiota of patients with and without cancer, and none have investigated distant body-site microbiomes outside of the gut. We hypothesize that cancerous breast tissue is associated with a microbiomic profile distinct from that of benign breast tissue, and that microbiomes of more distant sites, the oral cavity and urinary tract, will reflect dysbiosis as well. Fifty-seven women with invasive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy and 21 healthy women undergoing cosmetic breast surgery were enrolled. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from urine, oral rinse and surgically collected breast tissue, sequenced, and processed through a QIIME-based bioinformatics pipeline. Cancer patient breast tissue microbiomes clustered significantly differently from non-cancer patients (p=0.03), largely driven by decreased relative abundance of Methylobacterium in cancer patients (median 0.10 vs. 0.24, p=0.03). There were no significant differences in oral rinse samples. Differences in urinary microbiomes were largely explained by menopausal status, with peri/postmenopausal women showing decreased levels of Lactobacillus. Independent of menopausal status, however, cancer patients had increased levels of gram-positive organisms including Corynebacterium (p<0.01), Staphylococcus (p=0.02), Actinomyces (p<0.01), and Propionibacteriaceae (p<0.01). Our observations suggest that the local breast microbiota differ in patients with and without breast cancer. Cancer patient urinary microbiomes were characterized by increased levels of gram-positive organisms in this study, but need to be further studied in larger cohorts.",

Moreover, only a fraction of those who harbor a genetic predisposition to breast cancer or who are exposed to known environmental risk factors go on to develop disease [3]. Clearly, additional contributing factors need to be identified. One such element that has garnered recent attention is the human microbiome, a dynamic community of bacteria, viruses, archaea, and eukaryotes that colonize human tissue [4]. The perturbation of these microbial communities, known as dysbiosis, has been linked not only to acute disease, but also to chronic diseases and malignancy [5\u20137]. Examples of this include the well-described role of Helicobacter pylori in gastric adenocarcinoma [8], and the emerging role of specific microbiomic profiles in colorectal cancer [9].",

In addition to modulating the immune system, these gut microbes are known to play a vital role in estrogen metabolism; the perturbation of this \u201cestrobolome\u201d has been shown to influence systemic levels of estrogen and its metabolites [5, 7, 13, 14]. In fact, increased antibiotic use has been linked to increased risk of incident and fatal breast cancer in a case-controlled study of over 2,000 women [15]. Local estrogen levels, in addition to circulating ones, also play a role in breast carcinogenesis [16]. Malignant tissue in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer contains higher levels of estrogen metabolites as compared to normal breast tissue, attributed in part to altered intracrine signaling [17]. What remains unknown is the breast tissue microbiome\u2019s role in local estrogen metabolism and breast carcinogenesis, and whether the microbiomes of any other body sites, outside of the gut, are affected by the systemic hormonal and immunologic disturbances associated with breast cancer.",

These investigations are still in their infancy, and the evidence also remains mixed on whether a difference exists between tumor and adjacent histologically-normal tissue from cancer patients. Additionally, these studies utilize a wide range of extraction methods, amplification primers, sequencers, bioinformatics pipelines, and patient populations. Additional studies are needed to elucidate which associations are strong enough to pursue functional studies. Furthermore, distant body-wide microbiomes, apart from the gut, have not yet been examined in breast cancer patients, and could represent a potentially non-invasive screening test.",

These differences were further confounded by the significant influence of BMI on taxa relative abundances as demonstrated by PCoA; higher BMI was associated with decreased genus Streptococcus (p = 0.05, R2 = 0.06) and family Planococcaceae (p < 0.01, R2 = 0.31) [Supplementary Figure 4].

We hypothesized that breast carcinoma tissue would have a microbiome unique from that of surrounding normal parenchyma, that hormone receptor status of the carcinoma would be associated with microbes able to metabolize estradiol/progesterone, and that breast cancer patients would have altered microbiomes relative to healthy controls, both at the local tissue level and at more distant sites. The simple comparison of invasive carcinoma and paired normal tissue revealed no major shifts in overall diversity or microbiomic content. Similarly, oral rinse samples in cancer and non-cancer patients showed no large-scale differences. Notably, however, analysis of breast tissue revealed that cancer and non-cancer patients had significantly different microbiomes, a difference characterized largely by the decreased abundance of Methylobacterium in cancer patients. Urine sample analysis showed that while the biggest microbiomic differences were due to menopausal status, cancer patients harbor urinary microbiomes with increased abundance of gram-positive bacteria associated with skin flora.",

                    "text": "The observation that the overall diversity of tumor and paired normal tissue samples from breast cancer patients are largely similar imply that more similarities than differences exist between the overall breast tissue microbiomes of tumor and adjacent normal tissues from the same patient, consistent with Urbaniak et al.\u2019s findings [18]. In contrast, another previous, smaller, study has suggested conflicting results when comparing tumor tissue to paired normal tissue in breast cancer patients [11]. Key differences may be that our tumor and \u201cnormal\u201d tissue was histologically-verified at the time of extraction and reclassified, if warranted, and that we used flash-frozen aseptically collected tissue, as did Urbaniak et al. rather than formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Still, our analyses may have been limited by being underpowered by both sample size and low read count, despite being larger than the previous. Due to risk of a false negative finding, larger studies will be needed in the future to confirm these findings. At least one other recent study, using fresh intraoperatively-collected tissue, has found tumor and adjacent benign breast tissue to be largely similar as well [18]. If adjacent benign breast tissue is truly more similar to that of carcinoma tissue than to breast tissue from women without cancer, it may imply a breast-wide predisposition to carcinogenesis. Alternatively, these similarities may suggest that the microbial differences observed are secondary to the effect of the tumor rather than a causative agent.",

This may be due to the fact that we used MO BIO extraction kits, and took precautions to keep samples in aseptic conditions until sequencing. MO BIO extraction kits have been shown to have the least contamination compared to other commercially available microbiome-focused DNA extraction kits [20]. Additionally, in an effort to minimize non-specific amplification, we size-selected the amplicon using gel-purification and limited the number of amplification cycles to 25. We acknowledge that the power to detect statistically significant differences in relative abundances is limited by the low read counts in this study. As such, the likelihood of false negatives in this study is quite high. However, there is evidence to suggest that useful comparisons can be made at this sequencing depth [21]. Indeed, prior studies have demonstrated that low numbers of reads can accurately characterize communities at the phylum-level, and be used to uncover large-scale differences between communities through analysis of beta-diversity metrics [22\u201324].",

While age, BMI, race, and menopausal status were significantly different in the cancer and non-cancer groups, they did not significantly contribute to variation in the PCoA plots. This suggests that the differences seen on beta diversity analysis are due to the cancer versus non-cancer groupings, not to demographic differences. Additionally, while PCoA identified differences based on hormone receptor and HER2 status in cancer samples, we were unable to resolve individual taxa that explained these differences due to small sample size and high background noise.",

                    "text": "The primary bacterial genus driving the cancer-versus-non-cancer breast tissue microbiomic separation is the genus Methylobacterium. Methylobacterium belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, and while its main habitat is soil and water, certain species have been identified in the human oropharynx and foot [25, 26]. Indeed, Methylobacterium has been identified as a known environmental contaminant, especially in low-biomass samples [20]. However, we found that the levels of Methylobacterium detected in patient samples were far greater than levels detected in the environmental controls, making this finding unlikely to solely be due to environmental contamination. They are facultative methylotrophs, meaning that they are able to use methanol and methylamine as fuel, and have been shown to produce phytohormones like cytokinin and auxin [27]. In rare cases, they have been identified as human pathogens [28]. Some of these phytohormones have been described to exert an anti-cancer effect [29, 30]. While this is certainly in line with our data that Methylobacterium is highest in non-cancer patients and lowest at the site of the tumor, and that it is associated with tumors with greater invasive potential, it is premature to suggest that local depletion of Methylobacterium increases malignant potential. Indeed, a prior study suggests that Methylobacterium radiotolerans is increased at the site of tumor [11]. However, this may be due to a myriad of differences between our studies (use of flash-frozen vs. formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue, type of extraction kit, 16S rRNA primers), or a matter of species specificity. In contrast, the family Alcaligenaceae was increased in cancer relative to non-cancer samples. Several members of this family are known human pathogens, for example, various species of Achromobacter and Bordetella, especially in immunocompromised hosts [31].",

Previous work in this area has concentrated on the gut microbiome. In 2011, Plottel et al. [7] extensively discussed the estrobolome, consistent of the enteric bacterial genes whose products metabolize estrogen and its metabolites. Perturbations in this collection of microbiota (e.g., via antibiotics) can lead to elevated levels of circulating estrogens, thereby increasing the risk of breast cancer. Indeed, clinical studies have identified associations between the gut microbiome and urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites [13, 14]. Recently, a case-control study of 48 post-menopausal breast cancer patients and 48 controls found the gut microbiome to be less diverse and compositionally distinct in the women with breast cancer [32]. Supporting this hypothesis, antibiotic use has been found to be associated with the risk of incident and fatal breast cancer in a dose-dependent matter [15].",

In the oral rinse microbiome, we found no differences between cancer and non-cancer patients despite epidemiologic data suggesting that periodontal disease was associated with increased breast cancer risk [33]. This is most likely due to the fact that the oral cavity is exposed to the environment through vocalization, air-exchange, and food and fluid ingestion on a constant basis. In fact, our data showed that relative abundances of Streptophyta and Streptococcus were significantly increased in patients who reported oral intake in the hour prior to their oral rinse. The levels of Streptophyta likely reflect chloroplasts from ingested plant material [34]. The relative increase in Streptococcus may be due to the ingestion of carbohydrates [35]. Thus, the microbes at this site are likely less permanent and more heavily influenced by the environment relative to internal factors than at sites like in the tissue and urinary tract.",

Although there are likely no large differences in oral microbiome composition of breast cancer and non-cancer patients based on the negative findings in our study, we cannot exclude the possibility of small to moderate difference in microbial communities that would be detected in a larger cohort. While the way in which we collected the oral rinse samples most closely approximates what would be feasible for a non-invasive screening test in a clinical setting, our study is limited by the lack of control for diet and temporal variation. As such, there exists the risk of false negative findings in this study. Future studies on the oral microbiome in breast cancer should ideally control for oral intake and evaluate multiple samples from the same patient over a 24 hour period.",

While increased overall diversity is associated with health and decreased diversity with colorectal cancer in the context of the gut microbiome [36], the opposite is true of the urogenital tract. For example, the vaginal tract microbiome in premenopausal women has been described to be less diverse, characterized by a relative overabundance of Lactobacillus relative to postmenopausal women [37], and can be at least partially restored in patients taking exogenous estrogens [38, 39]. It is no surprise, then, that our urine results reflect this difference, although this is, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, the first time it has been reported in the urine. These findings could be due to contamination with vaginal or skin flora at time of collection (despite mid-stream clean catch protocol), or to colonization of the urethra and bladder by vaginal or skin flora [40]. This caveat may be less plausible because we cannot find a systematic reason why vaginal or skin flora contamination might affect only one group of patients.",

Specifically, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Actinomyces, and Propionibacteriaceae are all gram-positive microbes that are generally associated with skin flora (with the exception of Actinomyces). Gram-positive bacteria are known to be strong inducers of interleukin-12 (IL-12), as opposed to gram-negative bacteria, which preferentially stimulate IL-10. IL-12 goes on to promote interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) secretion from T and NK cells, ultimately activating cytotoxic effects [41]. While IFN-\u03b3 is classically associated with anti-tumor effects, recent literature has shown that in the right context, IFN-\u03b3 can induce the opposite effect by upregulating proliferative signals and allowing tumor cells to escape recognition by cytotoxic T cells and NK cells [42, 43]. Colonization of the urogenital tract by gram-positive bacteria, perhaps opportunistically during menopause when levels of protective Lactobacillus decline, could potentially lead to chronic low-level IFN-\u03b3 activity and escape of breast cancer cells from interferon regulation and tumor progression [44]. Moving forward, it will be necessary to establish a timeline of urinary dysbiosis relative to cancer diagnosis/progression; if this pattern persists in patients over time prior to cancer diagnosis and/or progression, urine screening may represent a non-invasive way to identify high-risk patients in the future.",

As such, we did not implement any multiple testing corrections, increasing our risk for detection of false positive results in an effort to minimize false negative results. Additionally, our analyses comparing cancer and non-cancer patient breast tissue, oral rinse, and urine microbiomes are potentially confounded by the effects of age, BMI, race, and menopausal status. We elected not to conduct an adjusted analysis as we would have been severely underpowered to do so based on sample size. However, in breast tissue, comparisons on alpha and beta diversity metrics, as well as relative abundances of Methylobacterium and Alcaligenaceae were not significantly different when analyzed by age, BMI, race, and menopausal status. This suggests that the differences observed in breast tissue are not due to these potential confounders. In urine, our finding of no significant differences between cancer and non-cancer patients could have been due to confounding from significant differences by menopausal status and BMI. In the taxa-level analysis in urine, we adjusted for menopausal status by using LEfSe\u2019s subclass function to essentially conduct sensitivity analysis, only identifying differentially abundant taxa in cancer and non-cancer groups within each menopausal class. While logistically challenging, future studies in this area should aim to match their cohorts on the basis of age, race, BMI, and menopausal status if possible.",

Notably, however, cancer patients had significantly different microbiomes compared to non-cancer patients in both the local breast tissue and in the urinary tract. The tissue microbiome of cancer patients is driven by a relative decreased abundance in the genus Methylobacterium, and the urinary microbiome of cancer patients is characterized by relatively increased levels of gram-positive bacteria independent of demographic factors such as menopausal status and BMI. The investigation of the microbiome in breast cancer patients is still in its infancy. Further validation with a larger cohort of clinically matched patients will be needed to determine the significance and biological relevance of these findings.",

All beads, tubes, and nonenzymatic reagents were treated with UV light for at least 30 minutes prior to use [46]. In brief, 2 \u03bcl total DNA was amplified using primers F: (5\u2032TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG3\u2032) and R: (5\u2032GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC3\u2032), targeting the 16S V3 and V4 region (Illumina) [47] under the following conditions: 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 25 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 54\u00b0C for 30 seconds for breast samples or 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds for urine and oral rinse samples, 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. For urine and oral rinse samples, the resulting 16S rDNA amplicons were cleaned with Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA). For breast samples, the PCR product showed nonspecific bands on a 1% agarose gel. Thus, all breast sample 16S rDNA amplicons were run out on a 1% agarose gel, size selected at 450-500 bp, and gel purified using Zymoclean DNA Gel Recovery kit (Zymo, Orange, CA). Purified amplicons underwent a second round of PCR to add Nextera indices (Illumina) in half reaction volumes with 2.5 \u03bcl of sample. A second round of Ampure XP clean-up was performed and resulting libraries were quantified with Quantiflour dsDNA system (Promega, Madison, WI). After calculating molarity, 5 uL of each sample (diluted to 4 nM) were pooled into sequencing libraries. Libraries were validated on a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) to verify size and sequenced on the Illumina Miseq with V3 reagent kit at the Case Western Reserve University Genomics Core.",

Prior to PCoA analysis on weighted Unifrac distances of oral rinse and urine samples, OTU tables were normalized using the DESeq2 algorithm (implemented within the QIIME pipeline), which was originally developed for RNA-seq data, and models counts with a negative binomial mixture model [57, 58]. Breast tissue samples were rarefied to 60 reads instead of being normalized due to insufficient read counts for comparisons of both alpha and beta diversity. Sensitivity analyses with weighted UniFrac distances were also conducted, and were not reported unless discordant with findings based on unweighted UniFrac distances.",

In order to account for the confounding factor of menopausal status in the analysis of the urine microbiome, instead of using Wilcoxon rank-sum or Kruskal-Wallis, taxa summaries generated in QIIME [56] were reformatted for input into LEfSe [60] via the Huttenhower Lab Galaxy Server [61\u201363], where menopausal status was used as a subclass, and cancer vs. non-cancer as the overarching class. This ensured that any taxa flagged as significantly different between cancer and non-cancer urine samples by LEfSe\u2019s algorithm were also different within the peri/post-menopausal and pre-menopausal subclasses. Taxa represented in fewer than 10% of total samples in the group were discarded. This algorithm performed nonparametric statistical testing of whether individual taxa differed between the class cancer vs. non-cancer, and the subclass peri/postmenopausal vs. premenopausal, and ranked differentially abundant taxa by their linear discriminant analysis (LDA) log-score [60]. Differentially abundant taxa that were statistically significant using an alpha of 0.05 and exceeded an LDA log-score of 2 were visually represented on cladograms and box plots, with p-values listed in Supplementary Table 4.",
