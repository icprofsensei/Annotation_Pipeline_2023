Dental plaque samples collected from 20 healthy participants were pooled and stored in either 75% ethanol or Bead solution for up to 6-months at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C, prior to DNA extraction with either QIAamp (non-bead beating) or PowerSoil (bead-beating) kit, followed by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. We found that storage media and not extraction method had the biggest influence on the diversity and abundance of the oral microbiota recovered. Samples stored in Bead solution, independent of the extraction kit, retrieved higher diversity (PowerSoil p\u2009=\u20091.64E-07, QIAamp p\u2009=\u20090.0085) and had dissimilar overall ecologies as indicated by lower level of shared diversity (PowerSoil p\u2009=\u20090.0000237, QIAamp p\u2009=\u20090.0088). Comparatively, samples stored in Bead solution and extracted with PowerSoil recovered a higher abundance of Streptococcus species. These data indicate that Bead solution can preserve the oral microbiome in dental plaque reliably, for periods of up to 6-months at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C, and is compatible, with either a bead-beating or non-bead beating DNA extraction method.",

Teng et al. also reported similar results from their prepared mock community in terms of DNA extraction method, meanwhile they found that 16S primers with regions targeting V3-V4 and V4-V5 seemed to yield more reproducible results than V1\u2013V319. Interestingly, Vesty et al. systematically evaluated four widely used microbial DNA extraction methods (PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit, QIAamp DNA Mini kit, Zymo Bacterial/Fungal DNA Mini Prep and phenol:chloroform-based DNA isolation) on human dental plaque as opposed to a mock community, and found bacterial genera in dental plaque did not significantly differ across the DNA extraction methods20. These studies highlight the difference in results obtained when assessing the simpler mock communities to the more complex human samples.

As a proxy for shared bacterial diversity between extracts, we used the PC2 values from Fig.\u00a03. As a measure of overall alpha diversity, we used the Shannon Index. These models revealed that independent of the condition being tested, the shared (p\u2009=\u20090.47) and overall diversity (p\u2009=\u20090.24) did not significantly vary over 6 months of sample storage at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. The modelling did show that storage media and not extraction method had the biggest influence on the diversity of the oral microbiota recovered from dental plaque. For samples stored in Bead solution, extraction method did not influence the overall diversity recovered (p\u2009=\u20090.82, Fig.\u00a04a), and these samples\u2019 overall ecologies were similar as indicated by a high level of shared diversity (p\u2009=\u20090.89, Fig.\u00a04b). Samples stored in Bead solution compared to ethanol, independent of whether a mechanical disruption extraction method was used, retrieved significantly higher diversity (PowerSoil p\u2009=\u20091.64E-07, QIAamp p\u2009=\u20090.0085, Fig.\u00a04a) and had dissimilar overall ecologies as indicated by a low level of shared diversity (PowerSoil p\u2009=\u20090.0000237, QIAmp p\u2009=\u20090.0088, Fig.\u00a04b). However, if samples were stored in ethanol, extraction of those samples with the QIAamp kit retrieved more diversity than samples extracted with the PowerSoil kit (p\u2009=\u20090.0008, Fig.\u00a04a).",

A differential abundance test, DESeq222,23, was used to compare the abundance of ASVs present in dental plaque samples stored in Bead solution versus ethanol, and extracted with the PowerSoil versus the QIAamp kit, while controlling for length of time stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Comparison of the four conditions revealed a similar profile of bacteria in samples from each condition, with only 4 of the 280 species being significantly differentially abundant between all states, (Supplementary Table\u00a03). Similar to the diversity results, there was little difference between the Bead solution stored samples extracted with the PowerSoil to QIAamp kit. Only one species (Streptococcus sp., p\u2009=\u20095.26E-10) was significantly different, being more abundant in PowerSoil/Bead solution than QIAamp/Bead solution treated samples. In comparison, there were 4 differentially abundant ASVs between the Bead solution and ethanol-stored samples (Fig.\u00a05). Of these four, three species were more abundant in Bead solution than ethanol-stored samples, independent of if the sample was extracted with PowerSoil (Fig.\u00a05a) or QIAamp (Fig.\u00a05b). These enriched species in Bead Solution included Streptococcus sp, Haemophilus sp. and Streptococcus parasanguinis_II (p\u2009<\u20090.001). For the ethanol-stored samples, those extracted with the PowerSoil compared to the QIAamp kit (Fig.\u00a05c), recovered a higher abundance of Streptococcus parasanguinis_II (p\u2009=\u20096.09E-19), Haemophilus sp. (p\u2009=\u20098.11E-05) and Rothia sp. (p\u2009=\u20098.11E-05). The differential abundance test indicated that Bead solution stored and PowerSoil extracted samples recovered a higher abundance, particularly of streptococcus species, compared to ethanol-stored samples.",

Thus, the availability of reliable preservation methods is essential to avoid changes in the microbial community being sampled, which is key for minimizing potential bias and enabling fair comparisons among bio-banked samples, especially for large initiatives, such as the Human Microbiome Project21. Numerous studies have compared different preservation methods for faecal samples12,14,24, yet the studies on dental plaque have centred around the evaluation of DNA extraction methods and 16S primers design17,19,20,25. In this study, we found that storage conditions, particularly storage media significantly influenced the overall diversity and ecologies of the oral microbiome samples, to a more substantial degree than the extraction method. Interestingly, a bead-beating, DNA extraction method did not appear to substantially improve the recovery of bacteria from dental plaque samples, as has previously been reported. Our results highlight the need to examine in combination the multiple steps involved in profiling oral microbiome samples, from storage to extraction, to assess where bias is potentially introduced.",

                    "text": "Of the two storage media compared, Bead solution was found to be optimal to ethanol for dental plaque samples isolated with both DNA extraction kits tested, as it retrieved higher diversity and performed better at stabilising prevalent oral bacteria, such as Streptococcus parasanguinis. Haemophilus sp. and Streptococcus sp (Figs\u00a04 and \u200band5).5). Bead solution is the initial buffer used in the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit, and is recommended by the Human Microbiome Project for storage of oral microbiome samples26, however, there has been no published studies evaluating the DNA preservation effect of this solution. Bead solution contains guanidine salts that are a protein denaturant and nucleic acid protector. While we found Bead solution to be a more effective storage medium compared to the more hazardous ethanol, ethanol has been far more widely used in molecular biology for microbial community stabilization and DNA preservation. This is because ethanol can inactivate enzymes such as DNAases and secondary metabolites, and it is globally accessible and low-cost relative to other stabilizers. Previous research using real time PCR found that storage in 70% ethanol at 4\u2009\u00b0C protected the DNA integrity of oral bacteria27. We also found ethanol could stabilise a wide range of oral bacteria at a similar level of performance to Bead solution, and that a single species, Rothia sp. (p\u2009=\u20099.39E-07), was significantly more abundant in samples stored in ethanol than Bead solution (Fig.\u00a05c). Potentially, a higher percentage of ethanol may have resulted in better preservation, as room temperature stored, faecal samples have been found to retain greater diversity when stored in 95% compared to 70% ethanol14. Our results indicate that for dental plaque, while Bead solution was a superior storage media, 75% ethanol was not substantially worse and is a suitable option, especially if cost is a limiting factor or Rothia species were of particular interest.",

Our finding that the microbiome composition of dental plaque samples was stable at low temperatures over months is supported by shorter-time scale studies comparing oral microbiome samples at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C for up to 2 weeks28 and longer-time scale studies comparing gut microbiome samples stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C for up to 14 years29.",

For the Bead solution stored samples, both the bead-beating and chemical disruption method (PowerSoil) and the chemical only lysis method (QIAamp) retrieved nearly identical microbiome profiles from dental plaque, in terms of both diversity and abundance (Fig.\u00a04). Our findings are consistent with previous studies showing a lack of impact of the addition of a bead-beating step on the microbiome composition from oral rinse25, saliva and plaque samples20. The addition of bead-beating has been found to improve the recovery of Firmicutes from oral rinse samples30, such as the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans19. We also found the only significantly more abundant bacteria in the Bead solution samples extracted with bead-beating compared to without, was a Firmicutes species (Streptococcus sp.) (Fig.\u00a05a). In comparison to our findings, studies based on mock communities have found that DNA extraction method exerted considerable influence on the observed bacterial diversity, retrieving higher diversity with an additional bead-beating step7,17,31. The inconsistency between our findings and others on the influence of bead-beating may arise from the difference between the non-biofilm, mock communities7,17,31 and human oral microbiota samples used in the study design25.",

However, amongst this higher diversity there was a significant loss of abundance of key oral bacteria with QIAamp compared to PowerSoil kit, including Streptococcus parasanguinis. Haemophilus sp. and Rothia sp (Fig.\u00a05c). This indicates that the ethanol may interact with buffers in the PowerSoil kit to negatively influence overall diversity, but that the addition of bead-beating still assists to recover important oral bacteria.",

Biological variation was captured by sampling 20 individual\u2019s dental plaque. The influence of inter-individual variation was strong, accounting for the majority of variation in shared phylogenetic diversity amongst extracts (68.1%, PC1) (Fig.\u00a03), compared to the storage and extraction method (14.1%, PC2) (Fig.\u00a04a). The strong influence of inter-individual variation on bacterial community composition has been previously found34\u201336. The finding of the influence of biological variation highlights the need to incorporate multiple individuals in microbiome methods testing studies, as opposed to one individual replicated multiple times37. For the purpose of assessing technical variation, all conditions for the second group of pooled samples were duplicated, with intra-condition variation playing a minor role.",

However, we did pool our samples into two groups to ensure adequate sample volume was available for the multiple comparison, an approach which has been used for prior oral and gut microbiota studies12,13,15,20. Secondly, our results are based on NGS with single target region of 16S (V4). However, Teng et al. has claimed that hypervariable regions have a relatively minor effect on the microbiome composition recovered and that the V4 region produced more reproducible results than other hypervariable regions (V1\u2013V3)19. Finally, our analysis does not reveal whether storage media, storage duration and extraction kit would affect the preservation of other microbes, such as Fungi and Archaea.",

Of the two storage media tested, Bead solution recapitulated the original picture of dental plaque, retrieving higher diversity and higher abundance of key oral bacteria, independent of using a DNA extraction with or without bead-beating. For ethanol stored samples, the QIAamp kit was superior at retrieving more overall diversity, but the PowerSoil kit retrieved a higher abundance of prevalent oral species. This study provides empirical evidence to researchers to assist with the selection of an appropriate storage media for dental plaque, especially for long-term storage, and the compatible extraction kit for DNA isolation, following which NGS can be performed to help broadening the knowledge on the role of oral microbiome in health and disease.",
