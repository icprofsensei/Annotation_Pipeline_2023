                    "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF; OMIM 219700) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the exocrine glands of the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems. The clinical manifestations of CF in affected individuals vary widely, with both age at diagnosis and lethality ranging from the first year of life to the third (and later) decade [1]. In CF, the chronic infection of respiratory tract leads to progressive respiratory deficiency [2]. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene lead to the accumulation of mucus on epithelial surfaces mainly in pancreas, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts [3], [4]. The CFTR gene (OMIM 602421) functions as a chloride channel that regulates ions and water transport across epithelial cell membranes. Around 1500 mutations and 300 polymorphisms in the CFTR gene are known (Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database; http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/), usually grouped in five classes representative of all the possible alterations in the maturation process and/or transfer of the CFTR protein [1], [5]. In this five-class system, mutations belonging to classes I, II, and III are predicted to have severe functional consequences on CFTR function via different molecular mechanisms. Mutations belonging to classes IV and V, on the other hand, are expected to confer some residual function to CFTR channel, and thus to give milder symptoms. Based on the residual functionality of the protein, mutations are classified as mild or severe, even if a direct correlation among CFTR genotype and severity of clinical manifestations is known only for the pancreatic status, not for the lung status [4]. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the loss of the CFTR function results in a dehydrated state of the lumen that is believed to contribute to the insolubility of secreted mucus and glycoproteins. The GI tract represents an additional site where the CF pathology is early manifested, with severe consequences [4], [6]. In CF patients many factors predispose to the onset of the small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO) condition, characterized by a high bacterial load in the small intestine [7]. Such a condition could lead to impairment of quality of life at an early stage and also later in the lifespan of an individual. Among the many factors influencing the microbiota composition, the genetic background could act a specific role, as already assessed in other studies [8], [9]. Under this hypothesis, the present study aimed to find out a correlation between faecal microbiota composition and the CFTR gene mutations in a cohort of CF patients. To this end, the presence of a control cohort was not necessary, because we aimed to depict the variability in microbiota composition mainly driven by different CFTR alleles, related to different clinical forms of CF disease. To this purpose, we selected a cohort of 36 CF patients and classified them by means of two different criteria: 1) presence/absence of F508del mutation; 2) disease severity in heterozygous and homozygous F508del patients. Dominant microbiota of faecal samples was characterized by Temporal Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TTGE), a semi-quantitative technique useful for comparative purposes, and by species-specific PCR of cultivable bacterial species usually found in faeces. The results obtained were correlated to the two CF patients classifications, through statistical analysis, in order to find out if mutations in the CFTR gene could be related to the microbiota population structure. We also described shifts in faecal microbiota composition driven by CFTR genetic background in terms of ecological structure.",

A first-level genetic investigation was achieved by an ABI PRISM 3100 Avant genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems), through the multiplex DNA test \u2018PCR/OLA/SCS\u2019 (Brinson et al., 1997; Grossman et al., 1994), encompassing the 32 most frequent mutations of the CFTR gene. All patients who had not been characterized by PCR/OLA/SCS were subjected to a second-level genetic investigation, by an ABI PRISM 3130 xl genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems), with direct sequencing of the CFTR gene [10]. The effect of CFTR mutations found and, whenever possible, the functional class, were deduced from literature data [1]. In order to classify the patients we used as criteria of severity: 1) patients characterized by the presence of severe mutations (if known, of class I, II, III) in homozygous or compound heterozygous state and pancreas insufficiency (severe, annotated as 1 in Table 1); \u200b);2)2) patients characterized by the presence of mild mutations (if known, of class IV and V) in homozygous or compound heterozygous state and pancreatic sufficiency (mild, annotated as 0 in Table 1). The mutations found within this case series may be classified as follows. Class I, II or III: G542X, W1282X, F508del, N1303K, L1065P, L1077P, Y569D, S549R(A>C). Class IV or V: R117H, 2789+5G>A, TG12T5, R347P, D1152H, R117C. For the growth evaluation, for patients from birth to 20 years, the weight and height percentiles, the IBW (weigh for height index), and the Body Mass Index (BMI) were assessed, as valid criteria to give assessment of patients nutritional status for all patients age [11]. The assessment of body weight is easy to perform and very useful because the weight gain may be compromised in patients with CF. The height is generally less frequently compromised than the body weight, so its deficit is indicative of a serious and persistent malnutrition. Lung function was assessed by the quantity of air exhaled in one second during a forced breath (FEV1), expressed as a percentage of the theoretical value [12]. As a tool for assessing spirometry was used the Sensor Medics Vmax229. The sweat test was performed with the method of Gibson and Cooke pilocarpine iontophoresis [13], by using Macroduct Collection System and Chloride Meter Jenway System for lecture. The test is considered positive for Cl concentrations above 60 mmol/L, considered negative with values below 40 mmol/L (30 mmol/L for infants). The sweat test with values ranging between 40\u201360 mmol/L (30\u201360 mmol/L for infants) were considered borderline. The faecal elastase assay, ELISA stool test Schebo Pancreatic Elastase 1, was used to evaluate the pancreatic exocrine function. Faecal elastase values were considered normal in the range 200\u2013500 mg/g of faeces, borderline between 100\u2013200 mg/g, pathological if less than 100 mg/g of faeces.",

PCR was performed with Taq DNA-polymerase (Hot Star Taq Plus, QIAGEN). PCR reaction (25 \u00b5L) contained 1\u00d7 buffer per PCR, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 \u00b5M for each dNTP, 0.5 \u00b5M of GCclamp-U968 and L1401 primers, 1.25 U of Taq polymerase and 100 ng of total DNA.

Due to the high prevalence of F508del mutation (Figure S1), we choose to divide patients in 3 classes: homozygous-F508del (n\u200a=\u200a5), heterozygous-F508del (n\u200a=\u200a19) or non-F508del mutation (n\u200a=\u200a12). Their TTGE profiles of faecal microbiota were regressed against this first criterion by means of PLS-DA algorithm, to assess if F508del mutation could affect the faecal microbiota structure in a particular way. We reported representative mean TTGE profiles for each of the three classes, along with a heatmap based on Euclidean distance generated by means of the online tool CIMminer (Figure 1, panel A). In this latter, the red areas correspond to the TTGE bands with higher importance in dividing the three classes, showing how the different genetic background, due to the homozygous-F508del, heterozygous-F508del and non-F508del, arise different faecal microbiota compositions in CF patients.

In order to assess if the faecal microbiota structure would be affected by CF disease severity, we choose all the CF patients harbouring at least one F508del mutation. Once established that F508del drives a different faecal microbiota composition (see above), we focused our attention on homozygous-F508del (n\u200a=\u200a5) and heterozigous-F508del (n\u200a=\u200a19) patients, dividing them into two distinct classes: mild (n\u200a=\u200a10) and severe (n\u200a=\u200a14). Their TTGE profiles of faecal microbiota were regressed against this second criterion by means of OPLS-DA algorithm: this criterion was chosen because F508del mutation was found in 24/36 (66.7%) of CF patients, thus allowing a common background to investigate the role of the other CFTR allele on faecal microbiota composition. We reported representative mean TTGE profiles for each of the two classes, along with a heatmap based on Euclidean distance generated by means of the online tool CIMminer (Figure 2, panel A). In the heatmap, red areas correspond to the TTGE bands with higher importance in dividing the severe and mild classes, showing how the different genetic background, due to the other non-F508del allele, could shape a different faecal microbiota compositions in CF patients. A score plot obtained by the OPLS-DA analysis was also drawn (Figure 2, panel B), showing a significant separation among the two classes of CF patients (Total error\u200a=\u200a0%, Fisher\u2019s P\u200a=\u200a1.2*10\u22126). Thus, CFTR mutations, driving a mild or severe clinical phenotype in CF patients, could also drive, in some measure, the faecal microbiota composition.",

                    "text": "To determine which aspects of community composition were most related to CFTR mutation, specific ecological parameters were computed for each TTGE profile: Simpson biodiversity (Hsi), Simpson equiripartition index (Esi), normalized carrying capacity (Rrnorm), Gini coefficient of inequality (C), and normalized Pareto-Lorenz curves (PL0.5). Even if the TTGE is considered a semi-quantitative technique, it can describe bacteria that constitute up to 1% of the total bacterial community [19], [20]: thus, due to this resolution power, it can properly describe changes in bacterial community structure. Taking into account all CF patients, without any classification, we found linear correlations among the ecological parameters: Esi and Hsi (R2\u200a=\u200a0.925), C and PL0.5 (R2\u200a=\u200a0.926) were linearly and positive correlated, whilst Esi and C, Hsi and C were linearly correlated with a negative slope (Figure 3). Rrnorm parameter showed no correlation with Esi, Hsi, C, or PL0.5 (results not shown). Mann-Whitney U test was used to calculate putative ecological differences among faecal microbiota of homozygous-F508del, heterozygous-F508del and non-F508del groups (criterion I). The same test was used to quantify differences in ecological parameters among severe and mild CF patients (criterion II). In Table 3 are the results. Homozygous F508del mutation led the faecal microbiota to higher evenness (Esi) (P\u200a=\u200a0.027) and higher biodiversity (Hsi), compared to heterozygous-F508del and non-F508del. Severe CF patients showed a faecal microbiota with lesser inequality of the bacterial population structure (C) and lesser dominance of particular bacterial species (PL0.5), compared to the mild one (P\u200a=\u200a0.024). At a microbial community level, these results could explain why F508del mutation led to a different faecal microbiota composition, as well as the CF disease severity did.",

Species-specific PCR assays were performed to achieve a presence/absence and a relative quantification of some cultivable bacterial species usually found in faeces, as reported in literature [15], [16]. After an accurate correction for the intra-species number of 16S rDNA operons, a matrix of relative quantification based on 1% agarose gel densitometry was built, combined with species-specific prevalence data, and processed with Mann-Whitney U test to assess putative differences in bacterial relative abundances. Among sixteen bacterial species or groups examined (Table 2), only five were found to be differentially distributed, in terms of relative abundance, in faecal samples of CF patients divided by the two classification criteria: Escherichia coli, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium group, Eubacterium limosum, Eubacterium biforme. We found higher levels of E. coli and E. biforme in homozygous-F508del patients, and, at the same time, higher levels of F. prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium, and E. limosum in non-F508del patients (Figure 4). Taking into account the criterion II, we found that severe CF patients harboured more E. coli and E. biforme than mild one, which, in turn, had higher levels of F. prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium, and E. limosum in their faecal samples (Figure 5).",

                    "text": "Recently, the intricate molecular mechanisms underpinning the host-microbe cross-talk has begun to emerge. Gut microbiota, the biggest bacterial community in our body, exerts many beneficial effects on our health, acting like an \u2018organ\u2019 with peculiar characteristics in its composition and function [21]. Many features can shape the gut microbiota structure: sex [22], diet [23], birth delivery [24], feeding mode [25], and disease status [26]. Up to date, only two studies focused on the role of human genetics as a modifier agent of gut microbiota composition: the first, in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) [9], and the second, in Familiar Mediterranean Fever (FMF) [8]. Like FMF, Cystic fibrosis is a good candidate to assess how the genetic background could shape the gut microbiota, due to its monogenic nature (unlike IBD, where 99 loci are known to play a role [27]). During development, intestine is the first district in which high levels of CFTR mRNA are expressed, and are constitutively maintained during all the lifetime [28]. The intestine usually presents high protein or mucous loads, together with low flow rates, and CFTR defects lead to abnormalities in: gastrointestinal tissue morphology, electrolytes secretion, mucus secretion, protein concentration, and protein folding [28]. For this reason, a loss of function of CFTR protein can lead to intestinal obstruction (called ileum meconium) as the earliest clinical phenotype of CF, and to intestinal complications in paediatric/adult age as a secondary site of CF manifestations (after the lung) [28]. Recently, it was found how a diminished pH in airway epithelia from CFTR\n\u2212/\u2212 pigs impaired bacterial killing [29], and it could be speculated a similar event also in the gastrointestinal tract, where a particular microbiota could arise [30].",

                    "text": "Our study hypothesis was that CFTR genetic background could act as a selective force, able to drive a different gut microbiota, as well as the faecal one, in CF patients. Gut microbiota encompasses mucosa-associated and luminal microbiota, while faeces mainly harbor the luminal part of the gut microbiota. Therefore, we showed here how CFTR gene variants were related to shifts in faecal microbiota profiles of CF patients. Particularly, we found that the most common CFTR mutation, F508del, found in 66.7% of our patients, led to a peculiar composition of faecal microbiota, especially in the homozygous state (Fig. 1), in which E. coli and E. biforme species prevailed (Fig. 4). The potential effect that differences in sample size could have on data interpretation, e.g. in the case of the five homozygous F508del patients, was considered and taken into account in the multivariate statistical analysis by intra-variance correction. Such results are to be considered indicative for future studies addressed to investigate the role of homozygous F508del state in human subjects more deeply. F508del mutation arose around 11000 years ago, spreading out during the Neolithic human expansion, due to a putative selective advantage of heterozygous F508del state [31]. Following literature data, F508del mutation belongs to the second class of CFTR mutations, in which loss of function of the resulting CFTR protein heavily impairs chloride secretion, leading to a higher thickness and viscosity of the mucus layer [1], [5]. It could be arguable that such a peculiar intestinal habitat, along with an inflamed mucosal state, could enhance the adhesion capability of particular bacterial species, such as E. coli and E. biforme, leading to higher counts in their populations, as already established for E. coli strains in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases [32]. Indeed, we found these two bacterial species to be prevalent also in faecal samples from severe CF patients, not from mild (Fig. 5). The mean percentages of E. coli and E. biforme in faecal samples are usually 1.21% [33] and 1.00% [34], respectively. Thus, the expected E. coli/E. biforme ratio of the mean relative abundances in a faecal sample from healthy subjects should be around 1.2. Actually, in a parallel on-going study, we found that E. coli/E. biforme mean ratio within our cohort of healthy subjects was 1.6, and this ratio grew up to 50.4 in an age- and sex-matched CF cohort (unpublished data, not shown here). Notably, E. coli differs from E. biforme not only for the cell wall properties (the former is Gram-negative, the latter is Gram-positive), but also for antibiotic susceptibility [35].",

The high prevalence of E. coli found could be due to its enhanced fitness in the CF intestinal habitat as already observed in Celiac disease [36] and IBD [32], [37]. We could hypothesize that high levels of E. coli in homozygous F508del and severe CF patients would be related to a \u2018pathobiont\u2019 sub-population. Since there is an increasing evidence of intestinal inflammation in CF [38], this habitat could be at the origin of a positive selection for inflammation-adapted E. coli \u2018pathobionts\u2019, as well as it happens in other disorders. In IBD patients with underlying genetic mutations, inflammation is targeted to specific members of the microbiota and not to infectious pathogens [39]. Moreover, other authors found that Escherichia genus, as well as Clostridium and Enterococcus, that reside in all people, are usually targeted by T cell response in an inflamed intestinal habitat, leading to the \u2018pathobiont\u2019 hypothesis [40], [41]. E. biforme resulted to be significantly present in homozygous-F508del (Fig. 4) and severe CF patients (Fig. 5). This bacterial species was isolated from human faeces, rumen, sewage and soil, but it was occasionally isolated from wounds, abscesses and periodontitis, thus it may be considered an opportunistic pathogen [34], [42]. At the same time, both in homozygous-F508del and severe CF patients, we also found a marked reduction in beneficial bacterial species, as stated in literature, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii\n[43], Bifidobacterium spp., and Eubacterium limosum\n[44] (Fig. 4 and \u200band5).5). Interestingly, it is conceivable that E. biforme doesn\u2019t belong to the same genus of E. limosum, because the former belongs to Erysipelotrichi class, while the latter belongs to Clostridia class, both within the Firmicutes phylum. Thus, a within-the-genus different bacterial habit should be taken unambiguously, albeit E. biforme and E. limosum apparently have the same \u2018genus\u2019 designation. From the aforementioned results, one could realize that CFTR genetic background in homozygous-F508del and severe patients led to an enhanced dysbiosis, with the prevalence of E. coli and E. biforme species, even within the CF cohort itself. Indeed, we found that biodiversity (Hsi), evenness (Esi), and carrying capacity (Rrnorm) were significantly higher in homozygous-F508del patients, while inequality (C) and community dominance (PL0.5) were lower in severe CF patients (Table 3). These results are in agreement with the hypothesis of an enhanced SBBO in the gut of CF patients [7], eventually leading to a major load of bacterial counts and by-products that could stimulate an exaggerated mucosal response in the gut. Owing to faeces that mainly represent the luminal bacteria, in order to properly assess an in situ dysbiotic event, further experiments should be done on intestinal biopsies from CF patients, similarly to what has recently been done on samples from transplanted lungs [45]. Such a requirement could be difficult to be achieved, because CF patients usually don\u2019t undergo gastro-duodenoscopy or endoscopy in their clinical follow-up, and, most importantly, intestinal symptoms are commonly underestimated [2], [6], [28]. It is noteworthy that our cohort was not under antibiotic treatment for two months before faecal sampling, nor the patients underwent a probiotic usage: thus, the role of the CFTR gene on shaping the faecal microbiota was not influenced by such treatments. Previously, it was demonstrated a relation among CFTR gene mutations and modifications induced in the airway microbiota in 51 CF patients [46], thus, the common genetic background could establish a link among the two main body districts in which CFTR mRNA is expressed: the lung and the gut [28]. Recent studies evidenced an emerging view of an intimate cross-talk [47] existing among the lung and the gut, especially in CF [48]. Thus, CF disease could be perceived as a \u2018systemic disease\u2019, in which pulmonary and intestinal habitats are interconnected in a \u2018lung-gut axis\u2019 by immunological system, common genetic background (like CFTR), and, ultimately, some bacterial or viral species, or they by-products [47]. Clinical studies should be pointed towards a holistic view of the comorbidities existing within a disease: such an effort should also ameliorate the CF treatment regimens. The present study was only on an observational basis: further experiments with mice, or pigs, carrying mutated CFTR variants, would shed light on the actual microbiota-modulating properties of CFTR gene. This kind of study would improve the knowledge on the refined interactions existing among host and microbiota, important step to set up new therapy strategies aimed at restoring and maintaining an healthy intestinal microbiota in CF patients, and to ameliorate their clinical conditions.",
