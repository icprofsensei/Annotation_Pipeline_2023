Short spacer sequences separated by the repeats are derived from foreign DNA and direct interference to future infections. The availability of hundreds of shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) enables us to explore the distribution and diversity of known CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities and to discover new CRISPRs. We propose a targeted assembly strategy to reconstruct CRISPR arrays, which whole-metagenome assemblies fail to identify. For each known CRISPR type (identified from reference genomes), we use its direct repeat consensus sequence to recruit reads from each HMP dataset and then assemble the recruited reads into CRISPR loci; the unique spacer sequences can then be extracted for analysis. We also identified novel CRISPRs or new CRISPR variants in contigs from whole-metagenome assemblies and used targeted assembly to more comprehensively identify these CRISPRs across samples. We observed that the distributions of CRISPRs (including 64 known and 86 novel ones) are largely body-site specific. We provide detailed analysis of several CRISPR loci, including novel CRISPRs. For example, known streptococcal CRISPRs were identified in most oral microbiomes, totaling \u223c8,000 unique spacers: samples resampled from the same individual and oral site shared the most spacers; different oral sites from the same individual shared significantly fewer, while different individuals had almost no common spacers, indicating the impact of subtle niche differences on the evolution of CRISPR defenses. We further demonstrate potential applications of CRISPRs to the tracing of rare species and the virus exposure of individuals. This work indicates the importance of effective identification and characterization of CRISPR loci to the study of the dynamic ecology of microbiomes.",

CRISPR/Cas systems are a widespread class of adaptive immune systems in bacteria and archaea, providing acquired immunity against foreign nucleic acids: CRISPR/Cas defense pathways involve integration of viral- or plasmid-derived DNA segments into CRISPR arrays (forming spacers between repeated structural sequences), and expression of short crRNAs from these single repeat-spacer units, to generate interference to future invading foreign genomes. Powered by an effective computational approach (the targeted assembly approach for CRISPR), our analysis of CRISPR arrays in the HMP datasets provides the very first global view of bacterial immunity systems in human-associated microbial communities.

CRISPR/Cas systems commonly use repeat and spacer-derived short guide CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to silence foreign nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner [8], . CRISPR/Cas defense pathways involve several steps, including integration of viral or plasmid DNA-derived spacers into the CRISPR array, expression of short crRNAs consisting of unique single repeat-spacer units, and interference with invading foreign genomes at both the DNA and RNA levels, by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood [8], [10]. The diversity of cas genes suggests that multiple pathways have arisen to use the basic information contained in the repeat-spacer units in diverse defense mechanisms. The CRISPR components are evolutionarily closely linked and potentially evolve simultaneously as an intact locus\u2014sequence analysis reveals that the direct repeats in CRISPR locus and the linked cas genes co-evolve under analogous evolutionary pressure [11].",

Infectious disease works to maintain both species diversity [18], [19] and genotypic diversity [20] within a species, as has recently been shown for marine microbiomes [21], [22]. As such, infectious agents may be at least partially responsible for the amazing species diversity and turnover found throughout the human microbiome [23]. The ability of CRISPR loci to prevent plasmid spread is medically relevant, in that the exchange of conjugative elements is perhaps the dominant mechanism by which antibiotic resistance genes (notably multi-drug resistance) move within a biome, and by which pathogens acquire resistance [24]; CRISPR activities could be expected to retard this exchange (e.g.\n[25]).",

We developed a targeted assembly strategy (see Figure 1) to better identify CRISPRs in shotgun metagenomic sequences, as whole-metagenomic assembly failed to reconstruct many CRISPRs that otherwise could be identified. All of the programs available to date [27], [28], [29], [30] are designed to find CRISPRS from assembled contigs that are sufficiently long to contain at least partial CRISPR loci; however, it is very difficult to assemble metagenome reads into contigs containing CRISPR loci, because of their repeated structures. We thus needed to collect sequencing reads associated with CRISPRs and assemble them specifically. For known CRISPRs (identified in reference genomes), we identified consensus sequences of CRISPR repeats, collected the reads containing these sequences, and assembled these reads into CRISPR contigs. We also identified CRISPRs from the whole-metagenome assemblies, and for the novel CRISPRs or new CRISPR variants (that are not seen in the reference genomes), applied the same assembly strategy to achieve a more comprehensive identification of the novel CRISPRs across the samples. This approach allows us to study the evolution of CRISPRs in human microbiomes.",

A total of 14 unique but related repeat sequences were identified from 278 CRISPR contigs, and two of them (which differ at 3 positions) are dominant, constituting 71% of the repeats in the CRISPR contigs. Notably, all the repeats could be clustered into a single consensus sequence with an identity threshold of 88%. By contrast, the spacer sequences are very diverse across different samples. For example, we obtained a total of 352 unique spacer sequences, which were clustered into 345 consensus sequences with an identity threshold of 90%.

An edge in the network between two CRISPR repeats, each represented by a node, indicates that the two repeats can be transformed from one to another by at most 10 operations (including mutations, insertions, and deletions). Since it is difficult to determine the direction of CRISPR repeats [7] (especially for the CRISPR arrays that have incomplete structures), given two repeats, we calculated two edit distances\u2014one is the distance between the two repeats, and the other one is between one repeat and the reverse complement of the other\u2014and used the smaller value as the edit distance between the two repeats. The global network (Figure 3A; see Figure S1 with node labels) shows that most of the novel CRISPRs identified in the human microbiomes are remotely related to ones identified in complete (or draft) genomes. Still, there are small clusters that contain only novel HMP CRISPRs, indicating that these CRISPRs are substantially different from ones identified in the reference genomes. In Figure 3B, we have colored nodes by body site: while specific CRISPR repeats can be highly specific to body site (see below), the larger families of repeats shown in Figure 3B do not appear to cluster based on body site.",

F0314, but these two CRISPRs show distinct absence/presence profiles across body sites (see Table 3). For stool samples, there exists only CRISPR Neis_t014_L28 in 51 datasets, but not Neis_t014_L36. And Neis_t014_L36 is relatively more prevalent in oral-associated samples as compared to Neis_t014_L28. The different body site distributions can be explained by the fact that these two CRISPRs are found in different sets of genomes (although both can exist in a common genome, Neisseria sp. oral taxon 014 str. F0314). Neis_t014_L36 has been identified in multiple Neisseria genomes, including Neisseria meningitidis ATCC 13091, Neisseria meningitidis 8013 (so Neis_t014_L36 belongs to the Nmeni subtype among the 8 subtypes defined by Haft et al [33]), Neisseria flavescens SK114, and Actinobacillus minor NM305. Neis_t014_L28, however, was only found in Neisseria sp. oral taxon 014 str. F0314. On the other hand, even though we could not find any CRISPRs containing the exactly same repeat as Neis_t014_L28 in the complete/draft genomes other than Neisseria sp. oral taxon 014 str. F0314, many CRISPRs, when a few mismatches are allowed, were found in diverse genomes (for example, Crenothrix polyspora, Legionella pneumophila 2300/99 Alcoy, and Thioalkalivibrio sp. K90mix) from environmental samples.",

AlactL29, initially identified from the Anaerococcus lactolyticus genome, was found only in 3 vaginal samples. Notably, LjensL36 was found in 28 vaginal samples (which comprise 43% of vaginal samples collected) and 1 skin sample. This observation is consistent with a previous study showing that Lactobacillus constitutes over 70% of all bacteria sampled from vaginas of healthy, fertile women, and Lactobacillus jensenii is one of the major genomes [34]. Interestingly, we could find evidence of adaptation in the LjensL36 spacer against Lactobacillus phage Lv-1 (NC_011801) (see below). LjassL36 was found in 33 vaginal samples by targeted assembly. We confirmed that it is in different Lactobacillus genomes, such as Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus, by BLAST search. CRISPR LcrisL29, which was identified in the Lactobacillus crispatus genome, was found in 31 vaginal samples, and we found the same repeat sequence in the Lactobacillus helveticus genome.",

Figure 5 shows the spacer sharing among 6 selected individuals, each of whom has multiple samples with identified streptococcal CRISPRs from multiple body sites (see Figure S5 for the spacer sharing with spacers clustered at 80% sequence identify). By examining the distribution of the spacers across samples, we observed that samples re-sampled from the same individual and oral site shared the most spacers, different oral sites from the same individual shared significantly fewer, while different individuals had almost no common spacers, indicating the impact of subtle niche differences and histories on the evolution of CRISPRs. Our observation is largely consistent with the conclusion from Pride et al.\n[26]. But our study showed that different samples from the same oral site of the same person, even samples collected many months apart, could still share a significant number of spacers (e.g., the supragingival plaque samples from individual 1 in visit 1 and visit 2, with 238 days between the two visits, and the tongue dorsum samples from individual 5 in visit 1 and visit 3, with 336 days between the two visits; as shown in Figure 5). Our study also showed that although the different oral sites of the same individual share similar spacers, this sharing (e.g., between the supragingival plaque sample and the buccal mucosa sample for individual 1) is minimal, as compared to the spacer sharing between samples collected in different visits but from the same oral site (e.g., between the supragingival plaque samples from visit 1 and visit 2 for individual 1). Finally, our study shows that the spacer turnover varies among individuals\u2014for the 6 selected individuals, individual 3 shows significantly higher turnover of the spacers between visits, as compared to other individuals.",

However, previous studies have shown that only 2% of the spacer sequences have matches in GenBank, which is probably due to the fact that bacteriophage and plasmids are still poorly represented in databases [13], [14]. Similarity searches of identified spacers against viral genomes enable identification of the viral sources of the spacers (i.e., proto-spacers) captured in each CRISPR locus. For example, similarity searches of the 7,815 unique spacers in the streptococcal CRISPR against viral genomes revealed similarities between streptococcal spacers and 22 viral genomes (species names and accession IDs are listed in Table S4), and the two most prevalent viruses are Streptococcus phage PH10 (NC_012756) and Streptococcus phage Cp-1 (NC_001825) (see Figure 6A). Figure 6B suggests that the potential proto-spacers are rather evenly distributed along the phage genomes (except for a few regions, including a region that encodes for an integrase, which is highlighted in red in Figure 6B). Although the positional distribution of the proto-spacers is close to random, the sequences adjoining the proto-spacers for streptococcal CRISPR we identified in the virus genomes showed conserved short sequence motifs (GG) (see Figure S7 for the sequence logo), which is also the most common proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) shared by several CRISPR groups, as reported in [38].",

All the PpropL29-related repeats identified in these samples can be clustered into 7 unique sequences. In order to find the most likely reference genomes for these 7 unique repeat sequences, we blasted these repeat sequences against the human microbiome reference genomes and found 100% identity matches in the Lautropia mirabills genome. To investigate the overall coverage of this genome by the reads (not only the CRISPR regions), we mapped the entire collection of reads from four samples: SRS019980 and SRS021477 (both are from supragingival plaque, and have an 100% identity match with the CRISPR repeat in the Lautropia mirabills genome); SRS019974 (from tongue dorsum, with a slightly different CRISPR repeat sequence with 3 differences); and SRS019906 (which does not contain any CRISPR repeats similar to PpropL29, used as a control). The mapping results show the reads from two samples SRS019980 and SRS021477 each cover \u223c80% of the Lautropia mirabills genome, which is very significant evidence that these two microbiomes include Lautropia mirabills. But the other two samples have only a limited number of reads mapped to the genome (e.g., only 3089, reads in SRS019906 were mapped into Lautropia mirabills). This contrast suggests that identification of CRISPRs by targeted assembly could provide significant evidence for the existence of certain rare genomes.",

Once seeding CRISPRs are identified from whole-metagenome assemblies, we can go back to the original short read datasets, and pursue a comprehensive characterization of the CRISPRs, using the targeted assembly approach. Also, we did not fully utilize the presence of cas genes for identification of novel CRISPRs in our study, since in many cases we can identify arrays of repeats, but not their associated cas genes. A future direction is to combine targeted assembly of CRISPRs and whole-metagenome assembly, aiming to achieve even better assembly of the CRISPR loci with more complete structures, including cas genes and the arrays of repeats and spacers. Such an improvement is necessary to achieve a more comprehensive characterization of especially the novel CRISPRs discovered in metagenomes, and the temporal order of spacer addition to arrays.",

The identification of CRISPR spacers opens up several potential applications, including tracing the viral exposure of the hosts, studying the sequence patterns of the regions adjoining the spacer precursors in viral genomes, and discovering viral contigs in metagenome assemblies. It has been shown that short sequence motifs found in the regions adjacent to the spacer precursors in the viral genomes determine the targets of the CRISPR defense system [38], and we were able to analyze the sequence patterns of regions adjacent to spacer precursors for several CRISPRs with the most spacers identified in the HMP datasets (including SmutaL36, LjensL36, and KoralL32; see sequence logos in Figure S7). When more metagenomic datasets become available, we will extend the analysis to more CRISPRs, which may provide insights into the mechanism of the CRISPR defense system (including the turnover patterns of the CRISPR spacers, and the target recognition of the CRISPR defense systems). Our preliminary exploration of viral contigs\u2014by searching CRISPR spacers against whole-metagenome assemblies\u2014suggests that we can identify new virus genomes in metagenome assemblies; further computational and experimental analysis will be needed to confirm these contigs.",

The parameters were chosen to minimize false CRISPRs, considering that a CRISPR array typically contains 27 repeats, with an average repeat length of 32 base pairs [28]. We only kept CRISPRs that can be found in at least one of the whole-metagenome assemblies, using CRISPRAlign. We further reduced the number of candidate CRISPRs by keeping only those that share at most 90% sequence identity along their repeats by CD-HIT [39], as there are CRISPRs that share very similar repeats, and our targeted assembly strategy can recover the CRISPRs with slight repeat differences. To avoid including a repeat and its reverse complete (metaCRT does not consider the orientation for the repeats) in the non-redundant list, we included reverse complement sequences of the CRISPR repeats in the clustering process. Therefore, a repeat would be classified into two clusters by CD-HIT (the reverse complete of the repeat would be classified into a different cluster), one of which was removed to reduce redundancy.",

With these reads containing CRISPR repeat sequences, we ran SOAPdenovo [40] with k-mers of 45 bps, which are sufficiently long to assemble reads with the repetitive sequences found in CRISPRs. In general, whole-metagenome contigs are assembled using shorter k-mers (for example, 21\u201323 bps in MetaHit [41] and 25 bps in HMP assembly [42]), as longer k-mers often fragment assemblies into short contigs.
