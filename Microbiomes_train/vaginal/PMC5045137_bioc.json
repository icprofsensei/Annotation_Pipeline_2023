In this study, we investigated the oral, anal, and cervical microbiomes from the same 20 sexually active adolescent females, using culture-independent, next-generation sequencing. DNA from each sample was amplified for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and sequenced on an Illumina platform using paired-end reads. Across the three anatomical niches, we found significant differences in bacterial community composition and diversity. Overall anal samples were dominated with Prevotella and Bacteriodes, oral samples with Streptococcus and Prevotella, and cervical samples with Lactobacillus. The microbiomes of a few cervical samples clustered with anal samples in weighted principal coordinate analyses, due in part to a higher proportion of Prevotella in those samples. Additionally, cervical samples had the lowest alpha diversity. Our results demonstrate the occurrence of distinct microbial communities across body sites within the same individual.",

In particular, these sites are frequently involved in sexual contact between individuals. In addition, potentially influential factors include frequency of exposure from the external environment, bacterial strains to which exposure occurs, and species selection due to nutrient availability, inter-microbial competition or immune system functions. All of these factors may vary across sites and between individuals. In addition, dispersal of organisms between these and other corporal niches most likely occurs and may vary between sites and individuals, especially during sexual contact. The extent to which any of these factors determine the local dynamics of these ecosystems or the global dynamics of the body\u2019s meta-ecosystem remains unknown. Furthermore, all three are body sites for which disease states are common and can be serious. Oral, anal, and cervical cancer have all been found to have increased risk due to infections with human papillomaviruses (HPV), however associations with host bacteria are not yet clear [3,4]. Apart from some well-known pathogens (e.g. Helicobacter pylori), interactions between microbial communities and pathogenesis remain poorly understood. There may also be forensic value in understanding inter-personal and inter-site variability for anal, oral, and cervical microbiotas. Previous studies have characterized the cervical [3] and oral microbiomes [5-7], but few have characterized the anal microbiome [8] using modern culture-independent molecular techniques, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, apart from one report [9], there have been no analyses of microbes from all three niches from the same cohort of individuals.",

The 3\u2019 end of the demultiplexed reads was trimmed with PrinSeq- lite V0.20.4 [16] to remove bases that had a PHRED quality score below 25. Processed reads were then merged with PANDASEQ 2.8.1 [17] if their overlap threshold exceeded 0.6. Reads were then quality filtered by using the usearch quality-filtering pipeline in QIIME 1.9 [18]: reads were sorted by length, de-replicated to ensure that only unique sequences were analyzed, sorted by abundance, and chimeras were removed by the implementation of usearch in QIIME. Taxonomy was assigned to the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clusters with uclust using a custom database. This custom database was constructed using the 13.8 release of Greengenes [19], the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) [20] and also included species in the Vaginal Microbiome Consortium (VMC) [21]. Once created the database was pruned for redundancy in order to ensure that there were no sequences with sequence similarity of 97 percent or greater. The merging of these databases allowed for the identification of clinically relevant species like Gardnerella vaginalis. Using this database, we employed R 3.2.1 [22] with the Phyloseq package V1.12.2 in order to parse the QIIME generated biom table.",

The phyloseq [23] R package was used to calculate the Shannon index rarefaction curves, with 1000 iterations of 100 steps between the smallest and largest sample read numbers, in order to determine the minimum sample read numbers for downstream analyses. Phyloseq was also used to compute the Simpson diversity index for all samples. Abundance based analyses were performed by rarefying the samples to an even depth (1,000 observations in this case) and aggregating the OTU counts for OTUs that were assigned the same genus level taxonomy. Error for these analyses was determined by calculating the median absolute deviation, a robust measure of variability in a sample, with R stat package\u2019s mad function. The clustering for the heatmap was performed using the relative abundances of the samples in the Hierarchical cluster function, hclust, from the stat package using Euclidean distances and the ward.D2 clustering function. The plotting was performed with the heatmap.2 package. Plots for the boxplot abundance figures were constructed using ggplot2. Alpha diversity for the three body sites was analyzed by calculating the Simpson\u2019s diversity index, which takes into account both the abundance and evenness of present OTUs in each sample, using the richness function from phyloseq. The cor.test function from the R stats package was used to perform a Spearman rank correlation on the Simpson\u2019s alpha diversity indices between the various sites. Values were paired if the sample came from a different body site from the same individual. \u03b2-diversity was determined using Unifrac distance matrices and visualized using principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots with the phyloseq package. Pairwise significance between individual OTU abundances was calculated using the t.test function in R. The adonis function from vegan package V2.3 [24] was used in order to perform permutational multivariate analysis of variance calculations on the Unifrac distance matrices to determine whether there was significant site-specific variation based on phylogenic diversity. Weighted and unweighted PCoA plots were made with phyloseq and ggplot2 to show the extent to which abundance of unique taxa affected site clustering.",

The information presented includes 20 oral, 17 anal, and 17 cervical samples that had sufficient read counts for analysis. A total of six samples yielded insufficient reads ( < 1,000) to adequately represent their respective microbiotas, based on Shannon rarefaction curves. Rarefaction analysis of counts assigned at the genus level for each anatomic site suggested that we had sampled sufficiently to capture the majority of bacterial genera expected in each site (data not shown). While a per-sample rarefaction analysis (data not shown) suggested that some specimens contained an underestimate of the true number of genera present, the narrow width and long tail of the community distributions and their similarity to more deeply sampled specimens suggested that the proportions shown in Figure 1 are sufficiently accurate to be compared.",

Prevotella and Bacteroides are closely related gram-negative, non-motile, biofilm-forming genera, considered normal constituents of the mouth, gastrointestinal and female reproductive tracts. Certain species (e.g. Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphyromonas spp.) have been associated with perirectal abscesses [25], though it\u2019s unclear whether this association is simply due to the co-occurrence of the pathogens with the normal anal flora or whether certain components of the normal flora can, under certain circumstances become opportunistic pathogens of the epidermis. Two of the three global gastrointestinal enterotypes previously identified [26], have as their main constituents Prevotella and Bacteroides, respectively though none apparently exhibit a mixture of the two, such as that seen here.",

As also apparent from the clustering in Figure 1, some overlap occurs between anal and cervical microbiotas due to the presence of Prevotella spp. The pairwise comparison between anal and cervical clusters was not significantly different (p = 0.2), however, cervical with oral, or anal with oral were significantly different (p \u2264 0.001).",

A total of 14 out of 17 samples were dominated by Lactobacillus (median proportional abundance of 99.0 percent \u00b1 1.0 percent), which consisted of L. iners and L. crispatus at the species level, corresponding to community types III and I, respectively [3,29]. One sample (MS2313) was dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis (57.3 percent \u2013 community type IV), but apparently had sufficient Prevotella spp. to cluster with the anal samples. The remaining two samples (MS445 and MS2966) contained large proportions of Prevotella (83.1 percent and 19.8 percent respectively), Lactobacillus (21 percent, 29 percent, and 13 percent, respectively) and one (MS2966) also contained a large proportion of Gardnerella (29.7 percent). These latter three samples were unlike previously characterized cervical community types due to their large Prevotella component [3,29].",

A Spearman rank correlation was performed on the Euclidean distances of samples from each site relative to the samples from a reference subject at the same site. Samples were paired according to subject and each pairwise comparison between sites was performed. This tests if the degree of similarity between the microbiotas of two subjects is independent across niches. In other words, if the microbiotas of two subjects are similar in one niche, are they also similar in another niche. The results indicated they were not; there was no correlation with an absolute value greater than 0.2 and none of the values was statistically significant (p > 0.90 in all cases) (data not shown).",

A direct comparison across the three anatomical niches was possible for 16 of those participants and revealed significant variability both across sites and across patients. The group of oral microbiotas was significantly different form anal and cervical samples, whereas four of the cervical samples clustered with the anal samples, preventing the two groups (anal and cervical) from appearing statistically significantly different. The mediods of the cervical and anal samples on a principal component clustering were, however, at least as far apart as either was from that of the oral group. The most ecologically diverse niche was found to be the anal, followed by oral and then cervical, with cervical communities in most individuals exhibiting strong dominance by a single, but variable species, which is in agreement with previous findings in the majority of women [3,29,30].",

As this community type appears rarely, if this was the case a dispersal event may have had occurred recently and subsequent environmental selection would revert the community to a more common type over time. To confirm a process of dispersal followed by selection, cross-sample contamination would first need to be ruled out, then time-resolved data spanning a time-period before and after the dispersal event would need to be analyzed. However, it is only among the Prevotella genus that these samples showed similarity to the anal samples \u2013 they didn\u2019t for example contain Bacteroides. Furthermore, they appeared to have different distributions of Prevotella spp. than any of the anal samples (Figure 1). These factors indicate yet another possible explanation; that they may be of a distinct cervical microbiome community type that supports Prevotella spp. The co-occurrence of BVAB1 (bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria 1) at relatively high levels in three of these four samples may suggest a state of bacterial dysbiosis [9] in these subjects, and therefore may also explain why they do not cluster with the more common cervical microbiome community types.",

Among the 16 subjects for which direct comparison was possible, there was no evidence to suggest that similarity between the microbiotas from two individuals for one niche ensures a similar degree of similarity between their microbiotas in another niche; a Spearman rank correlation of Euclidean distances showed no statistically significant correlations. Environmental contribution (e.g., eating, breathing) and dispersal (e.g., digestion, sexual intercourse) of microorganisms all occur for each of these sites, with some regularity. These results therefore could indicate strong environmental selection of species through factors specific to anatomical niches that are relatively similar across individuals.However, in order to understand the dynamics of bacterial ecosystems, and thereby discover how best to manipulate microbiota for treating and preventing disease, it is essential for studies to gather time-resolved, simultaneous cross-site samples. Single time-point snapshots of microbiota provide the ability to characterize them with high accuracy, but, as is apparent from this study, only hint at the details of their complex dynamics.",
