Delivery of these drugs using intravaginal rings (IVRs) holds the potential benefits of improving adherence and decreasing systemic exposure, while maintaining steady-state drug levels in the vaginal tract. Elucidating how IVRs interact with the vaginal microbiome constitutes a critical step in evaluating the safety of these devices, as shifts the vaginal microbiome have been linked with several disease states. To date, clinical IVR trials have relied on culture-dependent methods that omit the high diversity of unculturable microbial population. Longitudinal, culture-independent characterization of the microbiota in vaginal samples from 6 women with recurrent genital HSV who used an acyclovir IVR was carried out and compared to the communities developing in biofilms on the IVR surface. The analysis utilized Illumina MiSeq sequence datasets generated from bar-coded amplicons of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Specific taxa in the vaginal communities of the study participants were found to be associated with the duration of recurrent genital HSV status and the number of HSV outbreaks. Taxonomic comparison of the vaginal and IVR biofilm communities did not reveal any significant differences, suggesting that the IVRs were not systematically enriched with members of the vaginal microbiome. Device usage did not alter the participants' vaginal microbial communities, within the confines of the current study design. Rigorous, molecular analysis of the effects of intravaginal devices on the corresponding microbial communities shows promise for integration with traditional approaches in the clinical evaluation of candidate products.",

Globally, HSV-2 is the most frequent cause of genital ulcer disease (Corey et al., 2004) and is associated with a three-fold increased risk for HIV-1 acquisition in women (Freeman et al., 2006). These epidemiological findings suggest that interventions against HSV-2 may have a key role in HIV prevention worldwide (Freeman et al., 2007). Daily oral valacyclovir (VACV), the 5\u2032-L-valyl ester prodrug of the antiherpetic drug acyclovir (ACV), has been shown to prevent or delay genital recurrences by 85% (Patel et al., 1997) and to reduce the risk of transmission among HSV-2-discordant couples by 48% (Corey et al., 2004).",

We hypothesize that sustained delivery of ACV to the vaginal tract can provide an alternative approach to oral suppressive therapy and may protect against sexual HSV acquisition. Delivering ACV from intravaginal rings (IVRs) holds potential benefits of improved adherence and low systemic exposure while maintaining steady-state drug levels in the vaginal tract. We previously developed a pod-IVR technology (Baum et al., 2012) that can deliver multiple compounds independently in a controlled, sustained fashion with pseudo-zero order kinetics (Moss et al., 2012a; Moss et al., 2012b; Moss et al., 2012c). The safety and pharmacokinetics of pod-IVRs delivering ACV in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) tenofovir (TFV) were evaluated successfully in the rabbit and sheep models (Moss et al., 2012c). Acyclovir tissue penetration in both models was not impaired by vaginal mucous. We designed human silicone IVRs to release ACV and evaluated safety, pharmacokinetic, and surrogate efficacy in women with recurrent genital HSV, referenced herein as \u201cgenital herpes positive\u201d (GHP), who switched their daily oral VACV suppression to the ACV pod-IVR for 7 and 14 days (Keller et al., 2012). This first-in-human study demonstrated that an IVR could safely deliver ACV and achieve comparable local mucosal levels to oral therapy without systemic absorption. The IVRs were well tolerated and there were no adverse events related to the ring, no abnormal colposcopic findings, and no reports of ring expulsions. There was no increase in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples following IVR insertion. No HSV viral DNA was detected in vaginal tract swab samples during the course of the study. The median ex vivo anti-HSV activity of CVL fluids increased from 32% in samples collected just prior to IVR insertion to 58% in samples collected 7 days after IVR use, suggesting that sufficient ACV was present to augment the endogenous anti-HSV activity of cervicovaginal secretions, even though CVL represents an approximately 50-fold dilution of vaginal fluids.",

In studies on IVRs delivering TFV in pig-tailed macaques, we used confocal laser scanning microscopy, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy to investigate IVR colonization by polymicrobial biofilms (Gunawardana et al., 2011). Large areas of the ring surfaces were covered with monolayers of epithelial cells that supported two biofilm phenotypes, both with a broad diversity of associated bacterial cells. Similar results were obtained in our clinical evaluation of IVRs delivering ACV in GHP women (Keller et al., 2012). By Day 7, epithelial cell clusters had developed on the IVR surface, with little or no visible associated microbial growth. At Day 14, large areas of the ring surface were covered with a mat of epithelial cells that harbored the development of polymicrobial biofilms with similar morphological features to the biofilm phenotypes in our macaque studies.",

Briefly, 6 HIV-negative, GHP women who were willing to change their suppressive oral VACV to an ACV IVR were enrolled into a pharmacokinetic and safety study. In order to prevent ACV washout from the vaginal tract, IVR insertion occurred within 24 h of oral VACV dosing, which was discontinued during the study. The first three participants used an ACV IVR for 7 days and had cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) collected prior to IVR placement; 1 and 3 days post-insertion; and at Day 7 when the IVR was removed. The final three participants used an ACV IVR for 14 days, and the study visits were extended to include sampling at 10 days after IVR insertion and at Day 14 when the IVR was removed. The study design resulted in the collection of 30 CVL samples: 6 at IVR placement; 6 on Day 1; 6 on Day 3; 3 on Day 7; 3 on Day 10; 6 at IVR removal. None of the women displayed symptoms suggestive of active vaginal or sexually transmitted infection (STI) during the study.

Sequences were filtered for quality using established guidelines (Bokulich et al., 2013). Quality-filtered reads were demultiplexed, yielding 3,989,623 sequences total with an average length of 151 bases per read, and an average coverage of 110,822 sequences per sample. Sequences were binned into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on 97% identity using UCLUST (Edgar, 2010) against the Greengenes reference database (McDonald et al., 2012) May 2013 release. The representative sequences for each OTU were compared against the Greengenes database for taxonomy assignment. Each sample's sequences was rarefied to a depth of 28,000 sequences per sample to reduce the effect of sequencing depth, and used for downstream analysis. This level of rarefaction was chosen to minimize the number of samples dropped from downstream analysis while maximizing the number of sequences allowed per sample. Following rarefaction, 1 sample (Subject60.CVL14.671842) was omitted from further analysis due to insufficient sequence coverage, yielding 35 samples and 581 OTUs in 980,000 sequences.",

The overall highest probability for discovering new OTUs in our samples was 1.295%, meaning that our sequencing had revealed 98.705% of the overall community diversity (Table S2). The \u03b2 diversity of samples was measured using the weighted UniFrac metric (Lozupone and Knight, 2008), and the dimensionality reduction technique of Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) was used to visualize the community differences. All correlations involving bacterial relative abundance were performed using the nonparametric Kendall's tau. The relative abundance of each taxon was calculated by dividing the sequences pertaining to a specific taxon by the total number of bacterial sequences for that sample. The statistical cutoff of P = 0.05 after False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons was used to define statistical significance when testing if taxa were significantly different between groups.",

For microbiome studies, power calculations are very much an emerging area. Traditional power calculations based on parametric distributions (e.g., assuming that the frequency data can be analyzed by t-tests or ANOVA) are often more misleading than useful in this context. Although recent work using Dirichlet models has been informative (Holmes et al., 2012; La Rosa et al., 2012), these models also make certain parametric assumptions that are not always well-founded in microbial data. We therefore performed a rarefaction analysis (Fig. S3) on a per-sample basis and the HMP dataset (Aagaard et al., 2013), showing the accumulation of new diversity in both qualitative (unweighted UniFrac) and quantitative (weighted UniFrac) measures of \u03b2 diversity. The analysis demonstrated that using the weighted UniFrac distance metric with 20 samples at 1000 sequences per sample covered more than 99.5% of total \u03b2 diversity seen in the vaginal communities characterized by the HMP. The sample size used in this study therefore is sufficient to draw general conclusions about how IVRs affect the vaginal communities of GHP women.",

Clinical trial failures with N-9, Carraguard, C31G (Savvy), and CS underscore the urgent need for comprehensive, early microbicide efficacy and safety assessment prior to large, Phase II/III clinical trials (Keller and Herold, 2009). The application of a culture-independent analysis to determining the effect of the microbicide IVR on the vaginal microbiota therefore was performed during early safety evaluation of this novel device, using 6 subjects in an exploratory clinical trial.

Two of the women in the current study had vaginal microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus iners, one dominated by L. helveticus, and the remaining 3 woman had more diverse vaginal communities, consisting mainly of Lactobacillus, Proteobacteria, the Bacteroidetes genus Prevotella, and the Actinobacteria Gardnerella vaginalis in varying proportions (Fig. S1 and Fig. 2). The vaginal bacterial communities of 5 participants are consistent with 2 of the 5 proposed major CSTs (Fig. S1). One of the study participants, however, had a vaginal community that was dominated (91% relative abundance) by Lactobacillus helveticus, a community structure that does not match with any of the CSTs. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that L. crispatus was not present in any of the samples although this species makes up a dominant member of one of the CSTs (Ravel et al., 2011). Larger cohorts of GHP women will be needed in future analyses to determine if these taxon differences are a consequence of GHP status, VACV suppressive therapy, or merely reflect the small sample size. The vaginal bacterial communities of the 6 study participants cluster primarily by individual (Fig. 2), an expected result given the large interpersonal variation observed across body sites (Ursell et al., 2012).",

To reduce the number of spurious correlations, only taxa that were present in at least 5 CVL samples with at least 2 representative sequences were included in the analysis. The first correlation was between the relative abundance of bacterial taxa and the duration of GHP status (median: 4.0 years, 2-8 year range) in the 6 study participants (Table S3A). Three of the most significant taxa that could be identified at the species level, for which the changes were statistically significant at the most stringent level, included Ureaplasma parvum (tau = 0.619, P = 0.0001), Gardnerella vaginalis (tau = 0.552, P = 0.00059), and Atopobium vaginae (tau = 0.534, P = 0.00071) (Fig. 3), and all exhibited a positive correlation between duration of GHP status and relative abundance. Many other taxa, identifiable to the genus level, also showed a positive correlation between duration of GHP and relative abundance including Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas, while some Lactobacillus taxa were negatively associated with GHP duration and relative abundance (Table S3A).",

Additional correlations with genus level taxa also were observed (Table S3B). While the small sample size precludes any definitive, generalizable conclusions concerning GHP status and the nature of associated organisms, the results are consistent with previous reports that identified a correlation between GHP women and an altered vaginal microflora (Cherpes et al., 2008; Kaul et al., 2007).",

Comparing the microbial communities developing on the IVRs (Day 7 or Day 14) with the corresponding vaginal microbiota in samples on the day of IVR removal did not identify any taxa that were different across all participants, suggesting that the IVR biofilms were not systematically enriched with any members of the vaginal microbiome. These results also suggest that no significant, selective biases were introduced as a result of the different DNA extraction methods used for CVL and IVR samples (see 2.2.). There were no significant taxonomic differences in the microbial communities between the IVR biofilms that were removed on Day 7 compared with those removed on Day 14, nor was the \u03b1 diversity of the IVR samples different from the vaginal (CVL) samples (Fig. S2).",

In order to determine the effect of the IVR's presence on the temporal dynamics of the vaginal communities, the \u03b2 diversity in each participant's IVR and vaginal samples was plotted over time (Fig. 4). The CVL and IVR samples were connected by a solid line through PCoA space, with the first point representing the starting CVL microbial community prior to IVR administration, and the final point representing the IVR microbial community. Some of these microbial communities remained stable over the study period, denoted by the steady, level lines through PCoA space, while other exhibited more variability. If the introduction of the IVR caused a systematic disturbance in the vaginal microbiota, a large shift in the tracing lines in the same direction in PCoA space for all 6 patients would be expected. However, no large shift was apparent in the PCoA plots over time, likely because no taxa were significantly different in the vaginal samples collected prior to IVR administration compared with the corresponding samples collected when the IVR was removed. This finding further suggests that the presence of the IVR is not selecting for any specific taxa across all subjects, nor is the IVR pushing the vaginal communities of these GHP women to a new CST. It is possible that IVRs are causing a more subtle change in the vaginal communities over time that cannot be elucidated with our current sample size, and future confirmation for this finding likely will require larger cohorts.",

In 1973, Henzl et al. evaluated early reservoir-IVRs delivering the hormonal contraceptive chlormadinone acetate in 12 women over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles (Henzl et al., 1973). The microbiologic examinations of the vaginal secretions consisted of direct smears stained with Gram's stain and a special stain for Trichomonas vaginalis. In addition, the secretions were evaluated by cultivation on broad-spectrum media for aerobic and anaerobic microbes and a selective media for mycoses, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Neiserria spp. In the early 1980s, Population Council reservoir-IVRs (Jackanicz, 1981) delivering the contraceptive levonorgestrel (LNG) in combination with estradiol (E2) were studied for contraceptive effectiveness and acceptability in multicentered trials involving 1,103 ring users (Sivin et al., 1981a). Increased vaginal discharge, potentially due to alteration of the vaginal microbiome, was identified as the most frequently voiced complaint by users (Sivin et al., 1981a, b). This possibility was disproven by Schwan and colleagues in a group of 17 subjects who used the Population Council LNG-E2 IVR for 6 months (Schwan et al., 1983). Culture-dependent methods were used to characterize the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeast, and mycoplasma/ureaplasma in vaginal secretions collected from the cervix and posterior fornix before and after treatment with the IVR. No significant difference was observed between both groups and it was concluded that alterations in the vaginal bacterial ecology through IVR usage was not the cause of the increased discharge.",

                    "text": "While culture-based methods have continued to be used in clinical evaluation of IVRs (Davies et al., 1992), the recent introduction of high-throughput, culture-independent molecular methods (Caporaso et al., 2012) has made it possible to collect hundreds of thousands of sequences spanning hundreds of samples. The so-called democratization of sequencing (Tringe and Hugenholtz, 2008) has continued to be fueled by ever decreasing sequencing costs, notably on several Illumina platforms (Caporaso et al., 2012). The Illumina sequencing platform returns on the order of 100 million sequencing reads per flowcell and therefore supports unprecedented sequencing depth (Caporaso et al., 2011) enabling the detection of very rare phylotypes (Binladen et al., 2007). Deep sequencing methods allow important parameters for describing microbial community composition to be determined, including the species richness within each sample (\u03b1 diversity), and the diversity shared between multiple environments (\u03b2 diversity) (Kuczynski et al., 2010; Lozupone et al., 2007). We have used bar-coded Illumina sequence datasets generated from 16S rRNA gene fragments to study the response of the vaginal microbiomes of GHP women to pod-IVRs medicated with ACV. This analysis allowed the vaginal communities developing in microbial biofilms on the IVR surface to be compared for the first time to the corresponding vaginal microbiomes. Our results suggest that rigorous, molecular analysis of the effects of intravaginal devices on the corresponding microbial communities shows promise for integration with traditional approaches in the clinical evaluation of candidate products.",

Although microbial biofilms were readily detected on the IVR surface, the composition of these sessile communities was similar to that of the corresponding vaginal microbiome. These observations need to be tempered by the exploratory nature of the study. Future research will need to investigate the impact of the IVR on the vaginal microbiota over a complete menstrual cycle and how the device affects vaginal microbiomes representative of all major CSTs (Ravel et al., 2011). These important questions will be addressed in larger, follow-on clinical studies.",
