Bacterial 16S rRNA genes from saliva samples, skin swabs, and stool samples collected on postnatal days 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, and 21 from six LBW (five premature) infants were amplified, pyrosequenced, and analyzed within a comparative framework that included analogous data from normal-birthweight (NBW) infants and healthy adults. We found that body site was the primary determinant of bacterial community composition in the LBW infants. However, site specificity depended on postnatal age: saliva and stool compositions diverged over time but were not significantly different until the babies were 15 days old. This divergence was primarily driven by progressive temporal turnover in the distal gut, which proceeded at a rate similar to that of age-matched NBW infants. Neonatal skin was the most adult-like in microbiota composition, while saliva and stool remained the least so. Compositional variation among infants was marked and depended on body site and age. Only the smallest, most premature infant received antibiotics during the study period; this heralded a coexpansion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a novel Mycoplasma sp. in the oral cavity of this vaginally delivered, intubated patient. We conclude that concurrent molecular surveillance of multiple body sites in LBW neonates reveals a delayed compositional differentiation of the oral cavity and distal gut microbiota and, in the case of one infant, an abundant, uncultivated oral Mycoplasma sp., recently detected in human vaginal samples.",

Colonization by the indigenous microbiota, which begins at delivery, may predispose some high-risk newborns to invasive infection or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and protect others, yet neonatal microbiome dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we present the first cultivation-independent time series tracking microbiota assembly across multiple body sites in a synchronous cohort of hospitalized low-birthweight (LBW) neonates. We take advantage of archived samples and publically available sequence data and compare our LBW infant findings to those from normal-birthweight (NBW) infants and healthy adults. Our results suggest potential windows of opportunity for the dispersal of microbes within and between hosts and support recent findings of substantial baseline spatiotemporal variation in microbiota composition among high-risk newborns.",

While the postnatal assembly of an adult-like distal gut microbiota has been studied in healthy infants (5\u20137), relatively little is known about the development of the microbiota at extraintestinal sites (8, 9) or about the compositional differentiation of the microbiota across multiple sites during the neonatal period. Knowledge of these spatiotemporal dynamics is particularly lacking for low-birthweight (LBW) infants, who are at high risk of invasive infection and other serious perinatal complications, including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a disease linked in part to microbial colonization (10, 11). LBW infants are often premature, and often receive antibiotics, experience delays in the initiation of enteral feedings, and/or require prolonged hospital stays\u2014all of which can influence, and be influenced by, interactions with microbes. Certain complications, such as sepsis and NEC, are characterized by onset timing (12, 13); for example, the postnatal age at the onset of NEC is inversely correlated with the gestational age at delivery (14). These patterns underscore a need to understand better the temporal dynamics of microbiome development in high-risk neonates.",

Furthermore, early life colonization deficiencies have been associated with alterations in host metabolism and immune function (18, 19). In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), however, the promotion of potentially beneficial host-microbe interactions must be carefully balanced against the control of pathogen spread among a highly vulnerable patient population (20, 21). This is distinctively challenging with regard to the prevention and treatment of NEC, a disease in which the interrelated roles of antibiotic exposure, enteral feedings, and changes in the intestinal microbiota are imprecisely defined (10, 11). Recent studies of the fecal microbiota of premature infants using cultivation-independent approaches have revealed a low level of diversity, high interindividual variability, and a capacity for abrupt temporal shifts in species- and strain-level composition (22\u201332). However, most of these studies have been limited to a relatively small number of samples and to a single body site, the distal gut.",

Indeed, saliva and stool compositions grew progressively more distinct as the infants grew older (Table\u00a03). Furthermore, on average within infants, the compositional difference between saliva and stool samples increased significantly with infant age (linear regression, R2 = 0.7075, P = 0.0359). We asked whether this divergence was driven by compositional turnover in the distal gut, oral cavity, or both. Pairwise a posteriori tests mainly implicated the distal gut, where the amount of variation explained by time was positively correlated with the size of the time step (see Table\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material)\u2014a pattern that was not as apparent in saliva or on skin (Table\u00a0S2).

To do this, we pyrosequenced bacterial 16S rRNA genes amplified from archived fecal DNA samples from NBW infants who were enrolled in a prior study (5) (see Materials and Methods). In both cohorts, compositional variation depended positively on elapsed time (Fig.\u00a04a, P values of <0.05). We also found that there was no significant difference between the cohorts with respect to the rate of compositional turnover (Fig.\u00a04a, P = 0.7911). On average, the stool microbiotas of LBW infants were slightly enriched in the observed number of OTUs (controlling for sequencing effort; P = 0.01) and significantly enriched in OTUs assigned to Enterobacter, the Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus (adjusted for Bonferroni\u2019s correction, P\u00a0values of <0.001). Escherichia was abundant in the NBW infants and virtually absent from the LBW infants (P < 0.001). Despite these differences, over time, the community-wide composition of LBW infant stool grew more similar to that of 21-day-old NBW infant stool (i.e., to that of a healthy reference group; Fig.\u00a04b). These results suggest that while gestational age at delivery, delivery mode, or other factors may affect gut microbiota makeup, its rate of development may depend more on intrinsic community-level factors, e.g., the amount of time the site has been available to colonists, microbe-microbe interactions, microbe-host interactions (that are independent of host gestational age), or increasing hypoxia/anaerobiosis.",

Interestingly, a recently deposited GenBank sequence (uncultured Mycoplasma sp. clone Mnola; accession no. JX508800) is 99% identical to our infant-derived OTU (Fig.\u00a0S4); this clone was isolated from a vaginal swab from a Trichomonas vaginalis-infected patient (37). Finally, we amplified and cloned near-full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences from baby 3\u2019s DOL 18 saliva (see Materials and Methods). This yielded sequences belonging to the novel OTU that confirmed the phylogenetic placement of the shorter pyrosequences (Fig.\u00a0S4). To our knowledge, this is the first report of infant-derived (and second report of human-derived) sequences from this as-yet-uncultivated Mycoplasma-related clade.",

(In the mouth and gut, the main difference between neonates and adults seems to be a relative lack of strict anaerobes [38].)

This small effect size for time, compared to those for body site and host individual, is also consistent with patterns observed in healthy adults (1\u20133, 40). Nonetheless, our comparative approach uncovered subtle yet important temporal changes that occurred over the 8- to 21-day age range: in particular, a gradual (i.e., delayed) compositional divergence of the oral and fecal microbiota (Table\u00a03), largely driven by progressive temporal turnover in the distal gut (Table\u00a04), the latter of which proceeded at a rate indistinguishable from that of age-matched NBW infants (Fig.\u00a04a). Long recognized as a key process taking place in early infancy (38, 41\u201343), our study draws into focus the initiation phase of gut microbiome development, capturing, possibly, the time span over which the site begins to receive and select for gut-specific microbes, which may then grow to outnumber or outcompete transient or generalist immigrants from the oral cavity (or other sources shared by the two sites). However, given our small cohort of six infants for which there were a number of uncontrolled variables (e.g., gestational age at delivery, multiple gestation, medical treatment, delivery mode), we caution that our data are likely limited in terms of their generalizability and capacity to detect subtle effects. The biogeographic patterns we report warrant follow-up in larger, well-controlled, prospective cohort studies.",

M.\u00a0hominis and Ureaplasma spp. can cause chorioamnionitis (a risk factor for preterm premature rupture of membranes [PPROM]) and pass from mother to newborn, and the latter organisms have been associated with preterm labor and low birthweight (39, 44). In neonates, they cause respiratory, blood, and central nervous system (CNS) infections (39). Lacking cell walls, these organisms are innately resistant to beta-lactam (e.g., ampicillin, cefotaxime) and glycopeptide (e.g., vancomycin) antibiotics (45). Although not innately resistant, their susceptibility to aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin) is variable (46).",

Thus, carriage of Mycoplasma- and Ureaplasma-related OTUs at low abundance at the start of the study, on DOL 8, may have been due to vertical transmission at delivery, followed by resistance to the initial course of antibiotics, although alternative scenarios are possible (e.g., later exposure in the NICU). Baby 3 was again treated with antibiotics (vancomycin, gentamicin, cefotaxime) from DOL 13 to 19 (Table\u00a02), and this coincided with a marked increase in the proportional abundance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Fig.\u00a01a) and OTU 15, a member of a novel, uncultivated clade belonging to the Mycoplasmataceae, in baby 3\u2019s oral samples (Fig.\u00a05; see Fig.\u00a0S4 in the supplemental material). Intriguingly, a recent study found high abundances of this uncultivated Mycoplasma in the vaginal microbiota of Trichomonas vaginalis-infected women (detected in 19/30\u00a0T. vaginalis-infected and 1/29 uninfected individuals) (37), again raising the possibility that this organism too was transferred from mother to infant at delivery. Further investigation into the diversity, distribution, and clinical significance of this novel, uncultivated Mycoplasma in human hosts is warranted, particularly in pregnant women and premature infants.",

                    "text": "Although the LBW infants in this study were relatively free of major medical problems, we found that their microbiomes were dominated at times by bacterial taxa that have been associated with neonatal infections and NEC, e.g., Staphylococcus, C.\u00a0perfringens, P.\u00a0aeruginosa, and others (28, 32, 47, 48). Yet, despite the abundance of taxa with pathogenic potential, it appears that certain normal processes were under way, including the development of body site-specific bacterial communities and progressive compositional turnover in the distal gut, as observed in healthy hosts (2, 38). Our analysis was cohort based; however, it might be useful to know whether individual infants vary in the precise timing of body site-associated compositional differentiation, and if so, whether such variation depends on gestational age at delivery or particular NICU management protocols. Unfortunately, our cohort was not well suited to this analysis because of its small size, but also because gestational age at delivery was confounded with delivery location and the amount of time spent in the NICU (Tables\u00a01 and 2). This underscores a need for larger and distinct cohorts but also highlights a challenge: the smallest, most premature infants will almost always require the most intensive medical support, thus entangling factors such as gut and immune immaturity with, for example, the number of invasive procedures or days on antibiotics. Nevertheless, monitoring of oral and other potential source communities in the NICU might be particularly warranted during the time the gut microbiome remains \u201cundifferentiated\u201d and, possibly, more open to invasion.",

The infants were born within 1\u00a0week of each other in the summer of 2010. The cause of the low birthweight was preterm delivery in five of the infants (a singleton and two pairs of twins) and fetal growth restriction in the sixth. Birth weights ranged from 0.75 to 1.82\u00a0kg (see Table\u00a01 for clinical details; <2.5\u00a0kg is considered low birthweight). Stool and saliva samples and skin swabs were obtained from each infant on postnatal days 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, and 21. The age range of 8 to 21\u00a0days was selected because it may represent a critical window for the colonization of the infant, and although it did not occur in the present cohort, for the onset of NEC. Stool sampling involved manual perineal stimulation with a lubricated cotton swab, which induced prompt defecation. Oral and skin samples were collected by gently swabbing the dorsum of the tongue and the anterior upper chest wall, respectively. For the oral samples, we simply call the collected materials \u201csaliva,\u201d because it is likely that multiple sites were contacted during the gentle swabbing. Samples were collected using sterile nylon or cotton swabs, placed in 3\u00a0ml of universal transport medium (UTM; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), and promptly frozen at \u221280\u00b0C. A total of 108 samples were collected for the study. Data pertaining to the care and location of the infants during the sampling period are presented in Table\u00a02. All infants remained hospitalized throughout the study. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Chicago approved the study protocol, and the infants\u2019 parents provided written informed consent.",

A representative sequence was chosen from each OTU by selecting the \u201cfirst\u201d sequence (i.e., the UCLUST cluster seed). Representative sequences were aligned against the Greengenes core set (54) using PyNAST (55) with a minimum alignment length of 150\u00a0nt and a minimum identity of 80%. Fifteen OTU representative sequences failed to align; BLASTn searches against GenBank\u2019s nr/nt database revealed 13 human OTUs, 1 Candida albicans OTU (representing 276 reads from baby 6, day 8 stool), and 1 poor-quality OTU, all of which were excluded from further analysis. Taxonomic assignments were made using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier version 2.2 with a minimum support threshold of 80% and the RDP taxonomic nomenclature (56). For the most abundant OTUs study-wide (here, those with >0.05% average abundance across all samples), RDP assignments were manually confirmed and, when possible, annotated with species-level information using BLASTn searches against the nr/nt database. A table of sequence counts per classified OTU \u00d7 sample was generated in which the criteria for an OTU\u2019s inclusion were that it contained at least 2 sequences and was assigned at least to the genus level. The final OTU table consisted of 321 OTUs containing a total of 105,462 sequences.",

This analysis was prompted by the identification of an OTU assigned to the genus Mycoplasma containing 771 reads (99% of which were from baby 3\u2019s saliva) and exhibiting low sequence identity (~88%) to the most closely related cultivated strains represented in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). Sequences were aligned against the Greengenes core set using the NAST algorithm (60) (http://greengenes.lbl.gov) and imported into ARB (version 08.08.27) (61). In ARB, the alignment was manually improved using secondary structure information and alignment to nearest neighbors in the context of an expanded, in-house database founded upon the Greengenes alignment. Phylogenetic relationships among the 3 OTUs found in the present study, their closest relatives (uncultivated mycoplasmas), and selected representatives of cultivated Tenericutes were inferred using bootstrapped maximum likelihood inference methods in RAxML (version 7.2.8) (62). In order to confirm and further explore the phylogenetic placement of the novel Mycoplasma-related OTU, a small number of near-full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were recovered from baby 3\u2019s day 18 saliva sample via amplification (with primers 8F/1391R), cloning, and Sanger sequencing using methods described elsewhere (63). Fifteen high-quality sequences were assembled (4 uncultivated Mycoplasma sequences and 11 Pseudomonas aeruginosa sequences). The near-full-length Mycoplasma sequences were analyzed using NAST, ARB, and RAxML as described above.",

Adult data were selected from two published studies that used pyrosequencing approaches similar to those used here (1, 2). From the first study (1), we selected samples from 7 adults (3 female), \u201cdays 1 and 2\u201d (of 4 sampling dates), including dorsal tongue swabs, skin swabs (forehead and right forearm), and stool samples (56 samples in total). These 16S rRNA gene sequences were V2 region FLX reads originating from the distal primer (338R). From the second study (2), we selected samples from 6 adults (a subset chosen at random but matched for gender to the LBW infants), \u201cvisit 2\u201d (of 2 sampling visits), including saliva samples, skin swabs (right retroauricular crease), and stool samples (18 samples in total). These were V3-V5 region Ti reads originating from the distal primer (926R). By comparison, the infant-derived sequences generated for the present study were V3-V5 region Ti reads originating from the proximal primer (338F). Thus, given the differences in sequence length and sequenced region among the data sets, the pooled sequences were trimmed to a length of not more than 300\u00a0nt and OTUs were picked against a set of reference sequences. This was accomplished in QIIME using uclust_ref-based OTU picking against the Greengenes gg_97_otus_4feb2011.fasta reference set at an identity threshold of 95% (relaxed from 97% to allow for greater recruitment), with reverse strand matching enabled and no new clusters allowed. A total of 3,158 reference OTUs were detected; these encompassed 96% of the 475,080 total sequences. Rarefied and unrarefied OTU tables, along with a reference tree (gg_97_otus_4feb2011.tre), were used to calculate unweighted UniFrac distance matrices, which served as inputs for PCoA in QIIME.",

To investigate potential kit-associated bias, we pyrosequenced 16S rRNA genes amplified from archived adult stool DNA that had been isolated using a Qiagen kit (from the NBW infants\u2019 fathers [5]; mothers were excluded due to possible pregnancy-associated shifts in microbiota composition [64]). These new adult sequences were filtered as described herein and trimmed to a length of not more than 300\u00a0nt, pooled with the other sequences, and analyzed as described in the preceding paragraph. Because the Qiagen-extracted adult stool samples (5) clustered with the MO BIO-extracted ones (1, 2) (see Fig.\u00a0S1 in the supplemental material), we concluded that DNA extraction kit did not grossly bias the results of the unweighted UniFrac-based PCoA.",
