Moreover, how changes in the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women affect pregnancy outcomes historically associated with bacterial colonization, such as spontaneous preterm birth (PTB), is unknown. BV is an established risk factor for spontaneous PTB. The syndrome of BV is characterized by colonization of the vagina with a heterogeneous mix of anaerobic and gram-negative aerobic bacteria. However, current methods to diagnose BV in pregnancy (e.g., Nugent score on Gram stain) do not provide a comprehensive spectrum of the microbial complexity required to discriminate interpatient differences in the bacteria present in the vagina. As such, our objective of this preliminary study was to test the differences in the vaginal microbiome of pregnant women stratified by the presence or absence of BV, birth timing (preterm or term), and race. By assessing these relationships, in this pilot study, we sought to estimate parameters for power calculations for future vaginal microbiome\u2013based studies.",

Details of this parent study have previously been published.[10] Briefly, during a vaginal speculum examination, Dacron swab samples of the mucus on the ectocervix and in the posterior vaginal fornix were collected from women at a routine prenatal visit between 21 and 25 6/7 weeks gestation. Each swab was left in place for 10 seconds, withdrawn, and placed in 750 \u03bcL of fetal fibronectin buffer. These samples were then stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Of note, these samples had not been subject to previous thawing. Concurrently, vaginal smears were also obtained and evaluated for the presence of BV. Gram stains of these vaginal smears were evaluated in a single experienced center by the Nugent criteria: decreased Lactobacillus morphotypes (score 0\u20134), increased Gardnerella morphotypes (score 0\u20134), and increased Mobiluncus morphotypes (score 0\u20132) (scores of 0\u20134 indicative of normal flora, 5\u20136 consistent with \u201cintermediate flora,\u201d and 7\u201310 diagnostic of BV).[9]",

D6010) following the manufacturer's instructions (there are no kits specific for vaginal DNA isolation). Once the sample DNA was prepared, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used with unique bar coded primers to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene to create an \u201camplicon library\u201d from individual samples.[11] [12] While previous studies, including those from the Human Microbiome Project have used V1\u2013V3 or V3\u2013V5 primers, we opted to use V4 primers. Specific to the vaginal microbiome, the V1\u2013V3 region is not recommended for the identification of Gardnerella. In addition, recent literature has shown that for both short and longer read sequences, the V4 region is an appropriate region for capturing microbial diversity.[11] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] As such, we used the following V4 primers:",

All the samples were multiplexed using bar codes, and 251 base paired end reads were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform (San Diego, CA).[11] [12] FASTQ conversion of the raw data files was performed following demultiplexing. Quality assessment of the FASTQ files was performed using FASTQC, and then quality filtering was done using the FASTX toolkit.[20] [21] Since the overlap between fragments was approximately 245 bases, both paired reads were merged to generate a single high-quality read using the module \u201cfastq_mergepairs\u201d of USEARCH (Drive 5). Read pairs with an overlap of less than 200 bases or with too many mismatches (> 25) in the overlapping region were discarded. Chimeric sequences were also filtered using the \u201cidentify_chimeric_seqs.py\u201d module of USEARCH.[22] The resulting reads with an average base quality Q score of < 20 were discarded. The remainder of the steps (explained below) was performed with the quantitative insight into microbial ecology (QIIME) suite, version 1.8 and in-house developed Perl scripts.[20] [23] [24]",

The RDP classifier was trained using the modified version (explained below) of Greengenes (v13_8) 16S rRNA database.[25] The resulting OTU table included all OTUs, their taxonomic identification, and abundance information. To account for differences in read depth across different sample, the OTUs are rarified at a common sequence depth. OTUs whose average abundance was less than 0.0005% were filtered out. OTUs were then grouped together to summarize taxon abundance at different hierarchical levels of classification (e.g., phylum, class, order, family, genus). These taxonomy tables were also used to generate bar charts of taxon abundance. Multiple sequence alignment of OTUs was performed with PyNAST.[21] Alpha diversity (within sample diversity) was calculated using a variety of diversity metrics, including Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson, as implemented in QIIME.[26] Beta diversity (between sample diversity) among different samples was measured using UniFrac analysis.[23] Principal coordinates analysis was performed by QIIME to visualize the dissimilarity matrix (\u03b2-diversity) between all the samples, such that samples that are more similar are closer in space than samples that are more divergent.[27] A heatmap with the top 15 most highly abundant taxa across all samples was generated using the \u201cheatmap.2\u201d function in R package (available at: http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gplots).",

They also described distinct microbial patterns associated with high- or low Nugent scores.[8] It has been noted that the vaginal microbiome is different in both composition and stability between pregnant and nonpregnant individuals.[29] [30] However, Hyman et al, in a prospective study of 88 participants, noted that diversity in flora by race persisted in pregnancy.[31] We did not observe distinct differences in microbiota by race. However, posthoc analysis showed that we were underpowered for this comparison. The fact that our results differ from what has been previously reported may be due to our small sample size, techniques used to sequence, and classify DNA (for example, choice of primers), or it may be true that pregnancy results in amelioration of racial differences in the vaginal microbiota.",

We did observe some clustering associated with preterm birth, yet this was not statistically significant. However, we were underpowered for that comparison as well, and we are currently conducting a prospective study of vaginal microbiota and preterm birth to further evaluate this association. The above-mentioned study by Hyman et al, measured the microbial diversity in women with either a low- or high risk of preterm birth. While there were no clear groups of microbes implicated with preterm birth, it was noted that there were differences in the overall diversity of microbes between women with a preterm birth and those with a term birth.[31] Given the fact that there was no single organism or group of organisms identified in that study or in our study, perhaps it is dynamic, changes in vaginal microbial communities that are linked to spontaneous preterm birth rather than a specific organism or group of organisms. This possibility should be addressed in future studies evaluating the vaginal microbiome at different time points during pregnancy. Furthermore, differences between the organisms in our clustered analysis should be investigated in a larger sample to elucidate if there is a relationship between those microbial compositions and preterm birth. As are others, our group currently is conducting such a study.",

                    "text": "The strengths of our current study include the use of a newer microbial analysis technique to characterize samples from a well-described cohort of patients. Demographic characteristics, Nugent score, and birth outcomes of these patients were prospectively collected at the time of the parent study. However, given that this is a retrospective analysis of previously collected samples, one limitation is the possibility of contamination affecting DNA analysis. Moreover, the relatively small sample size resulted in a small number of patients in each subgroup, limiting our ability to make statistical comparisons. Our posthoc power calculations have enabled us to determine the number of samples required in future studies. In addition, the samples evaluated in our current study reflect one point in time; it may be that changes in the vaginal microbiome over time are at least as important as the prevalence of various organisms at a single point in time.",

Given our preliminary data, we think that additional studies evaluating the vaginal microbiome in relation to pregnancy outcomes, particularly preterm birth, are warranted and hold promise to improve our understanding of infection-related preterm birth. Potentially, such studies may identify a target organism or group of organisms associated with adverse outcome, thus yielding a way to identify a group at high risk of PTB who could be targeted for current or putative therapeutic interventions.",
