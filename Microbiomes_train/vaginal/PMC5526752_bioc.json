Since other genital infections enhance HIV susceptibility by inducing inflammation, we assessed the impact of HPV infection and clearance on genital immunology and the cervico-vaginal microbiome. Genital samples were collected from 65 women for HPV testing, immune studies and microbiota assessment; repeat HPV testing was performed after 6 months. All participants were HIV-uninfected and free of bacterial STIs. Cytobrush-derived T cell and dendritic cell subsets were assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Undiluted cervico-vaginal secretions were used to determine cytokine levels by multiplex ELISA, and to assess bacterial community composition and structure by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Neither HPV infection nor clearance were associated with broad differences in cervical T cell subsets or cytokines, although HPV clearance was associated with increased Langerhans cells and HPV infection with elevated IP-10 and MIG. Individuals with HPV more frequently had a high diversity cervico-vaginal microbiome (community state type IV) and were less likely to have an L. gasseri predominant microbiome. In summary, HPV infection and/or subsequent clearance was not associated with inflammation or altered cervical T cell subsets, but associations with increased Langerhans cells and the composition of the vaginal microbiome warrant further exploration.",

While significance was lost when post-menopausal women were excluded from the analysis (p=0.084), this likely relates to the reduced sample size, since menopausal status was not associated with CST status or other immune parameters in univariate analysis (data not shown). When we evaluated individual bacterial taxa (Figure 4 C-D), participants with HPV had a substantially lower relative abundance of Lactobacillus gasseri (p=0.009; Figure 4E), and also of the less abundant bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum (p=0.019; Figure 4F), Cornybacterium accolens (p=0.001; Figure 4G), Peptoniphilus harei, Anaerococcus tetradius, Finegoldia magna, and Raoultella planticola (all P<0.05; data not shown). Finally, HPV-infected participants had a higher overall bacterial load (median 9.22log10) than their uninfected counterparts (median 8.95log10, p=0.018).",

However, we found no association between prevalent HPV infection and genital inflammatory cytokines, nor with endocervical CD4+ T cell numbers or highly susceptible CD4+ T cell subsets such as those expressing CCR5 or CD69.26 Furthermore, among women with prevalent HPV infection, none of these immune parameters differed between participants who subsequently cleared the virus and those who remained persistently infected. However, we did find an increased absolute number of Langerhans cells in women who cleared HPV, and a skewing towards vaginal CST-IV, characterized by a paucity of Lactobacillus spp., in participants with prevalent HPV infection.

It has been suggested that innate immune responses may be vital to clearing HPV infections through recognition via pattern recognition receptors.32 Imiquimod, a TLR-7 agonist that induces Langerhans cell recruitment and antigen presentation, increases the clearance of HPV-associated genital warts.33 This mirrors our results, with increased numbers of Langerhans cells being associated with HPV clearance. Further, Langerhans cells are reduced in individuals who develop HPV-positive cervical intraepithelial lesions34 and a previous study showed that HPV clearance is associated with increased CD1a+ dendritic cell density in the male foreskin.21 Since Langerhans cells may play a direct role in enhancing HIV susceptibility via binding HIV gp120 and facilitating transmission to CD4 T cells in trans,35 this constitutes a potential immune mechanism linking HPV clearance with HIV susceptibility. In addition, HPV-infected participants had elevated genital levels of the chemokines IP-10 and MIG (which were not components of the pro-inflammatory cytokine score). These chemokines are both IFN-\u03b3 inducible and bind CXCR3,36 meaning that they may indicate immune activation; interestingly, genital levels of both are reduced in women who remained HIV-uninfected despite frequent HIV exposure,37 and elevated levels of IP-10 were strongly associated with increased HIV acquisition in South African women.38 The exact mechanism(s) by which they enhance HIV susceptibility is not known, although we found both to be moderately correlated with an increased numbers of cervical CCR5+CD4+ T cells (both correlation coefficients 0.3, P>0.05).",

Other studies have specifically linked L. gasseri with HPV clearance,27 and our results support a potential role for these bacteria in defense against HPV. The other bacterial phylotypes that were reduced in the context of HPV infection were of much lower overall abundance and their importance in the genital tract is less clear, although Fusobacterium nucleatum may act as a pathogen.40 Although our analysis only found significant reductions in specific bacterial phyla among HPV-infected women, anaerobes as a whole tended to be increased in HPV positive participants, in keeping with a higher proportion of CST-IV. While these differences in the composition and structure of the vaginal microbiota were not associated with alterations in HIV-susceptible CD4 T cells in the female genital tract, they could feasibly play a role in promoting the recruitment of Langerhans cells to sites of HIV exposure, or enhance HIV susceptibility through other mechanisms such as decreased integrity of the vaginal epithelial barrier.41",

While robust associations were demonstrated between HSV-2 serostatus and CD4+ T cell subsets in a smaller study,19 and between HPV infection and specific immune and microbiologic parameters in this one, our sample size could have precluded us from finding true but less robust associations of HPV with other immune parameters. However, any causal effect of HPV infection or its clearance on CD4+ subsets or inflammation would be considerably weaker than the effect of HSV-2. While there was variability in the time of genital sampling in relation to the menstrual cycle and menopause, neither factor was associated with immune parameters or the microbiome in univariate analysis, and their incorporation into our multivariable model did not substantively impact the results. Longitudinal immunological data were not available, with cell populations and cytokines measured only at baseline, and follow up HPV infection data were only obtained after 6 months. Therefore, we may have missed a short-lived immune signature of clearance, and/or immune changes that are induced after (rather than before) HPV clearance. Future studies with more frequent sampling may help to understand the sequence of immune changes that culminates in HPV clearance. Our ability to assess the association of vaginal CST-I/II/V with HPV infection was limited, since these vaginal microbiota types are relatively underrepresented in the ACB community.39 Secretions for microbiome analysis were collected by Softcup, and therefore represent a mixture of secretions from the proximal vagina and cervix, while previous studies have used mid-vaginal swabs. However, recent work from our group demonstrates no more variability in the composition of the microbiota as assessed from a cervical and vaginal swab, than was seen between two independent vaginal swabs (Jacques Ravel, personal communication). Finally, limitations in cell numbers obtained by endocervical cytobrush sampling meant that we were not able to assess functional alterations in mucosal T cells that may be linked to HPV infection or clearance, and it is possible that by focusing on the endocervix our study could miss HPV-associated cellular changes limited to the ectocervix or transformation zone. Future studies that incorporate ectocervical biopsy might be considered to explore this possibility.",

However, HPV infection was associated with alterations in the composition and structure of the vaginal microbiota and with local elevations in the chemokines IP-10 and MIG, while HPV clearance was associated with increased numbers of cervical Langerhans cell, and each of these could potentially enhance HIV susceptibility. Further research should confirm these observations and characterize the impact of HPV on other immune parameters that may modulate HIV susceptibility.",

Secretions were plated at 50\u03bcl per well and run in duplicate. A standard curve was used to determine the concentration (pg/ml). The dilution at which the coefficient of variation exceeded 30% was defined as the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). Any sample out of range of the standard curve was repeated following dilution. All samples were assayed and analyzed by blinded lab personnel and the original undiluted concentrations of cytokines in the secretions were calculated.",

If the average phred quality score of 4 consecutive bp was below 15 the sequence reads were trimmed and only retained if their length was at least 75% of their original length after trimming. FLASH46 was used to assemble paired reads. De-multiplexing by binning sequences with the same barcode and quality trimming were performed in QIIME (version 1.8.0)47 (see Fadrosh et. al45 for additional details). Detection of de novo and reference-based chimera was conducted in UCHIME (v5.1)48 using greengenes database of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Aug, 2013 vers.)49 as reference. The processed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences were assigned to genera and species, and vaginal microbial communities were assigned to a community state types (CSTs) using taxonomic composition and abundance and the Jensen-Shannon divergence metrics as previously described.24 A table providing the relative abundance of identified taxa and the CST assignments for each sample was generated and is provided as Supplementary Table S1 with metadata and a legend in Supplementary Tables S2-S3. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data has been deposited into NCBI SRA under accession number SRA362820. Overall bacterial load was measured using an assay previously described by Liu et al.50",
