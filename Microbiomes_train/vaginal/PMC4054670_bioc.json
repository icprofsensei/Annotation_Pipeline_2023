The level of biodiversity in one habitat is independent of the biodiversity of other habitats in the same individual. The abundances of a given genus at a body site in which it dominates do not correlate with the abundances at body sites where it is not dominant.

Each niche thus serves as a unique and complex space for microbes to survive and thrive. Alteration of the microbial balance in humans is associated with disease [2-12]. Characterization of the human microbial community by culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing unveiled the high diversity of microbes in different habitats of the body. The gut microbiome is the best-characterized human microbial habitat, and it was originally estimated to harbor 500 to 1,000 species [13]. Bacterial community structures in other habitats of the human body such as the oral, skin, nasal, and vaginal areas also have been addressed [14-21]. Over 500 species-level phylotypes were discovered in oral habitats [16,22]. Two hundred and five genera were identified on the skin surface from 10 subjects [18]. Traditionally, urine has been thought to be sterile but culture-independent sequencing uncovered diverse microbial communities and substantial intra- and inter-subject variability [7].",

The NIH launched the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) [23], aiming to more fully characterize the human microbiota and address its role in health and disease. This project enrolled 300 healthy, young adults, collected samples from 15 (male) or 18 (female) habitats in the body, and produced datasets of both 16S rRNA gene and whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences [24]. The 16S rRNA gene sequences aim to define community structures in different habitats, representing major niches of the human body, including stool, oral, skin, nasal, and vaginal areas. The HMP consortium has been conducting extensive analysis with the HMP 16s rRNA gene dataset to explore different aspects of human microbiome [24-29]. RDP-based taxonomic, operational taxonomic unit (OTU), and phylogenetic approaches are the main analytic methods used to characterize microbial community structure [24,25,28]. The RDP taxonomic approach used in this study possesses easy interpretability and better sequence error tolerance. It provides confident taxonomic assignment at the genus and other higher taxonomic levels. The OTU approach offers a sub-genus level resolution. However, the OTU does not always reflect a biological unit, and technical factors (single, average, complete linkage) largely affect the components within an OTU. The phylogenetic approach dependent on the tree construction provides phylogeny of the bacterial community, but it inevitably bears the intrinsic problems of tree construction using short reads. Each of these methods has its pros and cons, and they are complementary to each other. They provide equally important insight into the bacterial community structure [30].",

We addressed the following aspects of human microbial biogeography in the context of a large cohort and deep sequencing: how many organisms inhabit the human body; is the biodiversity of one habitat influenced by other habitats; is the presence or abundance of the organism in one habitat affected by other habitats; what is the bacterial distribution pattern in a habitat; what is the degree of inter-personal variation and temporal variation in different habitats; are the HMP data comparable with the prior human microbiome studies. The analysis focusing on the above questions are not addressed in other HMP companion papers or are insufficiently investigated in the main papers. Answering these questions allows us to have a more complete and broad understanding of the ecosystems of the human body.",

As indicated by the accumulation curves in Figure \u200bFigure1,1, skin and skin-associated sites continue to yield more taxa with increasing numbers of subjects. On the other hand, the slopes of the accumulation curves for the three vaginal sites, seven of nine oral sites (except throat and hard palate), and the stool become asymptotically flatter, suggesting the sampling is close to saturation for those habitats.

These minor organisms are detected after quality filtering and chimera removal and thus are unlikely to be due to these types of artifacts. Concern has been previously raised over the possibility that minor species/OTUs are nevertheless 'noise' due to various issues. One of these is sequencing artifacts that are not removed by quality-based filtering [37,38]. As noted earlier, our methods were developed using mock community approaches, in which a limited number of false taxa were detected [31]. Moreover, different from the studies at the species/OTU level, analysis at the genus level is also less likely to be as sensitive to false taxon calls due to small sequence errors. Thus we do not consider sequencing errors to be a major source of the minor organisms detected.",

We note below that genera that are present at low abundances, for instance nasal Streptococcus have an average relative abundance of 2%, but are found in >80% of the nasal samples. Two-thirds of those samples with Streptococcus are from Houston, and sequenced roughly evenly at the four sequencing centers, making it unlikely to be noise from contaminants (Figure \u200b(Figure44).",

At each sequencing depth, the prevalence of each taxon was calculated (Figure S4 in Additional file 1). With increasing sequencing depth, the prevalence among the subjects for the majority of the taxa at the 1,000 read depth increased 3.6-fold on average. As an example of a well-known minor genus, that is not a false taxon, we analyzed Escherichia/Shigella, and found it in five out of 60 subjects at 1,000 reads, and increased to 24 subjects at 9,000 reads. As a second example, we chose Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium, which make up the majority of skin microbiota, but are not a major part of the fecal flora. They were each identified in one subject at 1,000 read depth and increased to 11 and six subjects, respectively, at 9,000 reads.

To answer this question, we chose two different body sites from the same subjects and computed their richness. Correlation of body sites' richness within a subject was then expressed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. The richness correlation was 0.68 between subgingival plaque and supragingival plaque, 0.66 between left and right retroauricular crease, 0.68 between left and right antecubital fossa, and 0.41 to 0.68 within vaginal sites, indicating a stronger correlation for those pairs. In contrast, correlations between skin and oral, skin and vaginal, or skin and stool sites were very low, indicating richness was not correlated (Figure \u200b(Figure5A).5A). Therefore, similar body sites had stronger correlation of richness, while dissimilar sites had little or no correlation. More specifically, an individual who harbors a greater collection of taxa in saliva is more likely to have more taxa on the tongue, but not necessarily more taxa in skin, stool, or vagina. It has been well known that major habitats are distinctive by their specific dominant taxa [25,39], and a finer distinction between similar habitats, such as oral sites, is achievable at the OTU level [28]. The taxa preference to certain habitats is generally explained by environmental selection. The richness specificity for the major habitats that we found here contributed to another interesting ecological observation.",

This result does not provide support for the possibility that host genotype is the major modulator of microbial content since no individuals were observed with higher diversity in all body sites, as might be expected if a host mechanism controlling microbiome diversity were a major factor.

The HMP consortium not only produced a large amount of sequence data, but it also developed new analytical tools to cope with the high dimensional metagenomic data [40,41]. Given the multivariate nature of the metagenomic data, we recently developed multivariate statistical method, Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, to model the variation of the whole bacterial community composition in a habitat [41]. In the model, theta is an overdispersion parameter reflecting the variance of each taxon and covariance between taxa. It ranges from 0 to 1, with the higher value representing higher variation (Figure \u200b(Figure6).6). Lowest variation (theta <0.1) was observed for the nine oral sites and stool samples. Two of the three habitats showing highest variation were vaginal sites. Although these sites had the lowest alpha diversity, due to the dominance of Lactobacillus in most samples, the high overdispersion resulted from the subset of samples with low Lactobacillus abundance. Skin habitats also showed higher overdispersion presumably due to their exposure to the environment. High variability was also observed for urine and preterm baby stool samples as expected since neither of these habitats shows consistent patterns of organisms between subjects.",

                    "text": "In microbial ecology, the abundant species are found in many samples, that is, show high prevalence. Similarly, highly abundant genera in the human microbiota were present in higher percentage of subjects, whereas low abundance genera were restricted in distribution. This phenomenon is shown for the anterior nares (Figure \u200b(Figure4)4) and the other body sites (Figure S5A, 5B, 5C in Additional file 1). Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus are present in all anterior nares samples with the abundance of 23% \u00b1 2.6% and %19 \u00b1 3.0% (m \u00b1 sd), respectively. The majority of genera (92%) in the anterior nares are <1% abundance. However, we do not have evidence to suggest that they are noise within the sequence dataset as described above. Interestingly, some of the relatively low abundance genera are also widely distributed across subjects. For example, Streptococcus and Anaerococcus are both present in >80% of the nasal samples, however, their relative abundances are about 2% \u00b1 0.8 and 2% \u00b1 0.3 on average. This observation was also evident in stool and oral sites. Coprococcus in stool, Fusobacterium in throat and hard palate, and Haemophilus in hard palate are all low abundance and high prevalence. As a result, the cosmopolitan aspect of human microbiota is not limited to high abundant taxa.",

It was found in all the subjects in the oral habitats, nearly all of the skin sites and anterior nares samples, about 50% of vaginal samples, and 30% of stool samples. To investigate whether a locally abundant genus affects its abundance in less dominant sites, the abundance of Streptococcus from throat, Lactobacillus from posterior fornix, Bacteroides from stool were compared with their abundances in the rest of habitats (Figure S6 in Additional file 1). The abundance of Streptococcus in throat has moderate correlation with the abundance of Streptococcus in other oral habitats except subgingival and supragingval plaques, and it has no correlation with non-oral sites. Similarly, no correlation was found between stool and non-stool site for Bacteroides, vaginal and non-vaginal sites for Lactobacillus. The strong association of microbes within habitats and lack of association between major habitats is consistent with the findings from another HMP companion paper focusing on the microbial co-occurrence in human bodies [26]. However, both of our conclusions were based on the genus level analysis, while species and strain level analysis may reveal a different picture of the correlation pattern within habitat since the same genus from two different habitats may represent different species.",

The mean time interval between visits is 212 days (Table S3 in Additional file 2). Bacterial communities in oral and stool habitats have strong correlation (>0.6) between first and second visits, thus representing stable communities, whereas skin/nares and vaginal sites have weak correlation (<0.4) between visits, thus representing variable communities. Furthermore, within a body site, correlation between visits varies greatly from person to person, especially in skin and vaginal sites.",

Moraxella is a genus that colonizes mucosal surfaces and can give rise to opportunistic infections. It is also one of the notable causes of otitis media and sinusitis. In this dataset, Moraxella was detected in 17.5% of the sampled individuals. High variation was detected in nine out of 48 paired samples. For example, in one subject Moraxella was 74.3% in abundance in the first visit, but dropped to 0% in the second visit while another subject showed 0% in first visit and 66.2% in second visit (Figure S8 in Additional file 1). The increased abundance of Moraxella was accompanied by decreasing abundance in other genera, such as Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium, and Corynebacterium.",

The frequency of Bacteroidetes from HMP data is significantly higher than that in the twin study (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P <0.001) (Figure S9 in Additional file 1). Hierarchical clustering of stool samples using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was performed as a general comparison. Surprisingly, stool clustering revealed two distinct groups (Figure S10A in Additional file 1) with each cluster based on projects. The HMP saliva samples and the Chinese saliva samples were separated into two project-based clusters with the exception of six caries and two healthy Chinese saliva samples that clustered with HMP healthy samples. Two Chinese caries samples were outliers (Figure S10B in Additional file 1). The clear boundary separating samples by projects suggest significant variation between the bacterial communities in each project. Multiple factors differ between projects (for example, read length, DNA extraction, 16S rRNA region, see Table S4 in Additional file 2), and these in addition to individual variation, demographic difference, and other technical issues [45] can have significant impact on bacterial community structure. The above analyses indicate the challenges for comparisons across projects and suggest that care must be taken in use of HMP data as healthy controls for other projects.",

Each habitat has its own characteristic biodiversity and taxon abundance distribution curve. While there are many contributing factors to each characteristic pattern, this description of the healthy state will contribute to recognition of changes associated with disease. The trend of the biodiversity changes varies with diseases. For example, diversity was reduced in stool habitat with obesity [43], but increased in the vaginal habitat with vaginosis [46]. However, it is not clear whether the disturbed biodiversity is the consequence or the cause of disease. Moreover, compared to classical macro-ecological systems, where healthy ecosystems show high biodiversity, considered important for stability and surviving stress to the system, it is apparent that the situation with the human microbiome is more complex as there is no simple rule relating biodiversity to health. Thus for use of biodiversity as a diagnostic of health or disease, careful analysis of the baseline healthy state in each habitat is required.",

For example, most habitats have a few dominant taxa with a large number of individually rare species; the more abundant taxa show the most dispersal among subjects, although some minor taxa are widespread too; habitats showing lower Shannon diversity (vagina, skin) also are among the most variable. It was reported that the vaginal bacterial communities from healthy adults underwent drastic changes over a short period of time [21]. In this study, we also observed the dynamic community structure of the anterior nares. Clinical studies have revealed that the prevalence of pharyngeal colonization and respiratory tract infections caused by Moraxella catarrhalis displays seasonal variation and increases in winter [47]. Unfortunately, no detailed seasonal information is available for this dataset. Further study with multiple sampling points at different seasons will provide a better picture of the seasonal effect on the bacterial community in the anterior nares. In general, familiar concepts from macro-ecology appear to apply. Both cosmopolitan and endemic organisms are found in the human microbiome, with many organisms found in multiple habitats, albeit at varying abundance, so the adage 'everything is everywhere, but environment selects' [48] in ecology appears to hold for the human microbiome as well.",

However, the 16S rRNA gene method involves PCR amplification with degenerate primers that may nevertheless favor some taxa over others. This method also creates chimeric sequences that are largely but not completely removed during data processing. With the decrease of sequencing cost, sequencing large cohorts of samples by WGS is feasible in the future. The taxonomic profiling derived from WGS data (that is, MetaPhlAn) will overcome the above concerns [49]. Furthermore, the taxonomic approach using either 16S rRNA gene or WGS sequences must be complemented by studies of the individual organisms to understand 'what' functional activities they are providing, necessary for a mechanistic understanding of the functioning of the microbiome. The pure focus on the organisms of many studies of the human microbiome leaves this analysis incomplete. As aptly stated by early researchers in the field 'It is what bacteria do rather than what they are that commands attention, since our interest centers in the host rather than the parasite' [50].",

Fifteen habitats comprised of anterior nares, skin (left and right retroauricular crease, left and right antecubital fossa), oral (hard palate, keratinized gingiva, buccal mucosa, subgingval plaque, supragingval plaque, saliva, tongue dorsum, palatine tonsil, and throat), and stool were sampled from both male and female subjects. Female subjects were sampled at three extra sites, vaginal introitus, posterior fornix, and mid vagina. Subjects with vaginal pH >4.5 were excluded from the study. For longitudinal studies, sets of samples from each habitat were collected at two time points (Table S3 in Additional file 2). The mean time interval between the two time points was 212 days. We also included some datasets from other projects. The control group from a trachoma project with collaborators from The Gambia showed no evidence of acute or chronic trachoma and had normal healthy conjunctiva. Those samples provide a view of microbiota in the conjunctiva. Preterm baby stool samples from a neonatal microbiome project [51] contribute to the more complete picture of stool microbiome. Microbiota vary greatly in the early weeks of life, thus a single sampling point was chosen at the age of 4 weeks. No antibiotics were taken 3 weeks before sampling of the preterm baby stool. The urine habitat from healthy controls from the Urethral Microbiome of Adolescent Males project were added to represent other body habitats that were not represented in the HMP samples [7].

Craig Ventor Institute. The quality filtering and trimming, chimera checking were performed as described [24]. In brief, the protocol allows one mismatch in the primer and zero mismatches in the barcode. Chimeric reads were removed using Chimera slayer software [52]. At the beginning of the HMP, investigation on the Mock Community that is composed of known organisms demonstrated that the increased richness was mainly from the chimeric and low quality reads [31]. All the high quality 16S rRNA gene reads were classified from phylum to genus level at a confidence threshold of 0.5 using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Naiive Bayesian Classifier version 2.2, training set 6 [32]. The reads whose taxonomic assignments were <0.5 confidence threshold were assigned to the unclassified group. Samples with <1,000 reads were removed to ensure adequate representation of the community structure. The reads used in this analysis can be downloaded from the Data Analysis and Coordination Center (DACC) website [55] with SRA study ID SRP002395. The metadata of HMP study was submitted by the EMMES Corporation, which serves as the clinical data collection site for the HMP. It can be obtained from dbGaP website [56].",

The average relative abundance of phyla in each habitat was measured by the fraction of total 16S rRNA gene sequences. Each color represents a phylum. (A) Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria are the major phyla identified in human body. (B) Phyla accounting for <0.5% of the total phyla are shown. Preterm baby stool in this dataset does not contain low abundance phyla with the 0.5% standard, thus there are no data plotted. The total fractions of the phyla <0.5% in this figure are listed on top of the plot. Figure S3. Accumulation curves at the genus level. The only difference between Figure S3A and Figure \u200bFigure11 is that all the samples were rarified to 1,000 reads in Figure S3A. The accumulation curves exhibit similar patterns in both figures. Figure S3B shows stool richness at different sequencing depths. Sixty stool samples with >9,000 reads were rarified to 1,000, 3,000, 6,000, and 9,000 reads. Both deep sequencing and a large number of subjects are required to detect all the possible taxa. Figure S4. The association of sequencing depth and sample frequency.

Sixty stool samples with >9,000 reads were rarified to 1,000, 3,000, 6,000, and 9,000 reads. The points showing the abundance of each genus at different depths are linked by line segments. With increased sequencing depth, the number of subjects who share the same genus, including the minor genera, is increased. Figure S5. The relative abundances of taxa in each habitat and dispersal among subjects. Dispersal of a given genus is indicated by sample prevalence of that genus on x-axis. The average relative abundance (m \u00b1 se) of each genus is indicated on y-axis. The most abundant genera in general have the highest prevalence. However low abundance genera can also be ubiquitous and high abundance genera can be distributed in a limited number of subjects. Also see Figure \u200bFigure4.4. Figure S6. The correlation of abundant taxa between their dominant habitats and less dominant sites. The abundances of Bacteroides from stool, Streptococcus from throat, and Lactobacillus from posterior fornix were compared with abundances in the rest of the habitats. The taxon abundance lacks correlation between major habitats (oral, skin, vaginal, stool), but it shows moderate correlation within the oral and vaginal sites. Figure S7. Dynamics of Lactobacillus in vaginal habitats between visits. The relative abundances of Lactobacillus undergo great changes between two visits. Vaginosis related genera (Gardnerella, Prevotella, Atopobium) are over-represented after Lactobacillus loses its dominance. These subjects were asymptomatic and met the criteria of HMP study. Figure S8. Dynamics of Moraxella in anterior nares between visits. The relative abundance of Moraxella (colored orange) varies from 0% to 70% between visits. Figure S9. The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in HMP stool samples and twin study stool samples. The relative abundances of two major phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are plotted. Bacteroidetes in HMP stool samples are significantly higher than those in obese and lean group of the twin studies (P <0.001). Figure S10. Cluster analysis of the HMP dataset with data from other studies. (A) Clustering analysis of HMP stool and twin study stool samples. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and complete linkage. Red labels represent the HMP samples and blue labels represent twin study samples. (B) Clustering analysis of HMP saliva and Chinese saliva samples. Red: HMP sample; green: healthy controls of Chinese saliva samples; blue: Chinese saliva samples from subjects with dental caries. The majority of the samples are clustered by project rather than health status.",
