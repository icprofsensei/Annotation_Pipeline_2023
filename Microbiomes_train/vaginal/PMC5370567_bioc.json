Multiple factors affect microbiome assembly, including stochastic acquisition of bacterial strains, diet, age, pet ownership and antibiotic use [1\u20136]. These complexities often leave dissecting the effects of individual factors challenging, yet these complex interpersonal differences represent the background on which real-world treatment of disease takes place. Many of modulators of the microbiota are expected to vary with demographic and socioeconomic status. Here we investigate longitudinal vaginal microbiota samples from HIV+ and HIV\u2212 women in the city of Chicago, where sampling took place at two hospitals, which are separated by less than 5 miles but serve quite different socioeconomic groups.",

Advanced disease and AIDS are associated with immunodeficiency, which can result in opportunistic infections and alterations in the microbiome [8, 15\u201319]. Some of the expanded microbes are readily detected in the healthy human microbiome and are only pathogenic in immunodeficient states. The microbiota has been implicated in HIV transmission and disease progression [20\u201323]. Immune responses to the normal microbiota may shape the possible immune responses to new infections with HIV, and inflammation associated with microbial action may promote transmission by inducing proliferation of cells that support HIV infection. After infection, leakage of microbial antigens across the damaged gut may promote inflammation and associated morbidity [24, 25]. These observations and others have motivated detailed studies of the interaction of HIV and the human microbiome.",

A study of 174 Rwandan sex workers showed a strong association between the structure in the vaginal microbiome and HIV+ status [27]. In a study of at-risk women in Kenya, BV and HSV2 infection were the two strongest risk factors measured for HIV acquisition over a 20-year period [28]. BV is known to be more common in African American women, motivating studies of associations with HIV infection [29]. In contrast, a study of the vaginal microbiome in 64 women in Chicago showed no differences associated with HIV infection [30]. Another study, comparing vaginal microbiota in women from Rwanda and the US together with HIV status, found modest differences for both geographic site and infection status [31]. Thus reported associations between HIV+ status and structure of the vaginal microbiota have varied with cohort and geographical location.",

To assign Lactobacillus sequences to the species level, sequences were compared to the 16S Lactobacillus type strains downloaded from Bacterio.net. As was seen in previous studies [3, 9, 11, 39, 40], many samples showed high proportions of bacteria from the genus Lactobacillus (Figure 1D\u2013E). A total of 99.3% of Lactobacillus sequences were classified to the species level (using BLAST with e-value threshold of 10\u22125 and percent identity > 97%). Species present included L. iners, crispatus, gasseri, fornicalis, taiwanensis, psittaci, jensenii, helveticus, vaginalis, ultunensis, and rhamnosus (Figure 1F). The proportions of Lactobacillus varied widely, with some samples composed nearly entirely by Lactobacillus while others were almost free of Lactobacillus. The proportions of the different Lactobacillus genera in general did not differ between the hospitals studied or HIV infection status (p=0.786 and p=0.693 respectively), though the relatively rare Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus gasseri were more common in samples from CC hospital (p=0.009 and p=0.001 respectively, Table 1). The significance of this difference is unknown and could be either due to happenstance of colonization in differences in geographical locations or factors such as race, diet, health status, or hygiene practices.",

When the test was conducted using only the first time point, so that each woman contributed only one measurement, results were still significant (Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0.046). Following previous literature on BV and health disparities [29], we investigated associations of HIV, BV and race. We found that when all data points were analyzed as a pool, HIV and BV were positively associated within both self-identified African Americans (Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0.0087) and other racial groups (Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0.009) independently. When samples were compared using only the first time point, which reduced power, significance was lost for African Americans, but still detectable for other races (Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0.020).

The cohorts sampled, though from the same city, differed in median income, health, racial and demographic factors. Women treated at both hospitals achieved good virologic control (<40 viral RNA copies per ml of blood). Thus the HIV+ subjects were relatively healthy, likely accounting for the relatively modest differences seen in the vaginal microbiota associated with HIV status. Analysis of the vaginal microbiome showed notable associations between high diversity states, high pH, and BV as inferred from Nugent scores, paralleling previous studies [9, 11, 18, 39]. Previous studies have differed on associations between HIV status and BV[26\u201328, 30, 31]\u2014here we found that HIV+ status was correlated with BV status.",

This finding accounted for more frequent switching by the women sampled from the CC hospital. For some women, the vaginal microbiota has been reported to show longitudinal variation, in some cases associated with the menstrual cycle but also on other time scales as well [40, 44\u201346]. The factors driving longitudinal dynamics have not been fully clarified. The fluctuations in BV status were not associated with HIV infection, though the numbers of switchers identified was low and so limited power to detect association. The basis of longitudinal instability in vaginal microbiome structure among African-American women is unknown and was not obviously associated with any of our metadata. Candidate explanations include genetic differences or cultural differences such as hygenic practices.",

Various models may explain this observation. It is possible that women can develop a persistent long term state where BV is frequent, and that this state is associated with more frequent HIV infection. Alternatively, HIV infection may promote BV, despite effective antiretroviral therapy. Still another possibility is that high frequencies of BV are markers for socio-economic, genetic, or other factors that are positively associated with HIV infection as well without being directly causal. At present it seems simplest to invoke the first model, since inflammation associated with BV may result in recruitment of HIV infection target cells to the mucosa, and so provides a simple explanation for the data [29]. If correct, this emphasizes that interventions designed to reprogram the persistent frequent BV state may help prevent HIV transmission.",

CM samples were aspirated with a mucus collection device, Mucat (Sepal Reproductive Devices, Boston, MA), directly from the cervical os.

The pH of all mucus samples was measured using a small-volume pH electrode (Metrohm, Riverview, FL). All samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until DNA was extracted in batches.
