Two patients showed Lactobacillus iners dominance during the course of pregnancy, and two showed a shift between the first and second trimester from L. crispatus to L. iners dominance. In all of the samples only these two species were identified, and were found at an abundance of higher than 1% in this study. Comparative analyses also showed that the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy is characterized by a marked dominance of Lactobacillus species in both Caucasian and African-American subjects. In addition, our Caucasian subject population clustered by trimester and progressed towards a common attractor while African-American women clustered by subject instead and did not progress towards a common attractor.",

Genomic DNA extraction was performed by using the MoBio Ultraclean Soil Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA); however, instead of vortexing, MP FastPrep (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) for 40 seconds at 6.0 m/s was substituted to obtain a more effective and rapid lysis of the cells. Incubation period was done for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of overnight. After extraction the DNA content was measured using High Sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) with the results ranging from 25\u201360 ng/\u00b5l. The V3\u2013V5 region of the 16S rRNA was then amplified through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as follows: 25 \u00b5l of Kapa HiFi (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA), 1.5 \u00b5l (10 uM) forward primer, 1.5 \u00b5l (10 uM) reverse primer, 50 ng of DNA with the remaining volume being added by molecular grade water (up to a final volume of 50 \u00b5l per reaction). The forward primer was the universal primer 357F (5\u2032GTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG3\u2032) with the added construct on the 5\u2032 end of the 5\u2032 Illumina Adapter (5\u2032AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC3\u2032) + Forward Primer Pad (5\u2032TATGGTAATT3\u2032) to a total sequence: 5\u2032AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTATGGTAATTGTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG3\u2032 and the universal bacterial reverse primer was 926R (5\u2032CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT3\u2032) with an added construct on the 5\u2032 end of the reverse complement of 3\u2032 Illumina adapter (5\u2032CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATGCCGCATTCGAT3\u2032) + Barcode (12 base pairs) to a total sequence: 5\u2032CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATGCCGCATTCGATXXXXXXXXXXXXCCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT3\u2032. The barcode introduced in the reverse primer construct was unique to each sample, functioning as a genetic ID for sequencing. The PCR cycle was the following: 95\u00b0C for 3 min, 98\u00b0C for 20 sec, 70\u00b0C for 15 sec, 72\u00b0C for 15 sec, cycle repeated for 34 times and 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The products of the amplification were verified by TapeStation D1K Tape (2200 TapeStation Instrument, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to be free of contamination and the expected amplification size, approximately 700 base pairs. Upon verification the PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). After purification the concentrations were measured using Qubit High Sensitivity and were found to be >1 ng/\u00b5l. The first samples 8\u201312 weeks of gestation were processed at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with an identical protocol. Subsequently, all of the samples were then collected and sent to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign for 16S rRNA sequencing using a high-throughput next-generation Illumina MiSeq (250 PE, San Diego, CA) sequencing platform.",

In this published work 22 pregnant women (19 African-American, 2 Caucasian and 1 Hispanic) were sampled throughout their pregnancy. Since all of our subjects were Caucasian, the comparison between both studies allows for an investigation of putative ethnical differences. It is well known that African-American healthy vaginal microbiotas exhibit a higher degree of inter-subject diversity than observed among Caucasian subjects [23]. Since the risk factor for the development of both gynecological [23] and obstetrical [24] morbidities is higher in African-Americans [23] it becomes of interest to characterize the healthy state of the vaginal microbiome in both groupings in order to investigate if the higher inter-subject variability is maintained in African-Americans or is homogenized by pregnancy.",

Despite limitations due to the different 16s rRNA primers and sequencing platform utilized in the Romero et al. study, some meaningful comparative analyses were possible through the use of reference OTUs [21]. The results show that in both ethnicities pregnancy significantly decreases \u03b1-diversity (Figure 4). Comparison in overall diversity between ethnicities did not reveal any significant differences regardless of pregnancy state (Figure S3). Overall, we found divergence between subjects to be higher between non-pregnant subjects in Caucasians than between pregnant ones (p<0.01, Figure 5). The opposite was observed between non-pregnant and pregnant African-Americans, where inter-subject variability was lower than between pregnant individuals (p<0.01, Figure 5). Comparison of the relative abundance of the genus Lactobacillus in the non-pregnant state is significantly higher in Caucasians than African-Americans but this proportion becomes non-significant when pregnant subjects are compared (Figure 6).",

A major limiting factor was present in side-by-side time-longitudinal analyses and ethnicity as we identified only 3 African-American subjects with longitudinal data across all 3 trimesters (all other subjects did not have samples collected during the first trimester). Though small in size, we nonethless compared the results from these 3 African-American subjects and our 12 Caucasian subjects and showed that the diversity observed between the African-American subjects varied widely across these 3 cases in comparison to the 12 Caucasian subjects (Figure 7). The PCA plots shown in Figure 8 further showed that the African-American subjects clustered by subject and did not show a common attractor as the pregnancies progressed. This is in contrast with what was observed in the Caucasian subjects, which did not cluster by subject, but instead showed a strong common attractor towards the later stages of the pregnancy.",

Our findings are consistent with those reported in a cross-sectional study by Ravel et al.\n[8] that profiled the vaginal microbiome in non-pregnant women. The relative amount of dominance exhibited by L.crispatus and L.iners may be a factor in the susceptibility to changes in the microbiota. In addition, L.iners has been identified as a transitional vaginal microbe, potentially indicating susceptibility to dysbiosis or a recovery from it [32]. In this study we did not verify any difference in the pregnancy progression or outcome of women whose vaginal microflora was dominated by L.iners, although the fact that these profiles were more diverse than the ones dominated by L.crispatus may indicate a higher susceptibility to change. Overall, it is well known that Lactobacillus species actively protect themselves and the vaginal environment from invaders by the production of lactic acid which acidifies the vaginal pH as well as the production of H2O2 which prevents ascending infection [33]. At least 25% of pre-term births are associated with infection, and a healthy vaginal microbiome may be a stronghold against potential microbial invaders [34].",

However, the large majority of participants in the complementary study from Romero et al. [17] are from African-American women. Although still limited by numbers, our meta-analysis and comparison allowed us to draw inferences in these two populations. Perhaps, the most important limiting factor in the meta-analysis are the differences in hypervariable 16S rRNA regions amplified (V1-V2 in Romero's dataset and V3-V5 in our study) and sequencing platforms used (454 in Romero's and Illumina in ours). Attempts to single out the biases and artifacts introduced by these factors were made and the result of such comparisons determined that these artifacts made many of the direct comparisons between both datasets inconclusive (details presented in the Methods S1, Figure S2 and Table S1). This further highlights the importance of standards in the burgeoning field of microbiome research [35] in the women's reproductive tract.",

It is well known that there are differences between the microbiotas of African-American and Caucasian women, with the latter being more often reported to have a higher representation of Lactobacillus species [23]. The vaginal health benefits of a Lactobacillus dominated flora are well-described, and the fact that African-American women are more susceptible to gynecological morbidities such as bacterial vaginosis and vaginitis may be linked to a flora depleted in Lactobacillus\n[23] or a functional substitute that will maintain the acidity and peroxide contents that shield the vaginal canal from a multitude of pathogens. The dominance of Lactobacillus in Caucasian women seen on our cohort is telling when coupled with the fact that pregnancy complications leading to preterm labor and delivery are higher in African-American women, at a rate of 16\u201318% of all deliveries, when compared to 5\u20139% in Caucasian [24].",

Ravel et al. [8] have shown that African-American subjects are more likely to have a vaginal microbiome not dominated by Lactobacillus. However, Zhou et al. [23] have shown that Caucasians vaginal microbiota is commonly dominated by similar numbers of more than one species of Lactobacillus while this was rarely observed in African-Americans. Hence, both these observations confound diversity estimations between the two ethnic groups. We have not found a statistically significant difference in the vaginal microbiome diversity between African-Americans and Caucasians either non-pregnant or pregnant (Figure S3). What we did find was that the non-pregnant state is significantly more diverse than the pregnant state regardless of ethnicity (Figure 4). In accordance with Romero et al. [23] we verified that the proportion of Lactobacillus dominated communities is different between the two ethnicities when not pregnant (higher in Caucasians) but becomes statistically indistinguishable during pregnancy (Figure 6). This finding is an indicator that pregnancy has a marked effect in the vaginal microbiome, which experiences a complete dominance by Lactobacillus species regardless of ethnicity.",

On the other hand, African-American women cluster by subject and do not show a common attractor (Figure 8). This is also supported by the wider analysis shown on Figure 5. It is tempting to speculate that these differences in microbial dynamics may underlie the increased risk of pregnancy complications in particular individuals in the African-American population. However, due to the multitude of other factors that may also vary across these two populations, it is difficult to isolate the cause. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to consider the role of the microbiome in preterm birth and other pregnancy complications. This study highlights the importance of larger studies comparing subjects with different ethnical backgrounds that also analyze specific pregnancy complications such as preterm labor.",
