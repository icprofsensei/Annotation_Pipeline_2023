Shotgun sequencing of such communities' metagenomes provides information complementary to organismal abundances from taxonomic markers, but the resulting data typically comprise short reads from hundreds of different organisms and are at best challenging to assemble comparably to single-organism genomes. Here, we describe an alternative approach to infer the functional and metabolic potential of a microbial community metagenome. We determined the gene families and pathways present or absent within a community, as well as their relative abundances, directly from short sequence reads. We validated this methodology using a collection of synthetic metagenomes, recovering the presence and abundance both of large pathways and of small functional modules with high accuracy. We subsequently applied this method, HUMAnN, to the microbial communities of 649 metagenomes drawn from seven primary body sites on 102 individuals as part of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). This provided a means to compare functional diversity and organismal ecology in the human microbiome, and we determined a core of 24 ubiquitously present modules. Core pathways were often implemented by different enzyme families within different body sites, and 168 functional modules and 196 metabolic pathways varied in metagenomic abundance specifically to one or more niches within the microbiome. These included glycosaminoglycan degradation in the gut, as well as phosphate and amino acid transport linked to host phenotype (vaginal pH) in the posterior fornix. An implementation of our methodology is available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann. This provides a means to accurately and efficiently characterize microbial metabolic pathways and functional modules directly from high-throughput sequencing reads, enabling the determination of community roles in the HMP cohort and in future metagenomic studies.",

These microbial communities were assayed using high-throughput DNA sequencing, but it can be challenging to determine their biological functions based solely on the resulting short sequences. To reconstruct the metabolic activities of such communities, we have developed HUMAnN, a method to accurately infer community function directly from short DNA reads. The method's accuracy was validated using a collection of synthetic microbial communities. Applying HUMAnN to data from the HMP, we showed that, unlike individual microbial species, many metabolic processes were present among all body habitats. However, the frequencies of these processes varied dramatically, and some were highly enriched within individual habitats to provide niche specialization (e.g. in the gut, which is abundant in food matter but low in oxygen). Other community functions were linked specifically to properties of the human host, such as biochemical processes only present in vaginal habitats with particularly high or low pH. Studying additional environmental or disease-associated communities using HUMAnN will further improve our understanding of how the microbial organisms in a community are linked to the biological processes they carry out.",

Metagenomic sequencing provides a culture-independent means of studying these diverse microbiota within different ecological niches, including sites in the human body that differ strikingly in microbial composition and subsequent impacts on health [2], [3], [4]. The gut microbiota in particular have been shown to play an important role in host metabolism [5], [6] and immune response [4], and mechanisms of commensal microbial contribution to disease have been established e.g. in the vaginal [7] and skin [8] communities as well. These studies have demonstrated the importance of assaying microbial pathways, metabolism, and individual gene products by means of metagenomic sequencing to determine their roles in community-wide interactions and phenotypes. A functional interpretation of metagenomic sequences is thus key to connecting the metabolic and functional potential of a microbial community with its organismal population structure and with its influence on the surrounding environment or human host.",

The study's metagenomic data comprise over 3.5 Tbp of shotgun DNA sequences drawn from seven body habitats (including oral, gut, urogenital, nasal, and skin) from over 100 individuals. Using these data, we sought to address questions pertaining specifically to microbiome function: what metabolic and broader biomolecular functions are present within the human microbiome, how do they provide specialization within the microbial niches of distinct body sites, and how do they vary across the human host population? To address these in a high-throughput manner, we have developed a scalable methodology to reconstruct the functional potential of microbial communities from metagenomic sequences, the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN). To avoid the need for assembly of metagenomic reads, HUMAnN (Figure 1) allows direct profiling of the metabolic potential of microbial communities as represented by orthologous gene family and pathway abundances. The computational methodology incorporates a series of gene- and pathway-level quantification, noise reduction, and smoothing steps in order A) to identify which pathways are present or absent within a metagenomically sequenced community and B) to determine their relative abundances. HUMAnN's predictive accuracy was validated quantitatively using data from four synthetic communities, and it was subsequently used to characterize metabolic function throughout the human microbiome.",

However, functional characterization of community metagenomes is additionally necessary to determine what metabolism and other biological activity may be occurring [11], [12]. This presents a distinct set of challenges, since inter-dependent organisms within a community may share many functional components in addition to playing individually specialized roles. Current metagenomic approaches for characterizing microbial community function include IMG/M [13], MG-RAST [14], and the recently expanded MEGAN tool [15]. Each of these relies on a \u201cbest-BLAST-hit\u201d approach, in which individual short reads from a sequenced community (or open reading frames from assembled DNA) are searched against a characterized reference database using translated BLAST. This approach has been used to show the importance of specific community metabolic processes in a range of environmental ecologies, including ocean water and the human gut [16]. Gianoulis et al [17] in particular found that in a collection of 37 ocean communities, metabolic differences correlated specifically with environmental features such as temperature, depth, and salinity. In a particularly large dataset of 124 gut metagenomes, the MetaHIT consortium [11] qualitatively identified metabolic pathways using genes predicted from assembled sequences, which were subsequently suggested to be associated with host phenotypes including obesity [12]. Several additional studies have shown the importance of testing for pathways differentially abundant among communities of interest, e.g. among ocean environments [18] or within the infant gut [19], [20]. However, although each of these results demonstrates the importance of community metabolism and function, no one method has yet been quantitatively evaluated as a means of reconstructing microbial pathway abundances from metagenomic data.",

These were recovered with correlations over 0.9, consistently outperforming best-BLAST-hit approaches. We proceeded to scale our analysis to perform metabolic reconstruction on 649 human microbiome samples drawn from the buccal mucosa, supragingival plaque, and tongue dorsum (oral sites), anterior nares (nasal), retroauricular crease (skin), and stool (gut) communities from 102 individuals. We identified 196 metabolic pathways and 168 small modules that were differentially abundant among body sites, and we highlight here associations with environmental pH and enrichment for glycosaminoglycan degradation as examples from the vaginal and gut communities, respectively. Metabolic module abundances were substantially more variable among body sites and among individuals than was module coverage, indicating a connection between selective pressures in each microbial niche and the pathways carried by members of the community. Finally, as HUMAnN simultaneously reconstructs large pathways, specific metabolic modules, and individual enzymatic gene families, we discuss an example of glutamate metabolism in the gut community as it interacts with specific carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZys [21]). An implementation of HUMAnN is publicly available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann, and the methodology can be equivalently applied to metatranscriptomic or metaproteomic data using any gene or pathway catalog of interest for future studies.",

One HC and one LC had even distributions with all organisms at equal abundance, and the remaining two had log-normally distributed random abundances (see Supplemental Table S2). Organisms for the LC communities were manually selected from KEGG v54 curated reference genomes associated with the human microbiome, and HC communities were randomly generated from all manually curated bacterial genomes. A MAQ [6] error model was constructed using one lane of Illumina reads and quality scores; 106 synthetic reads were generated from this error model per organism. These were randomly mixed in proportion to organismal abundances to a total of 106 100 bp reads per community. These synthetic reads were BLASTed as above, with any hits at >90% identity discarded so as to prevent overestimates of accuracy based solely on well-characterized genomes.",

The former were manually chosen from representatives of the human microbiota, and the latter were randomly selected from KEGG high-quality bacterial genomes (see Methods, Supplemental Tables S2\u20133). Likewise, two of the communities contained organisms with equally distributed abundances, and two possessed lognormally distributed abundances to mimic physiological communities. A gold standard of functional modules and pathways as defined by KEGG [26] was assembled, comprising 13,980 gene families, 370 total small metabolic modules, and 309 large pathways. 251 and 303 of the latter, respectively, included at least four genes and were used here. Their presence in these communities was determined from KEGG genome annotations for the chosen organisms; these were used to evaluate a naive best-BLAST-hit metabolic reconstruction as compared with HUMAnN's inferences.

These synthetic communities were further used to refine the inclusion of computational steps within the HUMAnN pipeline and to assess the robustness of their parameter settings.

False positive modules (8, 3.3% at a 10\u22124 cutoff) were near-uniformly small gene sets overlapping with modules truly present (e.g. the urea cycle M00029, with five total genes and four present in the community). Conversely, false negatives (9, 3.7%) were most often small pathways present only in very low-abundance organisms, e.g. bicarbonate transport (M00321, four genes present at 0.022% relative abundance) or mannopine transport (M00301, four genes at 0.0014%).

However, in agreement with a gene family core from the gut microbiomes of an independent cohort [11], these modules comprise the functionality essential for microbial life: transcription (M00183, M00049-52), translation (M00178, M00360), transport (M00207, M00222, M00239), central carbon metabolism (M00001-2, M00006), and energy production (M00120, M00125, M00157, M00164). By relaxing the coverage threshold to 30% (expected to introduce few, if any, false positives; see 4.4), only 8 additional modules were included, demonstrating robustness to this threshold. Two of these extended the categories listed above; the remainder comprised sn-Glycerol 3-phosphate transport (M00198, a membrane lipid precursor [32]), the mannose and trehalose phosphotransferase systems (M00270 and M00276), spermidine/putrescine transport (M00299), early terpenoid biosynthesis (M00364), and threonine biosynthesis (M00018), the only amino acid module to meet this prevalence threshold. It should be noted that these 24 core modules are not the most abundant; for example, sn-Glycerol 3-phosphate transport reaches only a mean relative abundance of 0.001 sd. 0.002 across all samples, compared with the ribosome (M00178) at 0.03 sd. 0.008. Nor were they evenly abundant among habitats, as examples including phosphate and sugar transport (M00197 and M00222) are highly enriched in the posterior fornix as discussed below. The organisms performing the more specialized processes in this list also vary among habitats. Spermidine and putrescine are metabolized by the abundant Streptococcus spp. in the oral community, for example, processes that can play a role in halitosis [33]. However, this metabolic module is not present in reference genomes for the skin community's abundant Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium spp. [8], [26], and its abundance is instead correlated with that of the Staphylococcus reference genomes [24] (Spearman r\u200a=\u200a0.87, n\u200a=\u200a26, p\u200a=\u200a1.8\u00b710\u22126). Although this stringent core is itself moderately small, most other modules were consistently present or absent across body sites, with only 24 showing strongly differential coverage among habitats (Figure 3).",

Over two thirds (168, 67%) of detected metabolic modules varied significantly in abundance in at least one habitat, demonstrating the uniqueness of each body habitat's microbial environment (Supplemental Table S7). In addition to the detailed examples below, these included such diverse processes as arginine transport (M00229) and methionine biosynthesis (M00017) enriched in all three oral habitats, an enrichment for fungal transcription (M00181) and translation (M00177) in the skin and airways, and a strong depletion of pyruvate (M00307) and second carbon oxidation (M00011) in the anaerobic gut and vaginal sites. Several overall patterns of co-variation are shown in Figure 4, where the first principal component captured primarily eukaryotic modules found only on the skin and often nares (including, intriguingly, vitamin D biosynthesis, M00102). Interestingly, it also included metabolism abundant throughout the digestive tract (i.e. oropharynx and gut), such as putrescine (M00300) and sulfate transport (M00185) [23]. The second principal component described functionality depleted in the low-complexity vaginal habitat, and the third comprised processes enriched in the gut, both discussed below. The three oral habitats are often functionally similar (apparent in components 1\u20133), and the fourth emphasized modules unique to the tooth surface, the only microbially colonized hard surface assayed here, in contrast to the mucosal and tongue soft tissues [23]. While the skin and nares were likewise often similar, the final principal component shown in Figure 4 differentiates the two. These summaries show that while a wide range of microbial metabolism is present throughout the human microbiome, specific subsets of this functionality are selected for by the unique combinations of nutrients, immune pressures, and environmental exposures present at each body site.",

These quantify how many distinct types of organisms occupy a community, the uniformity of their relative abundances, or both, respectively. These measures were historically adopted from macroecology into microbial ecology, and while the former has included assessments of functional diversity [35], [36], it has been proposed for microbial communities [37], [38] but not yet widely adopted in metagenomic studies. Functional diversity measures are thus calculated by HUMAnN as a novel means of profiling microbial community structure, with some differences from their applications in macroecology as described in the Discussion. A simple measure of richness is calculated by summing module coverage scores within each sample [34], and Pielou's evenness [39] and the Shannon and inverse Simpson [34] diversity measures are calculated from module abundances. As observed qualitatively by Turnbaugh et al [5] and analyzed quantitatively by the HMP [1], microbial metabolic function differs significantly less among subjects than does organismal diversity within each habitat. Ecological summary statistics of community function may thus represent a unique descriptor of metagenomic data complementary to standard organismal diversity measures.",

These included chondroitin sulfate degradation, dermatan sulfate degradation, and keratan sulfate degradation, as well as the related uronic acid metabolism. All four of these modules are involved in animal proteoglycan degradation for microbial carbohydrate utilization [40], and they were present in high abundance in the gut (coverage >0.9 in 136 stool samples, 100%) and rare or completely absent in other body sites (coverage <0.1 in 131 samples, 26%; abundance <0.001 in 512 samples, 99%). This degree of specificity was unusual in the HMP dataset - as mentioned above, relatively few modules were present or absent in only one such body site. However, it provides a readily identifiable example of community metabolism associated with a specific clade, as glycosaminoglycan degradation is known to be enriched among the Bacteroides species [5], [41]. The model B. thetaiotaomicron alone, for example, carries nearly 90 different polysaccharide utilization loci, many targeting dietary starches, but at least 16 specific to host mucin O-glycan degradation [42]. As the Bacteroides are one of the predominant genera in the gut microbiome [43], are largely characteristic of only that body site, and are abundant in the HMP gut samples [1], they are highly likely to be responsible for this niche-specific metabolism.",

Chondroitin and dermatan sulfate degradation share the greatest overlap with 3 KO families, including beta-glucuronidase (K01195). Beta-glucuronidase is prevalent in the gut, averaging 0.03% sd. 0.01% in our data, in contrast to all other nonzero KOs (ave. 0.007% sd. 0.03%). It is one of the primary enzymes involved in metabolism both of food matter and of pharmaceuticals [44], as well as mediating effects ranging from dietary cancer risk [45] to antibiotic activity [46]. This enzyme also links uronic acid metabolism with the rest of pentose and glucuronate processing, the former being the most abundant module of these gut-specific examples. Uronic acid, like the GAG sulfates, is a component of dietary fiber and glycoproteins degraded by intestinal bacteria [42]. In contrast, heparan sulfate degradation, an additional module included in glycoprotein degradation as defined by KEGG, is present at only low abundance among all body sites, in spite of sharing nearly half of its enzymes with the other three modules (ave. 7\u00b710\u22124% sd. 0.003% in the gut, <10\u22125% elsewhere). This is due exclusively to the absence of the module's input enzyme, heparanase (K07964-5), a typically eukaryotic gene family implicated in tumor metastasis [47]; the healthy commensal microbiota may thus lack this activity in order to avoid undesirable inflammatory and immune response in the gut [48]. Conversely, the abundances of the four gut-specific GAG degration modules were not driven by one specific gene family (Figure 5), ranging from the most abundant beta-hexosaminidase (K12373, ave. 0.3% sd. 0.1%) to the low-abundance outlier L-iduronidase (K01217, ave. 2\u00b710\u22125% sd. 3\u00b710\u22127%). Given this ubiquity, it should be noted that GAGs possess wide-ranging activities including anti-cancer [49] and antimicrobial [50] properties; the abundance of degrading enzymes in the gut of any particular individual thus has the potential to affect the efficacy of GAG drugs [41], [51]. The specificity and prevalence of these four modules in the gut microbiota provides one example of HUMAnN's ability to identify community metabolism across hundreds of samples and link it to individual microbial gene families.",

Enriched functions included phosphate, glutamate/aspartate, and phosphotransferase transport systems (M00222, M00230, M00276, M00277, M00287); other functions such as arginine and amino acid transport (M00229, M00237) were significantly depleted. The posterior fornix community's metabolic pattern was perhaps the most distinct of the habitats examined here, in agreement with the high degree of biochemical specialization (and thus intercellular transport) observed in the low-diversity vaginal community [7]. Perhaps most interestingly, the misleadingly labeled \u201cnitrogen fixation\u201d module (M00175) was overabundant in the posterior fornix, as well as in buccal mucosa and stool. This module can be driven by any one of four gene families: K00531, K02588, K00536, or the complex K02586+K02591. The low number of genes involved would render its detection prone to noise; however, as described below, this module is detected very consistently only in women with vaginal pH\u22654.0, and then only due to either K00536 (Enzyme Class EC 1.19.6.1, nitrogenase - flavodoxin) or, in a minority of cases, K02588 (EC 1.18.6.1, nitrogenase). These two gene families were mutually exclusive when detected, and the most common family K00536 is only included in the current reference genomes for Bacillus cereus, B. thuringiensis, and the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, none of which were detected in any vaginal samples [9]. While it seems unlikely that these enzymes are contributing to canonical nitrogen fixation per se, flavodoxin has been observed to be involved in the catalysis of nitric oxide production in the gut microbiota [52], [53], and disrupted amine production in conjunction with elevated vaginal pH is a standard symptom of bacterial vaginosis [7]. In combination with the vaginal pH-associated modules below, this provides one example of microbial functionality linked to host phenotype that could not be recovered based on reference genomes, community structure, or phylometagenomic assays alone.",

Taxonomic profiles detailing the abundances of microorganisms in these communities were available from the HMP's 16S rRNA gene surveys [9], from mapping of metagenomic sequences to reference genomes [24], and from previous studies of the vaginal flora [7]. Specifically, Ravel et al [7] showed the presence of five microbiome types among the vaginal communities of reproductive age women, with four clusters dominated by different Lactobacillus species and one with low levels of all lactobacilli. Communities dominated by L. crispatus corresponded to lower pH (<4), which was also the case in the HMP posterior fornix data [1]. We observed a very tight co-clustering of the metabolic repertoires of these communities with the abundances of these five groups' characteristic species (Supplemental Figure S5), suggesting that in this specialized microbial niche, there is a particularly close association of community structure and function. To expand on this, we performed a comprehensive test of all 232 modules against the HMP's clinical metadata (phs000228.v3.p1 [54]) to uncover associations between microbial metabolic profiles and host phenotype. Available metadata included gender, age, BMI, geographical location, and others, as well as the pH of the posterior fornix and vaginal introitus in women. The latter were again strongly linked not only to community structure, but also with the abundances of several metabolic modules. Specifically, pH correlated with the abundances of N-acetylgalactosamine II phosphotransferase (M00277), proline biosynthesis (M00015), and again \u201cnitrogen fixation\u201d (M00175), while phosphate transport (M00222), peptide/nickel transport (M00239), and lysine biosynthesis (M00016) were associated with lower pH. Species within the Lactobacilli are known to specialize in exactly these areas of nutrient uptake and carbohydrate metabolism [55], [56], and many of these differences can be observed directly within finished genomes (e.g. lysine biosynthesis is present in L. crispatus and lacking in L. gasseri\n[26]). It is currently near-impossible to obtain complete genomes for all organisms in complex communities, however, again emphasizing the utility of metagenomic functional reconstruction for direct association of community function with habitat and host phenotype.",

Of all phenotypic associations with metabolic modules tested in the HMP stool microbiomes, only two reached significance (Spearman FDR q<0.1), links between diastolic blood pressure and nickel transport (M00246) and between pulse rate and methionine degradation (M00035). Although these are within the range of false positives expected at this level of stringency, recent observations of the gut microbiota in atherosclerosis [57] have also detected borderline significant shifts in organismal composition. Among other body sites, the only additional associations were correlations with BMI among the skin community: lysine biosynthesis (M00016) and sulfate transport (M00185). Although the retroauricular crease represents our smallest sample size (n\u200a=\u200a26), these were significantly stronger (p<10\u22124) than any metabolic association with BMI in the stool community (n\u200a=\u200a126, lowest p<10\u22123), with the metagenomic abundance of lysine biosynthesis consistently increasing and that of sulfate transport decreasing at greater BMI. Additional associations beyond this false discovery rate are included in Supplemental Table S1 and include several modules detected only at higher read counts, emphasizing the need for sufficient sequencing coverage when rare metabolic functions (as opposed to abundant taxa) are of interest. As has been shown for genotype [58] and gene expression [59] data, phenotype can be difficult to reproducibly associate with high-dimensional genomic or metagenomic features, particularly in large cohorts with complex population structure or when using multivariate models [60]. It is also critical to note that the HMP population was strictly screened for disease-free individuals [9], increasing phenotypic homogeneity and precluding the detection of microbial function perturbed in dysbioses. Further studies targeted to specific phenotypes and microbial communities of interest will be necessary to better understand the relationship between human microbiome membership, metabolism, and host phenotype.",

They contain an average of only \u223c10 genes and are structured to include both \u201cand\u201d relationships (multiple gene products that must function together in a complex or sequential pathway) and \u201cor\u201d relationships (alternative enzymes that can catalyze the same reaction). However, KEGG and other functional catalogs also define large pathways with up to several hundred genes that lack the complex combinations of relationships used to define small modules. HUMAnN can additionally recover coverages and abundances for any such pathways represented by unstructured sets of gene family identifiers. To this end, we analyzed 297 KEGG pathways present in the seven HMP body sites, containing 52 sd. 48 genes on average. While HUMAnN successfully recovered coverage and abundance information for these larger pathways in the HMP data (Supplemental Tables S8\u20139), we often found them to be too broadly defined for adequate analysis of mixed microbial communities, arguing for a focus on smaller functional modules, biosynthetic clusters [61], and orthologous gene families.",

Of the remaining 107 pathways, 96 (90%) had a coefficient of variation below one, indicating variation in coverage lower than their mean across all samples. In other words, only small portions of most KEGG pathways are present in the human microbiome. Those pathways that were consistently present tended to be so broadly defined (e.g. ko02060, phosphotransferases, or ko00030, the entirety of pentose phosphate) that they provided too coarse a view with which to observe metabolic variation and niche specialization among body sites. Nevertheless, applying the same significance criteria as described above, 196 pathways (66%) were differentially abundant in at least one body site using LEfSe.

The pathways with the lowest coefficient of variation across all samples in our data represented surprisingly diverse biochemistry, including terpenoid biosynthesis (ko00900), RNA degradation (ko03018), pyruvate metabolism (ko00620), and one-carbon metabolism (ko00670). These pathways were all present at an average of at least 0.5% relative abundance over all samples, with average coverages from 41% (of 75 genes in ko03018) to 77% (of 73 genes in ko00620). Each of these pathways followed a very characteristic pattern: their overall pathway abundance remained near-constant across body site niches, while the modules implementing each pathway varied significantly. Terpenoid biosynthesis, for example, can be performed either by the mevalonate (module M00095) or by the non-mevalonate (M00096) module; both were present in the oropharynx and skin, only the former was present in the posterior fornix, and only the latter in the gut (Supplemental Table S5). Likewise, pyruvate metabolism includes portions of the citric acid cycle (M00173), absent from the posterior fornix and rare in the gut and skin; pyruvate oxidation (M00307), absent from the posterior fornix and rare in the gut; and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (M00310), present only in the nares and gut. This trend complements the relationship between organismal and functional diversity described above and by the HMP overall [1], in which the communities at each body site of the human microbiome vary extensively, but the pathways needed for microbial life within these niches remain relatively stable. However, this result shows that the specific metabolic modules implementing stable, broad pathways tend to be specialized within each body site's microbial environment.",

These include, for example, glutamate metabolism in the gut (ko00250), which has been previously observed to be enriched in the stool microbiota [62]. Here, it showed low inter-individual variability in the gut, although as above, its product glutamate serves as input for several modules that were themselves highly variable among subjects. Among others, these included proline biosynthesis (M00015); glutathione biosynthesis (M00118); glutathione transport (M00348); and portions of the TCA cycle (M00009\u2013M00011 and M00311). We determined individual carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZy) gene families correlated with these modules by comparing them with CAZy abundances derived independently from the HMP metagenomic data [21]. Intriguingly, each of these modules in the gut correlated significantly (Spearman FDR q<0.05) with multiple CAZy families, almost none of which included enzymes within the modules themselves (Supplemental Table S10). In particular, six CAZy-module pairs had significant positive or negative correlations in all seven body sites: proline biosynthesis with GH5 (cellulase) and GH18 (chitinase); 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase with GH28 (galacturonases) and GH97 (\u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-galactosidase); and glutathione transport with GH3 (\u03b2-glucosidase) and GH18.",

Finally, these module-specific changes in abundance almost always (99% of all modules) correlated with one or more individual CAZy gene families detected within the same metagenome independently of the pathway's constituent genes. Together, these data suggest that while the basics of microbial metabolism remain stable among human microbiome body sites and individuals, the modules and enzymes operating as specific metabolic producers and consumers within pathways vary among environments and subjects to adapt to changing nutrient and metabolite availabilities [10].",

Here, we have described the development of the HUMAnN methodology for high-throughput metagenomic functional reconstruction and its application to 649 communities from 7 body habitats sequenced as part of the HMP. Validation of HUMAnN's accuracy using four additional synthetic communities of increasing complexity demonstrated its ability to quantify both pathway presence and relative abundance, with correlations to true abundances >0.9. When analyzing the human microbiome, relatively few modules were specifically present or absent in any one body habitat, but over two thirds varied in abundance by habitat and 24 were core to all hosts and habitats. Less variation was evident among hosts, although we demonstrated one example in which nutrient transport and mechanisms of central carbon metabolism were strongly associated with vaginal pH. HUMAnN's functional reconstructions include the abundances of large, general pathways, smaller and more specific metabolic modules, and individual orthologous gene families; each data type proved to show distinct patterns of variation among body sites and to provide a different perspective on underlying microbial community function.",

                    "text": "Characterization of microbial communities by large-scale shotgun metagenomic sequencing is a relatively recent advance, and computational methods for assessing these data in terms of biological function are under active development. Several previous studies have analyzed individual reads or assembled contigs using direct annotation by BLAST to orthologous gene families [5], [11] or to proxy genes [63]. Other computational pipelines such as MG-RAST [14] and MEGAN [15] do include full pathway reconstruction, generally using approaches that rely on the single best BLAST hit for each metagenomic read. Here, HUMAnN scaled easily to provide module and pathway reconstructions for >3.5 Tbp of HMP metagenomic data by avoiding metagenomic assembly and employing an accelerated translated BLAST implementation, requiring a total of approximately 13,000 CPU-hours for sequence search and 175 for metabolic reconstruction (750 and 55K sequences/second, respectively). HUMAnN is not dependent on any particular BLAST implementation, however, and provides default support for NCBI BLAST, MBLASTX as employed here, MAPX (Real Time Genomics, San Francisco, CA), and USEARCH [27]. In each case, the approximations used to accelerate search against a functionally characterized orthologous sequence database are mitigated by considering all read-to-sequence hits in a weighted manner. This leaves overall gene family abundance recovery essentially unchanged while improving full module/pathway recovery, as ambiguous BLAST hits can be resolved later in the reconstruction process when more information is available (Supplemental Figure S2). Further, each of HUMAnN's processing modules incorporates one or more types of additional knowledge, e.g. pathway parsimony by means of MinPath [22] and subsequent automatic taxonomic limitation based on BLAST organismal abundance profiles. These steps are not guaranteed to be optimal in all situations - taxonomic limitation, for example, might degrade performance in environments rich in novel or rapidly evolving organisms - but they are heuristics designed to improve reconstruction in most cases. They thus generally take advantage of the compositional information that can be leveraged when combining multiple gene family sequences into a single module or pathway, decreasing the noise potentially arising from examining single best BLAST hits.",

The abundances of gene families and pathways inferred by the system describe only the enzymes encoded by one or more microbial genomes, and their relationship to realized transcriptional or protein activity may not be straightforward in the absence of additional metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic, or metametabolomic data [64]. However, these metagenomic gene family and module abundances are appropriate as inputs into more sophisticated metabolic network and systems biology models, which have recently begun to incorporate features such as predicted compartmentalization, small molecule transport, and multi-organism interactions in microbial communities [65], [66]. HUMAnN as described here was designed to infer a permissive superset of community function that does not yet include realized transcriptional activity or organismal compartmentalization, and we hope to incorporate these features during future work. It should be emphasized that HUMAnN as currently implemented is appropriate for analysis of metatranscriptomic data from short sequence reads as well, from which it will reconstruct the abundance of actively transcribed gene families or pathways within a microbiome.",

Such measures are typically applied instead to organismal abundances, where \u03b1-diversity summarizes complexity and types of different organisms within a community and \u03b2-diversity the similarities (or differences) between multiple communities' structures [34]. Such organismal diversity measures have been very successful in describing properties of the human microbiome in large populations, such as the greater similarity of children's and parents' microbiomes [5] or reduced microbial diversity in conditions such as Crohn's disease [67]. Conversely, ecological functional diversity has been developed primarily in macroecology, specifically as applied to phenotypic traits [35], [68]. To our knowledge, however, this represents the first application of \u03b1-diversity measures to molecular function within microbial communities and specifically to the human microbiome. The HMP consortium has contrasted the functional diversities reported above with comparable organismal diversity measures at the genus, species, and strain levels throughout the human microbiome [1]. Their results suggest that functional diversity is lower than phylogenetic diversity both within and between communities throughout the human microbiome; that is, the microbes within this human population vary more than do the biological processes carried by their metagenomes. It must be noted that this conclusion speaks so far only to the disease-free HMP population, however, and only to the subset of characterized orthologous gene families currently analyzable by HUMAnN. Further variability in the functional potential of the microbiota may certainly remain to be found in its substantial carriage of uncharacterized gene families (estimated as high as 80% [11]) and during disruptions of host health.",

In other analyses by the HMP, additional protein databases including MetaCyc [28], CAZy [21], virulence related proteins [69], and antibiotic resistance genes [70] were all processed using HUMAnN. MetaCyc, for example, includes both characterized sequences and metabolic modules, for which HUMAnN reconstructed coverages and abundances; other databases included no explicit pathway groupings, and gene families were used directly to examine differential abundance. While these smaller databases are less appropriate for quantitative evaluations or broad metabolic reconstruction, they can be used with HUMAnN to provide focused coverage of specific biological areas. As detailed above, in addition to its primary abundance and coverage outputs, HUMAnN by default calculates a number of basic ecological summary statistics as applied to community functional profiles; it also produces detailed gene-level outputs for each community that can be directly imported into the JCVI Metagenomics Reports (METAREP) [71] software. All components in the pipeline, including taxonomic limitation, are entirely data-driven; the methodology can therefore be used for functional reconstruction on any genomic data from microbial or eukaryotic organisms, although in a single-organism setting, there are not clear benefits over standard genome annotation pipelines. However, individual modules (such as gap filling or the inclusion of multiple BLAST hits) can be manually activated or deactivated by the user for particular datasets. Importantly for microbial communities, HUMAnN can also be used on other data types, including metaproteomic or metatranscriptomic sequences; we anticipate HUMAnN being useful in the reconstruction of pathway activities in transcriptomic sequences from different environmental communities, for example.",

It was designed to complement taxonomic classifications of community structure, and integration of community function with membership is an area of further ongoing work [15]. Particularly in the human microbiome, full genome sequences are available for many reference strains isolated from multiple body sites, which has already allowed community membership to be analyzed simultaneously in metagenomic and 16S taxonomic marker sequences [1], [24]. By combining membership with functional reconstruction, specialized processes in specific habitats or hosts, for example, can be correlated with the organisms providing or dependent on these aspects of community function. While the general applicability of Beijerinck's 1913 hypothesis [72] that, \u201cEverything is everywhere, and the environment selects,\u201d is still unclear, we speculate that it may prove to be more broadly accurate for microbial function than for microbial organisms. That is, there may be a moderately stable pool of core microbial pathways, present in all communities but implemented by different organisms and gene families, with relative abundance (and activity) determined by the local selective pressures of each microbial habitat. This appears to be at least somewhat the case in the human microbiome, and further investigation will determine whether this pattern holds for the functional profiles of broader classes of microbial communities.",
