We used rolling circle amplification (RCA) and Ion Proton sequencing to investigate the vaginal microbiome of 20 HIV positive women from South Africa. A total of 46 different human papillomavirus (HPV) types were found, many of which are not detected by existing genotyping assays. Moreover, the complete genomes of two novel HPV types were determined. Abundance of HPV infections was highly correlated with real-time PCR estimates, indicating that the RCA-Proton method can be used for quantification of individual pathogens. We also identified a large number of other viral, bacterial and parasitic co-infections and the spectrum of these co-infections varied widely between individuals. Our method provides rapid detection of a broad range of pathogens and the ability to reconstruct complete genomes of novel infectious agents.",

The throughput of MPS makes it possible to study also highly complex human microbiota, such as that of the vaginal environment. The complexity of the vaginal environment is due both to the hormonal cycles, and resulting changes of the mucosa, and the multitude of sexually transmitted pathogens. Infections that compromise immune system function, such as with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have a strong effect on the vaginal microbiota. HIV infection increases the risk for opportunistic infections by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites and the development of several types of cancers (Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, cervical cancer) and recurring respiratory tract infections. Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment can restore the CD4+ count, but HIV infected individuals still have an increased risk of acquiring secondary infections. For patients with a reduction of immune system function, information on the viral, bacterial and parasitic co-infections may be critical for proper clinical management and choice of therapy.",

The sequence coverage of HPV types varied by a factor of 105. This may indicate large differences in HPV titer between types. Across the 20 samples the most highly abundant type was HPV 58, followed by a number of other high-risk HPVs (Supplementary Figure S2). Extensive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation was found within an HPV type between samples, consistent with the presence of different sequence variants. A cluster analysis performed for each HPV type resulted in the identification of multiple sequence variants for many of the HPVs (Figure 1A). For example, for HPV 58, which was detected in 12 of the 20 women, the cluster analysis revealed two distinct groups of HPV 58, that can be distinguished from the aligned sequences (Figure 1B, C). This extensive sequence variation within HPV types is not detected by conventional genotyping assays and might be of clinical importance.",

For the remaining 51% (114 observations), 61 were HPV types not included in the genotyping assays and 53 were missed because of other reasons, such as SNP/indel variation within the PCR primer sequences used for genotyping. To determine if the RCA-Proton sequence coverage reflected the abundance of an HPV type, we compared the sequence coverage with the data from the HPVIR real-time PCR. The sequence coverage was highly correlated with both total viral amount (HPV copy number, R2 = 0.79) and viral titer (HPV copy number per cellular equivalent, R2 = 0.73) (Figure 2). Thus, the RCA-Proton sequence coverage reliably estimates abundance of individual HPV types, even when a sample contains multiple HPV types.",

One of the women (S18) was infected with both of these novel HPVs. Additionally, HPV Y was detected in S3 and HPV X was found at low levels in S12. In order for a previously unknown HPV type to be classified as novel, the L1 gene sequence should show at most 90% similarity to any previous described type in the database12. A cluster analysis based on the L1 gene sequence showed that both HPV X and Y were most closely related to HPV 101, 103 and 108 in the HPV-gamma group (Figure 3B).

Among additional viruses detected were Torque teno and SEN virus, found in multiple samples, and the JC virus present only in one individual (Figure 4A). Short reference sequences from bacteria or parasites were analyzed separately and within this category a large variation was found between women with some species detected in multiple samples (e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Bacteroides fragilis) and others occurring in only a single sample (e.g. Trichomonas vaginalis and Salmonella enterica) (Figure 4B). We further identified sequences originating from large circular bacterial genomes of lengths 1\u2005Mb or more, and within this category we identified a broad range of infections with Gardnerella vaginalis being the most abundant (Figure 4C). As seen in supplementary Figure S3, there is a high and uniform sequence read coverage across the reference sequences for several infectious agents.

These reads did not match any of the infections analyzed above and therefore they may represent additional infectious agents for which the DNA sequences are still unknown. In six of the samples, we were able to assemble a total of 62 long contigs (of lengths 4\u2005kb to over 25\u2005kb) with no nucleotide sequence similarity to any known organism (data not shown). However, all of the assembled contigs contained a large number of open reading frames (ORFs) suggesting that they originate from DNA molecules densely packed with protein coding genes (see Figure 4E). By a protein similarity search within the ORFs we could conclude that all six samples contained sequences showing resemblance to protein-coding regions from various bacterial species (Supplementary Table S4), with Clostridium being the most common match among the women. Sample S16 showed the highest abundance of unknown bacterial sequences. The majority of contigs in S16 contained ORFs that showed resemblance to Clostridium, while others were assigned to other species including Veillonella, Lactobacillus and many more. This demonstrates that S16 carries an infection of a bacteria with a presently undescribed genome. However, it remains unclear whether all the sequences in S16 comes from one single infection, or if there are in fact multiple infections of uncharacterized bacteria in the sample. In conclusion, our results show that the RCA-Proton method can be used not only for the analysis of known viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, but also for the genome assembly and initial classification of previously uncharacterized infectious organisms.",

The prevalence of HPV is known to be substantially higher in HIV infected individuals13, but previous studies have been limited to the range of HPV types included in the genotyping assays. Our study provides an estimate of the full range of infecting HPV types, and the results shows the presence of over 40 HPV types in these women, with a single woman carrying as many as 21 HPV types. In a previous MPS study we examined a single HIV positive woman, and similarly detected multiple HPV types, some not included in the genotyping assays6. Our finding of two novel HPV types based on the analysis of only 20 individuals implies that multiple HPV types likely remain to be discovered and may contribute to tumor development. The oncogenic potential of many HPV types not included in the genotyping assays is presently unknown, but since HIV positive women have a less efficient immune response to co-infections such as HPV, they may also be less able to handle the transformation process initiated by otherwise less oncogenic HPV types. HPV types classified as low risk in otherwise healthy women may therefore contribute to tumor development when the immune system is not functioning properly.",

Among the bacterial infections are human pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitides and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Enterobacter agglomerans is an opportunistic pathogen and cause wound, blood, and urinary tract infections in immunosuppressed individuals, and Bacteroides fragilis is involved in 90% of anaerobic peritoneal infections. Streptococcus agalactiae is found in the gastrointestinal flora of humans and if transferred to a neonate can cause serious streptococcal infection (bacterial septicemia of the newborn). Gardnerella vaginalis can cause bacterial vaginosis in some women. We also identified the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, which is a flagellated protozoan causing trichomoniasis.",

In several samples it was possible to reconstruct large pieces of DNA that did not match any known reference sequence. The analyses of protein-coding domains revealed that many of these sequences represent additional, previously uncharacterized, bacterial infections. The most common infection showed 50\u201375% amino acid similarity to Clostridium, a genus of Gram-positive bacteria that include species of common free-living bacteria as well as important pathogens. It should be noted there are many uncertainties in the prediction of the closest related organism for these unknown DNA sequences, and these results should be seen as a preliminary rather than a final classification. Although further bioinformatics and biomedical analyses are required to confirm the genomic origins of these sequences and elucidate the role of these previously unknown infections in human disease, our results shows that the RCA-Proton method can be used as a first step in identifying novel pathogens.",

One of the main limiting factors is that RCA requires deeper sequencing as compared to 16S rRNA sequencing for metagenomic sequencing of bacterial communities. This is because the RCA method amplifies larger parts of genomes instead of just a single amplicon, and thus requires more reads to identify the bacterial species present in a sample. Moreover, the RCA reaction generates a relatively high proportion of reads originating from the host genome, thereby increasing the need for deep sequencing even further. When it comes to analyses of HPVs, the RCA method is not suitable for studying HPV integration into the human genome. Since small circular genomes are preferentially amplified in the RCA reaction the integrated HPVs will typically not be sequenced at high coverage.",

Since many bacteria and viruses are difficult or impossible to isolate and grow in aerobic conditions or outside their host or community, in vitro genetic screening is the most powerful approach to assess the microbiota. For MPS to be suitable for such analyses it has to be economically feasible to use. By barcoding of samples prior to Ion Proton sequencing, the price tag per sample can be reduced substantially. Further increases of the sequence throughput, such as that predicted for the Ion Proton chip PII, and the use of a higher number of barcodes, would make it possible to analyze as many as 100 samples in a single run, dramatically reducing the cost per sample. The run time on the Ion Proton instrument is only a few hours, and it is therefore possible to complete the process from sample preparation to generation of medically actionable data, in a few days. In summary, application of the latest MPS technology, such as the RCA-Proton method employed here, is likely to reveal a number of known and novel co-infections occurring in many infectious diseases. The pattern of co-infections in the present study varied dramatically between women, with a unique spectrum of viral, bacterial and parasitic co-infections present in each sample. Further studies of the co-infection profile will be important in order to determine their importance for proper clinical management of individual patients.",

Similarly, as a threshold for inclusion in the study a copy number of 10 genomic equivalents were used. HPV copies per cell (titer) were calculated by dividing HPV copies per sample by copies of HMBS.",

The mapping was performed with the TMAP alignment plug-in in Torrent Suite v3.4.2. Reads not mapping to any known HPV type or the human reference genome were extracted and used for de novo assembly using Newbler v2.6. Among the assembled sequence contigs, we screened for novel HPV genomes by applying two filtering criteria: i) a contig length close to those of known HPV-types, i.e. between 7000 and 9000\u2005bp and ii) a blastx search should identify the HPV proteins L1, L2, E1 and E2. Novel HPV genomes detected using this approach were added to the references sequence after which the process was repeated until no additional HPV types were detected.

Only those HPV types detected in samples with sufficiently high read depth were used for this analysis (90% of the bases were required to have \u226510\u00d7 coverage). For each HPV type and sample satisfying the coverage criteria, all homozygous SNP calls were extracted. A distance matrix was computed for each HPV type based on the number of SNP differences between samples infected by the same HPV. The distance matrixes were used as a basis for a clustering analysis (using custom R scripts) to obtain number of distinct variants for each HPV. A distance of at least 30 SNPs was required for two HPVs belonging to the same type to be classed as different sequence variants.",
