An understudied aspect of vaginal health in women who experience dryness due to atrophy is the role of the resident microbes. It is known that the microbiota has an important role in healthy vaginal homeostasis, including maintaining the pH balance and excluding pathogens. The objectives of this study were twofold: first to identify the microbiome of post-menopausal women with and without vaginal dryness and symptoms of atrophy; and secondly to examine any differences in epithelial gene expression associated with atrophy. The vaginal microbiome of 32 post-menopausal women was profiled using Illumina sequencing of the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Sixteen subjects were selected for follow-up sampling every two weeks for 10 weeks. In addition, 10 epithelial RNA samples (6 healthy and 4 experiencing vaginal dryness) were acquired for gene expression analysis by Affymetrix Human Gene array. The microbiota abundance profiles were relatively stable over 10 weeks compared to previously published data on premenopausal women. There was an inverse correlation between Lactobacillus ratio and dryness and an increased bacterial diversity in women experiencing moderate to severe vaginal dryness. In healthy participants, Lactobacillus iners and L. crispatus were generally the most abundant, countering the long-held view that lactobacilli are absent or depleted in menopause. Vaginal dryness and atrophy were associated with down-regulation of human genes involved in maintenance of epithelial structure and barrier function, while those associated with inflammation were up-regulated consistent with the adverse clinical presentation.",

Collectively these symptoms affect 25\u201350% post-menopausal women [2], [3] and significantly impact their quality of life. Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is somewhat of a catchment term for these symptoms and is diagnosed by an assessment of vaginal dryness, irritation, soreness, and dyspareunia with urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence, and the presence of pale and dry vulvovaginal mucosa with petechiae, along with pH>4.6 [4]. Though the use of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) can rapidly reverse some of these changes [5], a large proportion of women are hesitant to use estrogens, even when applied topically [3]. Interestingly, a proportion of women appear to remain symptom free, long after the onset of menopause.",

However, there were much lower abundances (<1%) of Mobiluncus, Staphylococcus, Sneathia, Bifidobacterium, and Gemella in our study set of post-menopausal women. This could be due to our smaller sample size rather than micro-environmental changes associated with menopause, and so the physiological significance is not known. As more information emerges about the different organisms in the microbiota, the types of clones and virulence properties of them, for example differences in expression of various toxins and mucus-degrading enzymes by G. vaginalis\n[15], the better will be our understanding of which strains equate to health versus disease.",

                    "text": "Vaginal dryness, a condition that is associated with significant changes in the transcription of genes associated with cellular structure and immune function, as shown here by the human microarray data, is a symptom of atrophy which afflicts large numbers of menopausal women and has been linked with depletion of estrogen [16]. The muscular layer of the vaginal wall tends to be thicker in postmenopausal than premenopausal women, while the epithelial layer is much thinner [17]. Having developed a method to use Affymetrix arrays to read epithelial cell gene expression changes in the vagina [18], we applied this here and found down-regulation of genes involved in maintaining proliferation and barrier function of the vaginal epithelium in the dryness group. Without a cornified envelope, epithelial cells are much more sensitive to drying, chemical agents and microbial infection [19]. Many of the genes in this group encode structural components of the cornified envelope, so lowered expression in the dryness group implies reduced structural integrity of the tissue. This is mirrored in the down-regulation of adhesion molecules such as SBSN and DSG1, implicated in maintaining proper epithelial barrier function [20], [21]. Similarly, ALOX 12 (\u221219.61-fold) has also been shown to be a positive regulator of epidermal barrier function [22], and keratin is an important structural molecule in the epidermis imparting mechanical stability to the tissue [23].",

Matrilysin-1 protein (MMP) 7 opposes the SPINK family proteins, and its up-regulation by 13.75-fold and cleaves ECM components and up-regulate inflammation [25]. Thus, it is possible that the combination of increased ECM degradation with decreased inhibition of protease inhibitors contributes to vaginal thinning.",

Since dryness is accompanied by inflammation, this suggests that the up-regulation of the regulatory molecules (CFH and CFI), although perhaps capable of protecting host cells, are not sufficient to dampen the inflammatory response. This potential for dysregulation of the complement system in vaginal dryness warrants further study. The transition from a lactobacilli dominated microbiota to one dominated by Gram negative anaerobes, Atopobium and Gram positive cocci could play a role in the inflammatory process, but further studies would be needed to prove the correlation in this environment rich in immune mediators [26].",

The SLC44A4 gene product is a sodium-dependent transmembrane transport protein involved in the uptake of choline in neurons, which is used in neurons in the production of acetylcholine, which is one of the main neurotransmitters of the parasympathic nervous system [27]. As the vaginal epithelium is rich in nerve endings and these can increase in density with reduced estrogen, it is possible that increased activity of this transporter may contribute to the sensation of pain through cholinergic nerve endings. The PLAT gene product is a serine protease which converts plasminogen to plasmin, and functions in cell migration and tissue remodeling as well as reducing blood clotting. Up-regulation of this gene may play a role in the increased bleeding and tissue sensitivity associated with vaginal dryness.",

The representative OTU sequences occurring with at least 1% abundance in any one sample have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers JF262791-JF262909. OTU taxonomic assignments are presented in Table S1.",
