A single species often dominates the vaginal microbiome, which has implications for vaginal health. For example, Lactobacillus species are often a majority among bacteria; they consume glycogen from the epithelium and produce lactic acid, thereby lowering the pH of the vagina and preventing colonization by pathogens. Among lactobacilli, Lactobacillus iners is considered among the least protective in part because it is associated with a higher pH and can co-occur with BV-associated bacteria.[10,11] Species such as Gardnerella vaginalis,[12\u201315] Sneathia amnii,[16,17] BVAB1,[18] and other non-lactobacilli are associated with dysbiosis. BV is generally characterized by low levels of Lactobacillus spp. and/or an increase in Gram-negative anaerobes. BV is highly recurrent, with recurrence occurring in up to 60% of subjects within one year. Moreover, up to 84% of women may have a shift in vaginal microbiota associated with BV without clinical symptoms.[19] Given the polymicrobial nature of BV infection, we investigate if changes in vaginal microbial composition over time may be used to predict BV infection or recurrence by indicating upcoming shifts to high-risk states. Changes in the microbial community composition may be precursors to changes in health, and may provide more etiologic information regarding prognosis.",

Rather than assessing which CST method is best at reflecting clinical data, we first demonstrate that detecting major shifts in the microbiome as indicated by CST transitions is largely independent of the CST definition method. We then evaluate whether there is a similarity across datasets in patterns that are suggestive of mechanisms for shifts in microbial flora, and whether CSTs can be used as a tool to discover mechanisms involved in such shifts. Specifically, we analyze the time scales of CST transitions, the expected persistence of a particular CST, the frequency of transitions between CSTs, the relationship of CST with changes in Nugent score and pH, the ability to predict CST transitions, and the bacteria that may be harbingers of CST transitions. Our findings demonstrate that vaginal CSTs are predictive of changes in the future bacterial environment.",

When data were normalized using DESeq2, a pseudo-count of 1 was added to the number of bacterial reads for each taxon. The method based on the predominant taxon assigns a CST to a sample based on the taxon for which the most reads were observed, provided that it comprises at least 30% of the sample; otherwise, no CST is assigned.[1] BCV measures dissimilarity while accounting for overdispersion.[49]",

Dissimilarities are normalized by subject by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The mean and standard deviation for five-day bins are plotted. If CST transitions occurred gradually, we would expect the average distance and the standard deviation to decrease as the day of a change approaches, indicating that samples make consistent movements towards the profile assigned to the new CST. In the figure we see that while there may be a slight trend to decreasing distance to the new CST over the 10\u201320\u00a0days preceding a transition, the variance in distance actually increases as a CST change approaches. Similar results are seen for the ravel dataset (Supplemental File 4). These results suggest that CST changes can reflect either abrupt shifts in microbiome profiles over less than a week or that they can reflect gradual changes, but not one or the other exclusively.\n",

The weekly transition probabilities are between 0.15 (0.11,0.21) and 0.33 (0.26,0.38) for these CSTs. For the gajer dataset, the highest transition probabilities were for transitions to CST 3 (up to 0.21 (0.12,0.36)), characterized by L. iners, and from CST 3 and CST 4-A to high-risk CST 4-B (0.12 (0.080,0.17) and 0.16 (0.083,0.30)), characterized by A. vaginae. For the chaban dataset, the highest transition probabilities were for transitions to CST 3 (up to 0.35 (0.09,0.76)) and from CST 3 to low-risk CST 1 (0.21 (0.067,0.46)), characterized by L. crispatus. Across the three datasets, the transition probabilities to CST 3 were lowest for low-risk CSTs 2, 5, and 1 which are characterized by L. gasseri, L. jensenii, and L. crispatus, respectively (Supplemental File 4).",

DBNs naturally deal with missing data, using exact inference for small topologies, and a variety of approximate methods for large topologies. In our analysis, we used the structured proportional jump process (SCUP) [53] modeling framework which combines ideas from the fields of proportional hazard models [54] and continuous-time DBNs and allows for efficient modeling of non-homogeneous multi-component processes.",

Nugent scores, currently the diagnostic gold standard for BV,[55,56] are calculated using Gram staining of a clinical sample.

Diagnosis of BV in samples with intermediate (4\u20136) levels of Lactobacillus spp. requires the presence of clue cells.[55] To improve numerical stability, we normalized continuous features to have zero mean and standard deviation of one.

Taxa/OTUs found in at least five samples were included. To maximize power to detect differences in abundances by exploiting correlations in outcomes of related taxa, we employed a two-stage hidden Markov model (HMM) as proposed by Sun and Cai [59] to obtain z-statistics for differences in abundance. For finite sample sizes, z-statistics can demonstrate skew, even under the null,[60] and so we first computed highly accurate p-values for the relationship between abundance and CST transitions by performing 1 million permutations for each feature. One tailed p-values were then converted to z-statistics using the inverse quantile normal transformation, and then used for the HMM group-level FDR procedure as implemented in R.[61]",

A likely explanation for this relationship is that higher Nugent scores are possible even when Lactobacillus spp. are present, but the sample is dominated by a species not considered when determining the Nugent score, such as GBS. Since Nugent scores are determined only by counting amounts of Lactobacillus spp., Garddnerella/Bacteroides, and other curved Gram-negative rods (i.e. bacilli), a sample dominated by bacteria of other morphology (e.g. cocci or vibrio) will be in CST 4-A. Over time, the Nugent score would detect changes in bacilli measured by the test, but would not capture variability or stability of species that are not bacilli and might contribute to BV pathology.",
