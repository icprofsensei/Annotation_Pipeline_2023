Vaginal, cervical, Fallopian, ovarian, peritoneal, and urine samples were collected aseptically both in the operating room and the pathology laboratory. DNA extraction was followed by amplification and high-throughput next generation sequencing (MiSeq) of the 16S rDNA V3-V5 region to identify the microbiota present. Microbiota data were summarized using both \u03b1-diversity to reflect species richness and evenness within bacterial populations and \u03b2-diversity to reflect the shared diversity between bacterial populations. Statistical significance was determined through the use of multiple testing, including the generalized mixed-effects model.",

Several taxa were found to be significantly enriched in samples belonging to the endometrial cancer cohort: Firmicutes (Anaerostipes, ph2, Dialister, Peptoniphilus, 1\u201368, Ruminococcus, and Anaerotruncus), Spirochaetes (Treponema), Actinobacteria (Atopobium), Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and Porphyromonas), and Proteobacteria (Arthrospira). Of particular relevance, the simultaneous presence of Atopobium vaginae and an uncultured representative of the Porphyromonas sp. (99\u00a0% match to P. somerae) were found to be associated with disease status, especially if combined with a high vaginal pH (>4.5).",

Lactic acid producing microbes have a strong role in determining the microbial community membership of the vaginal microbiome and have been shown to protect against infection [12]. Gynecologic pathogens associated with bacterial vaginosis, such as Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis have been associated with obstetric complications, such as preterm labor [13]. However, few studies have directly probed the microbes within the uterine environment and how these microbes could influence cancer within the endometrial lining. Given the inflammatory profile in endometrial cancer manifestation, we hypothesized that there is a microbiome component in the malignancy and that its signature in patients diagnosed with the disease is distinguishable from that of patients without malignancy.",

The swab and scrape samples were centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 10,000\u2009g to collect the bacterial cells and the supernatant was discarded. All genomic DNA extractions were performed by using the MoBio PowerSoil Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described by the manufacturer; however, instead of vortexing, an MP FastPrep (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) was used instead, for 60\u00a0s at 6.0\u00a0m/s, to obtain a more effective and rapid lysis of the cells. After extraction the DNA content was measured using High Sensitivity Qubit (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The V3-V5 region of the 16S rDNA was then amplified through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as follows: 25\u00a0\u03bcL of Kapa HiFi (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA), 1.5\u00a0\u03bcL (10 uM) forward primer, 1.5\u00a0\u03bcL (10 uM) reverse primer, 50\u00a0ng of DNA with the remaining volume being added by molecular grade water (up to a final volume of 50\u00a0\u03bcL per reaction). The forward primer was the universal primer 357\u00a0F (5\u2019GTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG3\u2019) with the added construct on the 5\u2019 end of the 5\u2019 Illumina Adapter (5\u2019AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC3\u2019)\u2009+\u2009Forward Primer Pad (5\u2019TATGGTAATT3\u2019) to a total sequence: 5\u2019AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTATGGTAATTGTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG3\u2019 and the universal bacterial reverse primer was 926R (5\u2019CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT3\u2019) with an added construct on the 5\u2019 end of the reverse complement of 3\u2019 Illumina adapter (5\u2019CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATGCCGCATTCGAT3\u2019)\u2009+\u2009Barcode (12 base pairs) to a total sequence: 5\u2019CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATGCCGCATTCGATXXXXXXXXXXXXCCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT3\u2019. The barcode introduced in the reverse primer construct was unique to each sample, functioning as a genetic ID for sequencing. The PCR cycle was the following: 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min, 98\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0s, 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s, 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s, cycle repeated 34 times, and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. The products of the amplification were verified by a TapeStation D1K Tape (2200 TapeStation Instrument, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to be free of contamination and to contain the expected amplification size, approximately 700 base pairs. If the amplification was unsuccessful, the parameters of the reaction or cycle were adjusted in repeated attempts. In some cases (mostly biopsy samples) the amplification was not successful even after repeated attempts. The reduced number of microorganisms present in the upper reproductive tract is likely to justify this result and attests for the success of the sterile collection of the samples. In samples that failed 16S rDNA amplification, NEBNext Microbiome DNA Enrichment Kit (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswitch, MA, USA) was used to separate the microbiome from the human DNA to increase the odds of a successful amplification from samples naturally enriched with human DNA (mostly tissue samples). Controls of both the DNA extraction and Microbiome Enrichment processes were performed and are shown in Supplement 5. Upon verification the PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). After purification the concentrations were measured using Qubit High Sensitivity. The 16S rDNA sequencing was performed by the MGF (Medical Genome facility at Mayo Clinic, Rochester) using a high-throughput next-generation Illumina MiSeq (San Diego, CA, USA) sequencing platform.",

Two \u03b1-diversity metrics, the observed OTU number and the Shannon index, were investigated. Rarefaction curves were used to compare the \u03b1-diversity measures. The observed OTU number reflects species richness, whereas the Shannon index measures both species richness and evenness. \u03b2-diversity reflects the shared diversity between bacterial communities in terms of ecological distance between samples; different distance metrics provide distinctive views of community structure. Two \u03b2-diversity measures (unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances) were calculated using the OTU table and a phylogenetic tree (\u201cGUniFrac\u201d function in the R package GUniFrac) [19]. The unweighted UniFrac reflects differences in community membership (i.e. the presence or absence of an OTU), whereas the weighted UniFrac captures this information and also differences in abundance.

We fitted an overdispersed Poisson to the counts if the zero proportion is less than 25\u00a0% and an overdispersed Binomial model (presence/absence) otherwise. For the overdispersed Poisson model, we included the log of library size as an offset to account for variable sequencing depth.

We used the winsorized data (97\u00a0% upper quantile) to reduce the potential impact of outliers upon the parameter estimates. To improve power to detect differential taxa, which show consistent change in both the uterus and lower tract microbiome, we pooled the uterus and lower tract data and included the sampling site (uterus/lower tract) as a covariate in the model.

The deep-sequencing of the V3-V5 16S rDNA region of all 238 collected samples resulted in the identification of 3545 OTUs. The endometrial microbiome was dominated by Shigella and Barnesiella, with Staphylococcus, Blautia, and Parabacteroides particularly relevant in the benign cohort and Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium more relevant in the endometrial cancer cohort (Fig.\u00a01). The uterine microbiome results are consistent with the very limited number of studies that have assessed the human microbiome composition through culture-based methods, where Escherichia, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus were found to be the predominant taxa in women with chronic endometritis and dysfunctional bleeding [21]. The very recent 16S rDNA assessment of the uterine microbiome via transcervical collection is also consistent with Bacteroides being a dominant uterine taxa [22]. In the lower genital tract (vagina and cervix), Prevotella and Lactobacillus were the dominant taxa, with Stenotrophomonas and Shigella more characteristic in the benign cohort and Porphyromonas more common in the endometrial cancer cohort (Fig.\u00a02). These results are also consistent with the pre-menopausal and post-menopausal profiles reported by others [23, 24], with the exception of Stenotrophomonas. Because our benign population is not gynecologically healthy, but instead presented with a variety of conditions (pelvic pain, abnormal bleeding, fibroids, and prolapse), it is possible that Stenotrophomonas may be more prominent in this patient population than in an asymptomatic group of participants. Although it is also possible that this could be the result of contamination, we did not find this taxon to be prominent in our controls (Additional file 1). It is therefore unlikely that this is the case. In the Fallopian tubes, Shigella and Bacteroides were the most dominant taxa, with Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Barnesiella, and Pseudomonas commonly appearing in the benign cohort (Fig.\u00a03). In the ovaries, Stenotrophomas, Xanthomonas, and Lactobacillus dominated the benign cohort, while Bacteroides dominated the endometrial cancer cohort (Fig.\u00a04). There is no current literature on the human microbiome composition of Fallopian tubes or ovaries.\n\n\n\n",

For instance, whether the vaginal microbiome of a given patient resembled the uterine microbiome of that particular patient more than the uterine microbiome of any other patient. The results showed a very significant correlation between all organs based on a distance-based permutation test (See \u201cMethods\u201d and Table\u00a02). The correlation was also significant, though to a lesser degree, for the stool samples when compared to all organs. The correlation structure held for both benign and cancer cohorts (Additional file 2). Genus level analysis revealed several genera that were significantly shared between the lower genital tract and uterus (Additional file 3). These results are indicative of an overall host specific microbiome effect (host selection effect) and/or transfer of microbiomes across the different organs (microbial movement across organs). The correlation between organs also suggests a potential gain in statistical power by a combined analysis. We thus performed both combined (uterus\u2009+\u2009lower genital tract) and separate analyses when assessing the microbiota between different disease states.\n",

Consistent with the \u03b1-diversity analysis, the difference was mainly observed in the uterus (p\u2009=\u20090.05 and 0.11 for uterus and lower genital tract, unweighted UniFrac). We next conducted pairwise comparisons using the endometrial samples. The endometrial microbiome of both endometrial cancer and hyperplasia cohorts displayed some level of difference from the benign cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.09 and 0.07, unweighted UniFrac). In contrast, the hyperplasia cohort was not distinguishable from the endometrial cancer cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.23, unweighted UniFrac) (Fig.\u00a06). Comparison of the distance between the benign and hyperplasia cohort to the distance between cancer and hyperplasia cohort reveals that hyperplasia is closer to the cancer cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.05, unweighted UniFrac, permutation test; Additional file 5). Interestingly, the distance between the benign and hyperplasia cohort is also significantly larger than that between the benign and cancer cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.05, unweighted UniFrac, Additional file 5). Because endometrial hyperplasia can be a clinical precursor to endometrial cancer, and the uterine microbiome of the four patients diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia is distinct from the benign cohort and presents some but not complete clustering with an endometrial cancer subgroup, we removed these patients from the primary analysis. This allowed us to compare the benign and endometrial cancer cohorts without the impact of the hyperplasia cases. These were later introduced in a secondary analysis.\n\n",

We first performed a combined analysis pooling the samples from both the uterus and lower genital tract. At the genus level there were 12 taxa significantly enriched in the endometrial cancer cohort (Table\u00a03 and Additional file 7, q\u2009<\u20090.10). When we further inquired at a finer level (OTU), we found eight OTUs significantly associated with endometrial cancer (Table\u00a04, q\u2009<\u20090.05). OTU 8 (Atopobium sp.) and OTU 9 (Porphyromonas sp.) became of particular relevance since they were pervasive across samples recovered from endometrial cancer patients and largely absent from the samples recovered from patients in the benign cohort. The Atopobium V3-V5 16S rDNA signature matches (100\u00a0%) that of Atopobium vaginae, a well-known vaginal pathogen [25]. The Porphyromonas signature is a close match (99\u00a0% sequence identity) to Porphyromonas somerae (Fig.\u00a07), a described pathogen recovered from soft tissue and bone infections [26]. Separate analyses of endometrial and lower genital tract samples revealed a high concordance of the identified genera from the pooled analysis, indicating that both uterine and lower genital tract microbiota may be associated with cancer diagnosis (Table\u00a03).\n\n\n",

Interestingly, the Atopobium vaginae and the Porphyromonas sp. presence/absence profile of the vaginal microbiome of these four patients more closely resembled a benign microbiome signature (Table\u00a05), while the uterine microbiome signature of two of them (H63 and H72) were closer to an endometrial cancer signature.",

The dominant taxa in the vaginal and cervical (lower tract) microbiome were Prevotella and Lactobacillus, which is consistent with current vaginal microbiome literature [23]. The dominant bacteria in the uterine microbiome were Shigella and Barnesiella, which is also consistent with the existent culture-based literature of the uterine microbial composition in women with endometritis and abnormal bleeding [21]. However, in contrast with our data, these authors reported low concordance between the vaginal and uterine bacteria. Despite the low number of patients in our study (n\u2009=\u200931), the microbiome correlation between all organs (vagina/cervix, uterus, Fallopian tubes, ovaries) was very significant, including the stool recovered from each patient. We interpret these results to indicate that there is a strong selective host effect on the microbiome and/or that there is movement or transfer of microorganisms across the different body sites. Since the samples were not collected simultaneously or in the same location or by the same personnel, we do not believe this correlation to be the result of an artifact. In addition, the stool samples were collected by the patient and processed separately, further supporting the veracity of the correlation. The microbiome organ correlations were equally significant for benign and endometrial cancer patients. Because we do not have healthy asymptomatic patients in this study we cannot assess whether this correlation is generally present or if it may be indicative of a diseased status in itself. We were unable to amplify a positive bacterial signal in about 40\u201350\u00a0% of all Fallopian and ovarian tissue biopsies collected. We conjecture that these results indicate a very low bacterial load (below detection) rather than a truly sterile environment. Further advancements in our ability to detect and amplify bacterial DNA from tissue samples should improve this success rate.",

Though cause and effect cannot be discerned from association alone, examination of the hyperplasia cases shows that although these microbes are absent from the lower tract, they are present in half the cases in the uterus, supporting an early disease role for these microbes. A. vaginae has been increasingly recognized as a prominent gynecologic and obstetric pathogen, being positively associated with Nugent scores and bacterial vaginosis [25], intrauterine infections [29], and other invasive infections of the female genital tract [30]. While we did not anticipate finding Atopobium to be associated with endometrial cancer, we provided all patients with a comprehensive questionnaire about present and past gynecologic and obstetric diseases or conditions. One question directly asked if the patient had a current or past diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Only one patient (H72), a patient with hyperplasia, declared having had bacterial vaginosis in the past (more than six months away from present time). Through verification of the medical records, which is allowed by our institutional IRB, no additional patients had a previous diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in their medical record. While bacterial vaginosis is a condition difficult to diagnose and not always medically reported, we believe we did all we could reasonably do to assess the prevalence of this disease in our study population. Given that only one patient indicated a past occurrence of bacterial vaginosis, we do not have evidence that this disease impacted our results significantly or differently among our benign and study cohort. While the specific Porphyromonas sp. has yet to be characterized in the literature, the association of members of the Porphyromonas genus with cancers has been recently verified. Porphyromonas gingivalis has been found to be an accurate biomarker for risk of death due to orodigestive cancer, independently of periodontal disease [31], and the carriage of Porphyromonas species has also been found to be associated with colorectal cancer participants [10]. Given the correlation of these two microorganisms with the disease along with their association with other pathologies, it is possible that they are involved in the etiology or aggravation of conditions leading up to the development of endometrial cancer. Based on the documented association of A. vaginae [32] with bacterial vaginosis, it is possible that this microbe causes a chronic inflammatory profile that eventually leads to local immune dysregulation and facilitates intracellular infection by Porphyromonas species. Porphyromonas species have been found intracellularly [33] and it is conceivable that the microorganism we found is capable of disrupting normal cell regulatory functions that may eventually lead to a carcinogenic trigger. The trigger could then be reinforced by the anoxic microenvironment fomented by these microorganisms. We believe this to be a hypothesis worthy of mechanistic investigation.",

While sample size is always a valid concern, based on the microbiome-based power calculation, the current sample size is powered to detect a relatively large overall effect: 90\u00a0% power for an \u03c92\u2009=\u20090.04, unweighted UniFrac, an effect size similar to that of antibiotics [34]. Even at this small sample size, we were still able to identify significant microbiome differences between disease states and identify differential abundant taxa after multiple testing correction. Though the increased power may be partially due to the inclusion of multiple replicates for each participant and the use of sophisticated statistical models to address the correlation between replicates and thus reduce the sampling error, these significant results nevertheless indicate that there is a large difference between benign and cancer states.",

The study involved slightly different methods of sampling the microbiota including variation in bacterial DNA enrichment (used to separate bacterial DNA from human DNA in tissue samples), collection type (swab versus scrape versus biopsy), and sampling position (posterior versus superior). Based on marginal PERMANOVA tests, we were able to detect significant effects of bacterial DNA enrichment method and collection type in profiling the microbiota (p\u2009<\u20090.001, unweighted UniFrac) while the sampling position was not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.28 and 0.67, unweighted and weighted UniFrac). However, these technical variables were not true confounders in this comparative study due to roughly equal proportions of different sampling methods in both benign and cancer cohorts (p\u2009>\u20090.3, Fisher\u2019s exact test). In fact, if these technical variables were adjusted in the model, we achieved a similar level of statistical significance in testing the microbiota difference between the two cohorts (data not shown). We thus ruled out the potential confounding effects of these technical variables. Among the demographical and clinical variables, age, BMI, vaginal pH level, menopausal status, and history of hypertension were potential confounders, which had different distributions in the benign and cancer cohorts (Table\u00a01). Marginal PERMANOVA tests on the uterus samples revealed that these variables had less significant effects on the endometrial microbiota than the cohort effect (Additional file 8), indicating that the observed difference could not be completely explained by these potential confounders. However, a larger sample study may be needed to disentangle these confounding effects with confidence. In order to specifically address concerns that the observed findings could be impacted by the age differential between our benign and cancer cohorts, we performed a subset analysis where we extracted patients in the age range of 48\u201360 years with both a cancer and benign diagnosis. We repeated the analysis with this age-matched subset and we still observed the same trend for both A. vaginae and Porphyromonas, though less significant due to the reduction in the sample size (6 cancer versus 5 benign, Additional file 9). Although age differential is a direct reflection of the patient populations, enrollment targeted efforts will be made in future studies to decrease this gap.",
