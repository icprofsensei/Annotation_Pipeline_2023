Parameters such as cervicovaginal mucus, an intact epithelium, mucosal antibodies, and certain antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play important defensive roles [3], but the host mucosal immune system is a double-edged sword. Vaginal levels of several AMPs, including cathelicidin LL-37 and the \u03b1-defensins, correlate with enhanced HIV acquisition [4], as do proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels [5]. The mechanism by which genital inflammation increases HIV risk is at least 2-fold. First, mucosal inflammation recruits activated CD4+ T cells [6\u20138], which express higher levels of the HIV coreceptor chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) [9] and are preferential targets for HIV [10]. In addition, inflammation is associated with disruption of the genital epithelial barrier [7].",

Overall, 13/51 (25.5%) of participants demonstrated genital inflammation: 45% (9/20) of participants within CST-IV, 18.2% (4/22) within CST-III, and 0% (0/9) within CST-I/II (LR = 9.5; P = .024, Figure 2A).

These 2 CSTs were associated with the presence of genital inflammation, and also with elevated levels of several individual proinflammatory cytokines. Specifically, CST-IV was strongly associated with elevated IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and to a lesser degree GM-CSF and IL-10, while CST-III was associated with elevated IP-10 and MIG. Interestingly, levels of the latter 2 chemokines were reduced in women with CST-IV, with even more substantial reductions of these and other chemokines in women with BV by Nugent score, an unexpected finding that may merit further investigation. Further, genital inflammation was associated with specific bacterial phyla, most strikingly with a decreased relative and absolute abundance of L. crispatus, and increased relative and absolute abundances of several individual anaerobic bacterial phyla, including G. vaginalis and P. bivia. Neither CST-III/IV, BV, nor intermediate microbiota (defined by Nugent score) were associated with alterations in the number or phenotype of endocervical CD4+ T cells, endocervical dendritic cell numbers, or their subsets. We did not observe any association between vaginal CST and HSV-2 infection, despite the significant epidemiological synergy that exists between BV and HSV-2 infection [31\u201333].",

Mucosal inflammation may increase HIV risk in at least 2 ways. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 are produced after stimulation of innate immune receptors on both epithelial cells and local dendritic cells [35], and directly disrupt mucosal epithelial barrier function both in vitro and in vivo, potentially facilitating HIV entry [7, 36]; furthermore, inflammation is associated with an influx of activated CD4+ T cells that fuels local HIV replication [8]. Our analyses now suggest that these 2 mechanisms can operate independently of each other. Vaginal CST-IV was associated with mucosal proinflammatory cytokines, particularly the cytokine IL-1\u03b1 that is produced via microbial stimulation of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 on local antigen presenting cells [6, 37], without alterations in CD4+ T-cell targets. However, HSV-2 infection was associated with increases in mucosal CD4+ T-cell subsets without alterations in local proinflammatory cytokines; while some cytokines/AMPs were associated with increased CD4+ T cells (MIP-3\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, LL-37, and HNP1-3), these were generally distinct to cytokines associated with CST-IV. Together, these results suggest that HSV-2 and vaginal CST-IV enhance HIV susceptibility through independent mucosal immune mechanisms.",

Over 92% of our study participants (48/52) were either HSV-2 seropositive or had a CST-III/IV vaginal microbiota, and 50% (26/52) demonstrated both. Whether having both conditions will synergistically increase HIV susceptibility is not known. There was a nonsignificant trend to increased endocervical CD4+ T-cell subsets in participants with both conditions, but we could not comment on potential enhanced HIV susceptibility due to alterations in the epithelial barrier, such as breakdown of tight junctions, resulting in increased permeability. However, even if such synergy exists, it is not clear if/how this could be translated into effective HIV prevention strategies. While vaginal proinflammatory cytokines are significantly reduced 4 weeks after standard clinical treatment of BV [39], the clinical ability to alter the vaginal microbiota in the long term is limited. Specifically, clinical BV recurs soon after standard metronidazole treatment in one-third of women, and altered microbiota (by Nugent score) recurs in almost two-thirds of women [40], demonstrating that clinically induced \u201cnormalization\u201d of the microbiota tends to regress to an individual\u2019s mean. While the presence of rectal Lactobacillus spp. is associated with reduced rates of BV [41], the success of oral probiotics as BV treatment or prevention has been mixed [42, 43]. Therefore, better ways to restore and maintain a Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota are urgently needed.",

While this reduces our ability to definitively demonstrate the lack of association between the vaginal microbiota and cervical HIV target cells, the fact that we still see strong cellular associations with HSV-2 infection clearly demonstrates that a vaginal microbiota association with genital target cells (if it exists) must be less robust. Further, while no association was seen between chronic HSV-2 infection and the vaginal microbiota, we could not assess the impact of HSV-2 reactivation or acute HSV-2 infection on the microbiome or genital immune parameters. This study only enrolled participants from the ACB community, reducing our power to assess the immune impact of vaginal CSTs dominated by Lactobacillus spp. other than L. iners (CST-I, -II, -V). Our analysis of genital cellular immunity assessed cellular phenotype rather than function, due to limitations in the number of cells collected by cytobrush sampling. Whether cervical T cells in women with a vaginal CST-IV demonstrate altered function is an interesting question that will require future study.",
