Established cytology biobanks, typically collected with a cytobrush, constitute a unique resource to study such associations longitudinally. It is plausible that compared to rayon swabs; the most commonly used sampling devices, cytobrushes may disrupt biofilms leading to variation in VM composition. Cervico-vaginal samples were collected with cytobrush and rayon swabs from 30 women with high-grade cervical precancer. Quantitative PCR was used to compare bacterial load and Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene used to compare VM composition. Cytobrushes collected a higher total bacterial load. Relative abundance of bacterial species was highly comparable between sampling devices (R2\u2009=\u20090.993). However, in women with a Lactobacillus-depleted, high-diversity VM, significantly less correlation in relative species abundance was observed between devices when compared to those with a\u00a0Lactobacillus species-dominant VM (p\u2009=\u20090.0049). Cytobrush and swab sampling provide a comparable VM composition. In a small proportion of cases the cytobrush was able to detect underlying high-diversity community structure, not realized with swab sampling. This study highlights the need to consider sampling devices as potential confounders when comparing multiple studies and datasets.",

VM composition can be broadly classified into five community state types (CSTs). CST-I, -II, -III and -V are all characterised by one dominant Lactobacillus species whereas CST IV is characterised by a high diversity, Lactobacillus-deplete community9. CST-IV, and to some extent CST-III (L. iners dominated), have been associated with increased acquisition and persistence of HPV infection5 and increased severity of CIN disease status7, 8, 10. The majority of existing data in the literature is derived from cross-sectional cohorts, limiting reported correlations between vaginal microbiota, HPV infection, cervical dysplasia and carcinogenesis to associations that lack causal inference. Longitudinal samples stored in existing cytology biobanks may provide a unique resource that permits temporal assessment and identification of causal associations between the VM, HPV infection and cervical disease.",

However, in the context of CIN and cervical cancer, biobanked samples are typically collected using a cytobrush, which exfoliate the top layer of cervical epithelial cells for detection of dysplasia by cytological analysis using light microscopy and are specifically designed to sample the transformation zone of the cervix; the area where HPV infects and causes dysplastic lesions and invasive cancers13. For this reason they may be superior to swabs due\u00a0to their ability to have a greater surface area contact with the cervical epithelium, ensuring the bacteria in closest contact with this mucosal surface are collected. Furthermore, biofilms of densely adherent bacteria can be present in the vagina, particularly in the case of bacterial vaginosis (BV)14. A relatively soft-tipped swab may be unable to disturb these biofilms resulting in sampling of primarily planktonic bacteria not in direct contact with the cervical epithelium. It is also plausible that differences in absorbance and exfoliation between the two sampling devices could lead to variation in the composition of the VM. Previous studies have compared sampling techniques in the nasal sinuses (swab versus biopsy)15, and ileum (brush versus biopsy)16 and found no significant difference in relative abundance, richness or diversity of bacterial species. A comparison of swabs and cytobrushes used for vaginal microbiota sampling and subsequent analysis by sequencing has not previously been conducted.",

Longitudinal studies are required to infer causality with regards to the role of the human microbiota in oncogenesis17. However, the change from a normal healthy cervix, through HPV acquisition, chronic infection resulting in dysplasia and onward neoplastic transformation to invasive cancer takes at least a decade18. Biobanks, largely collected as part of cervical screening programmes, contain liquid-based cytology samples collected using cytobrushes, which provide a unique resource of serial samples required to further explore the associations between VM and cervical carcinogenesis. Several techniques have been described in the literature for obtaining samples for the purpose of sequencing bacterial DNA to study the human vaginal microbiota in a variety of patient cohorts, the most common being swabs19, but the use of cytobrushes20, as well as cervicovaginal lavage21, epithelial scrapes and biopsies22 has also been reported. Heterogeneity of the vaginal microbiota at different locations throughout the vagina has been documented23, however a direct comparison of swabs and cytobrushes taken from the ectocervix has never been described.",

Whilst the suitability of different swab types has not been reported in studies exploring the vaginal microbiota, experiments in vitro have shown that a significant difference exists in both absorbance and release of compounds and proteins from different swab types24. Cytobrushes have a greater exfoliative ability compared to swabs in the studies on VM, possibly giving them the additional ability to disturb biofilms. We therefore hypothesised that cytobrushes would be associated with higher diversity due to these different properties.",

A small aliquot of the total 20\u2009ml LBC solution was used, and we were able to use qPCR to determine the volume to be used to give similar total bacterial load (Fig.\u00a01b, Table\u00a01) to prevent biasing further sequencing experiments with a discrepancy in bacterial load between the two techniques. We have also demonstrated the higher biomass collected by cytobrushes in a separate cohort of 20 further women in whom the mean weight of sample collected by swabs was 50 milligrams (mg), compared to 1560\u2009mg by cytobrushes (unpublished data), which supports that cytobrushes collect a much higher biomass than swabs. The advantage of using only one fortieth of the original sample for 16S rRNA gene analysis leaves the investigator with a large volume remaining with which to do further tests such as cervical cytology, HPV genotyping, and general microbiology reducing the need for extra sampling of women recruited to research studies. However, with the increasing interest in metagenomic/whole genome shotgun sequencing, the cytobrush-collected samples may contain a high load of host DNA, which can be problematic, however this was not assessed in the current study.",

There was a discrepancy between the CST classification of sequencing data in 3/30 (10%) women, all of whom had a swab sample which clustered with a Lactobacillus spp.-dominant CST, but with CST-IV on their cytobrush sample. It is plausible that sampling with a cytobrush disrupts biofilms that are otherwise left intact when sampled with a rayon swab resulting in the isolation of taxa present in planktonic phase. Clearly further studies are required to confirm this, however our data indicates that swab-sampling techniques may be less suitable when studying diseases correlated with highly diverse communities.

In order to determine whether primer choice influenced our results we performed G.vaginalis qPCR, and showed that where this species was detected, there was no significant difference between the two sampling techniques (Supplementary Figure\u00a01), and we\u00a0therefore do not consider this to be a significant limitation to our conclusions. Furthermore, the collection of both samples was performed during the same vaginal examination in order to ensure identical conditions and allow a direct comparison between the sampling techniques. The cytobrush, which has a greater exfoliative capacity compared to a swab was intentionally collected second to ensure that this does not disturb the biofilms prior to the swab collection. Given the wide surface of the cervix and the amount of discharge found in women, it is unlikely that the gentle tip of the swab would be sufficient to disturb the microbiota in the cytobrush, hence the reason for such a study design.",

However, cytobrushes were able to uncover CST-IV VM\u2019s, not demonstrated by the corresponding swab sample\u00a0in 10% of our sampled population, which may be due to the cytobrush having a greater exfoliative capacity, which could enable biofilm disruption. We have also shown that cytobrushes collect a higher bacterial load, which may reduce the impact of potential sample contamination. These results should be taken into consideration when designing future prospective studies where a high-diversity microbiota may be implicated in disease pathogenesis, and those performing meta-analysis of metagenomic data should consider variation in sampling techniques as a potential confounder. Based on our findings we conclude that cervical cytobrushes are a valid sampling device for collection of samples for 16S rRNA gene analysis, which opens up the possibility of using historical biobank samples for the study of longitudinally collected patient samples.",
