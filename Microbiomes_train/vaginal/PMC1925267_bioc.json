A condition termed aerobic vaginitis has been coined for a smaller proportion of women whose microbiota is dominated by streptococci and E. coli2. BV is estimated to affect more than 10% of the female population world-wide 3, but prevalence varies from 30% in Indonesia, 25% in Canada 4, 5 to 15% in rural Brasil 6. A recent study by our group showed a rate of 14.2% for BV amongst a population of Nigerian women 7. The aim of the present study was to determine the microbial contents in these subjects. A gene-based, rather than culture-based, method was used as the latter fails to detect many of the organisms that inhabit the vaginal tract 8. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated in the vagina the high prevalence of Lactobacillus iners, an organism that does not grow on standard lactobacilli media, and Atopobium vaginae, an anaerobe associated with cases of BV 9,10. BV is diagnosed clinically in several ways, depending upon availability of methods, cost and experience of clinicians. The Amsel criteria is based upon microscopic examination of vaginal discharge to identify \u201cclue cells\u201d, vaginal cells covered in Gram negative bacteria, and two of the three following criteria: (a) anterior fornix vaginal pH >4.5, (b) release of a fishy odor on addition of 10% KOH to the vaginal discharge (positive \u201cwhiff\u201d test), and (c) presence of an increased thin homogeneous white vaginal discharge 11. A Gram stain method known as the Nugent Score, is also used at some centres 12. It is based on a scoring system ranging from normal (predominantly lactobacilli rods) to BV (absence of lactobacilli and domination by Gram negative rods and Gram positive coccobacilli). In Nigeria, the Gram stain method is often used. The diagnosis of BV leads to antibiotic administration primarily using metronidazole, or as a second option clindamycin. With increasing drug resistance 13, the choice of empirical therapy may increasingly require first the proper identification of the causative agents.",

The findings support previous studies on the polymicrobial nature of BV patients 16. Although Mycoplasma hominis is regarded as a causative agent in BV 17, the present study suggests that it may be more prevalent in Nigerian women than Caucasians. The eubacterial primers used here had previously been successful in detecting more common BV isolates in Caucasian women, namely G. vaginalis, Prevotella sp., Mobiluncus, Atopobium sp., as well as E. coli\n10,18, none of which were detected in this population sample. A recent paper has suggested using a range of primers, including ones with up to 100 bases. While a range of primers and specific gene probes may have detected isolates present in low counts, we are confident that none of the Gram negative bacteria or Atopobium commonly associated with BV were present here as dominant organisms.",

The use of gene-based methods often uncovers microbial types that are either not classified into a known genera, or are regarded as being unusual for the habitat sampled. This was the case here, with the detection of an organism identified by the gene bank as a Rainbow trout intestinal bacterium. This organism is normally associated with marine ecosystems, which suggests that it could have colonized the hosts through food consumption and ascension from the rectum to the vagina, or through transfer directly into the vagina after swimming in a river or lake. At least a portion of the organisms found in the microbiota of fish appear capable of persisting in the human intestinal tract22. On the other hand, it is possible that the primers used or the sequencing profiles have either mistaken this organism for Gram negative bacteria in previous studies, or we have mis-identified it here and the clones are in fact more commonly isolated enterobacteriaciae. The genera belongs to the Gamma sub-class of proteobacteria, and the clone TI is very close to Enterobacteriaceae in the phylogenetic group, while D22 is closely related to Proteus sp. 23. A number of intestinal fish microbes, such as Aeromonas sp., do express virulence factors and can potentially infect humans 24, however, none have previously been associated with BV. It remains to be determined the extent to which the trout organisms isolated here do in fact colonize the vagina, displace lactobacilli and induce a symptomatic BV condition, or whether they are simply commensal bystanders.",
