Recent advances in technology have enabled deep sequencing and analysis of the members and structures of these communities. Two sites, the vagina and gastrointestinal tract, are highlighted to exemplify how technological advances have enhanced our knowledge of the host\u2013microbiota system. These examples represent low- and high-complexity communities, respectively. In each example, certain community structures are identified that can be extrapolated to larger collections representing multiple individuals and potential disease or health states. One common feature is the unexpected diversity of the microbiota at any of these locations, which poses a challenge for relating the microbiota to health and disease. However, we anticipate microbiota compositional measurements could become standard clinical practice in the future and may become diagnostic for certain diseases or increased susceptibility to certain disorders. The microbiota of a number of disease states are currently being examined to identify potential correlations. In line with these predictions, it is possible that existing conditions may be resolved by altering the microbiota in a positive way.",

Large-scale endeavors such as the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) (2), hosted by the US National Institutes of Health, and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) project (3), through the European Commission, have initiated extensive programs aimed at surveying the repertoire of microbial genes and genomes collectively termed the microbiome.

Wang and colleagues (7) delineated a two-step metabolic pathway involving the microbially mediated metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine, resulting in the production of the metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Additionally, a recent study by Sellitto et al. (8) described the development of the microbiota among individuals with a genetic predisposition for celiac disease. This study also highlighted the utility of incorporating studies of the metabolic capabilities of the microbiota, resulting in the potential identification of biomarkers for the development of celiac disease (8). Development of a mechanistic understanding of the human microbiota in relation to human health and disease and incorporation of the microbiome as a key component of the entire human genomic framework are fundamental for the advancement of personalized medicine.",

In the human microbiome literature, the definition of symbiosis ranges from a commensalistic relationship, wherein the interaction is decidedly beneficial for one of the partners (the host), to mutualistic, involving beneficial outcomes for all organisms involved. In this review, we discuss the variety of symbiotic interactions of the human host and microbiota in the context of maintaining homeostasis, focusing on the host\u2013microbiota systems of the vagina and gastrointestinal tract, and how perturbations of these interactions lead to dysbiosis.",

The advent of community genomics and high-throughput cultivation-independent molecular techniques has yielded remarkable insight into the complex diversity of \u201cour microbial selves\u201d (11), previously obscured from researchers focused on readily cultivated microorganisms from human samples. Sequencing technologies have advanced the investigation of these complex communities by increasing the throughput. During the past decade, sequencing strategies have changed from using Sanger sequencing to interrogate a full-length 16S rRNA gene (\u223c1,200 bp) to only examining hypervariable portions of the gene with second and third generation sequencing technology. These changes in sequencing strategy are indicative of the length of sequencing reads, from the long (800\u20131,000 bp) Sanger reads to the short sequencing reads of the Roche 454 and Illumina platforms (\u223c400 and 100 bp, respectively). Additionally, the high throughput of the new sequencing technologies has removed biases associated with cloning and allowed the simultaneous interrogation of hundreds, if not thousands, of samples. This level of throughput has altered the experimental design, as it is now economically and technically feasible to examine large numbers of samples from large patient or subject cohorts. However, the increase in sequencing throughput has resulted in challenges that have driven the development of novel tools for analysis, examined below.",

The use of animal models, particularly gnotobiotic and humanized mice, has provided crucial information regarding host-microbiota interactions (20). For example, using a mouse model, Vaishnava and colleagues established that epithelial MyD88 and RegIII\u03b3 are key host components regulating the microbiota at the intestinal surface (21). This work provided significant insight into a previously unspecified immune mechanism that promotes host\u2013microbial spatial interactions. However, findings from animal models do not always translate to humans, both in terms of reproducing clinical outcomes for a given disease (22) and in some of the observed experimental features. For instance, early studies evaluating microbiomes in lean and obese mice indicated that changes in the relative abundances of the two main phyla, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, were associated with obesity (23). These initial observations in animal models have been challenged by more recent studies demonstrating that the relationship is more complicated than simply the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes in associating gastrointestinal microbiota with obesity in humans (24, 25).",

The dynamics of the host\u2013 microbiota system can be appreciated at daily, monthly, and even yearly resolution. Fluctuations of the microbiota composition can indicate a highly individual temporal profile (Figure 2). Similarly, spatial resolution is significant in the context of the biochemical interactions and activities occurring on the micrometer scale. For example, the oral microbiota is remarkably unique, restricted to microniches associated with supra- and subgingival plaques, saliva and tongue surfaces within an individual's mouth (27\u201329). As we describe below, an eloquent study of the vaginal microbial composition of 32 reproductive-age women over a 16-week period has provided profound insight into the temporal dynamics that microbiota studies need to take into account in order to better quantify and attempt to define microbial \u201cnormality\u201d for human health.",

The vaginal microbiota appears to play a significant role in preventing bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, sexually transmitted infections, urinary tract infections, and HIV infection (30\u201334). The prevailing hypothesis is that the lactic acid\u2013producing bacteria (mainly Lactobacillus sp.), common colonizing bacteria in the human vagina, are the key players in maintaining homeostasis of the microbiota (26, 35). These species are hypothesized to facilitate the protective response by lowering the environmental pH through lactic acid production (36, 37), by producing various bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal compounds, or through competitive exclusion (38, 39). A cross-sectional study by Ravel et al. (26) categorized the microbiota of reproductive-aged women into five distinct community types: four that were dominated by Lactobacillus species (L. iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, or L. jensenii) and one that was not dominated by a single species but consisted of mainly anaerobic bacteria. This study was the first to speciate the Lactobacilli, providing a greater understanding of the specific microbial species that constitute the microbial community in the vagina. These findings are in direct contrast to the extreme species-level diversity that is observed in the gastrointestinal tract, discussed later in this review.",

These environmental factors play a significant role in the dynamics of the vaginal microbiota (Figure 3). A recent longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota of 32 women, examined daily over a 16-week period, confirmed the five major community types previously identified in the cross-sectional study, but, importantly, was also able to examine the temporal dynamics of the microbiota (35). It is clear from the measures of the microbiota composition and the association with sexual activity, menstrual cycle, and other environmental factors that there are periods of community-wide stability as well as periods of extreme variability. The data presented in Figure 3 are the longitudinal profiles from two individuals. The first contains a community that is dominated by L. crispatus, where, other than during menses, the community structure is extremely stable (panels a\u2013d ); the other individual exhibits a much more diverse microbiota over the sample acquisition period (panels e\u2013h). These two individuals exhibit distinct microbiota community profiles, and although one community is more diverse in composition, it appears to be more stable over the length of the study period. Ecological theory suggests that the less stable a community is, the more susceptible it is to invasion by incoming organisms (40). At this point, we can draw an important conclusion: a diverse community composition does not reflect the health status of the environment it was obtained from, and only through long-term longitudinal studies performed using large cohorts will we be able to identify microbiota signatures that are useful from the standpoint of health and human disease.",

The first is that there is significant diversity among samples collected from the same individual that does not correlate with a disease state. Second, frequent sampling can provide insight into the dynamics of the microbiota. As mentioned above, microbiota studies in the past have been hampered by the inability to process and sequence large numbers of samples. Advances in sequencing technologies have made it financially and programmatically feasible to examine large numbers of samples from large patient cohorts, enabling the interrogation of the microbiota at unprecedented levels. If the sampling and data generated for Figure 3 are examined only on the days of menses compared to days prior or subsequent to menses, an entirely different clinical picture appears. Overwhelmingly, the majority of previous microbiota studies utilized a cross-sectional study design, providing only a snapshot of the diversity of the microbiota with little insight into its dynamics. Understanding both diversity and dynamics is essential for developing therapeutics or diagnostics based on the microbiota. By way of analogy to chemical therapeutics, examining the microbiota in a cross-sectional study is like measuring the effective dose of a new drug only at 2 hours post administration and trying to determine its efficacy at 2 days post administration. It is impossible to determine an outcome or impact by examining a single time point in a rapidly evolving and developing system.",

Collectively, the gastrointestinal microbial consortia possess metabolic activity equivalent to a \u201cvirtual organ within an organ\u201d (41), and humans have been termed a \u201csupraorganism\u201d (1). Our indigenous microbes reside at the interface of the mucosal epithelial barrier, mediating host defense, immune development, and nutritional state. The vast majority of studies to date have investigated the composition, structure, and functional repertoire of the microbial community inhabiting the human gastrointestinal tract through the use of fecal samples (12, 17, 19, 42, 43, 44). Methodologies utilizing fecal material have proven effective and noninvasive yet remain only a proxy for the autochthonous members adherent to the epithelial mucosa at different sites throughout the gastrointestinal tract (45). Additionally, few studies have addressed the importance of archaeal, fungal, and viral components to the overall functioning of the gastrointestinal microbial system. Recent findings have shed light on the viral component as a reservoir of genetic heterogeneity (46), as well as the interaction of the resident microbiota in promoting viral replication and transmission (47, 48). Future efforts to integrate information regarding all microbial and viral players will be crucial in our deeper understanding of the host\u2013microbiota system.",

The gastrointestinal community appears to be seeded by mother-derived microbes during either vaginal delivery or Caesarean section and initially features low complexity and species richness (43, 49, 50). By the first year of life, the microbiota has dynamically progressed and converged toward a stable, phylogenetically diverse, adult-like profile according to distinct \u201cenvironmental\u201d events, e.g., the shift from breast milk to solid foods (43, 50). Age-related changes in community composition are apparent throughout the lifespan of an individual; for example, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, the presumptive sentinel of health and anti-inflammation (51), is found at conspicuously low abundances in the elderly and centenarians (52, 53). However, the specific trajectory of age-related shifts has yet to be fully characterized. For instance, relatively little is known regarding the gastrointestinal microbiota in pubescent children, which is a time of significant growth, dramatic hormonal changes, and bodily maturation (54). Recently, Flores et al. delineated a trend toward increased alpha diversity with age using a bivariate linear regression model (55). A highly attractive hypothesis derived from ecological theory is that a succession of rapid changes after birth leads to an equilibrium microbial composition or \u201cclimax community\u201d of gastrointestinal microbes in adulthood (11). Despite considerable taxonomic variation among adult individuals, a functional climax equilibrium is a readily testable concept in need of rigorous experimentation. Further study of the temporal dynamics over the lifespan is certainly a priority in an effort to fully describe developmental changes in the microbiome and their relation to global human health.",

Remarkably, the authors identified a subset of host genetic loci controlling individual microbial species, related taxa, and even putative pleiotropic effects on groups of distantly related organisms. Their results suggest that gastrointestinal microbial individuality is a complex polygenic trait, influenced and shaped both by the host genotype and by external, and sometimes stochastic, triggers.

A recent study examined the development of the microbiota among children genetically predisposed to develop celiac disease (8). Among these children, infants exposed to gluten early in life mounted an immune response and developed celiac disease more frequently than did infants with delayed gluten exposure. The microbiota was characterized by an overall lack of bacteria from the phylum Bacteroidetes along with a high abundance of Firmicutes. Interestingly, the microbiota does not resemble that of adults even at two years of age (43). The data from this study highlight the interplay between host features (genetic predisposition), environmental factors (exposure to gluten), and microbiota as contributors to the health and development of infants. This interrelatedness is highlighted in Figure 4, and one can most likely identify other factors on each arm of the figure that could play a role in the development and maintenance of the microbiota.",

This protection against colonization by enteric pathogens, termed colonization resistance, acts through three distinct mechanisms: (a) the direct inhibition of pathogen growth by microbiota-derived substances, (b) nutrient depletion by microbiota growth, and (c) microbiota-induced stimulation of innate and adaptive immune responses (60). The invasive enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) causes acute intestinal inflammation through invasion of the intestinal epithelium and survival in mucosal macrophages (61). Recently, an eloquent set of studies revealed the ability of S. Typhimurium to outcompete resident members of the microbiota through utilization of the respiratory chain electron acceptor tetrathionate, produced by reactive oxygen species during inflammation (61). The intestinal inflammation subsequently confers a growth advantage for S. Typhimurium to metabolize ethanolamine as a carbon source, which cannot be utilized by the resident microbiota (62). Remarkably, these subtle changes in the mode of respiration for S. Typhimurium (anaerobic respiration) appear to be a fundamental mechanism governing the dynamics of the host-associated microbiota (Figure 5, right).",

                    "text": "The communication of bacterial members of the microbiota has been studied for years in the context of bacterial quorum sensing (63\u201365). Quorum sensing is the ability to regulate gene expression in response to variations in cell density. Usually the term refers to self-communication, but in the context of the microbiota, there are potentially endless variations in terms of signal producers and responders. Cell-cell signaling between bacterial species is known as intrakingdom signaling. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that bacterial pathogens can respond to human hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine to increase the expression of virulence factors (66\u201368). This type of signaling is known as interkingdom signaling (69, 70). It has been proposed that if a therapeutic could be developed that would inhibit the bacterial signaling for virulence then the bacteria would not activate virulence mechanisms and would either pass through the human body or be easily eliminated by the immune system. A study by Rasko et al. (71) identified a compound known as LED209 that appeared to inhibit both the intra- and interkingdom signals in the gastrointestinal tract for the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli isolates, demonstrated to cause hemolytic uremic syndrome and death (72). This compound was demonstrated to inhibit the signal from the host microbiota, known as auto-inducer 3 (AI-3), as well as the bacterial sensing of the host hormones, epinephrine and norepinephrine (Figure 5, left). Additionally, the bacterial protein that was the sensor of the signals was conserved in other pathogens, and it was demonstrated that LED209 decreased the virulence of both Salmonella species and Francisella tularensis in animal models (71). Other examples of this strategy have been described for Vibrio cholerae (73, 74). It is thought that in contrast to traditional antibiotics, which seek to eliminate the bacterium, signaling inhibitors will be much better tolerated and the decreased negative pressure will prevent the rapid development of resistance to these compounds. These therapies still require a great deal of study before they will be available for human treatment but may signal a shift in the ideology of therapeutic antimicrobial design.",

Members of the genus Akkermansia, mucus degraders within the deeply rooted phylum Verrucomicrobia, have been implicated recently as a potential biomarker for a healthy intestine owing to their ability to produce oligosaccharides and short-chain fatty acids that stimulate the growth of resident mucus-colonizing gastrointestinal microbiota (76). Furthermore, investigation of specific compounds, in addition to microbial groups, has identified protective properties; for example, Bacteroides fragilis capsular polysaccharide A is protective against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, the most widely used animal model for multiple sclerosis (77). Diagnostic and prognostic applications based on an understanding of our microbial partners, particularly to identify precursor markers of disease that might be treated, hold remarkable promise as \u201cmicrobiome therapeutics.\u201d However, we will require a much greater understanding of our microbial communities before we can accurately shape the microbiota in the ways that are advantageous to human health. A major shortcoming in all microbiota research is that we currently lack the ability to differentiate cause and effect in studies that link changes in the microbiota with disease.

Whether identified metabolic pathways are functional, to what extent, and under what conditions remain to be quantified. Similarly, whole-community DNA-based surveys rely heavily on computational methods to relate a molecular signature back to the cell, yet this molecular signature may be from a living, active microbial cell or from a dormant or even dead cell. Advances in other \u201c-omics\u201d technologies, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, will provide fundamental information about the active constituents of the microbial consortia and what metabolic products are in flux at a given time (Table 2). Additionally, computational capacity and novel statistical methodology are advancing toward a systems biology approach to integrate clinical outcome, host metadata, and the microbiome. The availability of new tools, such as the maximal information coefficient as a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships (9, 86), will provide crucial mechanisms to associate health and the microbiome. In years past, the bottleneck to analysis was the feasibility of large-scale studies, limited by sequencing and financial concerns. Now, the new technologies can generate large amounts of data, rapidly, at relatively low cost; however, the methodologies to properly analyze and compare these data are still in development.",

The evident plasticity of the microbiome presents the possibility of modulating the microbiota to promote health. We have examined the concepts of the microbiota and human health within the two body sites that have garnered the most attention and thus have the most complete datasets and advanced hypotheses. The human vagina appears to contain a limited number of community types, the majority of which are dominated by one or more Lactobacilli species. In contrast, the microbiota of the human gastrointestinal tract displays a great deal of variability, but large cohorts of frequently sampled individuals are not yet available. Further investigation of the dynamics of the gastrointestinal enterotypes over time (78) will continue to reveal the range of community variation and provide context for the impact of microbial modulators, such as antibiotics and probiotics. In particular, antibiotic use brings about a regime shift in the resident community that fails to fully return to baseline (79).",

All human microbiome studies, to date, utilize three main sequencing platforms: capillary-based sequencing (Sanger, such as Applied Biosystems 3730xl), pyrosequencing (including Roche 454 GS, FLX, and FLX Titanium), and Illumina clonal arrays (Illumina GAIIx, HiSeq 2000, and MiSeq). Each technology has distinct characteristics, including read length, coverage depth, accuracy, scalability, relative cost, and time to generate data. We refer the reader to an extensive review of sequencing methodologies for the study of the human microbiome (81). Surprisingly, there is no \u201cstandard\u201d sequencing platform, methodology, or computational tool uniformly used by researchers in the field, rendering cross-study comparisons difficult. The choices of technology and bioinformatic tools to mine the data are critically important considerations for study design and subsequent interpretation of the results. For example, Sanger sequencing produces long read lengths (approximately 800\u20131,000 bp) compared to other technologies (<500 bp), enabling better phylogenetic resolution for ribosomal-based classification, but it yields four orders of magnitude fewer reads than the Illumina sequencing platform. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a particular sequencing platform, as well as the computational and analytical limitations, is crucial if we are to integrate knowledge of the microbiome as a diagnostic tool for human health and disease.",

The human microbiome is the collection of genes and genomes within the microbial community associated with a distinct body region. Characterizing the microbial phylogenetic composition from a given body site using 16S ribosomal gene sequence data describes only a portion of the microbiome. The term metagenome refers to the totality of genomes from an environment, including bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotic microbes. The terminology is significant because ribosomal gene sequencing and metagenomics are different measures of the microbial components, and each contributes a distinct microbial readout for interpretation and application to human health.",
