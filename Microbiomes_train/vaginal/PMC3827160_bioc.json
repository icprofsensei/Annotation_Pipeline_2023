We determined the vaginal microbial community in patients with VVC, bacterial vaginosis (BV), and mixed infection of VVC and BV using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA tags. Our results revealed for the first time the highly variable patterns of the vaginal microbiome from VVC patients. In general, the alpha-diversity results of species richness and evenness showed the following order: normal control < VVC only < mixed BV and VVC infection < BV only. The beta-diversity comparison of community structures also showed an intermediate composition of VVC between the control and BV samples. A detailed comparison showed that, although the control and BV communities had typical patterns, the vaginal microbiota of VVC is complex. The mixed BV and VVC infection group showed a unique pattern, with a relatively higher abundance of Lactobacillus than the BV group and higher abundance of Prevotella, Gardnerella, and Atopobium than the normal control. In contrast, the VVC-only group could not be described by any single profile, ranging from a community structure similar to the normal control (predominated with Lactobacillus) to BV-like community structures (abundant with Gardnerella and Atopobium). Treatment of VVC resulted in inconsistent changes of the vaginal microbiota, with four BV/VVC samples recovering to a higher Lactobacillus level, whereas many VVC-only patients did not. These results will be useful for future studies on the role of vaginal microbiota in VVC and related infectious diseases.",

In a recent survey, up to 40% of women with vaginal complaints in primary care settings were diagnosed as having VVC [9], [10]. Approximately 75% of women experience at least one episode of VVC during their lives, most commonly between the age of 20 to 40 years old [8]. However, an estimated 5% of women with VVC experience recurrent VVC, which is defined as four or more distinct episodes in a single year [9], [11]. Although there have been many studies regarding the host immunity and pathogenesis of Candida spp, little attention has been given to the vaginal microbiota, one of the most important aspects of the vaginal environment [10].",

                    "text": "The role of vaginal microbiota in VVC is controversial in the literature. VVC is a common side effect of BV treatment with antibiotics, indicating that the vaginal microbiota might be related to the colonization of yeast [12]. There have been reports regarding the association between VVC and intermediate flora patterns that result in an altered vaginal bacterial community [13], [14]. However, a comparison of the Lactobacillus species cultured from the vaginal secretions of women with or without VVC showed no significant differences [15]. Moreover, McClelland et al. reported that vaginal Lactobacillus colonization was associated with a \u22654-fold increase in the likelihood of symptomatic VVC [16]. Recently, Zhou et al. compared vaginal bacterial communities using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) technique; however, their results showed no altered or unusual bacterial community in women with VVC, and the authors suggested that commensal vaginal bacterial species might be incapable of preventing VVC [11]. To date, all the reports on the vaginal microbiome of VVC patients have been obtained using traditional cultivation or molecular fingerprinting methods, whereas there are no reports on the vaginal microbiome in VVC using NGS techniques [11]. In the present study, we used the barcoded Illumina paired-end sequencing (BIPES) technique [17] to determine the vaginal bacterial community structure of reproductive-age women with VVC in Guangzhou, China. Our study is the first report on the vaginal microbiota of VVC using NGS methods, which revealed diverse microbial community patterns of the disease.",

The average age of the participants was 31.7 years old. 30 of the subjects were healthy, 39 were infected with VVC, 16 were infected with BV/VVC and 10 were infected with BV. 14 follow-up subjects were infected with VVC, 4 follow-up subjects recovered from the BV/VVC infection, and 1 follow-up subject was infected with BV. From each subject, we took two swabs, one from the vaginal fornix and the other one from the lower vagina (lower third of vagina). Fresh samples were evaluated for pH using pH-testing strips and then placed in a \u221270\u00b0C refrigerator until DNA extraction. Each individual underwent routine gynecology examination by two gynecologists. VVC is diagnosed via the microscopic detection of dense numbers of yeast cells on a vaginal smear and by physical examination and the presence of a white, mucous-like yeast discharge. BV status was assessed using Amsel's clinical criteria [18] for all subjects and was confirmed using Gram-stain criteria (Nugent scores)[19]. The participants who met three or more of the following criteria were clinically diagnosed with BV: homogenous vaginal discharge, >20% clue cells on wet mount, elevated vaginal discharge pH (\u22654.5), and the release of a fishy amine odor upon the addition of 10% potassium hydroxide solution to vaginal fluid (\u201cwhiff\u201dtest). Then, based on the criteria for BV assessment developed by Nugent et al., participants with a Gram-stain score \u22657 were finally confirmed as having BV. Participants who met the criteria for both VVC and BV were diagnosed with a mixed infection of VVC with BV. Participants without any of these conditions were defined as healthy controls. Participants with any of the following criteria was excluded: <18 years of age, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, use of antibiotics or vaginal antimicrobials (orally or by topical application to the vulvar/vaginal area) in the previous month, menstruation, menoxenia, the presence of an intrauterine device, known active co-infection with Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or Trichomonas vaginalis, clinically apparent herpes simplex infection, or diagnosed HPV, HSV- 2, or HIV infection.",

After filtering the low-quality reads and removing chimeras, we obtained 1,026,382 high-quality reads, with an average number of 4,542 reads per sample. All of the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using TSC, and representative sequences from each OTU were used for the taxonomic assignment with GAST, a pipeline with good performance for analyzing V6 tags [22]. We sampled two swabs for each individual: one from the vaginal fornix and the other from the lower vagina. According to our analyses, both of the swabs from the same subject normally showed similar microbiome community structures compared to the swabs from other subjects (grouped together using PCoA and UPGMA clustering and showing similar constituents at all taxonomic levels), thus indicating good microbiome reproducibility for the two sampling sites. Therefore, we pooled the sequences from paired samples in the ensuing analysis. Good's coverage values for all the samples were from 0.980 to 0.998, indicating that our sequencing depth was sufficient to represent the majority of the microbiota in the vaginal environment.",

We further divided the VVC patients into two groups: those with a mixed occurrence of BV and VVC (named BV/VVC in the present study) and those with VVC only (named VVC). The genus level distribution (Fig. 1) clearly shows that the vaginal microbiota of the healthy group was normally dominated by the Lactobacillus genus, which is consistent with the common perception of a normal vaginal bacterial community structure [1], [3]. Additionally, we observed two individuals from the normal control (NC) group with vaginal microbiomes dominated by Bifidobacterium or Streptococcus, both of which have been reported to be temporarily dominant in healthy women without any symptoms [7], [25]. In comparison, the BV patients showed much higher diversity, with a relatively low abundance of Lactobacillus and a high abundance of BV-related bacteria, such as Gardnerella, Atopobium, Dialister, Sneathia, Mobiluncus, and Prevotella (Fig. 1); these genera are typical of the vaginal bacterial communities of BV patients determined using both traditional and advanced next-generation sequencing methods [5], [26]\u2013[28]. The consistency of our results for the NC and BV groups with those from the literature confirms the accuracy of our pipeline, and these two groups, NC and BV, were used as references for the following analyses.",

The variety of microbiota patterns within a single group could be observed by the span of the VVC samples in the PCoA results (Fig. 2). In our analyses, we observed that approximately 21 (54%) of the VVC samples were grouped with the \u2018normal\u2019 communities dominated by Lactobacillus.

The VVC patients were treated with fluconazole; the BV/VVC patients were first treated with ornidazole and then fluconazole. The follow-up samples were collected at 9 to 16 days after the treatment when the patients revisited the hospital. Although all of the follow-up patients recovered with improved symptoms, many did not exhibit the expected healthy vaginal microbiomes (Fig. 4). For the VVC patients with initially normal vaginal microbiomes, three of the eight patients showed even higher levels of Gardnerella than before treatment. In comparison, the two individuals with unusual microbiomes recovered a Lactobacillus-abundant microbiome following the treatment. Interestingly, we observed two that VVC patients initially with an intermediate vaginal microbiota recovered to a Streptococcus-dominated vaginal microbiome that was similar to the unusual microbiomes found in some asymptomatic healthy women [3], [26], [29]. In comparison, all four samples with mixed BV/VVC showed increased Lactobacillus after treatment (Fig. 4).",

The unique microbiome structure of the BV/VVC group suggests that the presence of candidiasis might alter the structure of an unhealthy microbiome (the BV microbiome). All the BV/VVC microbiomes showed abundant Lactobacillus, in contrast to the depletion of this genus in BV patients, indicating that Candida infection created an environment that was friendly to the growth of Lactobacillus. Another possibility is that both strains were simultaneously promoted by some environmental factor, such as estrogen [2]. Interestingly, all the follow-up samples in the BV/VVC and BV groups showed an increased abundance of Lactobacillus, indicating that treatment with antibiotics might be useful for the recovery of a healthy vaginal microbiome.",

The data suggested that all the previous studies regarding the vaginal microbial communities of VVC were partly correct, considering the traditional cultivation or molecular fingerprinting methods that were used. Historically, mixed results have been reported for the vaginal microbiomes of VVC patients [9], [11]. Many studies have found that Lactobacillus spp. were still abundant in VVC and that there was no significant difference between the vaginal microbiomes of VVC patients and healthy controls [11]. Our study found that the vaginal microbiomes from most of the VVC subjects had abundant Lactobacillus strains, which supports the isolation of Lactobacillus from VVC patients in many previous reports [15]. Gardnerella was found in a large proportion of the VVC patients in our study as well, and the microbiome diversity was increased in these groups, consistent with the increased Nugent score in the literature [13], [15]. At present, we are unable to extrapolate any reason or meaning for these different types of microbiomes in VVC patients. It is possible that the variations merely reflect the changing patterns at different infection stages. The different patterns found in the VVC microbiomes appear to have no correlation with pH, as there were no significant differences in the pH values among the different VVC subgroups. Furthermore, because all our VVC patients presented such symptoms as discharge, \u201ccottage cheese\u201d discharge, vulval pruritus, and a burning sensation, the different patterns do not appear to be indicative of clinical symptoms. The present findings suggested that the complex vaginal microbiome community profiles of VVC can only be revealed by high-throughput methods with NGS techniques; indeed, the traditionally used methods might be the reason for the inconsistent results in previous studies.",
