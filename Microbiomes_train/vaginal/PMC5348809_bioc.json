The prototypical genome encodes 6 early genes (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) and 2 late genes (L1 and L2) [5]. By convention, HPV classification is based on the L1 gene where a difference of >10% in the viral sequence defines a different genotype [6]. With the advent of sequencing technologies, the list of papillomavirus (PV) genotypes has grown to 333 with 202 types isolated from humans and 131 from animals [7]. The conferment of HPV oncogenic potential is derived from two viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which inactivate two primary cellular proteins: p53 and RB, respectively [5, 8, 9]. Inhibition followed by degradation of p53 and RB leads to cell-cycle progression, immortalization, and malignant transformation of the HPV-infected cell [5]. The E6 and E7 proteins of carcinogenic HPV possess a structural advantage, namely, conformational plasticity that may be responsible for multi-target binding and transformation in host cells [9, 10]. Hence, sequencing the E6/E7 genes to decode its oncogenic potential through association with known genotypes by genetic proximity may be a preferred diagnostic test.",

For samples with multiple HPV infections, genotype identification may be imprecise or indeterminable because of noisy (overlapping signals) chromatograms causing failures in nucleotide alignment [11]. Furthermore, non-dominant genotypes in mixed infections may not be detected by the Sanger method and may be consequently underestimated. Therefore, to properly identify all HPV types in a complex sample, contemporary next-generation sequencing (NGS), also referred to as deep or high-throughput sequencing (HTS), may provide an innovative solution [12]. Although the literature is limited, several NGS platforms have been successful at determining the diversity of HPV genotypes found in human skin, normal cervical cytology, and cytology of an HIV+ woman harboring 16 types [13\u201316].",

HPV community is defined as the assemblage of different genotypes found in each sample by deep sequencing and grouped as LSIL or HSIL for comparative analysis. Count-based genotype diversity and dominance within a HPV community were quantified by the Shannon-Wiener Index (SWI) and Berger-Parker Index (BPI), respectively and compared using Solow\u2019s randomization test [22]. Composition-based genotype dissimilarity between communities (\u03b2-diversity) was calculated using the Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) method based on percentage differences between samples [23, 24]. ANOSIM is a non-parametric statistical test for significant differences in species composition (%) between two or more groups/sites of sampling units. The ANOSIM statistic R compares the mean ranks of species similarities between and within groups [24]. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the most influential variables (HPV types) in the LSIL or HSIL group. PCA was performed on the covariance matrix of natural log-transformed abundance data [ln(x\u2009+\u20091)] of HPV-types within each sample [24, 25]. Log transformation was applied to reduce the influence of highly abundant genotypes (skewed data). Biodiversity analyses were performed using Species Diversity and Richness 4.0 and Community Analysis Package 5.0. [22, 24]",

The not classifiable agents are generally considered not carcinogenic based on limited epidemiological and experimental data. The rationale for categorizing HPV 6 as not classifiable instead of probably not carcinogenic was the low (0.45% [95% CI: 0.35-0.56]) but not zero incidence found in invasive cervical cancers worldwide [30]. It is postulated that HPV-6 and other low-risk genotypes may rarely cause cancer due to unusual \u201cvirus-host circumstances\u201d [30]. Therefore, the not classifiable/probably not carcinogenic genotypes are generally considered non-carcinogenic and thus grouped together for this study. The probably not carcinogenic group include HPV species alpha-1, -2, -3, -4, -8, -10 (other than HPV 6, 11), -13, -14/15 [8, 30].",

Deep amplicon sequencing generated abundant mapped reads and deciphered the composition of genotypes within each sample. The total number of HPV types identified by sequencing single and multi-infected samples ranged from 27 for LSIL to 17 for HSIL and spanned the spectrum of IARC-defined carcinogenicity [8, 30]. More specifically, the viral community differed between LSIL and HSIL with a loss of genotypic diversity and domination by carcinogenic HPVs, in particular, HPV-16 in HSIL. The inverse correlation between HPV diversity and progressive disease is consistent with the findings of 1,518 cervical biopsies ranging from CIN 0 to 3 in the ATHENA (Addressing The Need for Advanced HPV diagnostics) trial [32]. Furthermore, carcinogenic HPVs, in particular HPV-16 and -18, have been shown to be indicators and predictors of CIN 3 development [32, 33]. Carcinogenic HPV dominance (\u226550%) may also be an indicator of underlying high-grade disease, as found in 12% (3/26) of LSIL upgraded to CIN 2/3 on biopsy. Together, these metagenomic characteristics are consistent with the ecological principles of competitive exclusion and carcinogenesis hallmarked by clonal expansion and evolution of transformed cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a06 [34\u201340]. The distinguishing features of altered diversity and dominance between HPV communities may serve well as a biomarker for disease severity. The addition of evolutionary analysis to sample E6/E7 sequences assists in determining carcinogenic potential based on genetic distances to HPV reference sequences. In this way, deep sequencing revealed the dynamic ecology of HPV coexisting and evolving within the cervical epithelium, a characteristic that would otherwise remain unseen by traditional sequencing.\n",

                    "text": "Currently, published data on deep sequencing of HPV in abnormal cytology are limited and varied. Previous studies have analyzed target (non-generalizable) populations, used different NGS platforms and assays, and reported findings that may not be translatable between platforms [13\u201316, 41]. However, we did find several notable similarities. A metagenomics study of healthy persons from the NIH Human Microbiome Project revealed a high prevalence of HPV in the vagina (41.5%) with 43 types; high abundance of HPV-34, 53, 45, and 52; and a high rate (~50%) of mixed infections [41]. Fonseca et al. investigated the prevalence of HPV in isolated, indigenous Amazonian women of northern Brazil [15]. Among the 607 cytology samples, 3.3% were abnormal, which included 7 cases of LSIL, 2 cases of HSIL, and 1 case of carcinoma. The overall HPV prevalence was 39.7% with 60 different genotypes and a high rate (45%) of multiple infections. Only a limited number of HPVs were found in HSIL and/or carcinoma (HPV-16 and 31) and ASC-US/LSIL (HPV-16, 18, and 31). Finally, Meiring and colleagues used deep sequencing to identify 16 HPV types in a South African HIV+ woman and demonstrated that prevalent HPV types in HIV+ women are undetectable by commercial tests that complicate surveillance measures [16]. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NGS reveals a diverse and prevalent existence of mixed HPV infections in healthy females. With progression of cytopathology, diversity diminishes to a few virulent types, namely HPV-16 and other \u03b1-7, -9 species as observed in our LSIL/HSIL samples and Sjoeborg\u2019s study using linear array genotyping [42]. Finally, for immunocompromised hosts, the HPV virome may be more diverse and inclusive of less-virulent genotypes.",

This finding is consistent with the natural history of HPV infection with a characteristic peak age of\u2009<\u200925\u00a0years for HPV infection/LSIL and 25\u201335 years for HSIL [43]. Ironically, we found no difference in the median age of subjects between those who had and who did not have carcinogenic HPV genotypes by NGS. A large population-based study conducted in New Mexico showed similar age distributions as our sample for both carcinogenic and low-risk HPV groups with the peak age range being 21\u201324 years followed by a rapid decline [44]. In fact, over 35% of women <21\u00a0years of age and 32% between the ages of 21\u201324 years tested positive for any carcinogenic HPV on cytology [44]. Collectively, the disparate age distributions support the notion that infection with a carcinogenic HPV occurs predominantly in adolescence/early adulthood; whereas, disease, i.e. HSIL develops in later adulthood.",

                    "text": "The strength of this investigation lies in the clinical specimens studied and sequencing method used. First, we intentionally focused on precancerous cervical lesions, i.e. LSIL and HSIL because they have been understudied to date by deep sequencing. The remarkable genotypic diversity and coinfection rates found in this study have direct implications for vaccine development and epitope selection, as well as post-immunization surveillance for efficacy and emerging replacement-types [45]. The recently FDA-approved 9-Valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) containing HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 virus-like particles (VLPs) is a significant improvement over the quadrivalent vaccine. However, our study only found 7/27 and 4/17 genotypes (~25%) in LSIL and HSIL, respectively, covered by the 9vHPV epitopes. More importantly, HPV-35 and -39 found highly prevalent in LSIL and HSIL are not covered. Another additive concern about vaccine ineffectiveness is the low vaccine uptake and adherence rates in the U.S. [46, 47]. Consequently, active, population-based surveillance is necessary to detect potential redistribution of carcinogenic HPVs as a result of under-achieved herd immunity [45, 48\u201350]. Second, we used the most accurate NGS platform commercially available [12]. The least cumbersome DNA library preparation was chosen to streamline the laboratory workflow. The bioinformatics workflow created for HPV genotyping with automatable steps systematized the computational analysis. The simple methods developed and tested in this study may be adopted for studying HPV viromes at all susceptible anatomical sites where surveillance is essential [50]. Conversely, the high concordance rate found between deep and Sanger sequencing suggests that Sanger remains a reliable method of detecting the dominant genotype in single and mixed infections if decipherable by BLAST\u00ae. In resource limited settings, Sanger sequencing will remain salient. Although PCR/Sanger sequencing is still the current reference standard for HPV clinical diagnostics, next-generation genotyping may soon gain acceptance in the clinical realm as a new reference method according to the 2015 FDA Draft Guidance on HPV in vitro diagnostic devices [51]. Before adoption, however, we opine that further investigation is required to determine the threshold for variant detection (minimum coverage) and variant filtering (percentage of reads in a mixed population) for accurate next-generation HPV genotyping. Two independent studies using admixtures of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and influenza A plasmids suggest that for accurate detection using Illumina\u2019s sequencing technology, the limit of variant detection and filtering should be set ~100x and 0.5%, respectively [52, 53].",

                    "text": "Cross-sectional studies, similarly to other observational studies are susceptible to errors due to chance and bias. We acknowledge that the current study has limitations. First, the potential for selection bias must be considered. Our clinical samples were derived from a South Texas military population represented largely by Active Duty Members and dependents of the U.S. Army and Air Force. The demographics, social, and sexual behavior of our population may not be representative of other segments of the U.S. population. In general, HPV prevalence should be interpreted in the context of ethnogeography. Second, atypical squamous and glandular cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US and AGUS) cytological categories were not studied. The overall frequency of HPV+/ASC-US (1.1%) and HPV+/AGUS (0.05%) is low among screening cytology samples; however, the 5-year risk of histologic HSIL and cancer are significant, i.e. 18 and 45%, respectively [54]. Hence, to fill this knowledge gap, we plan to investigate HPV metagenomes of uncommon cytological categories to further our understanding of viral ecology, and we plan to establish predictive models for cytological outcomes based on metagenomics profiles. Third, we did not study LSIL/HSIL samples with negative E6/E7 amplification results. PCR non-detection (false-negative results) may be attributed to several variables, e.g. insufficient DNA template quantity or quality and primer-target mismatch [11, 55]. To explore and compare the HPV metagenomes in E6/E7 amplicon-positive and -negative cytology, multiply-primed rolling-circle amplification followed by deep sequencing may offer a solution, in particular, to partially deleted or poorly E6/E7-primed HPV genomes [13].",

Additionally, the evolutionary distances between the 3 clades correlated with IARC defined carcinogenicity. This finding is consistent with phylogenetic trees constructed traditionally from L1 ORF sequences. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [24]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length\u2009=\u20097.80202397 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1,000 replicates) are shown next to the branches [25]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [25] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analysis involved 160 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st\u2009+\u20092nd\u2009+\u20093rd\u2009+\u2009Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 238 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 [27]. (PDF 431\u00a0kb)",
