Because microbial abundance and diversity might differ in pregnancy, we sought to generate comparative metagenomic signatures across gestational age strata. DNA was isolated from the vagina (introitus, posterior fornix, midvagina) and the V5V3 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced (454FLX Titanium platform). Sixty-eight samples from 24 healthy gravidae (18 to 40 confirmed weeks) were compared with 301 non-pregnant controls (60 subjects). Generated sequence data were quality filtered, taxonomically binned, normalized, and organized by phylogeny and into operational taxonomic units (OTU); principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of the resultant beta diversity measures were used for visualization and analysis in association with sample clinical metadata. Altogether, 1.4 gigabytes of data containing >2.5 million reads (averaging 6,837 sequences/sample of 493 nt in length) were generated for computational analyses. Although gravidae were not excluded by virtue of a posterior fornix pH >4.5 at the time of screening, unique vaginal microbiome signature encompassing several specific OTUs and higher-level clades was nevertheless observed and confirmed using a combination of phylogenetic, non-phylogenetic, supervised, and unsupervised approaches. Both overall diversity and richness were reduced in pregnancy, with dominance of Lactobacillus species (L. iners crispatus, jensenii and johnsonii, and the orders Lactobacillales (and Lactobacillaceae family), Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Actinomycetales. This intergroup comparison using rigorous standardized sampling protocols and analytical methodologies provides robust initial evidence that the vaginal microbial 16S rRNA gene catalogue uniquely differs in pregnancy, with variance of taxa across vaginal subsite and gestational age.",

Such a view is seemingly in contrast to longstanding observations that humans serve as host to co-evolving microbes residing in highly plethoric communities. Indeed, microbiota are present from the time of birth, with up to 10-fold the number of microorganisms to adult human cells and a collective genome (the \u201cmetagenome\u201d) which exceeds our human genome in terms of gene content by more than 100-fold [1]. Moreover, we appreciate that the human microbiota are a metabolically and antigenically vibrant and diverse community which may function as mutualists (symbiotically beneficial), commensals (of neither harm nor benefit), or pathogens (of host detriment) [2]\u2013[4].",

Understanding the processes that govern the structure and dynamics of these human microbial communities is essential for gaining a complete understanding of human development and physiology [5]\u2013[9]. However, questions pertaining to how and when diverse microbial communities reside in the host (and how they differ during an individual\u2019s lifetime) are under-explored at a population-wide level. In other words, while we may soon know what constitutes the adult human microbial guild, we will neither know how it is established nor whether it is dynamic during intervals in reproductive life when the next generation\u2019s microbial community is being established.",

Based on a relative paucity of data, it is proposed that the na\u00efve neonatal microbiome is first established with rupture of the amniotic membranes, with further microbiota being introduced as the fetus traverses the vaginal birth canal. By the time of delivery, the neonate has been exposed to the maternal vaginal microbial ecosystem [9]\u2013[12]. Passage through the vaginal canal is an integral part of this process, as mode of delivery alters the neonatal microbiome [7]\u2013[12]. However, since a comprehensive characterization of the vaginal microbiome signature in pregnancy has not yet been undertaken, conclusions regarding mechanisms of neonatal colonization are likely premature [13]\u2013[17]. Since the infant is exposed to several environmental sources of bacteria in the early neonatal interval (maternal vaginal canal and feces, swallowing and breathing, skin to skin contact, maternal breastmilk, etc.) it is important to discern the relative potential contribution of the maternal vaginal community to the neonate.",

While multiple studies during the past several years have launched the era of human metagenomics, few reports have examined microbiomes outside of the gastrointestinal tract in more than a few individuals [22]\u2013[26], and none have systematically examined the vaginal microbiome throughout pregnancy. Here, we use cultivation-independent, molecular-phylogenetic techniques to characterize the first comparative bacterial assemblages across gestational age strata and in a rigorous clinical study. By interrogating the \u201chealthy\u201d human microbiome in pregnancy and in paralleled comparison with non-pregnancy, we reasoned that the ensuing metagenomic profile would optimally reveal the comparative diversity and richness of microbial species. In this manuscript, we describe our intergroup comparison using rigorous standardized sampling protocols and analyses methodologies in order to provide robust initial evidence that the vaginal microbial gene catalogue uniquely differs in pregnancy, with variance of molecular phylogeny (species richness and diversity) across both subsite and gestational age.",

As anticipated by our use of a parallel protocol design, comparable age, pregravid (or nongravid) BMI, race and ethnicity, and tobacco use were observed among both pregnant and non-pregnant subjects. Although the enrollment percentages by virtue of race and ethnicity were distinct in the two cohorts, these distinctions did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05, both independent samples t-test and ANOVA). As further anticipated among pregnant subjects per se, significant variance in medication use with respect to vitamins and antacids were similarly observed. Recalling prospective subject enrollment, the majority of gravidae had uncomplicated pregnancy outcomes: mean gestational age at delivery exceeded 39 weeks and included appropriately grown infants (mean 3265 grams), with 2/24 (8%) of subjects delivering <37 weeks (34 5/7, and 36 6/7 weeks). The cesarean delivery rate was consistent with the regional population (33%). A single fetal comorbidity was observed among the cohort after enrollment (fetal gastroschisis), and a total of 3 subjects manifest 4 comorbidites common to the obstetrical population (\nTable 1\n). Among the non-pregnant cohort, all subjects were not menstruating at the time of sampling per study protocol, and 58.8% would be anticipated to be anovulatory secondary to use of contraceptive (30 of 51 subjects).",

When within community (alpha diversity) variance was analyzed with OTU-based methodologic approaches [29]\u2013[33] the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy was equally rich but less diverse than non-pregnant communities (\nFigure 2B, left panel).

Although these denoising pipelines did, in fact, differ in their assessments of sequencing noise (and thus resulting OTU counts), both resulted in significant and robust differences among the pregnant (black lines) and non-pregnant (red lines) vaginal microbial communities. They also agreed in that community diversity in pregnancy is both significantly less rich (rarefaction metrics for microbial richness or taxa quantification, \nFigure 3A\n) [34] and less diverse (Renyi metrics for microbial diversity or number of distinct taxa, \nFigure 3B\n) [34]\u2013[37]. Taken together, these data are consistent with the notion that community aggregates to genus level projections (\nFigure 2B, right panel) are unchanged in the posterior fornix, but the more robust analysis of genus and sub-genus OTU based projections reveal significantly less diverse and less rich community structure in pregnancy (\nFigure 3\n).",

The first, the random forest algorithm paired with Boruta feature selection, was validated on classification of subjects by their vaginal microbiome with a pi statistic (improvement over random) exceeding 0.8 at OTU abundance thresholds of 100 or 500 for the AbundantOTU data set (Figures S1 and S2, Tables S1 and S2) and likewise above 0.6 for the QIIME denoised data set (Figure S1, Tables S1 and S2). Pregnancy status was, in fact, the single feature best predicted by the microbiome (as opposed to BMI, vaginal site of sampling, and ethnicity), and sub-sites were not well distinguished (pi statistic of discrimination <0.2 in all cases; Tables S1 and S2, Figure S3 with binned taxonomy). Using Boruta feature selection during RF analysis, 12 specific taxa were identified as discriminating between pregnant and non-pregnant cohorts at the genus level (at \u226580% bootstrap cutoff, Figure S1). In order to identify a taxonomic biomarker with high stringency, we additionally employed the LEfSe method [39], which confirmed the differential abundance of 29 and 27 clades (AbundantOTU and QIIME data, respectively, using default significance and LDA thresholds) at all taxonomic levels between pregnant and non-pregnant microbiomes (\nFigure 5\n). Supporting our findings in Figures 3 and \u200band4,4, these comprised primarily specific Lactobacillus OTUs and potentially the Bifidobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae. Our findings suggest that the composition of the microbial community in pregnancy represents a relatively diminished profile of species richness and diversity (\nFigures 2\n\n, \n\n3\n\n, \n\n4\n\n, \n\n5\n), culminating in the specific reduction of many usual vaginal community members and enrichment for a targeted set of Lactobacillus species (\nFigure 5\n). We present the species-level data in Table S3. Briefly, OTUs generated from AbundantOTU and QIIME were aligned to the Greengenes database with the top OTUs identified by LEfSe (\nFigure 5A\n). OTU sequences selected by Boruta feature selection are deposited in GenBank and are presented in Figure S2 and Table S3. Top OTUs identified by LEfSe are marked with an asterics. For example, AbundantOTU generated consensus 2/33 aligned to Lactobacillus iners, consensus 102/84/70/98/67/44/29/46 to Lactobacillus crispatus, and consensus 28 to Lactobacillus jensenii. On QIIME, 882 aligned to Lactobacillus johnsonii, and 322 to Lactobacillus crispatus.\n",

Interrogations of discrete contributors to community diversity revealed that the vaginal microbial community varied in pregnancy by gestational age and proximity to the cervix, but was less diverse and less rich overall (\nFigures 2B\n and \n3\n). To our knowledge, this structured molecular study of gravidae is unique in terms of stringency of a parallel clinical approach, sample acquisition from subjects, depth and robustness of analysis, and notable findings. In sum, the vaginal microbiome is distinctly structured by a state of health in most women\u2019s lifetime, i.e., pregnancy.",

Dominguez-Bello utilized 16S 454-generated molecular signatures to generate vaginal profiles in a limited sample set of 9 subjects at term with delivery (including non-laboring and active laboring mothers) from a remote population of Amerindians [9]. In this small sample set, the dominant vaginal taxa varied from mother to mother, also with notable variance in Lactobacillus spp. However, these investigations did not include parallel sampling of both non-pregnant and pregnant subjects, nor from multiple vaginal subsites [9]. However, this study was remarkable for its parallel acquisition of neonatal microbial community sampling. As supported by other studies [4]\u2013[12], the infant gut microbiome largely reflects the maternal mode of delivery, although it bears mention that in several studies women were delivered by cesarean for obstetrical indications in active and advanced labor thereby revealing a potential bias by virtue of infant handling in cesarean and vaginal birth and not solely a reflection of fetal descent via the birth canal [9]\u2013[12].",

Indeed, Ravel et al have previously reported that the vaginal microbiome in healthy, reproductive-aged women occupies states dominated by Lactobacillus iners and Lactobacillus crispatus specifically in association with low vaginal pH [40]. Others speculated [41] that vaginal community changes with pregnancy, but ours is the first direct evidence as such. Indeed, our findings suggest that at least among reproductive aged women, the vaginal microbiome remains a dynamic community in adult reproductive life, and that terminal differentiation does not occur per se\n[41]. Moreover, we observe persistent relative prevalence (but not sole nor absolute predominance) of Lactobacillus (\nFigure 4\n, AbundantOTU). However, across the entirety of our study population, less diversity and richness occurred in measured variance throughout weeks of gestation and in proximity to the uterus (posterior fornix), leading us to speculate on variances within the cusp of preterm viability. Of interest, in subjects closer to term OTU-based projections suggest that the non-pregnant community structure may return to some extent in the latter weeks of gestation. Our study is potentially limited by employing a cross-sectional comparison in gravidae (\nFigure 2\n), relative to a limited number of non-pregnant subjects with multiple samplings (18/301 specimens represented thrice sampling, see methods). Alternatively, when we compared only first samplings of non-pregnant women to gravidae, we still observed consistent cluster separation (data not shown). The most robust method to formally address the structure shifts in pregnancy would be to employ a longitudinal approach whereby each subject is sampled at ongoing weekly intervals across pregnancy. However, that is outside the scope of this initial study.",

While this enabled us to make true comparisons to a large, robust, and unparalleled dataset of non-pregnant subjects, it similarly opened the possibility that we were sampling an unperturbed but not \u201cnormal\u201d population. However, it bears mention that our outcomes among gravidae were entirely what might be anticipated in a health pregnant population (\nTable 2\n), and did not differ significantly among subjects. As with all large human cohorts, our study is prone to both alpha error and induced bias. We attempted to minimize error and bias with a single physician performing all subject sampling among both cohorts, and all samples being extracted from primary specimens within a single laboratory utilizing a common and rigorously tested protocol (HMP).",

Of note, we did not exclude gravid subjects by virtue of posterior fornix vaginal pH. In contrast, in the non-gravid HMP cohort subjects were excluded at the time of screening if the posterior fornix pH exceeded (see Methods). Given that <10% of screen failures (and <4% of the entire potential cohort) met such pH criteria for exclusion, we feel that this is an exceedingly unlikely potential confounder or bias. However, it cannot be formally excluded as such. To this end, in the recent publication of Ravel et al.,\n[40], the authors reported that while the pH and Nugent scores of each community demonstrated strong correlation between high pH and high Nugent scores and the highest pH values were associated with community states not dominated by species of Lactobacillus. It is of importance to note that these investigators employed self-sampling in their study. Nevertheless, the investigators also reported that elevated pH and high Nugent scores were observed in some communities with high proportions of lactobacillus species and that this was most true in communities which contained decreasing proportions of L. iners. However, this was not universally true, leading the authors to summize that these metrics cannot be predicted with absolute certainty solely on the basis of the proportion of Lactobacillus in a community [40]. We concur with these investigators summary statements, and note that when comparing our population of pregnant subjects to the non-pregnant HMP cohort we observed community discrimination by virtue of Lactobacillus species, namely L. iners, L. crispatus, L. jensenii and L. johnsonii. If our community distinctions were the result of an incidental inclusion of pregnanc subjects with a posterior fornix pH >4.5, then we would anticipate potentially seeing a decreasing proportion L. iners in the community structure. However, the opposite holds true (\nFigure 5\n) making confounding by version of pH unlikely.",

In any emerging field of study, optimal measures of data analysis are not evident to investigators at the forefront and different methodologic approaches may yield variance in significance of findings [28], [42]\u2013[46]. With this in mind, we employed a diverse and robust set of bioinformatic tools in analysis of our datasets (see Methods). For community cluster distinction (beta metrics), we analyzed taxa by nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic methods. Regardless of distance metric or phylogenetic analysis, the vaginal microbiome distinctly clustered by virtue of pregnancy (\nFigures 1\n\n, \n\n2A\n\n, and \n4\n). As AbundantOTU uses a consensus alignment algorithm, thus tending to concentrate on OTUs of greater abundance. Detection of rare species is difficult to differentiate from sequencing error. QIIME denoiser preempts this difficulty with a pre-filter to reduce the needs of all-on-all comparison; each additional unclustered read is compared to the most abundant clusters to discern sequencing error probability from detection of rare bacterial species retained in the OTU table. Regardless of methodology, our results from AbundantOTU and QIIME denoising are strikingly similar in terms of differentiating OTU identified (\nFigure 4\n). This finding is further evident at the species level, as detailed in \nFigure 5\n.",

We persistently observed less richness and diversity in pregnant communities when compared with parallel non-pregnant subject cohorts, regardless of computational pipeline, tool employed, or means of data projection (\nFigures 2B\n and \n3\n). The limited results analyses at the genus level, and the number of significantly differential OTUs (\nFigure 5\n), both suggest that it is subgenus taxa that most strongly contribute to observed alterations in community structure in pregnancy. This was supported by two complementary rigorous denoising approaches to our dataset. AbundantOTU and QIIME. The former resulted in diminished OTU estimates (868 versus 1,121 OTUs), but both agreed in the predominance of lactobacilli (\nFigure 4\n) irrespective of gravid condition and clades differential during pregnancy (\nFigure 5\n). With QIIME denoising, a broader set of taxon differences and less absolute predominance of Lactobacillus could be observed. While each denoising pipeline has its own strengths and limitations, one undeniable observation persists: the vaginal microbiome community is structured by pregnancy and varies with respect to richness, diversity, and specific microbial members.",

These include Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus johnsonii. Although it is outside the scope of this initial manuscript to delve deeply into the species differentiation and clinical implications, these findings are of probable biologic significance nevertheless. For example, L. johnsonii encodes enzymes and transporters essential for the release bile salt hydrolase and is primarily found in the upper GI tract [47]. In addition, the capacity for production of bacteriocins is a broad trait of the lactic acid bacteria and L. johnsonii production of Lactacin F both limits other lactobacillus as well as Enterococcus species in the GI tract. It\u2019s notable increased dominance in the vagina in pregnancy may be important for establishing the neonatal upper GI microbiota upon delivery, or preserving the integrity of the community to reduce risk of ascending infection or preterm birth.",

We took advantage of our role as clinical investigators with the Human Microbiome Project (K.A., J.P., and J.V., Baylor College of Medicine) [27] and employed parallel recruitment of non-gravid (non-pregnant) and gravid subjects using rigorous standardized sampling protocols. Subjects were recruited from the general population with general media and institutional advertisements, in addition to institutional study enrollment web sites and approach during previously scheduled clinical appointments. An initial telephone query included a general health questionnaire to screen interested individuals who would be evaluated by a list of inclusion/exclusion criteria including a pre-pregnancy or current body mass index range of 18\u201335, history of cancer, compromised immune status, history of specified chronic diseases, or medication exposure within the last six months (e.g., antibiotics, corticosteroids, cytokines, large doses of probiotics, etc.). Major dietary changes and history of moderate-high alcohol intake excluded individuals. Medications and dietary components that potentially might alter the human microbiome intentionally such as antibiotics and probiotics served as additional important exclusion criteria. Females were required to have a regular 21\u201335 day menstrual cycle or a history of regular cycles prior to beginning contraception or at the time of conception, and the use of specific contraceptives such as the combination hormone vaginal ring was exclusionary in non-gravid subjects. For gravidae, inclusion criteria additionally detailed best obstetrical dating for gestational age, defined as reliable last menstrual period consistent with <12 week sonogram or <10 week sonographic dating with unreliable last menstrual period. At the time of enrollment, all gravid subjects had presumed normal singleton gestations and were without known maternal comorbidities (such as type II DM, gestational diabetes type A2, hypertensive disorders, or chronic medical conditions). However, given the prospective nature of the study with early second trimester enrollment, some subjects developed these comorbidities (\nTable 1\n). Individuals who remained interested in the study and met study criteria were invited for a screening visit in the research clinic (non-gravid), or approached at their next scheduled clinic visit (gravid).",

Investigators determined final study eligibility by taking a medical history and performing a review of systems, documenting concomitant medications, measuring vital signs, collecting urine for pregnancy testing (non-gravid) and either obtaining blood for serum HIV, HBV and HCV testing or reviewing previously obtained serologies (all required to be negative). In addition, all subjects underwent targeted physical exams with attention to body site-specific exclusion criteria (oral cavity, skin and nasal cavity), and among non-gravid subjects measuring vaginal pH in females (pH>4.5 at posterior fornix was exclusionary). Gravid subjects did not undergo vaginal pH measurements as per study protocol limitations but were queried as to signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis and excluded if reported. Individuals who passed all screening criteria were eligible for enrollment and were sampled the first time within 30 days of the screening visit (non-gravid), or at the time of the prenatal visit (gravid). Although exclusion of non-gravidae for posterior fornix pH>4.5 at the time of screening was exceedingly rare (notably with only 22 of 254 screen failures in the HMP occurring by virtue of vaginal irritation or posterior fornix pH>4.5; 554 potential subjects were screened to ultimately enroll 300 in total for the HMP [http://www.hmpdacc.org/micro_analysis/microbiome_sampling.php]), it remains a formal possibility that our cohort comparison may be biased as posterior fornix pH was not an exclusionary criteria in our pregnant cohort.",

Enrollment criteria were established at approximately 20% minority (racial and ethnic) subjects. While in the index study protocol, two ethnically, racially, and socieconomically diverse U.S. cities (Houston, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri) served as geographically distinct study sites for clinical sampling for this comparison. However, only subjects sampled at Baylor College of Medicine were considered in the comparison cohort. This served to limit potential additional variables, including personnel doing the sampling (all gravid and non-gravid subjects were sampled by one investigator [K.A.]), site of microbial DNA extraction, and regional variability. To assure compliance of screening and sampling measures, a common set of human study protocols and consent forms were created, reviewed independently and subsequently approved at Baylor College of Medicine. An age range of 18\u201340 years was established to minimize variability due to childhood growth and development, aging, and hormonal influences during adolescence and menopause. Each of the enrolled non-gravid subjects agreed to primary and repeat (second) sampling so as many individuals as possible were sampled twice. A subset of non-gravid subjects was designated to undergo three samplings at each body site, at a priori designated intervals.",

The protocol for collection was as follows: in non-gravid subjects, the pH was measured at the vaginal introitus (Oakton pH meter, Vernon Hills, IL) and among both cohorts the vaginal introitus specimen was collected first. A clear, small or medium Pederson speculum (manufacturer) was thereafter introduced in the absence of lubrication, and turned to an approximate 45 degree angle to enable placement of the Oakton pH meter at the posterior fornix for determination of posterior fornix pH (non-gravid subjects). In both gravid and non-gravid, the posterior fornix sample was collected, then the speculum was slowly withdrawn to the midpoint of the vagina and the midpoint specimen was obtained.

AbundantOTU is a robust and fast OTU picking approach, which uses a consensus alignment algorithm to infer consensus sequences from full-length 16S pyrosequences. Since it relies on sequence redundancy, sequencing errors will have less effect on the OTU picking process compared with other clustering based methods. Rare species, which tend to cause inflated species diversity estimations [30], are not included. In our case, 87% of all input sequences were assigned to 194 consensus sequences. For QIIME denoising, the sequences from all samples were processed through QIIME\u2019s 454 dataset denoising pipeline (version 1.3), whereby the sff files from 301 non-pregnant samples and the sff file from the 68 pregnant samples were grouped into one complete dataset for denoising [31], resulting in the production of an OTU table for all 369 samples in a single run on a local cluster utilizing 75 processing cores [32], [42], [43]. Chimeric sequences in the representative sequence sets picked from denoised fasta files were detected by ChimeraSlayer and subsequently removed from the OTU table. In order to account for artifacts that may arise from multiple sequencing runs and separate denoising runs, all samples were denoised together in all alpha diversity, supervised and unsupervised learning, and feature selection pipelines.",

This pipeline was designed to utilize the output of the OTU picking step (OTU table and meta data file) as the only necessary input. Analyzing the biodiversity within a group of samples provides insight into the differences in species richness, evenness, abundance; we employed the methods of Chao1 [35] and Shannon [36] as we were analyzing groups of samples. Plots were generated and exported for species richness, rank-abundance, and Renyi\u2019s diversity indices [34] whereby species richness plots depict the number of species (OTUs) on the y-axis and the number of sites (samples) on the x-axis such that rank-abundance curves rank and list the most abundant OTUs from left to right on the x-axis and top to bottom on the y-axis. The width of the curve on the on the horizontal axis of a species richness plot serves as an indicator of richness: a wide curve indicates higher species richness and a narrow curve indicates the opposite. The shape of the rank-abundance curve is an indicator of species evenness: a horizontal curve indicates a completely evenly distributed system, whereas a steep curve indicates a less even distribution of species [48]. Rank abundance has been demonstrated to successfully show the extent that tag pyrosequencing illuminates the rare biosphere of the human gut [37]. Based on prior evidence, we assumed that Renyi diversity profiles are helpful in analyzing the differences in diversity and evenness between multiple subsets of samples [34], [37], [50]. If the curves from one sample set contain greater y-axis values, then it can be concluded that this sample set has greater diversity. However, if the two curves intersect at any point, the sample sets are said to be non-comparable, which may reflect important ecological processes [51].",

Machine learning algorithms are useful in determining the strength of meta data clusters (bagging, binning, etc.) as well as listing the most important variables involved in discriminating two groups of samples (feature selection). The algorithm randomForest enabled classification of groups of samples by constructing a classification tree, randomly sampling the predictors, choosing the best splitting variables, and predicting new data by combining the predictions from all trees in order to estimate the error rate [\u201cout-of-bag\u201d (OOB)] and list the highest performing variables. We secondarily applied the R package Boruta to explicitly perform feature selection [33], [39], [58]\u2013[60]. Linear discriminate analysis effect size (LEfSe) is a novel method developed to support for high dimensional class comparisons in metagenomics analysis [61]. LEfSe combines the standard tests for statistical significance (Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise Wilcoxon test) with linear discriminate analysis for feature selection. In addition to detecting significant features, it also ranks features by effect size, which put features explain most of the biological difference at top. Pregnant and Non-pregnant were indicated as two classes with no subclass indicated. Alpha value for the factorial Kruskal-Wallis test is 0.05.
