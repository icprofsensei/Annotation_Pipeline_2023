However, the associations between human placental microbiota and GDM are poorly understood. We aimed to profile the placental microbiota of GDM and further define whether or not certain placental microbiota taxon correlates with specific clinical characteristics. Placenta were collected from GDM women and women with normal pregnancies (n = 10, in each group) consecutively recruited at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The anthropometric parameters of mother and infant, and cord blood hormones, including insulin, leptin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were measured. Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated using magnetic beads and the human placental microbiota was analyzed using the Illumina MiSeq Sequencing System based on the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. It showed there was no statistical difference in the clinical characteristics of mothers and infants, such as BMI at the beginning of pregnancy and gestational weight gain (GWG), birth weight, and cord blood hormones, including insulin, leptin and IGF-1. We found that the placental microbiota is composed of four dominant phyla from Proteobacteria (the most abundant), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, with the proportion of Proteobacteria increased, and Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were decreased of women with GDM. Further analyses suggested that bacterial taxonomic composition of placentas from the phylum level down to the bacteria level, differed significantly between women with GDM and non-GDM women with normal pregnancies. Regression analysis showed a cluster of key operational taxonomic units (OTUs), phyla and genera were significantly correlated with GWG during pregnancy of mothers, and cord blood insulin, IGF-1 and leptin concentrations. In conclusion, our novel study showed that a distinct placental microbiota profile is present in GDM, and is associated with clinical characteristics of mothers and infants. This study contributes to the theoretical foundation on the potential relationship between placental microbiota and GDM.",

A particularly alarming trend is that gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has also increased dramatically, along with increasing rates of obesity (Dabelea et al., 2005; Sacks et al., 2012). In 2015, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that one in seven births is affected by GDM (International Diabetes Federation, 2015). World Health Organization stated in 2016 that about 50% female population are currently overweight (World Health Organization, 2016) and are at high risk of developing GDM. Women with GDM had considerable risks of developing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality (Hillier et al., 2007). For the mothers, it can increase the susceptibility of undergoing a Caesarian section, preeclampsia and postpartum development of T2DM (Capula et al., 2014). Adverse outcomes in infants include macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, preterm birth, and metabolic dysfunction such as neonatal hypoglycemia (Hillier et al., 2007; Metzger et al., 2008; Catalano et al., 2012). In addition, offspring of women with GDM may be more likely to develop obesity, insulin resistance and early-onset T2DM in young adulthood (Kubo et al., 2014), which has been clearly revealed by the \u201cDevelopmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD)\u201d hypothesis (Wallack and Thornburg, 2016; Baird et al., 2017). Therefore, GDM not only increases adverse pregnancy outcomes, but also has long-term deleterious effects on the metabolic health of mothers and their offspring.",

A metagenome-wide association study showed that gut microbiota were closely related with T2DM (Qin et al., 2012). However, as an important organ for fetal development, growth and survival during pregnancy, limited studies were about the placenta, especially with the bacteria within it (Watson and Cross, 2005). Until recently, it is widely accepted that the placenta are \u201csterile,\u201d that is essential to protect the fetus from infections (Wassenaar and Panigrahi, 2014). However, increasing evidence indicate that microbes is present in the normal placenta. In a cohort with 320 subjects, Aagaard et al. found a unique placental microbiome profile, composed of non-pathogenic commensal microbiota and were most akin to the oral microbiome (Aagaard et al., 2014; Pelzer et al., 2016). Compelling evidence suggests that placental microbiota are associated with pregnancy outcomes and human diseases. Doyle et al. showed that preterm labor were correlated with distinct microbial communities in placentas (Doyle et al., 2014). One previous study suggested that excess gestational weight gain (GWG) was correlated with an altered placental microbiome among women who experienced a preterm birth (Antony et al., 2015). Our previous data showed that placental microbiome was distinct in full-term neonates with low birth weight (Zheng et al., 2015). However, the relationship between placental microbiota and GDM are poorly understood. Given that GDM is a high risk factor of multiple adverse outcomes, we aimed to study the placental microbiota in GDM and further define whether or not certain placental microbiota taxon correlates with specific clinical characteristics.",

The age and BMI at the beginning of the first trimester were matched between pregnant women with GDM and non-GDM women, in order to avoid any bias related to age and gestational obesity/overweight. All the pregnant women with GDM were intervened by lifestyle changes, including diets and exercise, in order to avoid any bias due to medications. In addition, several studies have shown the mode of delivery (Cesarean section vs. vaginal delivery) could affect the gut microbiota composition of newborns (Mackie et al., 1999; Dominguez-Bello et al., 2010), which may affect placental microbiota. Thus, we only included women in labor who delivered by cesarean section, in order to minimize the potential confounders of delivery mode and placenta microbiota.",

Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained by clustering the reads with 97% similarity by UPARSE (version 7.1, http://drive5.com/uparse/). Rarefaction analysis and Shannon diversity index were calculated according to the OTUs with their relative abundance by QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010).

Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was calculated with the distance matrix according to the weighted UniFrac algorithm (Lozupone et al., 2006).

The two dominant phyla, with Proteobacteria (36.91 vs. 21.09%, P = 0.046) and Bacteroidetes (5.43 vs. 7.03%, P = 0.029) both exhibited statistically significant differences between GDM and NDM placenta tissue. The proportion of Firmicutes (2.34 vs. 4.53%, P = 0.083) had a tendency to be decreased in GDM group, compared to controls. The microbial composition was also comparable at the genus level, with 15 genera between GDM and NDM placenta tissues. Bacteroidales_S24-7_group_norank, Lactobacillus, Rhodocyclaceae_norank, Brevibacillus, Armatimonadetes_norank, Candidatus_Brocadia, PHOS-HE36_norank, Sulfuricella, Xanthomonadales_uncultured, Geothrix, TRA3-20_norank, Cyanobacteria_norank and Dyella exhibited a relatively lower abundance in GDM placentas. Alcaligenaceae_unclassified and Thauera were relatively more abundant in GDM group, compared to NDM group (Table \u200b(Table2).2). Additional information regarding the differences at the taxonomical level of order between GDM and NDM groups can be found in Table S2. Collectively, these observations suggest that microbial composition of placentas differed significantly between GDM and non-GDM women, according to the relative abundance of sequences.",

It showed that Proteobacteria, the most abundant phylum of placental microbiota, was negatively correlated with insulin level (r = \u22120.58, P = 0.042) (Figure \u200b(Figure6A).6A). In addition, Pseudomonas, one dominant genus of placenta bacteria composition, was associated with decreased insulin concentration (r = \u22120.60, P = 0.043) (Figure \u200b(Figure6B).6B). We also found Staphylococcus (P < 0.05) and Allobaculum (P < 0.05) genera were both correlated with higher leptin level. Bifidobacterium (P < 0.001) and Methylobacterium (P < 0.05) genera were both positively associated with IGF-1 level (Figure S3). Thus, these demonstrated that the specific phylum, genus and OTU were significantly correlated with clinical characteristics of the mother and infant, including cord blood insulin, IGF-1 and leptin levels, and may play a critical role in regulating glucose metabolism status, development and growth of the fetus.",

Mothers with history of GDM are more likely to develop postpartum insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (Gobl et al., 2014), placing affected women at risk of T2DM and cardiovascular diseases later in life (Goueslard et al., 2016; Retnakaran and Shah, 2017). The affected offspring are also closely related with risks for metabolic diseases in adult life (Damm et al., 2016). Placental microbiota plays an important role in normal healthy pregnancy, preterm birth, chorioamnionitis and preeclampsia (Pelzer et al., 2016). However, the studies about placental microbiota exposed to GDM are limited. To date, there is only one published study investigating the effect of GDM on the placental microbiota, with decreased abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes (Bassols et al., 2016). However, our study is more convincing because the delivery mode of all the subjects is consistent. Moreover, our study for the first time examined placenta micorbiota with GDM a Chinese population.",

In accordance with previous studies (Aagaard et al., 2014; Antony et al., 2015; Bassols et al., 2016), our study demonstrated that the placental microbiota is composed of four dominant phyla from Proteobacteria (the most abundant), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, with the proportion of Proteobacteria increased, and Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were decreased of women with GDM. Further analyses suggested that bacterial taxonomic composition of placentas differed significantly between women with GDM and non-GDM women with normal pregnancies. Additionally, specific metabolic hormones were shown to be associated with bacterial abundance in overweight and obese pregnant women, indicating a connection between metabolic hormones and the microbiota during pregnancy (Gomez-Arango et al., 2016). We found certain specific phylum, genus and OTU were associated with clinical characteristics of mother and infant, including cord blood insulin, IGF-1 and leptin level. It suggests that placenta microbiota may potentially regulate glucose metabolism status, development and growth of the fetus. However, no causal relationship can be inferred from this study due to the cross-sectional design, and more evidence and further investigation are needed.",

                    "text": "The origin of the bacteria in the placental microbiota in healthy and unhealthy pregnancies is not fully explored. Three main routes have been proposed: the oral-fetoplacental, gastrointestinal-feto-placental and the genitourinary-fetoplacental routes of placental innoculation (Kuperman and Koren, 2016). Furthermore, the placenta can mediate the negative effects associated with maternal insulin resistance on the fetus. Several studies suggest placentas from humans with GDM and placentas from non-human primates and rodent mothers with insulin resistance have increased hypoxia, oxidative stress, cytokine production, and inflammation in placentas (Radaelli et al., 2003; Li et al., 2013). Previously, it reported a relationship between commensal microbiota and inflammatory parameters (Hanski et al., 2012). Round JL et al. noted that placental microbiota may play a potential role in healthy barrier function and fetal homeostasis (Round and Mazmanian, 2009). It indicated that abundance of Acinetobacter is associated with blood eosinophil counts and expression of anti-inflammatory genes in placenta, such as interleukin-10 (Bassols et al., 2016). Maternal probiotic supplementation with Bifidobacterium lactis, a genus positively correlated with cord blood IGF-1 level in our study, regulated Toll-like receptor (TLR)-related genes expression in the placenta tissue and in the fetal gut (Rautava et al., 2012). Collectively, all the evidence supports the possibility that the changes in placental microbiota in GDM may be related to the increased inflammatory status and activated immune system in women with GMD.",

                    "text": "Several strengths and potential limitations should be taken into consideration. Our study has some notable strengths. First, 16S rRNA gene was sequenced by Illumina MiSeq technology, a reliable and widely used high-throughput sequencing platform, which can ensure placental bacteria be successfully identified. Second, the process of sample collection is rigorously sterile and the microbiota analysis is robust, with high quality, accuracy and reproducibility of sequencing. Third, only the fetuses delivered by Cesarean section were enrolled in our study, which can avoid confounding factors with delivery modes. However, several limitations should be taken into consideration. First, the sample size was small. Because the process of subjects' enrollment is strict and complex, we only included babies who were delivered by Cesarean section and mothers whose BMI at the beginning of first trimester were matched. Thus, all these factors restricted the size of our sample. Our ongoing study is aimed at enlarging the sample size. In addition, due to that all the participants included in this study were all recruited in the same hospital, hence potential regional differences in placental microbiota could not be assessed. Our further work will design a multi-center clinical study to fully investigate and compare the placental microbiota among subjects with GDM among different regions. Furthermore, due to the very low sample size, it does not allow to exclude a \u03b2 error when a significant result is not reached. This, at least in part, could explain the difference with the previous study (Bassols et al., 2016). Second, our study only focused on bacterial taxonomic composition of these communities in placentas rather than on the functional features they express. Thus, the role of intricate microbial communities on maternal and fetal health is still not clear. Therefore, metagenomic analysis in placentas, and even its associations with metabonomics will be determined in our future study. Third, it is a cross-sectional study, which does not allow to infer the causality between placental microbiota and the development of GDM. Thus, well-controlled longitudinal studies are critically important to understanding how changes in the placenta microbiota determine the development of GDM and its effects on mothers and infants. However, our present study is still novel because it provided an important basis for further studies about placenta microbiota of women with GDM.",

It contributes to the current theoretical foundation on the potential relationship between placental microbiota and GDM. As the prevalence of GDM has increased over the years, a better understanding of the connections between placental microbiota and the development of GDM would be of great benefit, and help to ensure a healthier future for the mothers and infants. Thus, high-quality, large-scale clinical studies and further pre-clinical experiments to clarify the underlying mechanisms are urgently warranted.",
