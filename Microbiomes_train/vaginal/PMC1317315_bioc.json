Sixteen bacterial strains commonly found in the human vagina were used to construct model communities that were subsequently used to develop efficient means for the isolation of genomic DNA and an optimal strategy for T-RFLP analyses. The various genera in the model community could best be resolved by digesting amplicons made using bacterial primers 8f and 926r with HaeIII; fewer strains could be resolved using other primer-enzyme combinations, and no combination successfully distinguished certain species of the same genus. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, samples from five women that had been collected over a 2-month period were analyzed. Differences and similarities among the vaginal microbial communities of the women were readily apparent. The T-RFLP data suggest that the communities of three women were dominated by a single phylotype, most likely species of Lactobacillus. In contrast, the communities of two other women included numerically abundant populations that differed from Lactobacillus strains whose 16S rRNA genes had been previously determined. The T-RFLP profiles of samples from all the women were largely invariant over time, indicating that the kinds and abundances of the numerically dominant populations were relatively stable throughout two menstrual cycles. These findings show that T-RFLP of 16S rRNA genes can be used to compare vaginal microbial communities and gain information about the numerically dominant populations that are present.",

In healthy women, vaginal communities are typically dominated by various species of lactobacilli that number approximately 108 CFU per ml (or g) of vaginal secretion. The remainder of the community varies among women in terms of both the kinds and abundances of species present (3, 29, 34, 38). Investigators have demonstrated the occurrence of coagulase-negative staphylococci, group B streptococci, and species of Corynebacterium, Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, Gardnerella, enteric bacteria, and various other taxa (38). The typical abundance of these populations ranges from 104 to 106 CFU per ml. Other than a common presence of lactobacilli, it is not yet possible to rigidly define the structure of a normal vaginal community given the data that are available.",

The ecological mechanisms by which Lactobacillus spp. work to exclude such organisms have not been unequivocally established, but they are believed to be linked to products of their metabolism, including organic acids, which create a low-pH environment that is unfavorable to many bacterial species, and H2O2, which is microbicidal in vitro (22, 23).",

Moreover, there is a distinct possibility that various taxa that are indigenous to the human vagina may have been overlooked due to limitations in the methodologies that have been used. Prior efforts to characterize the vaginal flora have largely employed methods that are commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories (14, 29). These methods are inherently limited because they require cultivation of organisms on selective and nonselective media in the laboratory, after which they are classified into broad taxonomic groups based on phenetic characters and microscopy. Slow-growing, strictly anaerobic, or fastidious organisms may not be recovered by these methods. Others may be overgrown or otherwise overlooked because investigators are unaware of their ability to grow on selective media. Finally, the coarse classification methods used probably do not distinguish ecotypically distinct populations in samples. While these studies have been invaluable because they provide at least some information about the kinds and abundances of organisms in the human vagina, they suffer from incompleteness and often fail to provide sufficiently detailed information.",

                    "text": "Culture-independent methods based on the analysis of 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences of microorganisms offer the possibility to overcome many of the limitations described above, and they have been successfully used in numerous studies to explore the microbial diversity in various habitats (7, 20, 56, 57). These methods consistently reveal the existence of novel taxa and result in a perception of diversity that is quite different from that provided by cultivation-dependent methods (42). Moreover, several of these methodologies lend themselves to the analysis of large numbers of samples and therefore may be useful in studies on the ecology of the human vagina. In one such method, profiles of microbial communities based on the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of 16S rRNA genes are produced (31), and these profiles provide insight into the phylogeny of the populations present in the samples (33; C. Shyu et al., unpublished data). Briefly, rRNA genes are amplified from total community DNA by using PCR wherein one or both of the primers used are labeled with a fluorescent dye. The mixture of amplicons is then digested with one or more restriction enzymes that have 4-base-pair recognition sites, and the sizes and relative abundances of the fluorescently labeled T-RFs are determined using an automated DNA sequencer. Since differences in the sizes of T-RFs reflect differences in the sequences of 16S rRNA genes, phylogenetically distinct populations of organisms can be resolved. Thus, the pattern of terminal restriction fragments observed is a composite of DNA fragments with unique lengths that reflects the diversity and composition of the numerically dominant populations in the community. While this method shares problems inherent to any PCR-based method, it has been shown to provide a facile means to assess changes in microbial community structure on temporal or spatial scales, based on the gain or loss of specific fragments from the profiles (39).",

Sterile water was added to a final volume of 20 \u03bcl. Each cycle sequencing reaction consisted of 25 cycles, and each cycle included a melting step at 96\u00b0C for 10 s, followed by primer annealing at 50\u00b0C for 5 s and extension at 60\u00b0C for 4 min. Prior to sequence analysis, the products were purified using the isopropanol precipitation method as described by the manufacturer. Sequence data were collected using an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer and analyzed using the AutoAssembler version 2.0 software package (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained were matched with all sequences presently available from the databases of the Ribosomal Database Project (32) and GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.gov) to identify their closest relatives.",

After overnight incubation, the cells were harvested from each culture and plasmid DNAs were extracted. The 16S rRNA gene inserts were individually amplified by PCR using the conditions described above and subjected to terminal restriction fragment analysis as described above. Clones yielding T-RFs that corresponded to those in the T-RFLP profile were sequenced, and the data were analyzed as described above. Ten clones representing each T-RF were sequenced, and all were sequenced if there were fewer than 10 clones for a given T-RF.",

The optimal combination of primers and restriction enzyme(s) would be that which produces 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 T-RFs that differ in size, thus providing a means to resolve all members of the community. Pairs of four commonly used bacterial primers, namely, 8f, 341f, 926r, and 1406r, were used. Seven restriction enzymes that are frequently used in T-RFLP analyses (13, 31) were evaluated; these were AluI, HhaI, HaeIII, MvnI, RsaI, MspI, and HinfI. Combinations of primers and restriction enzymes were tested on axenic cell suspensions of 16 bacterial strains commonly found in the vaginal tracts of healthy women. Primers 8f and 926r were superior to 341f and 1406r when used in combination with HaeIII, HhaI, and MspI, which were equally effective in their ability to resolve populations found in the vagina. The predicted sizes of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 HaeIII fragments from vaginal bacteria are shown in Table \u200bTable22.",

Both model communities were constructed by addition of known amounts of cells that had been quantified bydirect microscopic counts of DAPI-stained cells, rather than by addition of known amounts of DNA. Analyses done on communities constructed on the basis of equal amounts of DNA could be misleading, since genome sizes and 16S rRNA gene copy number vary among bacterial species (15, 16). Furthermore, various factors (including cell wall composition and architecture) can markedly affect the efficiency of cell lysis. For these reasons, it was preferable to construct the model communities by addition of known amounts of intact cells.",

This was consistent with the outcome predicted based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences (Table \u200b(Table2).2). For unknown reasons, the 3\u2032 T-RFs from Peptostreptococcus vaginalis and Peptostreptococcus magnus were absent from the profile. Digestion of PCR products from the 16S rRNA genes of Peptostreptococcus vaginalis and Peptostreptococcus magnus resulted in the 210-bp-long 5\u2032 T-RF; however, the 3\u2032 T-RFs were missing. The variation in the quantity (peak area) of the various T-RFs as well as the absence of T-RFs derived from both Prevotella species could be explained by differences in the efficiency of cell lysis or 16S rRNA gene copy number between various bacterial strains (15, 16), preferential amplification of specific 16S rRNA genes, or other unknown causes (26, 50).",

The total number of Lactobacillus cells (8.2 \u00d7 109) in model community B exceeded that of other species by at least 2 orders of magnitude. In experiments in which DNA from 108 cells of Lactobacillus strain 1 was mixed with DNA from a known number of cells from Staphylococcus epidermidis strain 1, the limit of detection of the latter organism was roughly 1% of the total number of organisms (data not shown). This was in agreement with experiments done by Dunbar (10), who found that only populations that constituted between 0.1 and 1% of a bacterial community could be detected in T-RFLP profiles. Thus, it was expected that T-RFs from strains other than lactobacilli would be absent from the T-RFLP profile of model community B.",

The T-RFLP profiles of swab samples taken from the left and right sides of the vagina (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2)2) were virtually the same, suggesting that the methodology was reproducible. The simplicity of the profiles was consistent with the notion that comparatively few populations of bacteria dominate vaginal communities. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA clones prepared from the same samples showed that these samples had high numbers of populations closely related to Lactobacillus crispatus (T-RF pair G245/B459) and three other species (T-RF pairs G287/B590, G287/B459, and G335/B590) and that all of the fragments in the T-RFLP profile could be accounted for in the library (data not shown). The three populations were only distantly related to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus johnsonii and were phylogenetically distinct from L. crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus gasseri, three species of Lactobacillus known to commonly occur in the human vagina (2, 24, 40). The lack of sequence similarity to known species of Lactobacillus suggests these may be phylotypes that were not previously known to reside in the human vagina.",

                    "text": "The T-RFLP profiles of microbial communities in different women and within an individual over a 2-month period of time were compared. Differences and similarities among women were readily apparent (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3).3). The vaginal communities of woman 2 and woman 3 had identical simple profiles that contained a single 5\u2032 fragment and a single 3\u2032 fragment, with sizes of 244 and 452 bp, respectively. This suggests that these communities had a limited number of numerically dominant populations, and perhaps only a single population. The profiles of woman 4 and woman 1 differed from each other and from those of women 2 and 3. Like for women 2 and 3, a single 5\u2032 fragment and a single 3\u2032 fragment, with sizes of 220 and 179 bp, respectively, dominated the T-RFLP profile of woman 1. The community of woman 4 had at least two phylogenetically distinct populations, which yielded two 5\u2032 T-RFs that were 286 and 331 bp and a single 3\u2032 T-RF that was 588 bp. Comparisons of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 T-RFs found in the communities of women 2, 3, and 4 to those predicted from in silico analyses of known 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the numerically dominant populations in these women were species of Lactobacillus. This is in contrast to the results of comparable analyses done on the numerically dominant population(s) present in the vaginal community of woman 1. None of the 16S rRNA gene sequences from species of Lactobacillus would yield the 220-bp 5\u2032 fragment or a 179-bp 3\u2032 fragment. Analyses done using algorithms available on the Microbial Community Analysis website (http://mica.ibest.uidaho.edu/) suggest that these fragments might be produced by Atopobium fossor, which would be expected to yield 221-bp 5\u2032 and 180-bp 3\u2032 fragments, while data obtained by Zhou et al. (55) suggest that the population could be Atopobium vaginae, which would produce 220-bp 5\u2032 and 179-bp 3\u2032 fragments. Of course, the possibility that it is some as-yet-uncharacterized phylotype cannot be excluded. Interestingly, the community of woman 5 appeared to be a composite of those found in women 1 and 4 and contained all the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 fragments found in these communities. Given this, it appeared that woman 5 also had numerically dominant phylotypes that were not species of Lactobacillus. Analyses of samples collected from each woman four times over a 2-month period indicate that the numerically dominant populations in these communities remained remarkably constant (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4)4) even though the samples were collected from each woman during menses as well as at other times during their menstrual cycles, from the left and right sides of the vagina, and with scrapers as well as cotton swabs (data not shown).",

Conclusions i and ii are consistent with those of previous studies (3, 19, 30, 53), whereas this represents the first instance where populations other than lactobacilli have been shown to be numerically dominant in the vaginal communities of healthy women. Additional studies are needed to verify this observation, since only a small number of women were included in this study.",

The skewed species abundance of vaginal communities gives rise to a deceptively simple T-RFLP profile when universal bacterial primers are used to amplify 16S rRNA genes. Since populations of lactobacilli often outnumber others by 10- to 100-fold, they can easily mask the presence of other taxa that may be present in the community. This is expected, given that 16S rRNA genes from lactobacilli would constitute the majority of template sequences in total community DNA used in the PCRs. In analogous studies done on other habitats, investigators have overcome this problem though the use of group primers that selectively amplify genes from phylogenetic groups that were less abundant (35, 52). It is very likely that one could use a similar approach to study the ecology of the human vagina. The instrumentation and methodologies used to analyze samples based on T-RFLP, namely, PCR and the analysis of DNA fragments, can readily be scaled up to accommodate large numbers of samples. This provides the means to conduct studies in which large numbers of individuals are sampled or to assess the temporal and spatial dynamics of vaginal communities. The T-RFLP data obtained from such studies can readily be analyzed using various statistical algorithms to quantitatively ascertain similarities and differences among communities and to infer plausible community structures (http://mica.ibest.uidaho.edu/). More-detailed information on the composition of any given community (or representatives of a group of samples) can be obtained by the construction and phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. Thus, the use of these methods provides a facile means to study the microbial ecology of the human vagina, while avoiding many of the limitations of culture-dependent methods.",

Moreover, the means to identify women whose vaginal communities are more susceptible to upset is an essential step if we hope to intervene and employ preventive measures that reduce this risk.

A sentinel species is commonly an indigenous species that has been found to be particularly sensitive to changes in biological, physical, or chemical characteristics of the environment and responds through either an increase or (more commonly) a decrease in population size. The chain of events that cause an increase or decrease in the abundance of a sentinel species can be simple, wherein the environmental change directly affects the reproductive success of the species, or it may be complex and arise indirectly through a series of ecological events that connect the causes and changes in the population size of the sentinel species. The \u201csentinel species\u201d concept is not widely employed in efforts to prevent or diagnose human diseases. Instead, the focus has been on understanding the composition of so-called normal flora and on the detection and identification of single species that are causative agents of various diseases. However, studies done more recently have shown that unhealthy conditions cannot always be attributed to single microbial species and sometimes arise from consortia of organisms (12, 54). This may well be the case for bacterial vaginosis (47), a condition that is clinically diagnosed based on various symptoms and general characteristics but not on the presence of any particular species of bacteria. Instead, bacterial vaginosis seems to reflect an upset in the normal community structure that is manifest in the outgrowth of various other populations, some of which may normally be present but at much lower numbers. In addition, the occurrence of disease is not entirely a function of a pathogen's virulence or ability to colonize a host, but it is also dependent on a variety of host factors that determine the susceptibility of an individual to infection, such as qualities of their immune system. Resistance to infection can also require the existence of a robust microbial community that can competitively exclude pathogenic organisms or create conditions that are unfavorable for the expression of virulence determinants. Given this, a desirable objective would be to develop the means to predict whether there is an increased risk of an individual contracting an infection due to shifts in the composition of the microbial community or changes in the abundance of specific populations. However, it is impractical to rely on exhaustive species inventories as a means to achieve this end. Instead, it would be more useful to identify one or more species whose numbers are responsive to and indicative of an impending or existing unhealthy condition\u2014in other words, sentinel species of the vaginal ecosystem. The first step toward identification of potential sentinel species is to better define the species composition of the vaginal microbial community by using methods that provide more-detailed and more-comprehensive information than those previously used. The second step is to better define variations in community composition and population sizes that occur in healthy women so that disturbances that cause abnormal fluctuations can readily be identified. With these data in hand, rational predictions can be made concerning which members of the normal flora might best serve as sentinel species for the vaginal ecosystem.",
