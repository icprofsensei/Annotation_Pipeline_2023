                    "text": "The vaginal microbiome is believed to influence host health by providing protection from pathogens and influencing reproductive outcomes such as fertility and gestational length. In humans, age-associated declines in diversity of the vaginal microbiome occur in puberty and persist into adulthood. Additionally, menstruation has been associated with decreased microbial community stability. Adult female baboons, like other non-human primates (NHPs), have a different and highly diverse vaginal microbiome compared to that of humans, which is most commonly dominated by Lactobacillus spp. We evaluated the influence of age, reproductive cycling status (cycling vs. non-cycling) and menstruation on the vaginal microbiome of 38 wild-caught, captive female olive baboons (Papio anubis) by culture-independent sequencing of the V3\u2013V5 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. All baboons had highly diverse vaginal microbial communities. Adult baboons had significantly lower microbial diversity in comparison to subadult baboons, which was attributable to decreased relative abundance of minor taxa. No significant differences were detected based on cycling state or menstruation. Predictive metagenomic analysis showed uniformity in relative abundance of metabolic pathways regardless of age, cycle stage, or menstruation, indicating conservation of microbial community functions. This study suggests that selection of an optimal vaginal microbial community occurs at puberty. Since decreased diversity occurs in both baboons and humans at puberty, this may reflect a general strategy for selection of adult vaginal microbial communities. Comparative evaluation of vaginal microbial community development and composition may elucidate mechanisms of community formation and function that are conserved across host species or across microbial community types. These findings have implications for host health, evolutionary biology, and microbe-host ecosystems.",

The normal mucosal microbiome of humans and animals is believed to benefit host health through protection from pathogens and contribution to critical host functions including immune education, metabolism, and epithelial development [Ding & Schloss, 2014; Lozupone et al., 2012; Ravel et al., 2013; Sartor & Mazmanian, 2012]. The study of mucosal microbial communities has undergone a revolution over the past 10\u201315 years with the implementation of culture-independent, high throughput sequencing methods [Foster et al., 2012]. These DNA sequence-based techniques generate a more complete picture of microbial communities than was possible with culture-based methods, since the majority of all bacterial species identifiable by DNA-based techniques are non-cultivable [Foster et al., 2012].",

A \u201cmicrobial community\u201d consists of the composition of species in an ecologically grouped, multispecies assemblage of bacteria, considered with respect to taxonomy and relative abundance [Konopka, 2009]. The \u201cnormal\u201d vaginal microbial community of healthy women is classically defined by a predominance of Lactobacillus spp. Lactobacillus ferment glycogen into lactic acid, generating a low vaginal pH that is thought to prevent colonization and proliferation of potentially pathogenic organisms [Hickey et al., 2012; Linhares et al., 2011; O'Hanlon et al., 2011]. This community structure is not, however, universal to all primates. Although female non-human primates (NHPs) undergo similar reproductive physiological changes, they have a higher vaginal pH and significantly different vaginal microbial community composition than women [Hashway et al., 2014; Rivera et al., 2010,2011; Spear et al., 2010, 2012; Stumpf et al., 2013; Yildirim et al., 2014]. Specifically, the NHP vaginal microbiome has much greater diversity and a striking paucity of lactobacilli in comparison to that of women. Host-species was recently shown to be the most significant factor influencing vaginal microbial composition in a comparative analysis of humans and eight species of NHPs, yet inter-species host microbial community differences are not entirely explained by host phylogenetic differences [Rivera et al., 2010; Yildirim et al., 2014]. Furthermore, there is inter-individual variation within host species. In humans, approximately 27% of healthy, asymptomatic adult women have vaginal microbial communities that are not Lactobacillus dominant, and are highly diverse [Ravel et al., 2011]. For women with a Lactobacillus dominant vaginal microbiome, different species of Lactobacillus may predominate [Ravel et al., 2011]. In baboons, a recent study on a small number of baboons evaluated over 6 months showed that inter-animal variation exceeded intra-animal variation over the course of the study [Hashway et al., 2014].",

In women, age-related changes in the vaginal microbiome are correlated with levels of estrogen [Farage et al., 2010; Hickey et al., 2012]. In young children, the vaginal microbiome consists of a diverse mixture of aerobes, strict anaerobes, and enteric organisms [Hammerschlag et al., 1978; Hickey et al., 2012]. This changes during adolescence to the lower diversity, Lactobacillus-predominant community of adulthood [Gajer et al., 2012; Hammerschlag et al., 1978; Lamont et al., 2011; Ravel et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2004]. Community shifts and decreased stability have been correlated with menstruation in humans [Gajer et al., 2012; Hickey et al., 2013; Lopes dos Santos Santiago et al., 2011]. Additionally, follicular phases (higher estradiol) of the menstrual cycle have been associated with higher levels of community stability [Gajer et al., 2012]. The effects of age or reproductive cycle\u2013associated microbial changes in NHPs have not been extensively investigated. In particular, it is unknown whether the age and cycle-dependent alterations seen in humans are unique. Evaluation of the NHP vaginal microbiome in relation to life cycle or reproductive cycle stages may provide comparative insight into strategies used by host-microbial ecosystems to cope with the hormonal alterations and increased potential pathogen exposure associated with sexual maturity.",

Olive baboons share many anatomic and physiologic reproductive features with humans, including non-seasonal sexual receptivity and a relatively straight cervical canal, in contrast to the seasonal sexual receptivity and tortuous cervical canal of the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) [Fox, 2002; VandeBerg et al., 2008]. These features may lead to increased potential exposure to pathogens. To our knowledge, alterations of the baboon vaginal microbiome with respect to age or reproductive cycle have not been evaluated. The specific objective of this study was to characterize differences in the vaginal microbial community of wild-caught, captive baboons based on age, reproductive cycle stage, and menstruation. Based on human studies, we hypothesized that adult baboons would have decreased microbial diversity, potentially due to selection for the optimal mixture of bacteria necessary for host health during reproductive life.",

                    "text": "Microbial community analysis was undertaken using an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) approach. This approach involves grouping based on a priori sequence similarity, thus avoiding bias introduced by species assignation from sequence databases. Sequences were clustered into OTUs using a difference of 3% to define OTUs (approximately at the level of species differences). Microbial diversity is based upon species richness, defined as the number of OTUs present, and species evenness, defined as the proportion or relative abundance of different OTUs. Diversity was estimated by the Shannon diversity index, which is proportional to the natural logarithm of the relative abundance of each OTU [Magurran, 1988]. Microbial community richness was evaluated using the observed number of OTUs (Sobs), and the Chao1 richness estimator [Chao, 1984]. The latter is an estimate of expected richness in a given bacterial community and is predicted from the frequencies of rare OTUs present [Chao et al., 2009]. Evenness was determined by calculating the Shannon evenness score (Shannon equitability score) from the Shannon diversity index. Unpaired t tests (GraphPad Prism version 6.02 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) were used to compare richness, evenness, and diversity using a 95% confidence interval. Unpaired t-tests were also used to compare specific phylum-level relative abundances between groups. A Dirichlet Multinomial Mixtures (DMM) model [Holmes et al., 2012] was used to identify community types based on OTUs alone. OTU-based comparison was performed by construction of a distance matrix of the dissimilarity (1-similarity) between microbial communities and the Yue & Clayton measure of dissimilarity was calculated using the \u03b8YC calculator [Yue & Clayton, 2005]. The Yue Clayton measure is a comparison of community similarity that accounts for relative abundance of OTUs as well as community membership (the particular OTU or species). Results of the \u03b8YC dissimilarity calculation were visually represented by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and statistical significance was evaluated by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) [Anderson, 2001]. Significance of AMOVA was defined as P < 0.05, after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Phylogeny-based comparison of microbial communities was performed by weighted and unweighted UniFrac analysis [Lozupone & Knight, 2005; Lozupone et al., 2007]. Significance was defined as P < 0.05, after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Additionally, microbial community function was evaluated by predictive metagenome (microbial DNA) analysis using PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States). PICRUSt is a recently developed phylogeny-based computational tool that predicts the functional capacity of microbial communities by correlation of the species present to reference databases of microbial genomes [Langille et al., 2013]. OTUs were normalized by 16S rRNA copy number, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) orthologs (KOs) were predicted [Langille et al., 2013; Muto et al., 2013]. The information obtained from PICRUSt was further processed by HUMAaN (The HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network) to predict functional metabolic pathways [Abubucker et al., 2012]. Metabolicpathways (modules) were then grouped into larger categories using the KEGG module database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/module.html) [Muto et al., 2013].",

The characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table I and described in the methods. The structure of the vaginal microbial community for each animal was determined by sequencing the V3\u2013V5 region of the 16S rRNA-encoding gene. Of the 49 vaginal samples, 11 yielded insufficient DNA for sequence analysis, likely due to insufficient bacteria present in the original sample or deterioration of DNA in samples after freeze\u2013thaw. After quality control, a total of 423,023 sequence reads were generated from the remaining 38 samples. The mean length of sequence was 256.8 bases (range 249\u2013270, median 257). The complete data set was subsampled to 2,107 sequences per animal, representing the minimum number of sequences in any animal that passed quality control. Each sample yielded a mean of 42.1 \u00b1 29.3 (mean \u00b1 SD) OTUs (median = 35.7, range 18.7\u2013196.0), with sequence differences of 3% defining an OTU. Since the total number of unique OTUs across all baboons in the dataset was 781, each baboon vaginal microbial community represented a highly individualized subset within the potential species pool for this anatomic site. To determine whether the observed OTUs adequately reflected the true number of OTUs, we calculated the mean Chao1 estimate of richness, a rarefaction curve, and the average Good's coverage. The Chao1 estimate was 56.1 \u00b1 41.3 (median = 46.16, range 22.4\u2013255.0), indicating slight underrepresentation. The rarefaction curve (measure of sampling sufficiency) showed a plateau in the majority of samples at the level of subsampling (~2100 sequences), except for two outliers (baboon 1 and 2) (data not shown). Nevertheless, the average Good's coverage [Good, 1953] (where \u201cperfect\u201d coverage = 1) was 0.995 \u00b1 0.005 (median = 0.996, range = 0.974\u20130.998), indicating that the true number of OTUs was adequately represented.",

The three most abundant phyla across all baboons were Bacteroidetes (26.12 \u00b1 17.45%), Fusobacteria (24.16 \u00b1 21.85%), and Firmicutes (32.72 \u00b1 23.08%) (mean \u00b1 SD). Ten of 38 (26.3%) animals had >10% abundance of Tenericutes, Proteobacteria, or Spirochetes, which are phyla consisting of mostly anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria [Brenner et al., 2005; Gupta et al., 2013; Whitman, 2010]. A variable number (range 0\u201335.8% per baboon) of sequences could not be assigned to a phylum and remained unclassified based on the sequence fragment available and the available reference database. Within Firmicutes, the polyphyletic class Clostridia (76.9 \u00b1 23.3%, range 10.0\u201398.8%) predominated over the class Bacilli (14.8 \u00b1 18.2%, range 0\u201365.4%), which includes the genus Lactobacillus (Fig. 1B).",

No significance was detected using unweighted UniFrac analysis (Table III), yet significant differences were detected in all groups examined using weighted UniFrac analysis.

The overall picture was of highly diverse microbial communities with high inter-individual variation between baboons, in marked contrast to the low diversity, relatively uniform, Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbial community of humans. One possible explanation for the apparently high inter-individual variation in baboons is that a variety of microbial communities could perform the same functional roles in this environmental niche. If this is the case, comparison across baboons based on functional analysis might reveal greater uniformity than is evident by community analysis.",

Surprisingly, despite the inter-individual variation and high diversity that had been evident in comparing community structures, the relative abundance of the majority of modules was strikingly similar across the animals (Fig. 4A). Additionally, comparison of the adults (N = 14) and subadults (N = 9) showed no significant difference in the average relative abundance of any of the modules (unpaired t-test, P > 0.05, data not shown). The individual modules are identified and their relative abundances (mean \u00b1 SD) across all baboons are shown in Figure 4B.

In terms of vaginal microbial diversity, humans appear distinct among primates. A recent survey of the vaginal microbiome across nine primate species (including human) showed that only humans had a marked preponderance of Lactobacillus at this site [Yildirim et al., 2014]. One explanation for this difference is that NHPs may rely on a different predominant mechanism of protection from pathogens in the vagina. Specifically, rather than antimicrobial effects of lactic-acid derived low pH, baboons and other NHPs may rely on high diversity as a means of competitive niche exclusion. In environmental microbial ecology, high community diversity is classically associated with greater overall ecosystem stability [Hickey et al., 2013; McCann, 2000; Robinson et al., 2010]. Two principles that contribute to this effect are functional redundancy and complementary resource use. Functional redundancy refers to functional overlap between some community members so that ecosystem stability is maintained in case of species loss [McCann, 2000; Rosenfeld, 2002]. Complementary resource use, on the other hand, refers to the occupation of separate functional or microenvironmental \u201cniches\u201d by different members within the ecosystem, thus decreasing resource competition by any one member [McCann, 2000; Yachi & Loreau, 2007]. By a combination of these strategies, high diversity communities may competitively exclude invasive outside species.",

                    "text": "If high community diversity and niche exclusion were the major protective strategies used for pathogen protection in the vaginal microbiome, it might be expected that puberty and the onset of sexual activity would be associated with an increase in microbial diversity. Instead, we found a decrease in diversity between the vaginal communities of adults and subadult animals, corresponding to a decrease in species evenness. A similar directional change, although of greater magnitude, is seen in humans. While the vaginal microbiome of young, pre-pubertal girls is highly diverse, the peri-pubertal decline in diversity eventually results in the Lactobacillus-dominant community state seen in most adult women [Hammerschlag et al., 1978; Hickey et al., 2012; Linhares et al., 2011; Yamamoto et al., 2009]. This would seem to contradict the theories above and suggest that lower diversity is advantageous in the post-pubertal environment. One potential explanation is that maintaining a high diversity community may be an energy-expensive strategy, particularly in a low-resource environment such as the relatively nutrient-poor vaginal ecosystem [Stumpf et al., 2013]. The energy costs can be tempered by the principle of competitive inhibition, which indicates that fewer species are necessary to maintain ecosystem stability if the species present represent a larger variance in function [McCann, 2000; Yachi & Loreau, 2007]. Thus, selection occurring at puberty may represent pruning of potential community members down to the number necessary to occupy available environmental niches but minimize cost of excessive functional redundancy. One disadvantage of our study was that only peripubertal animals were available for evaluation. Evaluation at an earlier time point (pre-pubertal animals) may have detected larger effects and provided a better assessment of puberty as a critical time point in the formation of the vaginal microbial community.",

In women, highest community constancy has been associated with estrogen-dominated periods (follicular phase) of the reproductive cycle [Gajer et al., 2012]. In addition, menses has been associated with decreased community stability, yet not with altered diversity [Gajer et al., 2012; Hickey et al., 2013; Lopes dos Santos Santiago et al., 2011]. In our study, interpretation of menstruation and cycling data was challenging for several reasons. First, sampling was limited to the distribution of reproductive cycle stages present in the animals at a single time point. Thus, only three animals were in menses at the time of sampling, resulting in a small group size that likely made it difficult to detect any but the most extreme differences. Similarly, small numbers of animals in each stage of the menstrual cycle necessitated grouping into cycling and non-cycling animals. More precise animal grouping within the reproductive cycle may have enabled detection of more nuanced differences with reproductive cycle phase. With these caveats in mind, our results suggest that reproductive cycle hormonal fluctuations are not major influences on the composition of vaginal microbial communities in the baboon.",

For example, the genera Prevotella (most abundant genus in baboons for this study), Sneathia, and Mobiluncus are typically considered pathogenic in women, yet were not associated with discharge or other signs of disease in baboons in this study. However, the presence of pathogenic species does not necessarily correlate with disease. For example, many apparently healthy, asymptomatic women with highly diverse vaginal microbial communities would meet clinical criteria of BV due to the presence of increased strict anaerobes, higher vaginal pH, and decreased numbers of lactobacilli [Oakley et al., 2008; Ravel et al., 2011, 2013; Yildirim et al., 2014]. Furthermore, our sequence data did not permit evaluation to the species or subspecies level. For instance, numerous Fusobacterium were present. This is a genus that contains pathogenic species and has been detected in women with BV [Twin et al., 2013]. However, Fusobacterium nucleatum is a commensal in the oral cavity, and has been associated with induction of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides in oral epithelium [Yin & Dale, 2007]. It is thus possible that, at the species level, members of the diverse taxa of the baboon vaginal microbiome are actually contributing to ecosystem stability or protective interactions with the immune system. It is also possible that some baboons in our study, despite the absence of clinical signs, are in a disease susceptible state. For example, Treponema was found in 6/9 (66.7%) subadult animals and 7/14 (50%) adult animals. Although we were unable to speciate Treponema in this study, Treponema pallidum has been found as a naturally occurring pathogen associated with necroulcerative genital lesions in wild baboons in Tanzania [Harper et al., 2012]. Future evaluation using full length 16S rRNA sequencing and bacterial culture may contribute to species identification and determining whether these species play a pathogenic or commensal role.",

This method has not been validated for baboon-origin microbial communities and it is possible that there are inaccuracies based on comparison to available databases. Additionally, these findings represent predicted functionality, not actual gene expression data. The results nevertheless raise the possibility that compositionally different microbial communities have similar functions, as previously demonstrated in the intestinal tract [Theriot et al., 2014]. Additionally, some women lacking vaginal lactobacilli have been shown to have similar levels of lactic acid production by other bacteria, such as Streptococcus spp. or Atopobium spp. [Farage et al., 2010; Gajer et al., 2012; Lamont et al., 2011]. The future use of gene expression data to complement community structure data may uncover functional similarities that are not evident when comparing community structure alone.",

This may represent peripubertal host selection of a community structure optimized for post-pubertal host health. Additionally, analysis of predicted functional pathways suggests that there is some functional equivalence across the seemingly disparate communities seen in individual baboons. Future studies in baboons or other NHPs focusing on microbial species-level comparisons and evaluation of gene expression patterns may contribute to greater understanding of the mechanisms employed by a high diversity vaginal microbiome in supporting adult reproductive functions and host health.",
