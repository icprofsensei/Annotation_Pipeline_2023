These oncogenic HPVs are also common risk factors in some other cancers, such as head and neck cancers [6]. However, there are still gaps in the knowledge of cervical cancer to answer the question of why HPV is necessary to cause cell carcinoma, although it is not a sufficient requirement [1, 7].",

Genome-wide association studies and subsequent meta-analyses showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in cervical cancer are more likely to locate in the region of frequent chromosomal aberration [9\u201312]. It indicates that cancer may strongly associate with the chromosomal instability [13]. A recent study suggests that microbiota might play important roles in the development of cervical cancer [14]. There exists a significant difference in microbiota\u2019s diversity between non-cervical lesion (NCL) HPV negative women and these with cervical cancer. Further, compared to the microbial community in NCL-HPV negative ones, these in cervical cancer samples have higher variation within groups. All these findings implicate that cervical microbiota is an important clue in the research of the cervical cancer pathology. In order to understand how the microbial community interplay with host genes and cause cell carcinoma in the molecular level, more and more research groups make efforts of identify key factors, also known as cancer-causing agents, which can drive the progress of cervical carcinogenesis.",

Therefore, many researchers take efforts to study how the human microbiota cause structural variation of human genomes and alter the immune system and metabolic system to support the development of cervical pathogenesis [16]. Permanent changes of microbiota may be a major cause of chromosomal instability, subsequently discharge the tumor suppressor gene retinoblastoma (RB) and tumor protein TP53. Some association measures can be used to build a covariance network for microbes and host genes [17]. Host-microbial networks provide a systematic way to study the regulation system between microbiota and host genes [18]. However, the role of host response to the change of microbiome in cervical cancer is still unknown. And there are only a few public tools specifically designed for analyzing host-microbial networks [19\u201321]. Therefore, there is a pressing demand to develop fast and efficient computational tools to examine how microbiota regulate the gene expression, chromosomal instability and cell carcinoma.",

Reference data sets and id-to-OTU maps for 16s rRNA sequence was downloaded from the Greengenes reference OTU builds [25]. All these sequences were grouped into different categories based on their family-level OTU labels. As shown in Fig.\u00a02, prevotellaceade followed by tissierellaceae appears to be the most abundant microbes, accounting for 13.7% of the microbiota community. There are four other groups accounting for more than 5% of the microbiota, which are fusobacteriaceae, porphyromonadaceae, planococcaceae and bacteroidaceae. Totally, twenty-six family-level OTU groups make up more than 87% of the whole community. To examine the diversity of cervical microbiota, the PCoA analysis was performed to analyze the microbial community in cervical carcinoma, skin, mouth and vagina. As shown in Fig.\u00a03, microbiota in cervical carcinoma (red dots) is less diverse than microbiota in any other body sites. Hence, we indeed found remarkable changes of microbial composition in the cancer cases.\n\n",

To study how microbiota regulates the viral response, cell cycle and epithelial cell differentiation, we searched for key risk factors using BpBC. These key factors are thought to be cancer-causing agents that can drive the progress of cervical carcinogenesis. Nodes that organizing communication between two cancer-related groups are more likely to be key factors. Since BpBC is such a measure to evaluate the importance of a node in the network topology, we choose these nodes in the top list of BpBC as candidates of key factors.

PSMB10 was an up-regulated gene in cervical cancer. Between the sub-networks of microbe and cell cycle, KCNIP1 and Hydrogenophilaceae (labeled as OTU_97.2777) are the most important regulators (see in Fig.\u00a05 middle). Eubacterium (labeled as OTU_97.10051) and KRT13 are the most important regulators between the sub-networks of microbes and epithelial cell differentiation (see in Fig.\u00a05 right). It proves that the interplay between microbiota and differentially expressed genes might be the driving force that regulates the progress of cell cycle, epithelial cell differentiation and viral response.\n",

Multiple web programming languages were used in the development, which includes PHP, mysql and javascripts. Each node and its neighborhood in the network can be searched by a query term in the panel of Search. And the induced sub-network will be visualized in the panel of View. For example, one can input a gene symbol CYP2A7 as a query term in the Search panel. A list of nodes associated with CYP2A7 will show out in a user-friendly panel, as well as a graphic view of the induced sub-network (see in Fig.\u00a06). Except for visualization and query, KF-finder can also sort microbes and DEGs in a decreasing order by the value of BpBC in microbe-antivirus, microbe-cell cycle or microbe-epithelial cell differentiation. Download and advanced search have been enabled on the web server. All our test datasets and results of users\u2019 personal jobs can be downloaded. Advanced search allows us search for genes and microbes based on string patterns or value constriction.

Many studies show that expression of IP genes including PSMB10 is up-regulated in most cancer types [26]. IP genes can be expressed by non-immune cell, and that differential cleavage of transcription factors by IPs has pleiotropic effects on cell function. Indeed, IPs modulate the abundance of transcription factors that regulate signaling pathways with prominent roles in cell differentiation, inflammation and neoplastic transformation (e.g., NF-kB, IFNs, STATs and Wnt) [27]. Therefore, PSMB10 is indeed a risk factor involved in the antiviral response of cervical caner.",

It is a down-regulated gene in cervical carcinoma, and a risk factor that involves in the progress of uncontrolled epithelial cell differentiat,ion. Previous work suggests that the loss of K13 or low K13 mRNA expression is associated with invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) [28, 29]. Epigenetic alteration of K13 is one major reason resulting the inhibition of K13 in OSCC. Besides, K13 was also reported that it played a directive role in prostate cancer bone, brain and soft tissue metastases [30]. More than 1000 single nucleotide polymorphisms of K13 were found in the dbSNP database. Totally, 51 variations mentioned K13 in ClinVar, seven out of which are pathogenic. All these evidences suggest KRT13 is very likely to be a key risk factor involved in cervical cancer.",

A host-microbial network was reconstructed from the 16s rRNA and gene expression data. The main contributions of this paper can be concluded in three aspects: (1) microbial community distributed in cervical carcinoma cells is less diverse than that of other body sites; (2) a web-based tool MiteFinder was developed which enables users to query and visualize host-microbial networks, microbes and differentially expressed genes in a fast-and-easy way; (3) a set of key risk factors have been identified, which have proven to have association with cancers in several previous publications. Our results show that six groups of OTU abundantly distributed in cervical cancer samples, including prevotellaceade, tissierellaceae, fusobacteriaceae, porphyromonadaceae, planococcaceae and bacteroidaceae. Besides these six groups of OTU, we found that three differentially expressed genes and three microbes may be key risk factors and play crucial roles in the pathology of cervical carcinoma. All of these results suggest that permanent changes of microbiota composition might be the key driving force in the pathology of cervical carcinoma, which result in the abnormality of epithelial cell differentiation, cell cycle and viral response.",
