Participants were recruited in Nigeria between April\nand August 2012. Vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by deep sequencing of\nbarcoded 16S rRNA gene fragments (V4) on Illumina MiSeq and HPV was identified using the\nRoche Linear Array\u00ae HPV genotyping test. We used exact logistic regression\nmodels to evaluate the association between community state types (CSTs) of vaginal\nmicrobiota and hrHPV infection, weighted UniFrac distances to compare the vaginal\nmicrobiota of individuals with prevalent hrHPV to those without prevalent hrHPV infection,\nand the Linear Discriminant Analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm to characterize\nbacteria associated with prevalent hrHPV infection. We observed four CSTs: CST IV-B with a\nlow relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. in 50% of participants; CST\nIII (dominated by L. iners) in 39\u00b72%; CST I (dominated by L.\ncrispatus) in 7\u00b79%; and CST VI (dominated by proteobacteria) in 2\u00b79% of\nparticipants. LEfSe analysis suggested an association between prevalent hrHPV infection\nand a decreased abundance of Lactobacillus sp. with increased abundance\nof anaerobes particularly of the genera Prevotella and\nLeptotrichia in HIV-negative women (P < 0\u00b705).\nThese results are hypothesis generating and further studies are required.",

Regarding the Korean women, the authors found that HPV-positive women had\nsignificantly higher microbial diversity with a lower proportion of\nLactobacillus sp. than HPV-negative women. Additionally, they observed that\nHPV infection was strongly associated with Fusobacteria. In the study of 32 reproductive age\nwomen in the United States who were followed prospectively for 16 weeks, the authors found\nthat community state type (CST) was associated with changes in HPV status and a low\nlactobacillus community with high proportions of the genera Atopobium had\nthe slowest rate of HPV clearance. Another recent study in a Rwandan population utilized\nphylogenetic microarray methods and observed that women with microbiota dominated by\nLactobacillus crispatus were less likely to have prevalent hrHPV\ninfection compared to women with more diverse microbiota comprised of mixtures of anaerobes\nincluding species of the genera Gadnerella, Atopobium and\nPrevotella [31].",

The higher the LDA score for a taxon, the more significant the relationship is\n[47, 48]. LEfSe was adapted to quantitatively characterize the biomarker phylotypes\nthat could explain the differences observed between two biological conditions [47]. The alpha value for the non-parametric factorial\nKruskal\u2013Wallis sum-rank test [49] was 0\u00b705, the\nthreshold on the logarithmic LDA model score for discriminative features was 2\u00b70. Weighted\nUniFrac distances, which measure the distance between vaginal communities using\nphylogenetic information to reveal patterns of sample aggregation [41], were used to compare the vaginal microbiota of individuals with\nand without prevalent hrHPV infection. The taxonomic ranks of the identified taxa in LEfSe\nare generated using Ribosomal Dataset Project (RDP) taxonomy [50] that were further marked on a cladogram representing the\ntaxonomic hierarchical structure from genera to phylum.",

We found a moderate association between prevalent hrHPV and a\nlow relative abundance of Lactobacillus sp. In subset analysis, LEfSe\nanalysis and comparisons of the weighted UniFrac distances showed that this relationship was\nstatistically significant in HIV-negative individuals. The most abundant genera in the\nHIV-negative hrHPV-positive participants in this study were Prevotella and\nLeptotrichia. Prevotella has been shown to be present in certain\ndysbiotic states such as occurs in BV [15].\nAlthough Leptotrichia which belongs to the same family as the genera\nFusobacterium and Sneathia, is considered to be part of\nthe normal oral cavity and the female genital tract microflora, it has been isolated from\ninfections of the female genital tract such as salpingitis and BV [54, 55]). Our result is\nsimilar to that obtained in a Korean study where HPV positivity was associated with a lower\nprevalence of Lactobacillus spp. and an increased abundance of anaerobic\nbacteria including Prevotella, Sneathia, Dialister, and\nBacillus species [29].",

These observations are similar to the findings of Spear et\nal. in a subset of the participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study [60], where it was observed that HIV-negative women had\na higher abundance of L. iners. In another analysis by Spear et\nal., it was observed that there was a higher microbial diversity in women with HIV\ninfection [52], and this is congruent with our\nfindings. Our findings are also in agreement with the findings of Borgdorff et\nal. in a study of 174 female sex workers in Rwanda, where HIV prevalence was higher\nin women with vaginal microbiome clusters not dominated by Lactobacillus\nsp. [31]. Given the role of HIV in immune\nsuppression, it is possible that the reduced immunity may account for the greater microbial\ndiversity, or by contrast, women lacking Lactobacillus spp. were at greater\nrisk for acquiring or transmitting HIV.",

Another limitation of this study is that we\nevaluated associations between CSTs and prevalent hrHPV infection. Prevalent hrHPV has a\nweaker association with cervical cancer and pre-cancer compared to persistent hrHPV\ninfection and HPV status is known to fluctuate in studies where samples are frequently\ncollected [61]. However, we continued to follow-up\nthese participants to ascertain whether these associations would change with persistent\nhrHPV infection. Our participants were recruited from cervical cancer screening clinics and\nmay not represent women in the community in general. Some of the data used in this study\nwere self-reported and thus subject to recall bias. Other limitations of self-reported data\nparticularly those related to sexual practices include the tendency to provide only socially\ndesirable responses.",
