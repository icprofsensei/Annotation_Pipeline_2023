The placental microbiome has not been robustly interrogated, despite recent demonstrations of intracellular bacteria with diverse metabolic and immune regulatory functions. A population-based cohort of placental specimens collected under sterile conditions from 320 subjects with extensive clinical data was established for comparative 16S ribosomal DNA\u2013based and whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic studies. Identified taxa and their gene carriage patterns were compared to other human body site niches, including the oral, skin, airway (nasal), vaginal, and gut microbiomes from nonpregnant controls. We characterized a unique placental microbiome niche, composed of nonpathogenic commensal microbiota from the Firmicutes, Tenericutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria phyla. In aggregate, the placental microbiome profiles were most akin (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity <0.3) to the human oral microbiome. 16S-based operational taxonomic unit analyses revealed associations of the placental microbiome with a remote history of antenatal infection (permutational multivariate analysis of variance, P = 0.006), such as urinary tract infection in the first trimester, as well as with preterm birth <37 weeks (P = 0.001).",

Studies have shown that neonates demonstrate complex microbial communities in the gut within the first week of life, with dynamic fluctuations in bacterial composition until a relatively mature equilibrium is reached around 1 to 3 years of age (5\u201313). What shapes these earliest microbial communities, and at what point the infant is first exposed to and colonized by its microbiome, remains unclear (12\u201316). In the first week of life, the full-term neonatal gut microbiome is largely colonized by the phyla Actinobacteria (including Bifidobacterium), Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, and, much less, Firmicutes (including the Lactobacillus spp., which dominate the vaginal flora) (17). In contrast, neonates who weigh <1200 g are dominated by both Firmicutes and Tenericutes phyla, with much less dominance of Actinobacteria (18). These collective observations raise the possibility that the infant may be first seeded in utero by a common shared low abundance source, such as the placenta, and this seeding may vary by length of gestation.",

Previous studies have largely used morphologic approaches and grossly documented the presence of bacteria in different regions of the placenta (18\u201321). A recent cross-sectional study of 195 patients (18) demonstrated Gram-positive and Gram-negative intracellular bacteria harbored in the basal plate (which comprises the tissue layer directly at and below the maternal-fetal interface). These were observed in nearly one-third of placental specimens, with a high prevalence among preterm deliveries <28 weeks of gestation but regardless of clinical or pathologic evidence of chorioamnionitis (18). Although current paradigms suggest that most intrauterine infections, which are associated with preterm birth, originate in the lower genital tract and ascend into an otherwise \u201csterile\u201d intrauterine environment (19, 20), most taxa detected in the placenta with DNA-based technology are not found in the urogenital tract, but rather represent commensal species common to the oral cavity (21\u201324). Some of these oral microbes, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum (a Gram-negative oral anaerobe), may facilitate hematogenous transmission during placentation as a result of their ability to bind vascular endothelium and alter permeability, thereby functioning as an \u201cenabler\u201d for other common commensals, such as Escherichia coli (25). These latter findings are of particular interest, given the long-standing strong association between periodontal disease [as well as upper and lower urinary tract infections (UTIs)] and increased risk of preterm birth (26\u201329).",

Similarly, by design, cases with a remote history of antenatal infection were significantly different from controls (P < 0.001) and included 68 sexually transmitted infections and 52 upper or lower UTIs. Because our population-derived case-cohort designations were based on either preterm birth or a remote history of antenatal infection, some preterm birth cases or their term cohort controls may have also experienced remote antenatal infections (and vice versa).

The phylum-level abundance has been previously used to compare taxonomic profiles from other body site samples with low microbial abundance (32), or samples from closely approximated body sites (1). We integrated the placental microbiome taxonomy profile identified by MG-RAST using WGS-generated taxonomic profiles for placental, oral, stool, skin, airway (nasal), and vaginal sites and calculated the Bray-Curtis distance at phylum-level abundance to reflect the similarity among body sites. Figure 1 demonstrates niche distinction by site, regardless of anatomic proximity. The placental microbiota show similarity to the oral phyla (derived from nonpregnant subjects) (1\u20133) notably among communities arising from the tongue, tonsils, and gingival plaques (Bray-Curtis index <0.3). By contrast, the potential anatomic contaminants during delivery of the placenta [stool and vagina, from both gravid (4) and nongravid (1\u20133) subjects] bore no evidence of similarity (Fig. 1). This held true for individual sample-level projections (fig. S2) and was replicated when alternately analyzed by ecologic indices specifically designed for WGS data [Jaccard (33) and Kulczynski (34, 35)] (fig. S2). Results using SourceTracker (36) analysis similarly indicate that the primary related source to the placental microbiome tracked to known oral taxonomic classifications (mean oral source tracked classifications at 90%, SD 5%).",

Detailed species-level comparison across body sites further characterized the unique properties of the placental microbiome phyla (Fig. 2B). In accordance with our data in fig. S1, E. coli is the most prevalent single species in the placenta. Although we did not characterize the infant microbiome in this study, Escherichia has been shown in high abundance in meconium from one recent study of neonates (38) and is a strong contributor to early-onset (within 48 hours of birth) sepsis among extremely low birth weight neonates (39).",

In general, the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins is represented with greater relative abundance among placental functional gene profiles (Fig. 2C; corresponding with published observations in the infant gut) (30). When compared with proximal anatomic sites, such as the posterior fornix of the vagina or the stool, we observed relatively lower abundance of carriage patterns of genes mapping to pathways involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism (Fig. 2C). Further detailed comparisons of the variation in metabolic reconstructions associated with gestational age at delivery and a history of first- or second-trimester maternal infections are reported in Figs. 3 and \u200band44 and described further below.",

Specifically, we interrogated beta diversity metrics in placental specimens from women with a well-documented but remote history of antepartum infections (primarily UTI in the first or second trimester), or having experienced a preterm birth at <37 weeks of gestation. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed on all the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing that could be assigned at least to the phylum level and appeared in at least 5% of samples after chimera removal. As shown in Fig. 3A, we observed clustering in association with gestational age at delivery on jackknife-supported PCoA plots using weighted UniFrac distance. We demonstrate with statistical significance that the placental microbiome is associated with preterm birth <37 weeks [permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), P = 0.001; permutational analysis of dispersion (PERMDISP), P = 0.855 (40)]. We also find that the placental microbiome is significantly associated with the interval week of delivery, when gestational age is alternately analyzed as a continuous variable (range of potential viability from 24 to 41 weeks; adonis, P = 0.001).",

Moreover, when we projected the metabolic pathways as Manhattan distance on a heat map, we observed samples correlating with gestational age at delivery, with relative increased abundance of pathways involved in methane metabolism, isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, and glycine/serine/threonine metabolism (Fig. 3C), and decreased biotin metabolism and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor pathways (Fig. 3C).",

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection, infant gender, maternal BMI, and route of delivery (cesarean versus vaginal birth) failed to associate with clustering of the placental microbiome. The PCoA performed on the OTU table denoised by AbundantOTU (4) similarly indicated that the placental microbial community is distinctly shaped among gravidae who delivered preterm or who experience an antepartum infection in the first or early second trimester of pregnancy. To identify the placental microbiota community members in gravidae with a remote history of antepartum infection, we applied another metagenomic biomarker discovery approach called LEfSe (linear discriminate analysis coupled with effect size measurements) (41). We observed enrichment of Streptococcus and Acinetobacter in gravidae with a remote history of antepartum infection (Fig. 4, B and C). The same set of genera, including Thioalkalivibrio and Pseudoalteromonas, was identified by Boruta feature selection as well (Fig. 4D). Consistent with taxonomic observations, application of LEfSe to MG-RAST\u2013generated gene carriage patterns from WGS data demonstrated an enrichment of genes involved in the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway in samples from individuals with remote history of antenatal infection (Fig. 4E).",

One primary limitation is the comparison between our placental microbiome data and the oral, gut, nares, and posterior auricular microbiomes derived from nonpregnant subjects enrolled in the HMP (1\u20133). Our rationale for using this well-characterized reference cohort was largely practical: to sample multiple body sites in all 320 gravidae would have exceeded the resources available for this study and surpassed the total number of women enrolled in the HMP (n = 150) (3). However, given recent publications demonstrating an observed shift of the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy (4), we did include these available data sets in our analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, although there is measurable variance between the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy relative to the nonpregnant vaginal microbiome, the appreciable variance does not significantly alter Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures between the vaginal and placental microbiota in aggregate.",

We did not anticipate our finding a strong measure of similarity between the oral and placental microbiome, and thus did not specifically recruit subjects with periodontal disease. With respect to the definition of UTI, we used standard clinical definitions used in pregnancy, namely, clinical symptoms in combination with moderate colony-forming units of 10,000 to 100,000 (4, 18\u201320). It remains a formal possibility that potential exposure to antibiotics over the pre-pregnancy interval (data that we did not have access to), rather than documented infection and treatment (table S3) in the antenatal interval per se, could be driving our observations. In the absence of available data on all subjects outside of the index pregnancy, we cannot exclude this possibility. However, given the strong observed association demonstrated in Fig. 4 alongside the relative health of our subject cohort, we feel that such a misclassification of association is unlikely. Similarly, given the observational nature of this study, we cannot distinguish whether it was the remote antenatal infection or its clinically indicated antibiotic therapy that had an effect on the placental microbiome community.",

On the basis of our recorded extracted specimen weights and resultant read counts, we estimate that 0.002 mg of bacterial DNA was extracted from every 1 g of placental tissue; this is accordant with recent morphometry estimates of intracellular bacterial burden in the normal human placenta (20). However, we were able to overcome the limitations of low biomass and the resultant risk of environmental contamination with our systematic application of three approaches: use of a large number of primary specimens in a population-based case-cohort design with strict adherence to sterile clean protocol, utilization of deep massively parallel sequencing with WGS metagenomics for delineation of community membership and metabolic pathways, and use of multiple biological and technical replicates.",

In our study, we followed the methodology of the HMP protocol but increased the amount of DNA in our 16S amplifications to a standardized 30 ng/\u03bcl (5 \u03bcl in each reaction) and compared all sequences to nontemplate controls. We limited our use of 16S data to generated PCoA plots of beta diversity and rigorously tested for significance. All remaining determinations of community membership by taxa and metabolic pathways, as well as comparative metagenomics, were conducted on WGS data to eliminate the potential for amplification artifacts and contamination from environmental sources. As with other investigators working in previously regarded sterile tissues such as the subepidermis of the skin (42), we have observed commensal bacterial communities that are shaped by host characteristics but are distinct from nearby and closely positioned microbial communities. Given the dissimilarity to the vagina and stool (regardless of mode of delivery) and significant similarity to specific sites in the oral microbiome (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity <0.3), we feel it is unlikely that our findings represent contamination at the time of delivery. Similarly, given the strong concordance of our findings by WGS and 16S (correlation coefficient of 0.56 at phylum-level abundance), we feel it is unlikely that this represents approach or analytic artifacts.",

Consistent with these and other investigators\u2019 observations, Escherichia has been shown in high abundance in meconium from one recent study of newborns (38), and is a strong contributor to early-onset sepsis among extremely low birth weight neonates (37).

Other investigators working in murine models have also reported significant similarity between the microbial communities of these two spatially distinct niches, and postulated that this may indicate that the placental microbiome is established by hematogenous spread (21\u201324). Several lines of additional evidence support this view. First, in a case of clinical and histologic chorioamnionitis without cultivatable microorganisms, a single strain of Bergeyella was found to be 100% identical at the 16S\u201323S rRNA sequence level between the patient\u2019s periodontal subgingival plaque and her amniotic fluid (22), both of which were 99.7% identical to a previously deposited oral Bergeyella sequence. No species of Bergeyella was detected from any of this subject\u2019s multiple vaginal samples, and Bergeyella is not known to be commensal to any body site but the mouth (22). Second, tail vein injection of the oral anaerobe F. nucleatum in mice induces preterm and term delivery and stillbirth and localizes to the placenta, where in high doses it causes localized infection (43). F. nucleatum failed to colonize other organs, such as the spleen or liver, which suggests that the bacteria found in the placenta did not merely represent a low-grade bacteremia. Of interest, these same investigators have demonstrated that the F. nucleatum adhesin FadA binds cadherin on the vascular endothelium, increasing permeability and allowing for other microbial species such as E. coli to cross endothelial barriers (25). We have reported herein the relative abundance of E. coli species in the placental microbiome, as well as multiple Fusobacterium spp. Together, the available evidence suggests that the placental microbiome is likely established by hematogenous spread of oral microbiota, which would be anticipated to take up residence during early vascularization and placentation.",

Although this study is not able to address the relationship between periodontal disease and the placental microbiome, we, as a community of obstetricians, have appreciated for decades the association between periodontal disease and preterm birth (19). A hallmark of periodontal disease is gingivitis (inflammation of the gums leading to bleeding) progressing to periodontitis (advanced pockets where the gum has pulled away from the tooth). It is tempting to therefore postulate that both the burden and the community profile of a hematogenously acquired low-abundance placental microbiome would rapidly vary and potentially result in overt inflammation and polymicrobial colonization in the setting of periodontal disease (44\u201347). In such a scenario, treatment of the periodontal disease with scaling and planing only once during pregnancy would not improve the rate of preterm birth since the pathophysiology would be long established (44\u201346). This is consistent with lack of proven efficacy of therapy for established periodontal disease in multiple randomized trials (27\u201329). However, primary prevention in the early reproductive years and potentially early treatment before placental architecture establishment may be efficacious (44, 45), and future studies might benefit from metagenomics-based multiple modality therapies for the prevention and targeted treatment of periodontal disease for the prevention of preterm birth.",

Rather, a remote history of antenatal infection was correlated with community membership, which was also associated with preterm birth of <37 weeks (table S1). Other investigators have established that pathogenic microbes (predominantly pathogenic strains of E. coli) can establish occult intracellular reservoirs within the urinary tract epithelium by binding to uroplakins, potentially evading immune recognition by the host as well as culture-based detection (48, 49). Upon inflammation or polymicrobial presence resulting in alteration in the endothelial barrier, this nonpathogenic status is altered as clinically symptomatic infection ensues. Similarly, it has been suggested that the nonpregnant endometrial epithelium may harbor occult microbes in women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (50). It is interesting to speculate that a common inflammatory response (by host predisposition or clinical infection) may lead to altered niche habitats resulting in our observed structuring of the placental community in association with a remote history of antenatal infection. This would further concur with our observations demonstrating an association with preterm birth because host genomic variance in inflammatory and progesterone receptor pathways is strongly associated with recurrent preterm birth (51).",

The protocol and consent form described precautions taken to reduce these risks. Additional protections for participants included coding genomic and metagenomic specimens and sequence data, using controlled-access repositories for extracted nucleic acids and deidentified medical and human genome sequence data, and making efforts to remove any human sequence traces from the microbial data deposited in open access databases. If a participant withdrew consent after providing specimens, remaining specimens and extracted nucleic acids were to be destroyed; however, any metagenomic sequence data that were already published in open access databases could not be retracted.",

Spontaneous preterm birth was defined by standard obstetrical definitions as adequately documented gestational age >24 and <37 weeks (by last menstrual period with <20-week gestation sonogram, or by <14-week sonogram with subsequent second-trimester sonogram), and no evidence of maternal or fetal comorbidity indicating induction of labor (such as preeclampsia, placenta previa, or hydramnios). For the second case-cohort data set (remote history of antenatal infection case-cohort), the database was independently queried for subjects with laboratory evidence of antepartum (first or early mid-trimester) clinically symptomatic infections including sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis; upper or lower UTIs with documented culture speciation and antibiotic sensitivity; and resistance profiling, periodontal disease, or systemic infections, such as pneumonia. The control groups for cohort comparison were thereafter created by a 1:1 match with previously identified case subjects (preterm birth or a remote history of antepartum infection). All case-cohort subject specimens were matched for gestational age, mode of delivery, race/ethnicity, BMI, age, and diabetic status but not for any of the case definitions (preterm birth or a remote history of antenatal infection). In this manner, we enabled preterm birth cases to potentially carry a diagnosis of a remote history of antenatal infection, and vice versa; this is consistent with the principles of a population-based case-cohort design.",

A working group of board-certified obstetrician-gynecologists, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and pathologists with molecular, surgical, perinatal, and placental pathology and microbiology expertise developed and refined the collection protocol, consent forms, and the manual of procedures for PeriBank. This manual provides detailed, standardized instructions to ensure consistency and clinical laboratory quality in enrollment sampling and specimen processing, and ensure compliance with regulatory and data management requirements. Briefly, following standard obstetrical practice, the placenta is delivered and immediately passed off to trained personnel in a sterile clean container. In a separate room, four to six 1-cm \u00d7 1-cm \u00d7 1-cm cuboidal sections are circumferentially excised from separate areas of the placenta, each located 4 cm from the cord insertion site. The excision was performed by pathology-trained personnel donning facial masks and sterile gloves and using a sterile scalpel and instruments; these clean and sterile conditions are standardized technique in the banking of all PeriBank specimens. The placental surfaces (namely, the maternal decidua and fetal chorion-amnion) were thereafter excised and discarded to avoid potential contamination from maternal, fetal, or environmental surface exposure during delivery or at the time of specimen transport. Over the interval of this study, PeriBank enrolled 85 to 93% of all gravidae delivering at the Baylor College of Medicine\u2013affiliated hospital, Ben Taub General Hospital (Harris Health System).",

After collection, placental specimens were immediately placed on dry ice in sterile closed vials, transported to the laboratory, and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until DNA extraction. In a strictly controlled, decontaminated, and sterile environment, genomic DNA was isolated in triplicate using the standard protocol from the MO-BIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO-BIO Laboratories) as previously described (1\u20134). About 100 to 150 mg of frozen placental tissue was taken from each sterile sample vial under ongoing strict decontamination conditions (personnel using masks and gloves, and decontaminated clean sterile equipment in a sterile ventilated hood, Labconco Class II Type B2), homogenized and heated, and then processed using PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kits (MO-BIO) according to protocols bench-marked as part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) HMP (1\u20134). All extracted DNA samples were stored in kit solution C6 at \u221220\u00b0C. DNA was quantified by NanoDrop and PicoGreen assays. We obtained sufficient quantities of DNA from all specimens, repeating the extraction when necessary until sufficient quantity was achieved. Time between delivery, specimen collection, storage, and extraction was examined as a possible confounder, and no bias was observed. One nontemplate blank extraction was performed for every 11 samples, and a subset was used in both WGS- and 16S-based metagenomic sequencing (on the Roche 454-Ti or Illumina platforms) to control for potential environmental or source reagent contamination; no 16S sequences were generated from nontemplate controls (fig.

By comparison, we have previously demonstrated that samples from the human vagina have >96% human contamination (1). Thus, the first step in processing WGS reads was to remove human contamination and thereby ensure quality and privacy of the data set. Human reads were identified and removed using BMTagger (Best Match Tagger) through a heuristic approach (1). The remaining reads were searched against a protein database of all the ORF from prokaryotic organisms in KEGG v54 (55) using BLASTX. BLASTX output was filtered on the basis of HMP standards (1, 2) and used as input reads to metabolic pathway reconstruction. The metabolic pathway reconstruction was directly inferred on the basis of short reads using HUMAnN (54). For taxonomy identification using WGS reads, quality-filtered reads were uploaded to MG-RAST (56). Taxonomy assignment was based on best-hit classification using the M5NR database as an annotation source with a maximum e-value cutoff of 1, minimum percent identity cutoff of 50%, and minimum alignment length cutoff of 15. The relative abundance of each species was calculated on the basis of the number of hits for that species. MG-RAST was also used to generate low-level KEGG pathway abundance for comparison between case- and control-cohort samples. MG-RAST\u2013generated taxonomy and pathway abundance were further normalized by number of reads mapped to each sample.",
