Male partners received oral metronidazole 400mg twice daily and 2% clindamycin cream topically to the penile skin twice daily for 7-days. Couples provided self-collected genital specimens and completed questionnaires at enrolment and then weekly for 4-weeks. Genital microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

There is strong observational evidence that sexual activity plays a key role in both BV acquisition and recurrence[15\u201318]. Meta-analysis has shown associations between lack of condom use and exposure to new or multiple sexual partners with BV [19]. Additionally, two cohort studies of women who have sex with women reported a significant association between acquiring BV and reporting a new partner or a partner with BV[18, 20].",

A recent Cochrane review rated the quality of the evidence as low to very low[30], and the discrepancy between current epidemiological evidence and the results of past RCTs is likely due to methodological limitations[31]. In addition none evaluated topical antibiotic therapy for males. We hypothesise that while urethral organisms are more likely to be effectively targeted by oral antibiotics, cutaneous colonisers of the coronal sulcus are more likely to be cleared by topical antibiotics. Thus it is plausible that combined oral and topical antimicrobial therapy is required to effectively clear BV-associated bacteria from both the coronal sulcus and distal urethra. Topical therapy is also likely to be particularly important in uncircumcised males who have a high abundance of sub-preputial BV-associated bacteria[22]. Male circumcision has been shown to reduce detection of BV-associated genera in males[32] and to reduce the risk of BV acquisition in women[33, 34], providing further evidence that cutaneous carriage of BV-associated bacteria plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BV acquisition and recurrence.",

Spearman\u2019s rho was used to assess the correlation between prevalent taxa in the vaginal microbiota of women and the same taxa in the cutaneous penile microbiota of their sexual partner at three time points: baseline, day 8 and day 28. Bacterial taxa present in at least 30% of vaginal specimens collected at baseline, day 8 and day 28 were included in the correlation analysis.",

Treatment of males was well tolerated and adherence was high, which indicates high acceptability of the therapy to males. In addition, treatment resulted in changes to both vaginal and cutaneous penile microbiota. Immediately post completion of treatment, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence and abundance of BV-associated bacteria in the vaginal microbiota and a shift to a low diversity and often L. iners dominated environment. Importantly, the suppression of BV-associated bacteria was sustained at three weeks post treatment in the majority of women. BV-associated bacteria were abundant in the penile skin of male partners of women with BV and interestingly, there was a significant reduction in bacterial diversity and a depletion of BV-associated bacteria in the cutaneous penile microbiota immediately post treatment, similar to what has been observed in trials of male circumcision[32, 56]. However, re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria in the cutaneous penile microbiota three weeks post treatment was common. This pilot study was not powered to look at the impact of dual-partner treatment on recurrence, however BV recurrence was uncommon. Our data provide an evidence base for the development of larger trials that have extended follow-up, sample the urethral microbiota, and a randomly allocated placebo or non-treatment comparator.",

This is higher than the 70% participation rate reported by Mengel et al[26], but is consistent with an RCT of a topical microbicide for male-partners of women with BV[57]. Women were asked at screening if they thought it likely that their male partner would agree to be involved which is likely to have biased the study towards a higher participation rate. Retention rates were reasonable with only five couples providing incomplete sets of data (four LTFU and one withdrew due to break up). Self-reported adherence to both study treatments was high, with the majority of participants taking all doses of medication. Male adherence to metronidazole was higher than adherence to clindamycin, which could suggest a preference for oral treatment over topical treatment.",

In addition, oral metronidazole and vaginal clindamycin have equivalent four week cure rates for BV[58]. Both treatments were well tolerated by males, with minimal side effects reported. This is particularly important for topical clindamycin which is not licensed for use in males. Metronidazole is widely used in females and males and the male who experienced a mild truncal rash may have had an allergy to metronidazole, which is known to be a rare side effect occurring in < 0.1% the population[59].",

The immediate and marked response of the vaginal microbiota to antibiotic treatment observed in this study is consistent with research by other groups[60\u201362]. The observed sustained suppression of BV-associated bacteria and low abundance of Gardnerella in women three weeks post treatment is encouraging, but without a control group of untreated males we are unable to determine if this is attributable to the additional benefit from concurrent male partner treatment. Previous investigations of the vaginal microbiota have provided varying reports regarding the re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria following treatment of women only. Mayer et al [60] and Ravel et al [61] reported that return to a pre-treatment microbiota and re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria was common occurring within three to four weeks of treatment. Conversely, other authors have shown sustained reduction in bacterial diversity and/or BV-associated bacteria following treatment with metronidazole [62\u201364]. For example, Gottschick et al [64] reported a low diversity, lactobacilli dominated vaginal microbiota at 7 to 28 days post treatment with oral metronidazole that was sustained in a majority of women at up to 14 weeks post treatment. Similarly, Xiao et al [62] followed 65 women after treatment with intravaginal metronidazole gel and reported a reduction in bacterial diversity that was sustained at 30 days post treatment. Both Gottschick et al and Xiao et al reported a similar percent of women cured, 72 and 74% respectively[62, 64]. Women who did not recur during our study had a predominance of L. iners following treatment, whereas the two women who recurred did not. These data suggest that a rapid increase in lactobacilli post treatment may be necessary for sustained effectiveness of treatment and prevention against reinfection. However, a protective role of L. iners against BV has not been established and L. iners is frequently detected in women with BV, without BV and in the vagina following antimicrobial therapy for BV[7, 8, 60, 61, 64\u201366]. This has led some groups to suggest that both pathogenic and beneficial strains of L. iners may exist, while others suggest that L. iners acts as a transitional species, bridging the gap between a diseased state and a healthy state [8, 60, 67\u201369].",

There was a dramatic change, specifically a reduction in bacterial diversity and a depletion of anaerobic BV-associated bacteria including Peptoniphilus, Finegoldia and Dialister. Re-emergence of anaerobic BV-associated bacteria occurred in the cutaneous penile microbiota of most males within three weeks of ceasing antibiotics. Interestingly, this didn\u2019t equate temporally to a re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria in the vaginal microbiota of their sexual partner in all participants. This raises the question: where are these organisms coming from, if not from the female partner? It is possible that BV-associated bacteria remain below the level of detection on the penile skin, reside in the prostate [70, 71], or persist in the urethra (which could not be measured in this study), following treatment and then proliferate in the absence of ongoing treatment. However, an alternative theory is that BV-associated bacteria are reintroduced to the penile microbiota via the oral cavity during oral sex or via the gastrointestinal tract, which have been considered by various investigators as potential mechanisms for BV acquisition/recurrence [72\u201374].",

A key limitation of this dataset was the absence of urethral specimens of sufficient quality to provide data on the abundance and prevalence of specific BV-associated bacteria at the urethral site. Zozaya et al reported that the penile skin and urethral microbiota of male partners of women with BV were more similar to the vaginal microbiota of their sexual partner compared to that of other women with BV, as well as a high level of correlation of specific taxa (primarily BV-associated bacteria) in the genital microbiota of BV-couples[23]. Furthermore, sexual partners have been shown to share the same strains of G. vaginalis [75]. In our study, we found no difference in the similarity of the vaginal and penile skin microbiota between sexual partners versus non-partners. In addition, while BV-associated bacteria were abundant in males, we found only weak to moderate correlation between the prevalent taxa in the vaginal and cutaneous penile microbiota of partners both pre-treatment and immediately post treatment.",

Both the Zozaya[23] and Eren[75] studies utilised clinician collected specimens for genital microbiota characterisation whereas we used self-sampling to optimise participant recruitment and retention; it also allowed for specimen collection at home. Additionally, the majority of women were highly similar at each time point during the study, with a predominance of Gardnerella pre-treatment and a predominance of L. iners post-treatment. These factors, together with the small sample size, may have reduced the discriminatory power of our analysis.",

                    "text": "Gardnerella was the predominant BV-associated bacteria identified in females at baseline, but was almost absent from cutaneous penile specimens at baseline. It has been hypothesised that colonisation of G. vaginalis may be limited to the distal urethra in males[76] and Nelson et al previously reported failure to detect G. vaginalis from coronal sulcus samples of adolescent boys, despite detecting it in 28% of urine samples collected from the same participants[21]. Consistent with this, while we observed a low abundance and prevalence of Gardnerella in the cutaneous penile skin of participants throughout the study, our limited urethral data available suggests that Gardnerella is both prevalent and abundant in the male urethra prior to treatment. Future studies should utilise collection of high quality urethral specimens to obtain a better understanding of the sharing of G. vaginalis and genital microbiota between sexual partners. Other organisms may also have a role in BV recurrence. Both Prevotella and Dialister showed a strong positive correlation between the vaginal and cutaneous penile microbiota of sexual partners at day 28. These organisms have been detected in women with BV [5, 7\u20139], and the presence of Prevotella and Dialister in the penile skin (as well as Mobiluncus and Porphyromonas) has previously been reported as an indicator of female-partner Nugent-BV[22]. Further investigation of the involvement of Prevotella and Dialister in the development and recurrence of BV is needed, particularly in women who have sex with men.",

Approximately one third of the urine swabs collected for urethral microbiota characterisation had low bacterial load and did not meet the sampling depth required for analysis. As detailed above, the limited urethral data creates an incomplete picture of what (and how) bacteria are exchanged through sexual intercourse, and may have particularly affected our ability to compare the genital microbiota of couples and to accurately measure the abundance of specific bacteria in males, namely Gardnerella. This is a key limitation given the interest in G. vaginalis as a key aetiological agent in BV. Future studies should utilise collection of appropriate urethral specimens. Self-collected penile-meatal swabs have been shown to be acceptable for STI testing[79] and would facilitate self-sampling of the urethral microbiota at home.",

As this was a pilot, couples were only followed for three weeks post treatment, and due to the small number of participants, we were unable to assess the effect of demographics, adherence or sexual behaviours on genital microbiota composition. Extending follow up for at least another three months may have provided a more complete understanding of the exchange of the genital microbiota between sexual partners, and together with a larger sample size, the true impact of male reinfection on BV recurrence. Two couples were treated for an STI at baseline and seven women reported taking antibiotics in the month prior to enrolment; four of these women reported metronidazole use. In most cases the antibiotic exposure preceded the diagnosis of BV by days to weeks and regarding the two couples treated at baseline, neither azithromycin nor ceftriaxone have strong anaerobic coverage. Importantly, all women had BV at enrolment and although is possible that antibiotic exposure may have impacted on the genital microbiota of these individuals, any ongoing impact on the genital microbiota during the month of follow-up is unlikely. Co-infection of BV with STIs is common and represents a key challenge of recruiting in STI services. We chose not to exclude the participants treated for STIs at baseline given the primary focus of this pilot study was acceptability and tolerability, however larger studies of male partner treatment should impose stricter eligibility criteria. Additionally, seven women reported unprotected vaginal exposure (received oral sex, or had vaginal or anal sex) during the treatment period, despite the instruction of abstention or condom use. Unprotected vaginal exposure during treatment may have impacted the composition of the vaginal and penile microbiota or treatment efficacy, however given the small sample size we were unable to assess this. Finally, this study did not include a placebo or untreated comparator, preventing comparison of dual-partner treatment to treatment of women only.",

Current treatments for BV are sub-optimal and associated with unacceptably high recurrence rates. Despite not being powered to assess the effect of treatment on recurrence, we observed a low incidence of BV recurrence in a group of women with a past history of BV who were having unprotected sex with a regular partner following dual-partner treatment. There is ongoing debate concerning the pathogenesis of BV recurrence but epidemiological and recent microbiological data strongly suggest sexual transmission is integral to both recurrent and incident disease. Our data support the need for high quality studies of male partner treatment with accompanying vaginal, cutaneous penile and urethral microbiota data, an untreated or placebo group and long-term follow-up to define the actual contribution of reinfection and disease persistence to BV recurrence in women. These data support recent reviews that suggest that combination approaches such as dual partner treatment and biofilm-disrupting agents may are likely to be needed to improve treatment outcomes[13, 14].",
