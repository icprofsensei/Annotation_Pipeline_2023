In the current study we set out to unravel the strong association between this mosquito species and human beings, as it is determined by odorant cues derived from the human skin. Microbial communities on the skin play key roles in the production of human body odour. We demonstrate that the composition of the skin microbiota affects the degree of attractiveness of human beings to this mosquito species. Bacterial plate counts and 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that individuals that are highly attractive to An. gambiae s.s. have a significantly higher abundance, but lower diversity of bacteria on their skin than individuals that are poorly attractive. Bacterial genera that are correlated with the relative degree of attractiveness to mosquitoes were identified. The discovery of the connection between skin microbial populations and attractiveness to mosquitoes may lead to the development of new mosquito attractants and personalized methods for protection against vectors of malaria and other infectious diseases.",

Physical cues include heat, moisture and visual cues, and play a role during orientation and landing [1], [2], [3]. Chemical cues are considered most important for orientation and landing, especially for nocturnal mosquitoes [4], [5] and humans can be ranked for attractiveness to mosquitoes by testing the emanations released from their skin [6], [7], [8], [9]. The mosquito Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto (hereafter An. gambiae), a nocturnal, highly anthropophilic species, is one of the most important malaria vectors in Africa [5]. Volatiles released from human skin provide essential cues that guide this mosquito species to its host [4], [5].",

The model differentiated the PA and HA groups based on the relative abundances of the bacterial genera (three significant latent variables, R2Xcum\u200a=\u200a0.544, R2Ycum\u200a=\u200a0.993, Q2cum\u200a=\u200a0.823). PLS regression coefficients were determined to identify genera that were most characteristic for either group (Figure S3). Variovorax spp. and Pseudomonas spp. were significantly correlated with PA individuals based on their high PLS regression coefficients (95% confidence interval, Figure 4 and Figure S3). Leptotrichia spp., Delftia spp. and Actinobacteria Gp3 spp. were significantly correlated with HA individuals (Figure 4 and Figure S3).",

Our results suggest that Pseudomonas spp. and possibly Variovorax spp. a) convert some of the attractive compounds produced by other bacteria, b) signal to other bacteria in ways that prevent them from emitting these attractive compounds, c) produce compounds that repel An. gambiae, or d) mask the effect of the attractive volatiles emanating from the human skin. More heterogeneous microbiotas may include more bacterial species that produce volatiles attenuating the attractiveness of PA individuals to mosquitoes, and may explain the interference effect described for the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti (L). [7]: higher levels of specific volatile compounds were found to be responsible for decreased attractiveness of individuals to Ae. aegypti. We hypothesize that lower attractiveness to mosquitoes is caused by a selective group of skin microbiota that emanates compounds that interfere with the attraction of mosquitoes to their human hosts and thus function as an in-built defence system [33]. Genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) have been shown to influence body odour [34], [35], [36] and may exert this influence by changing the skin microbiota composition and hence the volatiles produced by these bacteria and/or the human host [16], [37].",

Future studies should confirm if individuals with a specific microbiota composition run a lower risk of becoming infected with parasites, and consequently have a higher survival probability.",

Interestingly, the two closely-related sibling species An. quadriannulatus and An. arabiensis, have a wider host range that is more zoophilic [40], [41], [42] or opportunistic [43], [44], respectively. Bacterial communities of other vertebrate species are likely to differ from those on human beings and may play an important role in determining the host range of mosquitoes [45].",
