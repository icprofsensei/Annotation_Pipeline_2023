Bacterial DNA is present in larger quantities in acute human NEC specimens compared to samples collected after NEC has clinically resolved [7]. A number of different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as viruses have been associated with NEC [8]. Indeed, microbial community studies using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the fecal microbiome demonstrate a reduction in microbial community diversity with a shift towards potentially pathogenic subgroups [9\u201312].",

As intestinal tissue cannot ethically be collected from healthy infants, we included infants with intestinal diseases other than NEC in this study for comparison.

This feature selection method implements a stability selection procedure described in [39] with the improved error bounds described in [40]. Elastic net (from R package glmnet [41]) was used as the base feature selection method that was wrapped by the stability protocol. For groupings with two factor levels, a binomial family model was built with the grouping as a response and the matrix of the abundance values as predictors. The mixing parameter \u03b1 of glmnet was selected based on a 15-fold cross-validation minimizing deviance on the full dataset. The predictors were first normalized to simple proportions within each multivariate observation, transformed with the inverse hyperbolic sign log(x+\u221a(x2+1)), and then standardized to zero means and unit variances. With its multivariate base feature selection method, this protocol can potentially detect those correlated groups of biologically relevant features that will be missed by the univariate methods. The ranking of taxa and their probability of being selected into the model were reported, as well as the probability cutoff corresponding to the per-family error rate (PFER) that is controlled by this method. Our PFER cutoff was set to 0.05, and the target number of features selected by the base classifier was set to (0.8\u2212\u2212\u2212\u221a\u00d7p) where p is the total number of features (39). In our experience with omics datasets, the PFER control in this method is fairly conservative, and we typically look at the ranking of features as opposed to only concentrating on features that pass the PFER cutoff.",

Clostridium_sensu_stricto was near significantly more abundant in NEC tissue compared to non-NEC tissue (Table 2). Both groups were the only two genera identified as being significantly or near significantly more abundant in NEC compared to non-NEC samples. Clostridium_sensu_stricto was significantly more abundant in NEC than non-NEC tissues when the GeneSelector test using Wilcoxon test rankings was applied (q-value = 0.021). Clostridium_sensu_stricto abundance being higher in NEC infants appears to be due mostly to a single infant, N27, who had nearly 100% Clostridium_sensu_stricto abundance; the relative abundance of this genus was low for the remainder of samples (Fig 4).",

To assess the impact of these two disparate non-NEC groups, we repeated our main analyses, after separating out the samples into three groups: 1) NEC 2) \u201cyoung\u201d non-NEC and 3) \u201cold\u201d non-NEC. A PCoA plot constructed using pairwise Bray-Curtis dissimilarities at the genus level revealed that the two non-NEC groups clustered together, separately from samples from infants with NEC (S1 Fig). Additionally, microbial richness was lowest in infants who had NEC and was similar in the two non-NEC groups, regardless of infant age (S2 Fig). Staphylococcus abundance was highest in the NEC group, followed by the youngest non-NEC group, and lowest in the older non-NEC group suggesting intestinal Staphylococcus colonization at early age.",

Here, we report a tissue-specific overrepresentation of Firmicutes, specifically Staphylococcus sp. and Clostridium sp. in NEC. We are aware of only two other reports on the NEC tissue-level microbiome in humans: a study from Denmark performed a retrospective analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens using fluorescent in situ hybridization with bacterial rRNA-targeting oligonucleotide probes [45]. They detected Proteobacteria (49.0%), Firmicutes (30.4%), Actinobacteria (17.1%) and Bacteroidetes (3.6%) in tissue samples. More recently Brower-Sinning et al. applied 16S rRNA technology to compare the microbiome of 16 cryopreserved NEC samples and 10 controls [46]. Except for a higher bacterial load in NEC tissues, no statistically significant distinction was found between the composition of NEC and non-NEC microbial communities. The different results in our study may be explained by the fact that in the work by Brower-Sinning et al. all but one control patient were former NEC patients. In contrast, we included samples from infants with no history of NEC.",

After adding multiple covariates to the model in DESeq2 suggests that a combination of variables is likely to influence the infant tissue microbiome, for example age, vancomycin exposure, and NEC were found to correlate with Staphylococcus abundance. We observed that very young infants with NEC who had been exposed to vancomycin were most likely to have high Staphylococcus abundance in their gut tissue. We do not know how to explain this unexpected finding except by the fact that vancomycin does not penetrate tissue very well. Delivery by C-section has been associated with colonization of the neonate with Staphylococcus [47]. Therefore, we were surprised by our finding that mode of delivery did not correlate with specific taxa in our dataset. However, three out of four samples with high abundance of Staphylococcus were from C-section-delivered infants indicating that our sample size may have been insufficient to detect a statistical significance.",

This allows for an additional level of quality control as each patient is his/her own control and results between fecal and tissue samples were distinct in both non-NEC and NEC patients. Consistent with previous studies in preterm infants [9,48,49], we confirmed the dominant phyla as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, with a smaller contribution (<20%) from Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Several fecal microbiome studies reported a bloom of \u03b3-Proteobacteria with a concomitant decrease in Firmicutes in NEC patients [10,12]. This shift in microbial communities in NEC patients appears to start 1\u20132 weeks prior to diagnosis and has been associated with metabolic changes [9]. While our data do not replicate this shift in Proteobacteria in fecal samples, possibly as we measured the gut microbiome during rather than prior to NEC diagnosis, we confirmed the previously reported reduced microbial diversity and loss of Actinobacteria in NEC patients, especially patients with severe (surgical) disease [10,50].",

However, different forms of dysbiosis have been reported in NEC [11,48] including recently an association between Clostridium and Staphylococcus with NEC in European preterm infants [42]. Importantly, NEC dysbiosis with Firmicutes including Staphylococcus has been associated with earlier disease and higher mortality [48]. Our study included only infants with surgical NEC, the group of patients with highest mortality [51]. When comparing NEC patients with heavy versus light Staphylococcus abundance, NEC patients with high abundance required surgical resection significantly earlier. Staphylococcus is the major colonizing organism of the infant gut shortly after birth [49,52,53]. In preterm neonates, culture-based studies detected Staphylococcus in 50% of meconium and 100% of fecal samples from the first week post-partum [54]. Staphylococcus sp. are frequently cultured from meconium and have been associated with increased risk for NEC [8,55].",

While we collected tissue and fecal samples prospectively, technical and ethical limitations do not allow for tissue sampling prior to surgical resection. Therefore, we cannot perform time series experiments to evaluate the dynamic microbiome changes in NEC tissue. Similarly, since it is currently not possible to sample intestinal tissue from normal infants, we lack a healthy control cohort in which to characterize the standard infant tissue microbiome. While we attempted to match for important variables such as mode of delivery, antibiotic exposure and type of feeding, given the nature of this human study that explores both tissue and stool of a surgical emergency in a very vulnerable population, we were not able to control for all possible microbiome confounders. In addition, the lack of shotgun metagenomic sequencing prohibits further classification of the bacteria, especially those of important genera e.g., Staphylococcus and Clostridium identified in this study. However, based on the recent findings by Roz\u00e9 et al, we speculate that the majority of Staphylococcus and Clostridium species would be S. aureus and C. neonatale [42]. Future studies implementing whole genome sequencing will be necessary to address strain identification and implications for derangements in metabolic function associated with the distinct microbial community structure we detected. An additional future aim could be to measure Staphylococcus-specific endotoxin production in stool samples, especially as our PICRUSt data suggests there was an increase in bacterial toxin pathways in NEC compared to non-NEC tissue samples.",
