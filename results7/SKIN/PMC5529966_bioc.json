Effective prevention requires identification of biomarkers of risk but currently available strategies are actually based on markers of established, albeit early, disease or the identification of precursor lesions such as dysplasia and adenomatous polyps. Since genetic syndromes account for a minority of cases of CRC,1 factors that predispose to sporadic mutations offer the best prospect for early identification of individuals at greatest risk. Most of the known environmental or lifestyle risk factors for CRC, such as obesity and diets that are high in fat or red meat,2 also modify the indigenous microbiota. Thus, the microbiota or its metabolites may be the proximate environmental modifiers of risk for colon cancer. One of the lessons from the relationship between Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer is that interindividual variation may be due to heterogeneity at the level of either the microbe or the host response.3 In the case of CRC, the relationship between the microbiota and disease may be even more complex; combinations or co-abundance groups (CAGs) of organisms may be operative, rather than representing a one organism\u2013one disease model.4",

Some of the variances may be methodological: sampling differences (faeces vs mucosal tissue) or due to different stages of disease or true differences between the right and left colon. Heterogeneity of cancer-associated microbiota might also reflect differences in the host immunoinflammatory response to cancer, which is known to influence prognosis.9 Despite such heterogeneity of CRC-associated microbiota, recent studies have suggested the feasibility of using a combination of several bacteria (or microbiota signature) in the faecal microbiota of individuals with CRC as a marker for detecting the disease.10\u201312",

The results show that individuals with CRC can be stratified into four different groups based on the abundance of bacterial co-occurrence networks, but importantly we have been able to define a more complex concept of bacterial abundance gradients and community scaffolds rather than discrete bacteriotypes. The altered microbiota of these patients is present on the mucosa throughout the colon and is not restricted to cancerous tissue. Moreover, we detected microbiota differences between individuals with distal (including rectal) tumours and proximal tumours, and specific microbiota profiles were correlated with the expression of genes known to regulate the host immunoinflammatory response.",

An operational taxonomic unit (OTU) table was obtained using usearch18 and the following procedure. First, unique sequences of length 350\u2013500\u2005nt were filtered (derep_fulllength) and sorted by length (sortbylength). The remaining sequences were clustered (cluster_otus) and filtered for chimaeras against the ChimeraSlayer reference database.19 Finally, all sequences were mapped against this database (usearch_global) and an OTU table was obtained using uc2otutab.py. Classification of representative sequences for each OTU was carried out using mothur20 against the 16S rRNA reference of RDP, V.14. A similar approach was employed for analysing 16S rRNA sequencing data that we obtained from two previous studies,11\n21 with the exception that quality filtering of the pyrosequencing data from Kostic et al was carried out according to the 454 standard operating procedure in mothur.22 Identical sequencing depth per sample was ensured by rarification to 5000 sequences per sample for this cohort; to 10\u2005000 sequences per sample for data from Zeller et al; and to 2000 sequences per sample for data from Kostic et al.

Despite the collective differences between subjects with cancer and controls, the microbiota associated with cancerous and non-cancerous tissues within the same individual did not differ significantly (figure 1B). While individual bacterial taxa, including Fusobacterium, were more abundant in some individuals ON the tumour, no single OTU or genus was found to be significantly more or less abundant (see online supplementary tables S5 and S6). In addition, the microbiota of individuals with polyps (mostly undiseased tissue was studied for this group) was found to be significantly different to that of controls (figure 1A; range of Pr (>F) 0.0002 to 0.03 for the different distance matrices applied as in online supplementary figures S1\u2013S4).

                    "text": "Although most demographic features of the patients with CRC (see online supplementary table S1) were not associated with a particular mucosal microbiota profile, the microbiota of distal and proximal cancers differed significantly, both at the level of the whole community (see figure 1C and online supplementary figures S1\u2013S4) as well as for single OTU and genus (see online supplementary tables S8 and S9). In particular, the abundances of Alistipes (p<0.1), Akkermansia (p<0.1), Halomonas and Shewanella were significantly higher in individuals with rectal and distal cancers. Contrastingly, OTUs classified as Faecalibacterium, Blautia and Clostridium were significantly more abundant in individuals with proximal cancer. This difference in sidedness was also assessed in the control samples. An equal number of distal and proximal sided control tissue samples from different individuals was randomly sampled 100 times. For 97% of sample combinations, the microbiota of distal and proximal control individuals was not significantly different. Thus, it is unlikely that the differences observed between distal and proximal cancers are due to interindividual differences rather than the location of the tumour. Administration of different bowel preparations for distal (including rectal) and proximal cancers is also a possible confounding factor. Individuals with distal and rectal cancers were often administered a full bowel preparation prior to surgery (see online supplementary table S1), whereas individuals with proximal cancers were only administered two phosphate enemas on the morning of the surgery. Indeed, significant differences in microbiota composition were found between individuals with different bowel preparations. However, when excluding proximal cancers, no significant difference in microbiota composition was detected (Pr (>F)=0.12 for unweighted UniFrac distance, no adjustment for multiple testing) for the different bowel preparations applied. In contrast, when excluding distal and rectal cancers with full bowel preparation, the differences in microbiota composition between distal and rectal versus proximal cancers were still detected (range of Pr (>F) 0.003\u20130.02 for the different distance matrices applied). We conclude that differences in microbiota composition due to varying bowel preparations cannot be excluded but differences in microbiota composition between distal and rectal versus proximal cancers are more robust.",

Thus, the relative abundance of single OTU was only moderately correlated between paired mucosal and faecal samples (mean of Kendall's \u03c4 correlation coefficient of 0.20 for all OTUs; see online supplementary table S10a). However, significant differences between the faecal microbiota of controls and patients with CRC were still detected, both in terms of single organism (Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis and Coprococcus were significantly decreased in individuals with CRC) as well as overall microbiota (see online supplementary figures S1\u2013S4).

Therefore, we analysed the microbiota by determining CAGs, since community structure can be more informative than abundance differences of individual taxa.13 We identified six robust CAGs or bacterial clusters in the OTU data set and named them according to the most notable characteristic (figure 2). Among these, the Firmicutes Cluster 1 and the Bacteroidetes Cluster 1 were significantly less abundant in the microbiota of individuals with CRC, whereas the Firmicutes Cluster 2, Prevotella Cluster, Pathogen Cluster and Bacteroidetes Cluster 2 were more abundant in CRC biopsy microbiota (adjusted p value <0.1 for the latter; figure 3A). Similar trends were evident for the mucosal biopsy microbiota of individuals with polyps, albeit not statistically significant in all cases (figure 3A). The relative abundance of these CAGs was also significantly different by tumour location\u2014Bacteroidetes Cluster 2 and the Pathogen Cluster were more abundant in distal cancers, whereas the Prevotella Cluster and Firmicutes Cluster 2 were only significantly more abundant in individuals with proximal cancers (figure 3B).",

Thus, the separation of the samples in the PCoA along the X-axis and Y-axis was significantly correlated with the abundance of the CAGs (figure 5). Moreover, a strong correlation was detected between \u03b1-diversity and microbiota structure. The higher microbiota diversity level strongly correlated with the abundance of the Bacteroidetes Cluster 2 and Firmicutes Cluster 2 (p=6\u00d710\u221210 and p=5\u00d710\u221225, respectively), whereas a negative correlation was detected between \u03b1-diversity and the abundance of the Pathogen Cluster (p=3\u00d710\u22124). Clustering of individuals based on the (mucosal microbiota) abundance of each of the six bacterial clusters revealed four distinct sample groups (figure 6). Sample Groups 1 and 2 comprised only individuals with CRC, which displayed high abundances of the Pathogen Cluster and the Prevotella Cluster, respectively. Sample Group 3 comprised mostly healthy controls (70%) and individuals in this group had high abundances of the Firmicutes Cluster 1. Lastly, Sample Group 4 contained mostly individuals with CRC (62%) and elevated abundances of Bacteroidetes Cluster 1 and Bacteroidetes Cluster 2 (figures 6 and \u200band7).7). Firmicutes Cluster 2 was of elevated abundance in CRC samples of Sample Groups 3 and 4.",

Furthermore, the fold-change in abundance between OTUs of this CAG in mucosal and faecal microbiota was very high (mean >100, see online supplementary table S10b). Many of the OTUs with the highest fold-difference between paired CRC biopsy samples and CRC faecal samples were classified as Parvimonas, Anaerococcus, Streptococcus and Fusobacterium (see online supplementary table S10b), all bacteria of possibly oral origin. This discrepancy indicated a strong dilution of the mucosa-associated microbiota in faeces in individuals with high levels of possibly oral pathogens and could mean that these organisms form tight associations with the mucosa, resembling bacterial biofilms present in the oral cavity.",

Additionally, we removed healthy control samples from our data set, as such samples were not available for the other two studies. Strikingly, very similar microbial co-occurrence networks were identified in all three data sets (see online supplementary figures S5\u2013S8). Furthermore, the strong association of the Firmicutes Cluster 2 with elevated \u03b1-diversity that we described above, and the association of the Pathogen Cluster with decreased \u03b1-diversity, were both consistently detected (see online supplementary figure S9). Additionally, the four sample groups identified in our cohort, containing individuals with high mucosal abundance of the different microbial co-occurrence networks (figure 6), were validated in large part in the other two data sets (see online supplementary figures S10\u2013S13). Lastly, we analysed the data at the level of the bacterial genus, which allowed additional comparison of microbial abundances between healthy controls of the present cohort with microbial abundances in tumour samples of the two publicly available datasets. Mostly, similar bacterial genera were found to be less and more abundant in individuals with CRC throughout all three studied cohorts (see online supplementary figure S14).",

Thirteen genes were differentially expressed in patients and controls (see online supplementary table S2b), and the expression was significantly correlated with the abundance of several OTUs (see figure 8 and online supplementary table S11). More importantly, the mucosal abundance of the six bacterial clusters was associated with distinct mucosal gene expression profiles (table 2). The two clusters that were of decreased abundance in individuals with CRC (Firmicutes Cluster 1 and Bacteroidetes Cluster 1) were negatively correlated with the expression of genes such as CXCL1, SERPINE1, and interleukins (ILs) 17a and 23. Contrastingly, the abundance of the cancer-associated clusters Prevotella Cluster and Pathogen Cluster was positively correlated with the expression of these genes. For the Bacteroidetes Cluster 2 and Firmicutes Cluster 2 on the one hand and the Pathogen Cluster on the other hand, all of which show significantly increased abundance in individuals with CRC, opposing correlations were detected (table 2 and figure 9; individuals with CRC only). For example, the abundance of the former clusters was significantly negatively correlated with the expression of CCL20 and IL-17a, whereas the abundance of the Pathogen Cluster was positively correlated with the expression of such genes (table 2 and figure 9). At the level of single OTU, similar patterns were observed (figure 8). Importantly, the associations between the abundance of bacterial clusters and gene-expression levels were also detected in healthy tissue from patients with CRC (see online supplementary table S12), indicating that the microbiota-associated changes of mucosal gene-expression profiles could be involved in the early stages of disease development. In summary, the different mucosal microbiota structures detected were associated with different mucosal gene expression profiles.",

For example, OTUs most closely related to Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus or Parvimonas were markedly elevated in only 20\u201330% of individuals with CRC. However, it was possible to define four microbial clusters (higher level structures) of the CRC-associated microbiota of which at least one was elevated more than twofold (compared with the mean in all control samples) in all but one of the individuals with CRC. Importantly, we were able to verify our findings with regard to microbial heterogeneity associated with CRC patients by comparison with two previous studies.11\n21 However, differences were also observed. For example, we defined one CAG in the continental European cohort,21 which comprised genera such as Variovorax, Caulobacter and Comamonas. These bacterial taxa were not prevalent in our cohort which is possibly due to different 16S rRNA regions studied, as well as possibly differences in DNA extraction methodology. Additionally, tumour microbiota data sets from the American/European/Vietnamese cohort21 displayed very high abundances of Fusobacterium spp. in comparison to both the Irish and the continental European cohort. Geographical differences (environmental reservoirs for intestinal bacteria) could be an additional factor in this case.",

                    "text": "Arumugam et al have previously proposed a stratification of individuals into three distinct bacteriotypes or enterotypes.30 We detected striking similarities with this concept when grouping individuals into four subgroups based on their abundance of the six bacterial clusters (figures 6 and \u200band7),7), but our data support a concept of stratification based on bacterial abundance gradients rather than discrete bacteriotypes. Importantly, particularly when only considering the microbiota associated with tumours (see online supplementary figure S7) from the Irish cohort, the two bacterial clusters associated with healthy individuals were still detected (Firmicutes Cluster 1 and Bacteroidetes Cluster 1) and were correlated with the presence of two CRC-associated bacterial clusters (Firmicutes Cluster 2 and Bacteroidetes Cluster 2, respectively). The third and fourth clusters represent the Prevotella Cluster and the Pathogen Cluster, which were both clearly associated with the presence of CRC (figures 6 and \u200band7).7). This indicates that CRC-associated microbiota arises from a context of three different baseline microbiotas (Firmicutes Cluster 1, Bacteroidetes Cluster 1 and Prevotella Cluster). From a functional point of view, the microbiota of individuals with high abundances of the Prevotella Cluster and the Pathogen Cluster might influence the development of CRC through modulating the expression of immunoinflammatory response genes. Contrastingly, CRC-associated microbiota of the Bacteroidetes Cluster 2 and Firmicutes Cluster 2 type were negatively correlated with the expression of such genes, and are therefore likely to exhibit other properties, which might influence the development of CRC.",

In contrast, the negative association of the Bacteroidetes Cluster 2 and Firmicutes Cluster 2 with the expression of IL-17a and CCL20 suggest that these CAGs are associated with a decreased TH17 response and, perhaps, a better prognosis for CRC.",

We identified a CAG (Firmicutes Cluster 2), which was more often found to be increased in proximal cancers and associated with a gene expression profile more similar to the control cohort (and possibly a decreased TH17 response). In particular, the abundance of the Bacteroidetes Cluster 2 and Firmicutes Cluster 2 was negatively correlated with the expression of IL-17a and CCL20, a chemokine shown to promote cancer cell proliferation and migration35 and which binds to the TH17-cell receptor CCRC6. Several microbial and host factors contribute to differences in the topographical distribution of cancers over the long axis of the gut.36 The biological significance of difference in the microbiota in the proximal and distal colon is not currently clear but it is noteworthy that right and left colon are embryologically distinct, and have different blood supply and innervation. Furthermore, cancers of the right colon present and behave differently clinically to those of the distal colon. The relationship between these facts and the distinctiveness of the microbiome in the right and left colon is uncertain but worthy of future exploration.",

First, although we could not find differences between the composition of the microbiota of individuals with or without neoadjuvant therapy, presurgical treatment is potentially a confounding variable that is currently being tested more systematically by us. Second, bowel preparation has been shown to effect microbiota composition.37 Whereas we cannot exclude an impact of the varying types and amounts of bowel preparation administered on the microbiota, the detected differences in the microbiota structure of healthy controls and individuals with CRC as well as distal, including rectal, and proximal CRCs were stronger than differences related to bowel preparation. Third, we found evidence that individuals with CRC have different dietary habits than healthy controls (see online supplementary figure S15). However, no significant association was found between habitual diet and structure of the microbiota, perhaps because of insufficient dietary difference within the cohort. Furthermore, although dietary assessments by FFQ have been highly informative in assessing the impact of diet on the composition of the microbiota in elderly subjects,13 a diet\u2013microbiota link probably relates to dietary intake many years before the age of presentation with CRC. Consequently, contemporaneous dietary assessments are less likely to be informative.",
