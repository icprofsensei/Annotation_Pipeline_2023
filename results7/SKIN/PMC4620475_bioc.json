Viral communities have the potential to modulate states of cutaneous health and disease. Bacteriophages are known to influence the structure and function of microbial communities through predation and genetic exchange. Human viruses are associated with skin cancers and a multitude of cutaneous manifestations. Despite these important roles, little is known regarding the human skin virome and its interactions with the host microbiome. Here we evaluated the human cutaneous double-stranded DNA virome by metagenomic sequencing of DNA from purified virus-like particles (VLPs). In parallel, we employed metagenomic sequencing of the total skin microbiome to assess covariation and infer interactions with the virome. Samples were collected from 16 subjects at eight body sites over 1\u00a0month. In addition to the microenviroment, which is known to partition the bacterial and fungal microbiota, natural skin occlusion was strongly associated with skin virome community composition. Viral contigs were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style and also maintained genes encoding potential antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation and suggest a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Finally, we modeled the structure of bacterial and phage communities together to reveal a complex microbial environment with a Corynebacterium hub. These results reveal the previously underappreciated diversity, encoded functions, and viral-microbial dynamic unique to the human skin virome.",

To date, most cutaneous microbiome studies have focused on bacterial and fungal communities, their modulation of cutaneous immune responses, and the association of these microorganisms with dermatological disorders (1). Recent metagenomic studies confirm the roles of the skin microenvironment and interpersonal variation in shaping the microbiome (2). Skin viral communities and their relationships with their hosts remain poorly understood, despite their potential to modulate states of cutaneous health and disease. Bacteriophages (phages, viruses that infect bacteria) can affect human health by altering the composition of their host bacterial communities through predation (3, 4). Evidence of such dynamism is provided by the acquisition and diversification of bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) elements (e.g., see reference 5) that target phage genomes for destruction by using nucleases guided by sequences encoded in the CRISPR arrays. Phages may also have long-term impacts on their hosts via lysogeny, in which phages integrate their genome into the host and adopt a quiescent state. New genes carried by lysogens can affect host metabolism, virulence, antibiotic resistance, and sensitivity to other phages (6,\u20139). Phages may also serve as a genetic reservoir for bacterial adaptations during stress (i.e., antibiotic treatment) (10). Viruses that replicate on human cells are also present in the skin and can affect human health, including human papillomaviruses (HPVs), human polyomaviruses (HPyVs), and human herpesviruses, and can cause skin cancers and other dermatological disorders.",

The study we present here employed techniques for the purification of viral DNA, thereby reducing contamination from human and bacterial cells, whose genomes are orders of magnitude longer than viral genomes. This allows for deeper viral sequencing and the use of reference-independent analyses to capture the impact of unknown or uncharacterized genomes, known as viral dark matter (13). We applied shotgun metagenomic analysis to purified VLPs, as well as unpurified whole skin microbial communities, conducting the first longitudinal, integrated analysis of the healthy human skin virome and the whole metagenome across diverse anatomical locations. The major questions we address with this novel data set are as follows. What are the biogeography and diversity of the human skin virome compared to those of the whole metagenome over time and across individuals? What genetic functions are encoded by the skin virome, including antibiotic resistance, virulence factors (VFs), and auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs; host genes within phage genomes [14])? What can we infer about interactions between phages and their bacterial hosts, including the role of CRISPRs in maintaining virome community structure?",

It is important to note that while many viruses are not identifiable at the family level, they are often identifiable at the species level, as is the case with many orphan Staphylococcus phages (24).",

A large fraction of each virome contained contigs that maintained equal similarity to multiple phages, meaning they were not assignable to a single species and were therefore annotated as \u201cmultiple hits\u201d (Fig.\u00a02A). This is likely a reflection of the modular nature of bacteriophage genomes and highlights the need for more robust reference databases for a better understanding of phage genome architecture. There was also an abundant representation of environmental phages, including Pseudomonas and Bacillus phages.",

Bacterial communities were classified from the unassembled sequences by using MetaPhlAn (25, 26), which annotates sequences on the basis of clade-specific markers from reference genomes. Additionally, bacterial, fungal, and viral species abundances were quantified from assembled contigs by using the lowest common ancestor algorithm in MEGAN5 (27). Consistent with previous whole-metagenome analyses of skin (2, 28), Propionibacterium (including Propionibacterium acnes), Staphylococcus (including Staphylococcus epidermidis and S.\u00a0hominis), and Corynebacterium were the dominant bacterial genera (Fig.\u00a02B; see Fig.\u00a0S4A and B in the supplemental material) and Malassezia was the most abundant fungal genus (see Fig.\u00a0S4A and C). Viruses were present in low abundance (average, 0.4% per sample), likely because of the relatively small genome size of viruses compared to that of prokaryotes and microeukaryotes, and this further highlights the utility of VLP isolation before sequencing (see Fig.\u00a0S4A and D). The viruses recovered were primarily \u201cunclassified\u201d and Staphylococcus phages (see Fig.\u00a0S4D).",

Conversely, temperate phages are able to integrate their genomes into the bacterial host genome and exist as prophages, as well as excise and go through the lytic cycle. To examine the replication strategies of the phages residing on the skin, we used an established approach (17) of searching VLP contigs for temperate phage replication markers, including (i) the presence of integrase genes (including members of both the serine and tyrosine integrase families), (ii) the presence of temperate prophage genes, including parABS partitioning systems, and (iii) nucleotide sequence identity to bacterial genomes indicative of integration. Of the 6,661 contigs that were annotated as bacteriophages by our taxonomic criteria described above, 5,363 had at least one of these three temperate phage markers (Fig.\u00a03A). More specifically, 592 (8.8%) contained at least a single integrase gene, as represented in the UniProt TrEMBL database; 856 (12.9%) aligned with known bacterial genomes, including Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria; and 5,137 (77.1%) contained ORFs similar to annotated prophage genes found in the ACLAME database of mobile genetic elements (34). By these measures, each anatomical skin site had a median relative proportion of >85% temperate phages, with different relative abundances by site (Fig.\u00a03B; P < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis and multiple-comparison post hoc tests). This finding suggests that the majority of identifiable Caudovirales bacteriophages on the skin are temperate, consistent with studies of the human gut virome (16, 17).",

We evaluated whether there were core AMGs conserved across the entire skin virome, thereby belonging to the overall core gene set. To accomplish this, we clustered the predicted virome contig ORFs into representative operational taxonomic unit-like sequences called operational protein families (OPFs) (9, 37). Core OPFs were defined as those OPFs that were present in all of the samples from a skin site. Core OPFs were differentially distributed across skin sites, with the greatest amount present on the forehead (Fig.\u00a03C). Of the 15 core OPFs present in all of the virome samples, all were hypothetical or known phage genes and none were AMG candidates (Fig.\u00a03D), suggesting a sparse population of core skin virome AMGs. As highlighted above, in comparison to the metagenome, the virome was enriched in genes for KEGG pathways related to transport (see Fig.\u00a0S7B), as well as GO terms associated with regulation of RNA metabolic processes (GOEAST, P < 0.05). This indicates that potential AMGs, while not strictly belonging to a \u201ccore\u201d set of genes, are present throughout the skin virome. We also investigated the distribution of OPFs with respect to the skin site microenvironment and occlusion and found significant differences (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; P < 0.001, Adonis test), suggesting differential spatial distribution of virome functional potential (Fig.\u00a03E).",

Using blast algorithm parameters specified in previous foundational human virome studies (17, 38), we assessed antibiotic resistance potential by comparing ORFs from the assembled virome contigs to the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) (39) (BLASTx E value, <10\u22125). To further increase our confidence in the annotations beyond that of past studies, we filtered the BLASTx hits to keep only those with >75% identity. Viromes contained 29 unique antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) groups, which were related to antibiotic efflux and resistance to beta-lactamases, rifampin, tetracycline, and elfamycin (Fig.\u00a04A). Tetracyclines are commonly used to treat dermatological conditions such as acne, and elfamycins are naturally occurring antibiotics with strong activity against P.\u00a0acnes (40). To confirm that the ARGs identified are associated with the virome and not cellular contamination or artifacts, we demonstrated that ~50% of the ARGs are colocalized on contigs with other annotated phage genes or are themselves known phage-associated ARGs (Fig.\u00a04B). ARGs were associated primarily with \u201cmultiple-hit,\u201d Bacillus, and Streptococcus phages (Fig.\u00a04B). We also identified potential VFs associated with the skin virome by using the VF database (VFDB) (41) with the same BLASTx parameters and filtering as described for antibiotic resistance analysis above. We identified 122 unique VF genes, and >1/3 of the VF contigs were either known phage-associated genes or colocalized with phage genes (Fig.\u00a04C). These findings together indicate that bacteriophages of the skin microbiome may be a significant source of transmissible genes associated with antibiotic resistance, virulence, and pathogenicity.",

Positive interactions indicate that the bacteria and phage typically co-occur, while negative interactions suggest a mutually exclusive relationship between the bacterium and phage relative abundances. The resulting network of significant phage-bacterium interactions contained 21 nodes, 7 bacteria, and 14 phages. Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus bacteria were typically copresent with their phage counterparts, Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus phages, respectively (Fig.\u00a05A). The overall co-occurrence structure suggests that the network is nonrandom, exhibiting scale-free properties such as short average path lengths (characteristic path length, 2.781) and a node degree distribution that approximately fits a power law (R2 = 0.781) (43). Short average path lengths suggest that the skin phage-bacterium community network is able to respond rapidly to perturbations (44). The heterogeneity value (likelihood of uneven distribution of edges) of the network was 0.819, suggesting that there are fewer hubs and indicating the presence of potential \u201ckeystone\u201d taxa in the network (45).",

Spacer sequences, generally 26 to 72\u00a0nucleotides in length, are captured from invading phages and integrated into the bacterial chromosome. These spacer sequences provide a genomic record of phage predators encountered by the bacteria. We detected a total of 477 unique spacer sequences, identified by 68 unique CRISPR repeats in the whole metagenomic data set. Only 18 spacers aligned with VLP contigs (Fig.\u00a05B). These spacers were found in 21 metagenomic contigs and mapped to 40 unique VLP contigs. Spacers found in the Um aligned only with Um VLP contigs. Two Staphylococcus spacers detected in the Ax aligned with 16 different VLP contigs that were found at every body site except the Pa (Fig.\u00a05B). A Propionibacterium spacer found in both the Pa and Tw aligned with eight different VLP contigs from the Ax, Oc, Fh, and Ra (Fig.\u00a05B). These findings indicate that phage-host dynamics may not be restricted by anatomical skin site, and spacers identified at one skin site may be restricting phage during invasions from other skin sites, which could, in part, explain the spatial partitioning of the skin virome. We further characterized the genomic CRISPR targets within the VLP contigs and found that the majority of the targets within coding regions belonged to phage portal proteins, which are genes involved in the packaging of DNA into phage particles (Fig.\u00a05C). It is unclear whether this is an artifact of the low sampling of CRISPR spacers (approximately 12 spacers were annotated) or a biological phenomenon. Further work is required to understand this to a greater extent. Interestingly, the majority of CRISPR targets did not map to predicted ORFs, suggesting that there is not a targeting preference for genomic coding regions (Fig.\u00a05C).",

However, this technique has previously been technically prohibitive for application to skin viruses because of the small microbial burdens in and on the skin. Advanced library preparation techniques utilizing ultrasmall amounts (<1\u00a0ng) of DNA have facilitated this study to characterize the human skin dsDNA virome in parallel with the whole metagenome in order to gain insight into multikingdom interactions of the skin microbiome.",

CRISPRs not only targeted phages found at the same skin sites but also targeted phages at other skin sites, providing a record of successfully repelled attacks from phages now detected at other body sites. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for partitioning of the skin virome between different anatomical locations and warrants further investigation. While we focused on CRISPR mechanisms of interaction, there are other mechanisms of bacterium-phage interactions that are worth investigating in future studies such as restriction modifications.",

We identified phages by their host bacteria, but the numbers of known phages that infect bacteria differ greatly between hosts and the genomic diversity within these phages also varies. For example, Propionibacterium phages exhibit limited genomic diversity (46) and thus there is a higher likelihood of identifying a sequence match to one of these phages if it is present. Mycobacterium and Staphylococcus phages are more diverse, and reference-dependent methods will miss phages that diverge heavily from known sequences. We attempted to minimize the impact of these variations on our relative abundance and diversity calculations by using both reference-dependent and reference-independent methods.",

In order to minimize this bias, we employed a voting system based on taxonomy assigned to all of the genes within the contig and required that contigs have at least one identified gene every 10\u00a0kb to ensure that enough genes are present for proper classification. De novo contig assembly could also affect the interpretation of specific gene colocalizations observed (i.e., Fig. 4B and \u200bandC).C). Antibiotic genes could be adjacent to other genes but misrepresented because of contig assembly issues associated with mosaic genomes.

Many shotgun metagenomic studies of low-biomass communities have not addressed background contamination by sequencing and analysis of appropriate negative controls, resulting in erroneous conclusions (47). Previous virome studies have attempted to increase biomass by pooling samples, but this design is not conducive to the identification of interindividual variability. In the present study, in addition to minimizing contamination during library preparation, blank background controls were collected and analyzed. In silico decontamination removed organisms from experimental samples that were also present in the background controls. We defined successful removal of background contamination as a significant difference between the background controls and the experimental samples based on the Bray-Curtis distance metric. A caveat to this approach is that it is reference dependent and potential uncharacterized contaminants would not be detected. Also, if the background controls were not sequenced to absolute saturation, some low-abundance contaminants would not be detected. While this could impact the lowest-abundance contaminants, it is unlikely that major contaminants remained in the samples.",

Alpha diversity was estimated by including both the known and unknown viruses with the PHACCS algorithm (54) and GAAS program (55). Beta diversity was assessed by using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric within the vegan R package (CRAN) (56) and was based on normalized sequence counts (number of reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) for each contig by sample (56). Beta diversity information was also used for the intra- and interpersonal diversity calculations. Whole-metagenome taxonomy was assigned by using MetaPhlAn (25, 26) and MEGAN5 (27). Whole-metagenome diversity was calculated with the vegan R package. For comparison, the alpha diversity of each anatomic site from both the virome and the whole metagenome was calculated by the box plot notch calculation described in the ggplot2 R package (57), as well as by McGill et al. (58).",
