Previously, the sinuses were believed to be sterile in a healthy, nondiseased state.

Control experiments were performed by using live or heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain K subjected to the same control or DNase treatment described above. No decrease in DNA quantity was seen after DNase treatment of the live P. aeruginosa strain K samples (control, 84.0 ng/\u03bcL; DNase, 109.6 ng/\u03bcL); however, little to no intact DNA was extracted from the heat-killed P. aeruginosa strain K after DNase treatment, whereas the control-treated sample remained unchanged (control, 89.2 ng/\u03bcL; DNase, 2.8 ng/\u03bcL).

In total, 164 unique OTUs were identified across the 12 samples. We found that the overall bacterial diversity of our samples decreased with DNase treatment: an average of 33 unique OTUs were sequenced from our control-treated samples compared with an average of 27 unique OTUs in the DNase-treated samples. Besides the genera that appeared to be present only as dead bacteria or free DNA (i.e., Propionibacterium and Akkermansia), a number of other bacteria commonly found in the sinuses were found to be highly DNase sensitive. Twenty-five percent of the Staphylococcus detected was already dead on sampling as well as >50% of the Enterobacter, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Escherichia, and Bacteroides, all genus that contain known or suspected respiratory pathogens (Table 3).",

Although total DNA yields and quality were equivalent among the three methods, which was consistent with one previous publication that compared maxillary sinus brushings with tissue biopsy,24 we found that significantly more bacterial DNA was collected by using the swabs and brushes (Table 1). This difference was most likely due to the much larger sinus epithelia surface area that can be sampled by using these methods. Contributing to this difference could also be that tissue biopsy specimens include subcutaneous epithelial cells, whereas brushes typically include only surface epithelial cells. From a practical standpoint, we found that the double-tip culture swabs were gentle enough to allow for sample collection in the clinic without the use of analgesics and allowed for parallel collection of two virtually identical samples from the same location, critical for our DNase studies.",

Of the limited number of studies performed to date that looked at live versus dead bacteria the majority was performed in isolated bacterial populations or environmental samples, which makes it difficult to compare.25,26 However, Maurice et al.27 found that >17% of bacteria in human fecal samples were propidium iodide-sensitive, and Pezzulo et al.15 found that 63% of bacteria from porcine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were DNase sensitive. These striking differences indicated that the fraction of dead bacteria observed in a given microbial community may vary greatly, depending on disease state, location, sampling method, and other factors yet to be elucidated. They also highlight the importance of looking at both the total and live bacteria-derived DNA to avoid greatly overestimating the living components of the microbiome.",

Viability PCR depends on cell membrane impermeability to exclude a dye, such as propidium monoazide or propidium iodide, from gaining access to the nucleus.15,25 Damaged or dead cells that have lost membrane integrity will take up the dye, which is then covalently cross-linked to the cell's DNA. PCR amplification of this bound DNA is blocked, and, therefore, downstream detection by sequencing is prevented. However, these techniques are complicated because excess dye is difficult to remove, which requires multiple washing, target transfer steps, and potentially introduces contamination, result in bacterial target loss, and may give false-negative results due to carryover of unbound dye.26",

As with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and propidium iodide, DNase can only act on accessible DNA, which is not protected within an intact cell membrane. However, this technique differs in that, rather than modifying the DNA to block PCR amplification, the enzyme directly cleaves available DNA into fragments too small for PCR detection. This cleavage minimizes the possibility of false-positives by destroying DNA from dead bacteria rather than just shielding it from PCR amplification. DNase also has the advantage of being susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by pronase or irreversible heat inactivation, which thus removes the risk of false-negative results, the need for multiple wash steps, and potential loss of target.15,26 Although DNase has been shown to have a negative effect on bacterial biofilm formation after long-term treatment, even these experiments, which used higher concentrations of DNase and far longer incubations than those used here, did not report cell death, just a slowing of replication.28 Furthermore, the sturdy nature of bacterial cell envelopes, which can remain intact hours or even days after cell death,25,29,30 combined with the very short treatment time required (10 minutes before DNase inactivation and cell lysis) does not provide sufficient time for the cells to permeate and render themselves susceptible to DNase degradation.",

It would be incorrect to ignore dead bacteria in microbiome analysis because by-products of dead bacteria (including extracellular vesicles, lipopolysaccharides, and free DNA) are known stimulators of innate immunity and contribute to biofilm formation and to the overall picture of microbial interactions. We do, however, believe that it is critical to differentiate between these two distinct populations and believe that our protocol adds an additional layer of vital information to traditional 16S rRNA gene analysis techniques. Although our sample size was small, our study was the first, to our knowledge, to profile the live versus dead bacterial species present in the healthy human sinus. Further studies currently underway in our laboratory will identify how this healthy microbiome shifts in patients with chronic sinus disease and how these populations may further change after clinical intervention. It is also possible that different sites within the sinuses may have different bacterial communities that may be more or less stable due to how exposed they are to the outside environment. Current microbiome analyses include bacterial richness, evenness, and diversity in the sinus; however, we propose that DNase sensitivity may also be a critical factor in understanding the mechanisms of host-immune response because these mechanisms regulate the sinus microbiome in both health and disease.",
