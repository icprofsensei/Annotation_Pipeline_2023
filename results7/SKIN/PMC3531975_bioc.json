Under\nnormal circumstances, these microbes help us to digest our food and to maintain\nour immune systems, but dysfunction of the human microbiota has been linked to\nconditions ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to antibiotic-resistant\ninfections. Modern high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic tools provide a\npowerful means of understanding the contribution of the human microbiome to\nhealth and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. This chapter\nwill first discuss the historical origins of microbiome studies and methods for\ndetermining the ecological diversity of a microbial community. Next, it will\nintroduce shotgun sequencing technologies such as metagenomics and\nmetatranscriptomics, the computational challenges and methods associated with\nthese data, and how they enable microbiome analysis. Finally, it will conclude\nwith examples of the functional genomics of the human microbiome and its\ninfluences upon health and disease.",

The\ncommunity formed by this complement of cells is called the human\nmicrobiome; it contains almost ten times as many cells as are in the\nrest of our bodies and accounts for several pounds of body weight and orders of\nmagnitude more genes than are contained in the human genome [1], [2]. Under normal circumstances, these\nmicrobes are commensal, helping to digest our food and to maintain our immune\nsystems. Although the human microbiome has long been known to influence human health\nand disease [1], we\nhave only recently begun to appreciate the breadth of its involvement. This is\nalmost entirely due to the recent ability of high-throughput sequencing to provide\nan efficient and cost-effective tool for investigating the members of a microbial\ncommunity and how they change. Thus, dysfunctions of the human microbiota are\nincreasingly being linked to disease ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to\ndiabetes to antibiotic-resistant infection, and the potential of the human\nmicrobiome as an early detection biomarker and target for therapeutic intervention\nis a vibrant area of current research.",

Specific microbial species were detected by plating\nsamples on specialized media selective for the growth of that organism, or they were\nidentified by features such as the morphological characteristics of colonies, their\ngrowth on different media, and metabolic production or consumption. This approach\nlimited the range of organisms that could be detected to those that would actively\ngrow in laboratory culture, and it led the close study of easily-grown, now-familiar\nmodel organisms such as Escherichia coli. However, E.\ncoli as a taxonomic unit accounts for at most 5% of the microbes\noccupying the typical human gut [2].

The simplest is no assembly at\nall - the short reads produced as primary data can, after cleaning to reduce\nsequencing error [18], be treated as taxonomic markers or as gene fragments\nand analyzed directly. Since microbial genomes typically contain few intergenic\nsequences, most fragments will contain pieces of one or more genes; these can be\nused to quantify enzymatic or pathway abundances directly as described below\n[1], [58], [59], [60].\nAlternatively, metagenome-specific assembly algorithms have been proposed that\nreconstruct only the open reading frames from a population (its\nORFeome), recruiting highly sequence-similar\nfragments on an as-needed basis to complete single gene sequences and avoiding\nassembly of larger contigs [61], [62]. The most challenging option is to attempt full\nassemblies for complete genomes present in the community, which is rarely\npossible save in very simple communities or with extreme sequencing depth [53], [54]. When\nsuccessful, this has the obvious benefit of establishing synteny, structural\nvariation, and opening up the range of tools developed for whole-genome analysis\n[63],\nand guided assemblies using read mapping (rather than de novo\nassembly) can be used when appropriate reference genomes are available. However,\ncare must be taken in interpreting any such assemblies, since horizontal\ntransfer and community complexity prevent unambiguous assemblies in essentially\nall realistic cases [64]. A more feasible middle ground is emerging around\nmaximal assemblies that capture the largest unambiguous contigs in a community\n[65],\nallowing e.g. local operon structure to be studied without introducing\nartificial homogeneity into the data. In any of these cases - direct analysis of\nreads, ORF assembly, maximal unambiguous scaffolds, or whole genomes -\nsubsequent analyses typically focus on the functional aspects of the resulting\ngenes and pathways as detailed below.",

An illustrative example\nis the task of determining which parts of each sequence read (or\nORF/contig/etc.) encode one or more genes, i.e. gene finding or calling. By\nhomology, each sequence can be BLASTed [66] against a large database\nof reference genomes, which will retrieve any similar known reading frames; the\nboundaries of these regions of similarity thus become the start and stop of the\nmetagenomic open reading frames. This method is robust to sequencing and\nassembly errors, but it is sensitive to the contents of the reference database.\nConversely, de novo methods have been developed to directly bin\n[67],\n[68],\n[69] and\ncall genes within [61], [62] metagenomic sequences using DNA features alone (GC\ncontent, codon usage, etc.). As with genome analysis for newly sequenced single\norganisms, most de novo methods rely on interpolated [70] or\nprofile [71]\nHidden Markov Models (HMMs) or on other machine learners that perform\nclassification based on encoded sequence features [72], [73]. This is a far more\nchallenging task, making it sensitive to errors in the computational prediction\nprocess, but it enables a greater range of discovery and community\ncharacterization efforts by relying less on prior knowledge. Hybrid methods for\ne.g. taxonomic binning [69] have recently been developed that consume both\nsequence similarity and de novo sequence features as input, and\nfor some tasks such systems might represent a sweet spot between computational\ncomplexity, availability of prior knowledge, and biological accuracy.

This\nrequires an appropriate catalog of reference pathways such as KEGG [84], MetaCyc\n[91], or GO\n[83],\nalthough it should be noted that none of these is currently optimized for modeling\ncommunities rather than single organisms in monoculture [90]. The pathway inference process\nis similar to that performed when annotating an individual newly sequenced genome\n[92] and\nconsists of three main steps: A) assigning each ortholog to one or more pathways, B)\ngap filling or interpolation of\nmissing annotations, and C) determining the presence and/or abundance of each\npathway. The first ortholog assignment step is necessary since many gene families\nparticipate in multiple pathways; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, for example, is\nused in the TCA cycle, glycolysis, and in various intercellular signaling mechanisms\n[93]. The\nabundance mass for each enzyme is distributed across its functions in one or more\npossible pathways; methods for doing this range from the simple assumption that it\nis equally active in all reference pathways (as currently done by KAAS [94] or MG-RAST\n[76]) to the\nelimination of unlikely pathways and the redistribution of associated mass in a\nmaximum parsimony fashion [95]. Second, once all observed orthologs have been assigned\nto pathways (when possible), gaps or holes in the reference\npathways can be filled, using the assumption that the enzymes necessary to operate a\nnearly complete pathway should be present somewhere in the community. Essentially\nthree methods have been successfully employed for gap filling: searching for\nalternative pathway fragments to explain the discrepancy [96], [97], purely mathematical\nsmoothing to replace the missing enzymes' abundances with numerically plausible\nvalues [81], and targeted searches of the metagenome of interest for\nmore distant homologues with which to fill the hole [98]. Since we are currently able to\ninfer function for only a fraction of the genes in any given complete genome, let\nalone metagenome, any of these approaches should be deemed hypothetical at best;\nnevertheless, like any missing value imputation process, they can provide\nnumerically stable guesses that are substantially better than random [99]. Finally, as\ndescribed above for taxa, the resulting data can be used to summarize each reference\npathway either qualitatively (i.e. with what likelihood is it present in the\ncommunity?) or quantitatively (how abundant is it in the community?), and in its\nsimplest form condenses the abundance matrix of orthologous families into an\nabundance (or presence/absence) matrix of pathways. Either the ortholog or pathway\nmatrices can then be tested for differentially abundant features representing\ndiagnostic biomarkers with potential explanatory power for the phenotype of\ninterest, using statistical methods developed for identical tests in expression\nbiomarker discovery [100] and genome-wide association studies [101].",

Our trillions of microbial passengers account for a\nproportion of our metabolism and signaling as least as great as that performed by\nmore integral body parts, and after a century of molecular biology, we have only\nbegun to realize their importance within the last few years. To close with a success\nstory, the popular press [161] recently reported on the full recovery of a patient\nsuffering from Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which had\nled her to lose over 60 pounds in less than a year. C. difficile is\noften refractory to antibiotics, with spores able to repopulate from very low\nlevels, and the patient's normal microbiota had been decimated by the infection\nand subsequent treatment. Finally, she received a simple fecal transplant from her\nhusband, in which the host microbiome was replaced with that of a donor. Within\ndays, not only had she begun a complete recovery, but a metagenomic survey of her\nmicrobiota showed that the new community was almost completely established and had\nrestored normal taxonomic abundances [162]. While this is an extreme\ncase, similar treatments have shown a success rate of some 90% historically\n[163], all of\nwhich occurred before modern genomic techniques allowed us to more closely examine\nthe microbiota. Imagine performing any other organ transplant with such a high rate\nof success - while blindfolded! Like so many other discoveries of the genomic era,\nthe study of the human microbiome has begun with amazing achievements, and it will\nrequire continued experimental and bioinformatic efforts to better understand the\nbiology of these microbial communities and to see it translated into clinical\npractice.",
