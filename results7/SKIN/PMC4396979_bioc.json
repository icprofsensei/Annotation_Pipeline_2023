Contrary to traditional isolation methods, which are prone to biases inherent in the varying abilities of bacteria to grow in culture, sequencing allows direct examination of the DNA content in a sample. Based on these DNA readings, we are thus able to infer the bacteria contained within. This molecular method is very sensitive and is able to provide a more complete picture of all the microbes living in a certain environment, what is termed the microbiome. Recently there has been increased interest in sinonasal microbiome research, and how changes in the microbiome could relate to sinus conditions such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Recent findings point towards reduced microbial diversity in CRS patients, when compared with healthy controls.[1,2] To the best of our knowledge, almost all 16S rRNA sinonasal microbiome studies to date have relied upon sampling via swabs[3\u20135] or via sinus lavage[2,6], with no studies examining the microbiome of mucosal biopsies. Recent parallel research does suggest that bacteria existing within the sinus mucosa itself,[7,8] or adherent to the mucosa in the form of a bacterial biofilm, is associated with the disease state of CRS. [9] Numerous studies have demonstrated biofilms to be associated with an inflammatory response in the underlying mucosa,[10\u201313] and clinical studies suggested that these bacterial forms may predispose to more severe sinus disease and worse post-operative outcomes.[14,15] Traditionally, particular bacterial species like Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been associated with these worse outcomes.[16\u201319]",

Sequences were trimmed of barcodes and primers and sequence quality control was performed using QIIME's default script settings (sequence length 200\u20131000 nucleotides; minimum average qualilty score 25; maximum length of homopolymer runs 6; maximum number of ambiguous bases 6). Sequences were then denoised using QIIME's built-in denoiser, set on the Titanium profile.[22] Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered (open-reference OTU \u201cpicking\u201d against the August 2013 reference Greengenes 16S rRNA database[23]) at 97% similarity using uclust,[24] and then singleton sequences were removed. Taxonomic assignment of OTUs was then performed using BLAST[25] against the Greengenes 16S rRNA database.[23] After examining read counts, rarefactions of the OTU table were performed to a chosen maximum subsampling depth of 1100 sequences and rarefaction curves were plotted. Summary of taxonomic assignments were plotted as bar charts using QIIME. Observed species richness, as well as phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic alpha diversity metrics (Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity index \u201cPD_Whole_Tree\u201d and Shannon's index, respectively) were recorded and compared at the 1100 rarefaction depth. Phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic beta diversity matrices (Weighted/Unweighted UniFrac, and Bray-Curtis, respectively) were calculated. Three-dimensional Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) plots were generated using EMPeror software[26] bundled with QIIME. Using the principal coordinates of the PCoA plots, a Procrustes transformation was performed (over the first three principal components) of the swab samples against those of the tissue samples. This was done using the QIIME script transform_coordinate_matrices.py. Using this script, an m\n2\nvalue is calculated, and Monte-Carlo simulations (1000 permutations) were done to calculate a p-value.",

Beta diversity distances within-group were compared to between-group non-parametrically using a 999-permutations t-test. Testing for the presence of a significant effect of sample type on beta diversity metrics was also done using permutational multivariate analysis of variance[29] (PERMANOVA), through the function \u201cadonis\u201d present in the vegan R package.[30] To accommodate the paired design, the adonis function was employed using the strata parameter; this allowed the permutations to be done only within the patient variable, not across. We then investigated statistically significant differential relative abundance (MRA) of any bacterial species (of more than 1%) between the two groups using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Correlation between the taxonomic assignment summaries of the two groups (Pearson's Correlation coefficient) was calculated non-parametrically using a two-sided 999 permutations test, using the QIIME script compare_taxa_summaries.py.

However, this difference in richness and diversity did not reach statistical significance between the two groups. The plots in Fig 2A show that rarefaction curves have plateaued and reached asymptote. This indicates good sampling at the chosen cutoff depth of 1100 reads, and that a higher depth of sequencing is unlikely to discover more unique species (and increased diversity) for the sampled environment. We then explored whether the type of sample would have an effect on beta diversity metrics (Bray-Curtis and Weighted and unweighted UniFrac), and this showed no significant effect of sample type on beta diversity. (Fig 3) PCoA plots suggested a better clustering of samples by patient, rather than the type of sample.

First, these measures include both non-phylogenetic metrics (Shannon\u2019s for alpha diversity and Bray-Curtis for beta diversity) as well as phylogenetic metrics (Faith\u2019s PD_Whole_Tree for alpha diversity and UniFrac for beta diversity). Phylogenetic metrics include information about the evolutionary distance between taxa, since they account for the structure of the phylogenetic tree. Non-phylogenetic metrics do not account for this information and only depend on taxa abundance (or prevalence) and evenness. Second, we have also included metrics that account for the relative abundance of taxa (Bray-Curtis, Weighted UniFrac), contrary to using only metrics such as Jaccard\u2019s or unweighted UniFrac that depend on absence/presence (i.e. prevalence) of taxa, without accounting for their relative abundance. In this way, we could demonstrate that both methods of sampling (tissue and swab) are not only similar in regards to absence/presence of taxa, but also in regards to their relative abundance within each sample. Despite mucosal tissue samples having higher richness and within-community (\u03b1) diversity, we could not demonstrate that this was significantly higher than swab samples.",

Nevertheless, we believe positive results of all analysis types in the current study, which includes other metrics (alpha diversity metrics, beta diversity distances, PCoA plots, Pearson\u2019s correlation), supports a general conclusion of tissue and swab similarity. This raises the question of power in the realm of microbiota comparison studies, which is a subject of ongoing research.[31,32] Moreover, what is the clinically-significant \u201ceffect size\u201d calculated out of the commonly used diversity measures, and that would correlate with sinus health and/or disease? These questions need to be better defined for future research. Future studies confirming the findings of our study may benefit from including a larger cohort. Another caveat with our current study design is the possibility that taking the swab samples (first) somehow perturbed the surface microbiome of the tissue, which was biopsied from the same site after swabbing (middle meatus/anterior ethmoid region). Although this limitation seems unavoidable with the current study design, we believe this issue would not cause a significant change to the tissue specimens, since the tissue biopsied is typically larger than the surface area covered by the swab head, and thus is not limited only to the thin strip touched by the swab.",

This may suggest either a less than perfect ability of swab samples to accurately characterize the rare biosphere, or is an artefact of the OTU clustering. This is an additional reason to confirm the findings of this experiment on the Illumina platform in the future. Some sinonasal microbiome studies also used lavage sampling.[2,6] Unfortunately, this type of sampling was not investigated in our study.",

Interestingly, out of the 312 bacterial genera assigned in our study, only 10 (about 3%) had a mean relative abundance of more than 1% (Table 1). This suggests the presence of a \u201crare biosphere\u201d in the sinuses. This rare biosphere may constitute then about 97% of all species present in the sinuses. However the role played by these rare taxa, and whether they contribute significantly to sinus health or disease, is still unknown; although other studies suggested they have great functional importance at other sites such as the gut and oral microbiota.[37,38] With this said, the small sample size and lack of a healthy control group makes it difficult to draw further conclusions on the sinus microbiome in CRS patients.",

Future studies confirming these findings should explore: investigating sinus lavage samples, including a higher number of individuals, and using sequencing platforms that allow ultra-high depths of sequencing.",
